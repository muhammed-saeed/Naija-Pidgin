Round-up on Oil wells, Baguettes, Atheists, Tree Rings, Wine, Fat, Doctors on Obamacare and the Eye in the Sky

 Each new North Dakota oil well is equivalent to a new $8-10 million business, and they’ve got thousands 

The economic impact of the increased oil production in North Dakota over the last year is the equivalent to more than 1,000 new $8-10 million small businesses being created in the state, which have created 7,000 new direct jobs in the oil business over the last year, and more than 26,000 new jobs in total throughout the state.

 Atheists have the lowest retention rate of any &quot;religious&quot; group 

According to a new survey  by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, Black Women are more religious than any other group 
 when respondents were asked how much of a role God or faith plays when they are trying to get through tough times in life – 86 percent of black women said it was very important, compared to 66 percent of white women, 79 percent of black men, and only 51 percent of white men, who turned out to be the least religious group among the respondents to the poll.

 Tree-rings prove climate was WARMER in Roman and Medieval times than it is now - and world has been cooling for 2,000 years 
 Measurements stretching back to 138BC prove that the Earth is slowly cooling due to changes in the distance between the Earth and the sun.The finding may force scientists to rethink current theories of the impact of global warming.It is the first time that researchers have been able to accurately measure trends in global temperature over the last two millennia. …  Over that time, the world has been getting cooler - and previous estimates, used as the basis for current climate science, are wrong. Their findings demonstrate that this trend involves a cooling of -0.3°C per millennium due to gradual changes to the position of the sun and an increase in the distance between the Earth and the sun. …The finding was based on semi-fossilised tree rings found in Finnish lapland.

Keep 32

In a couple of  years, you&apos;ll be looking for Keep 32 in the toothpaste and mouthwash you buy.

 New chemical makes teeth &apos;cavity proof&apos; - and could do away with dentist visits forever 
 A new chemical could make human teeth &apos;cavity proof&apos; - and do away with the need for visits to the dentists forever.  The molecule has been called &apos;Keep 32&apos; - after the 32 teeth in a human mouth.

 The chemical was designed by dentists in Chile, and wipes out all the bacteria that cause cavities in just 60 seconds in tests .  The chemical could be added to any current dental care product, turning toothpaste, mouthwash and chewing gum into &apos;super cleansers&apos; that could get rid of the underlying cause of tooth decay.
 
The chemical targets &apos;streptococcus mutans&apos;, the bacteria that turns the sugar in your mouth into lactic acid which erodes tooth enamel.  By exterminating the bacteria, &apos;Keep 32&apos; prevents the damage to teeth before it happens.  Using a product containing the chemical keeps your teeth &apos;cavity proof&apos; for several hours.

The product has been under test for seven years, and is now going into human trials.  It could be on the market in 14 to 18 months, say researchers José Córdoba from Yale University and Erich Astudillo from the University of Chile. Posted by Jill Fallon at 8:32 AM | Permalink

Coffee reduces risk of Alzheimer&apos;s disease

I know a lot of people who stopped drinking coffee because they thought caffeine was bad for them.    Yet there&apos;s no evidence that that is the case.

In fact the evidence shows that moderate coffee drinking and caffeine intake seems to be a preventative against of many diseases of aging.  The New England Journal of Medicine published earlier this year a study showing coffee drinkers reduced their risk of Parkinson&apos;s, stroke, type II diabetes, heart disease, lung disease and breast cancer..

Now there&apos;s a new study from the University of South Florida that coffee intake is associated with a reduced risk of dementia or late onset.

 Coffee Cuts Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Risk
 
The reason seems to be that coffee and some other component of coffee act to boost cytokines in a way we still don&apos;t understand.

&quot;The amulet to ward off overly aggressive care&quot;

 Discovered: The Magic Word 
 The word “hospice” usually evokes a shift, a pivot from trying to cure to providing comfort and support at the end of life. Hospice workers help people through the final weeks and months of terminal illness, easing dying people’s pain and fear, bolstering their exhausted families.

But in one case I heard about recently, the word served a different function: It became a kind of magic shield. Simply saying it could protect against unwanted medical treatments for a vulnerable old woman who possibly wasn’t dying at all.

Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician and palliative care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who told me the story, described this use of hospice as “an amulet to ward off overly aggressive care.” He put that potent word to use a few weeks ago; the woman in question was his mother.
--
Once he wielded the amulet, “the change was fairly instantaneous.” And well-timed: The next day, as his mother awaited discharge, nurses noticed flecks of blood when she vomited, which sometimes signals internal bleeding. The normal procedure would have involved a naso-gastric tube (something Dr. Lee had tried on himself as a medical student and found intensely uncomfortable), then sedation and insertion of a second tube through her esophagus, into her small intestine. “But they didn’t do it,” Dr. Lee explained, with relief, “because she was under the care of a hospice.”
--
The way to ensure the most personalized, least invasive care for Mrs. Lee was to say, in effect, “We’re taking her home to die.”

CAD10, the Vaccine for Alzheimer&apos;s

Hurrah! Groundbreaking Alzheimer&apos;s vaccine could cut cases by half and be first step towards finding cure 
 A groundbreaking vaccine that could cut cases of Alzheimer&apos;s disease by half has been discovered.  The jab developed by scientists in Sweden could delay the onset of the debilitating illness and be the first step towards finding a cure.

Alzheimer&apos;s is the most common form of dementia and attacks nerves, brain cells and neurotransmitters that carry messages to and from the brain. The vaccine, known as CAD10, helps patients create protective antibodies to defend against deposits that develop in the brain of sufferers.

Researchers from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and from the Swedish Brain Power Network claimed in the Lancet Neurology journal that their discovery could help people with mild to moderate versions of Alzheimer&apos;s.  They found no serious side effects during the tests, which took place over three years on people aged between 50 and 80.

One in 14 people over 65 years old is affected by the disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Society.  The risks increase with age, with around one in six people over 80 years old developing the condition.  Scientists hope CAD106 can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease by five years.

Nicotinamide riboside, the hidden vitamin found in beer and milk

As a beer and milk drinker, I like this study.

 The miracle molecule: Hidden vitamin found in BEER and MILK can make you stronger, slimmer and healthier
 
 Beer may contain a vitamin which can fight obesity and improve muscle strength, scientists claim. The ‘miracle molecule’, which has been found in milk and may also be present in beer and some foods, has no side effects and could even lengthen lifespan, they say.
--
The snag is that the molecule, called nicotinamide riboside (NR ), is extremely small, difficult to find and expensive to synthesize.

Johnan Auwerx, head of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale in Lausanne, Switzerland, said experiments using mice revealed the molecule’s potential.  In an article in the specialist journal Cell Metabolism journal, Mr Auwerx called the results &apos;impressive&apos;  &apos;NR appears to play a role in preventing obesity,&apos; said Mr Auwerx.

Working with Weill Cornell  Medical College in New York, his team found mice on a high-fat diet that were fed NR gained significantly less weight – 60 per cent – than mice eating the same diet without NR supplements.  Mice which were fed NR supplements over a ten-week period had better endurance performance than those who were not.  They were also in better shape – and this was confirmed by observations of their muscle fibres under the microscope.  The molecule works by becoming trapped in cells where it boosts the metabolism, much like resveratrol, which is found in wine. No side effects were discovered during the experiments. &apos;It really appears that cells use what they need when they need it, and the rest is set aside without being transformed into any kind of deleterious form,&apos; said study author Carles Canto in a statement.

Maybe your &apos;spare tire&apos; is good for something after all

 Why that spare tyre could be GOOD for your health: Hard-to-shift fat helps to regulate your immune system
 
 Dieters desperate to get rid of that spare tyre can finally let it all hang out.  That muffin-top could actually help to regulate the immune system and provide a first line of defense against infection and viruses.

A hard-to-shift beer belly could even help regenerate damaged tissue after an injury.

The fatty membrane in the belly, called the momentum, has never seemed to serve much of a purpose.

But now the research by scientists in Chicago has shown it can be a health benefit - and their discovery could lead to the development of new drugs for organ transplant patients with auto-immune diseases such as Lupus and Crohn’s disease.

The momentum lines the abdominal cavity, covering most abdominal organs, and is where fat tissue is stored.

The research team found that cells from this membrane can differentiate into lung-type cells and bone cells.

They now believe the momentum may be assist tissue healing and regeneration.

&apos;We now have evidence that the momentum is not just fat sitting in the belly,&apos; said Dr Makio Iwashima, from the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.

The team also found that the cells can suppress the immune system&apos;s response to an infectious agent. Posted by Jill Fallon at 2:14 PM | Permalink

Potatoes a &apos;Wonder Food&apos;

 

&apos; The ultimate wonder food&apos;: Potatoes have more nutrients, vitamins and minerals than traditional &apos;superfoods&apos; 
 Ignored by dieters because they are &apos;fattening&apos;, few would class the potato as a &apos;wonder food&apos; packed full of vitamins, minerals and nutrients.

But the spud is actually better for the body than traditional super foods - such as bananas, broccoli, beetroot, nuts and avocado, a study has found.

The researchers said people are wrong to shun it in favor of modern and more expensive alternatives.

A jacket potato has five-and-a-half times as much fibre as the average banana - and is packed with more vitamin C than is found in three avocados, the Daily Express reported.

Last year a separate study discovered that eating spuds twice a day can lower blood pressure - and contrary to popular perceptions it won&apos;t make you put on weight.

The new research also found that the potato contains more of the mineral selenium than the average child gets from all the seeds and nuts they consume.

The study was completed by the independent nutritionist Sigrid Gibson on behalf of the Potato Council.

The researchers analyzed the food intake of 876 children and 948 adults for the study.

Sigrid Gibson added: &apos; We think of bananas as being a good source of potassium, and they are, but potatoes make a more significant contribution to the diet.&apos; Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:46 AM | Permalink

Depression and purpose, strawberries and blueberries

If you&apos;re depressed, don&apos;t delay getting treatment;

A Kaiser Permanente analysis shows Subjects Who Were Depressed in Middle Age Had an Elevated Risk of Dementia 
 The findings, published in the May issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, add to the evidence that late-in-life depression is a likely early sign of Alzheimer&apos;s disease and suggest that chronic depression appears to increase the risk of developing vascular dementia. Adequate treatment for depression in midlife could cut the risk of developing dementia.
--
To look at links between depression and dementia, Dr. Whitmer and other researchers looked at 13,535 long-term Kaiser Permanente members who had enrolled in a larger study in the period from 1964 to 1973 at ages ranging from 40 to 55 years old. Health information, including a survey that asked about depression, was collected at the time. 
Eat plenty of strawberries and blueberries.

 Strawberries and blueberries could delay cognitive decline among the elderly (over 65) by up to two and half years.  Researchers from the Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital and Harvard Medical School says its all in the flavonoids which are extremely powerful anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory substances.

And find new purpose in life.

P urpose in Life May Protect Against Harmful Changes in the Brain Associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. Researchers at the Rush University Medical Center  explain
 “Our study showed that people who reported greater purpose in life exhibited better cognition than those with less purpose in life even as plaques and tangles accumulated in their brains,” said Patricia A. Boyle, PhD.

“These findings suggest that purpose in life protects against the harmful effects of plaques and tangles on memory and other thinking abilities. This is encouraging and suggests that engaging in meaningful and purposeful activities promotes cognitive health in old age.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:19 AM | Permalink

‘Nobody has ever grown a nose before.’

 Making organ donation a thing of the past - the British lab growing human spare parts
 
 &apos;This is a nose we’re growing for a patient next month,’ Professor Alexander Seifalian says matter-of-factly, plucking a Petri dish from the bench beside him.  Inside is an utterly lifelike appendage, swimming in red goo. Alongside it is another dish containing an ear.

‘It’s a world first,’ he says smiling.

 

Seifalian leads University College London’s (UCL) Department of Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, which he jokingly calls the ‘human body parts store’. Seifalian and his team are focusing on growing replacement organs and body parts to order using a patient&apos;s own cells

As he takes me on a tour of his lab I’m bombarded with one medical breakthrough after another. At one desk he picks up a glass mould that shaped the trachea – windpipe – used in the world’s first synthetic organ transplant.  At another are the ingredients for the revolutionary nano material at the heart of his creations, and just beyond that is a large machine with a pale, gossamer-thin cable inside that’s pulsing with what looks like a heartbeat. It’s an artery.

‘We are the first in the world working on this,’ Seifalian says casually.

‘Other groups have tried to tackle nose replacement with implants but we’ve found they don’t last,’ says Adelola Oseni, one of Seifalian’s team. ‘They migrate, the shape of the nose changes. But our one will hold itself completely, as it’s an entire nose shape made out of polymer.’

Looking like very thin Latex rubber, the polymer is made up of billions of molecules, each measuring just over one nanometre (a billionth of a metro), or 40,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Working at molecular level allows the material itself to be intricately detailed.

‘Inside this nano material are thousands of small holes,’ says Seifalian. ‘Tissue grows into these and becomes part of it. It becomes the same as a nose and will even feel like one.’

When the nose is transferred to the patient, it doesn’t go directly onto the face but will be placed inside a balloon inserted beneath the skin on their arm.  After four weeks, during which time skin and blood vessels can grow, the nose can be monitored, then it can be transplanted to the face. 
At the Mayo Clinic, similar exciting work is going on as they as also Growing Your Own Organs , in this case, heart tissue.

Are you taking enough Vitamin D?

As more evidence piles up, Vitamin D is truly a miracle vitamin
 
Vitamin D supplements &apos;could cut blood pressure as effectively as some drugs&apos; 
 Taking vitamin D supplements could cut blood pressure by as much as some drugs, claim researchers .

A new study shows supplements lowered blood pressure in patients diagnosed with hypertension - high blood pressure - compared with those taking ‘dummy’ pills.

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with high blood pressure, but until now there has been little scientific evidence that topping up levels of the vitamin in the blood makes a difference.
--
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.

Study leader Dr Thomas Larsen said ‘Probably the majority of Europeans have vitamin D deficiency, and many of these will also have high blood pressure.

‘What our results suggest is that hypertensive patients can benefit from vitamin D supplementation if they have vitamin D insufficiency.

Check: A high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimeters of mercury

‘Vitamin D would not be a cure for hypertension in these patients, but it may help, especially in the winter months. Posted by Jill Fallon at 11:43 PM | Permalink

Before you leave the hospital, do these five things

A physician writes Before You Ditch The Hospital, Don&apos;t Forget To Do These 5 Things 
 The day we get to go home from the hospital after a surgery or sickness …[is] a major step from illness to recovery, but it is also a potential disaster for the ill-prepared.
---
Hospital stays are getting shorter every year and discharge doesn&apos;t occur when you are healed, but instead at a point where you can go to a less expensive location to recover. Most commonly, that place is your home. The only guaranteed aspect of your transition home is that it will not go as planned. You will be bombarded with more information than you can keep straight.
--
1. MEDICATIONS : It seems obvious, but this is the greatest source of confusion. …. You need to have your nurse or doctor carefully go over your old and new list [of medications] to make sure everyone is on the same page. Another tip: Only use one pharmacy, so that the pharmacist will have a record of all your medicines and can identify any potential problems. Have the hospital or pharmacy fax your final list of medications to your primary doctor. So often the doctor who takes care of you in the hospital is not the doctor who will follow you once you go home.

2. RED FLAGS: …Don&apos;t settle for the computer-generated form that the hospital hands out to patients. Ask your doctor for your specific condition&apos;s red flags. How much pain is too much pain? How long will it continue to hurt when you urinate? How much longer will I be coughing? Is there anything special that should make me run to the hospital, rather than call my doctor?

3. WHO TO CALL : Get the specific phone numbers of who to call if there is a problem. My wife had surgery on a Friday, so I asked the doctor for the name of who would be on call that weekend, and if he would let them know that we were out there. Make sure that someone at the hospital you are leaving lets your primary care doctor know that you are loose on the street. I always give patients a copy of their entire lab and x-ray reports to carry back to their main doctor. If they get into trouble before a scheduled appointment, then they have the critical information with them.

4. FOLLOW-UP: One of the main causes of readmission to the hospital is that the patient has not had appropriate follow-up after they leave the hospital. You may be told to see your regular doctor in 10 days, but when you call, they cannot see you for six weeks. Have the nurse or case manager at the hospital you are leaving call and make the appointment. Insist on it.

5. START A NOTEBOOK : . As a rule, when you come home from the hospital you have bundles of papers, some important and others destined for the recycling bin. Stick the important ones in a notebook or folder….. Take your notebook with you to each doctor&apos;s visit so you have a list of your medicines, doctor&apos;s names, laboratory results, and instructions all in one place.

 If you cannot get all of these questions answered yourself, then assign one family member to be in charge of the process. It is our -- your healthcare providers&apos; -- responsibility to make sure you get the information, but ultimately, it is going to be your responsibility to remember everything, and make sure you have all of your facts straight. Whether you believe it is fair or not, no one is going to organize all this for you -- it is your responsibility, and in your best interests, to get it together.

Breast cancer is effectively ten different diseases

 Landmark British study that could revolutionize breast cancer treatment: It turns out it&apos;s actually TEN different diseases 
 Breast cancer is effectively ten different diseases, according to breakthrough research that could revolutionize treatment.

The biggest study of its kind in the world has classified the country’s most common cancer into ten separate types.

The finding brings doctors closer to the holy grail of tailoring treatments to individual women. The rewriting of the rule book on breast cancer could also lead to new drugs and better diagnostic tests.

Dr Julia Wilson, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘This is incredibly exciting research which has the potential to change the face of breast cancer; from how we diagnose and treat it, to how we follow it up afterwards.’

However, the need for more research means it will be three to five years before women with breast cancer can start widely reaping the benefits of the shake-up in treatment.
--
The painstaking analysis of the genetics of 2,000 tumors, including many from women in London, Cambridge and Nottingham, has revealed there to be ten sub-types of the disease. Each tumor within a particular group shares similar genes and different women with the same type have similar odds of survival.

The ‘exquisitely detailed’ analysis also revealed several new genes that drive the growth and spread of the disease. This opens the door for the development of drugs that counter their effects. Knowledge of the genetics of each type of the disease will also speed the development of drugs, allowing women to have treatments tailored to their tumor. A handful of such ‘wonder-drugs’, including Herceptin, are already in use. Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:07 PM | Permalink

&apos;Paradigm shift&apos; in treating prostate cancer

 New treatment for prostate cancer gives &apos;perfect results&apos; for nine in ten men: research 
 A new treatment for prostate cancer can rid the disease from nine in ten men without debilitating side effects, a study has found, leading to new hope for tens of thousands of men.

It is hoped t he new treatment, which involves heating only the tumors with a highly focused ultrasound, will mean men can be treated without an overnight stay in hospital and avoiding the distressing side effects associated with current therapies.
 
 A study has found that focal HIFU, high-intensity focused ultrasound, provides the &apos;perfect&apos; outcome of no major side effects and free of cancer 12 months after treatment, in nine out of ten cases.
 
Traditional surgery or radiotherapy can only provide the perfect outcome in half of cases currently.

Experts have said the results are &apos;very encouraging&apos; and were a &apos;paradigm&apos; shift in treatment of the disease. Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:03 AM | Permalink

Aspirin for Cancer?

 How aspirin might inhibit the spread of cancer 
 Aspirin and other household drugs may inhibit the spread of cancer because they help shut down the chemical &quot;highways&quot; which feed tumours, Australian researchers announced on Tuesday.

Scientists at Melbourne&apos;s Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre said they have made a biological breakthrough helping explain how lymphatic vessels -- key to the transmission of tumours throughout the body -- respond to cancer.

&quot;We&apos;ve shown that molecules like the aspirin... could effectively work by reducing the dilation of these major vessels and thereby reducing the capacity of tumours to spread to distant sites,&quot; researcher Steven Stacker said. Posted by Jill Fallon at 6:25 PM | Permalink

Recovery Kitty

Anorexia is a terrible disease and one very hard to overcome.  So attention must be paid to this method that worked for one woman.

 &quot;Feeding up a bony stray cat saved me from anorexia&apos;: Woman who weighed the same as a 12-year-old reveals how she beat her eating disorder. 
 Aged 20, Ashley Ransley was severely anorexic, and despite her 6ft frame she weighed the same as a 12-year-old.

Doctors warned her she could have a heart attack at any moment as her body gradually shut down, and following years of failed treatments she resigned herself to a slow suicide.

But now the student from Fenton, Michigan, tips the scales at a healthy 1 1st albs and claims the experience of feeding up a malnourished cat helped her to overcome her long-term eating disorder.

Ashley, now 25, weighed just 7st 10lbs when she rescued the stray feline that had wandered onto her family’s property.

At first she thought it was a kitten because of it was so small, but vets later confirmed it was a fully grown female and extremely malnourished, weighing just three pounds.

While she helped the little animal, which she named Riley, regain weight, Ashley found she was also able to heal herself of the mental illness that had blighted her since school. 
 
 She said : &apos;As I worked on rehabilitating her to a healthy weight, I was focusing less and less on my eating disorder. 

I began to eat when she ate, share some of my food with her, and if I got anxious and wanted to purge or over-exercise, I would use her as a distraction.

&apos;Both malnourished and slowly regaining our health, our connection grew to more than just pet-owner attachment.

&apos;I didn’t really want to die, and I was getting better. I called her my recovery kitty.&apos; Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:19 PM | Permalink

The &quot;Digital-Age Leonardo da Vinci&quot;

Astonishing visualization from Alexander Tsiaras at TED, Conception to Birth

Here is his profile 
 



 

Another beautiful image of the heart glowing in an open chest cavity at JAMA, Art from the Heart 

 

 His mission : &quot;We want to change how people think about health, think about their bodies. The way to do that is by telling stories--beautiful, compelling, visual stories that show what an amazing thing the body is.&quot;

His company is Anatomical Travelogue is &quot;a pioneer in illustrating the intricate details of the human body in images that are at once high-tech, anatomically faithful and artistically striking—the ultimate &quot;insider art,&quot; he jokes.&quot;

From a feature article at Business Innovation Factory
 
 Tsiaras isn&apos;t a doctor; he&apos;s a photographer, technologist and visionary with an expert knowledge of anatomy and a passion for the human form . The books he has produced—including From Conception to Birth: A Life Unfolds, The Architecture and Design of Man and Woman: The Marvel of the Human Body, Revealed, The InVision Guide to a Healthy Heart and The InVision Guide to Sexual Health — have spawned educational videos and exhibits at the National Museum of Health and Medicine.

 The images are &apos;visualizations&apos; that Tsiaras and his team create using full-body scans, ultra-powerful microscopes and molecular modeling tools that allow him to illustrate the body in vivid detail, for both 3-D pictures and animations. He has described his work as &quot;&apos;Fantastic Voyage&apos; meets the TIME-LIFE book series.&quot;

Some see Tsiaras as a digital-age Leonardo da Vinci, whos e anatomical renderings set the standard for centuries. But Tsiaras describes himself in more prosaic terms.

How often should you get dental x-rays

If you are used to getting a dental x-ray every year at your annual dental exam, you may want to reconsider.    Maybe every other year or every third year is enough.

 Study links dental X-rays and risk of benign brain tumor - frequency pivotal
 Frequent dental X-rays are associated with an increased risk of developing the most common, noncancerous brain tumors, according to a new study, a finding that researchers say should serve as a reminder that even dental X-rays may be harmful if ordered too often.

Far from suggesting that people should skip dental X-rays, the researchers said that the new information should become part of the conversation people have with their dentists, especially since the American Dental Association’s guidelines suggest that healthy patients without cavities and free of risk factors should get bitewing X-rays once every one to three years, depending on their age.

“A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it,”

The over-prescription of antibiotics to both humans and animals may well spell the end of modern medicine that we expect and feel entitled to.

 Life won&apos;t be the same without antibiotics 
 The antibiotics used to treat even minor wounds when they become infected – as well as far more serious conditions – are rapidly losing their effectiveness, in the face of ever more resistant germs. There’s also a lack of new ones to take their place. We face the horrifying prospect of returning to the dark medical age before the discovery of penicillin, thanks both to the over-prescribing of antibiotics by doctors and – as a new report makes clear – by their virtually indiscriminate use in factory farms.

Typical journalistic scaremongering? No, but don’t take it from me. Here’s Dr Margaret Chan, who as head of the constitutionally cautious World Health Organisation (WHO) is humanity’s premier guardian of public health, speaking recently at a Danish Government conference.

 “A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it,” she warned. “Things as common as a strep throat or a child’s scratched knee could once again kill. Some sophisticated interventions, like hip replacements, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy and care of pre-term infants, would become far more difficult or even too dangerous to undertake.”

 Dr Chan described how the world is “losing” its present antibiotics, while “the pipeline is virtually dry” for new one s. Drug companies are not bothering to research or develop replacements, partly because they make much more money out of treatments for conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure – which are taken for life, rather than in short courses – and partly because they fear they will not recoup their investment before bacteria develop resistance and render the new drugs useless.

Already 25,000 Europeans die every year from antibiotic-resistant infections, while worldwide there are some 650,000 annual cases of multi-drug-resistant TB, half of which can’t be cured even with the best care. “Many common and life-threatening infections,” warns the WHO, “are becoming difficult or even impossible to treat.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:35 PM | Permalink 
Writing off the old

In the much touted national health service of Great Britain, life-saving treatment is denied to the elderly.    Even palliative surgery!

 Sentenced to death for being old: The NHS denies life-saving treatment to the elderly, as one man&apos;s chilling story reveals
 
 When Kenneth Warden was diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer, his hospital consultant sent him home to die, ruling that at 78 he was too old to treat.

Even the palliative surgery or chemotherapy that could have eased his distressing symptoms were declared off-limits because of his age.

His distraught daughter Michele Halligan accepted the sad prognosis but was determined her father would spend his last months in comfort. So she paid for him to seen privately by a second doctor to discover what could be done to ease his symptoms.

Thanks to her tenacity, Kenneth got the drugs and surgery he needed — and as a result his cancer was actually cured. Four years on, he is a sprightly 82-year-old who works out at the gym, drives a sports car and competes in a rowing team.

‘You could call his recovery amazing,’ says Michele, 51. ‘It is certainly a gift. But the fact is that he was written off because of his age. He was left to suffer so much, and so unnecessarily.’ Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:06 PM | Permalink

Popcorn, chocolate and toothpaste

Health news that will make you happy.

 Popcorn has &apos;more antioxidants that fruit and vegetables&apos; 
 Popcorn was found to have a high level of concentrated antioxidants because it is made up of just four percent water while they are more diluted in fruits and vegetables because they are made up of up to 90 percent water.... one serving of popcorn has up to 300mg of antioxidants - nearly double the 160mg for all fruits per serving..... the crunchy hulls of the popcorn have the highest concentration of antioxidants and fiber.
---
Researcher Joe Vinson said: &apos;Those hulls deserve more respect. They are nutritional gold nuggets.&apos;
 
 
 Eating lots of chocolate helps people stay thin 

The study found that people who frequently ate chocolate had a lower body mass index (BMI) than people who didn&apos;t. ...  published in the March 26 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine,

 Rubbing toothpaste on your toothpaste on your teeth &apos;quadruples protection against decay&apos;. Do this after lunch or when you are away from home.  This is in addition to morning  brushing and evening brushing and flossing. If you fail to brush properly twice a day, fatal heart problems may be in your future.
 
 Bacteria that loiter in the mouth can cause life-threatening blood clots which could trigger the rare condition infective endocarditis.  Researchers will describe how the streptococcus gordonii bug can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums at the Society for General Microbiology’s conference today. 
 Hope of fresh treatment for seven cancers after single antibody is found to shrink tumours from all of them 
 A drug that helps the immune system to break down cancerous tumors has been developed.

It has worked on breast, bowel, prostate, ovarian, brain, bladder and liver cancers, while previous studies show it can also be used to fight s ome blood cancers. 

The antibody has so far been tested only on mice, but researchers hope to give it to people within two years....the need for extensive proof that the drug is safe as  well as effective means that  its widespread use is about a decade away.

The Wonder Drug

Aspirin, of course.

 An Aspirin a day cuts cancer risk after just three years
 
 The cheap drug not only appears to stop cancers developing in the first place, but also prevents them from spreading to other parts of the body , the new work shows.

Those who start taking low dose (75mg) aspirin daily in their 60s appear to benefit just as much as those who start taking it earlier.

The studies, presented today in The Lancet, add to the argument that low-dose aspirin should be taken widely from middle-age, said the lead author, Professor Peter Rothwell, of Oxford University&apos;s Stroke Prevention Research Unit.
---
Prof Rothwell said the new research showed that aspirin had a far greater effect on reducing cancer than reducing heart attacks and strokes. Nine out of 10 deaths it prevented were &quot;non-vascular&quot;, according to one of the studies.
 
 Aspirin really deserves the name &apos;wonder drug&apos;. 
 The news that a daily dose of aspirin can reduce the risk of certain cancers and prevent cancer spreading is only the latest in a long series of discoveries showing the drug&apos;s extraordinary potential.

Aspirin is a real wonder drug: its usefulness (as willow-bark extract, for fever and pain) was known to the ancients; it seems to have myriad benefits; and yet its mechanisms remain mysterious. When it was first synthesised, as acetylsalicylic  acid, in the 1850s, it was used as to relieve the pains of &quot;rheumatism&quot;, but no one had any idea how it worked. 
It&apos;s still a mystery about how it works.

&quot;Creative, daring, life-giving healthcare for women and children&quot;

Timothy Cardinal Dolan on Protecting Health Care for Women and Children
 
 When it comes to the health of women, their babies, and their children, the Catholic Church is there, the most effective private provider of such care anywhere around.
--
I could go on and on: if you want to see creative, daring, lifegiving healthcare for women and their children, look at what the Church is doing. 
--
We’re on the offensive when it comes to women’s health, education, and welfare, here at home, and throughout the world.  We hardly need lectures on this issue from senators.

We just want to be left alone to live out the imperatives of our faith to serve, teach, heal, feed, and care for others.  We cherish this, our earthly home, America, for its enshrined freedom to do so. Those really concerned about women’s health would be better off defending the Church’s freedom to continue its work.
 
A couple of years ago I visited a woman’s prison. The warden asked me if I wanted to visit the expectant and new mothers’ healthcare center. It then dawned on me that, of course, some women would enter prison pregnant. I was so happy to see the expectant moms, getting good health care for themselves and their unborn babies, and to see the moms with babies under two getting classes in childrearing and parenting skills, with the babies receiving tender care right next to their moms. When I told the warden how grateful I was to see such excellent care for these women and children, he replied, “Thank yourself. Catholic Charities runs it.”
 
We can not grasp the degree of social chaos that will result if Catholic schools, hospitals and charities are forced to shut down because of the HHS mandate.

The Anchoress comments 
 The lie that the church “hates” women and wants to keep them down is an an old one and a lazy one and a convenient one, and — unsurprisingly, it’s the lie the media and folks with an agenda will run with. Reality, of course, is quite different and can’t be explained in a slogan or with a bumper sticker: Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:51 AM | Permalink

Grab bag of Delights and &apos;Pink Slime&apos;

 The look of love? How a woman&apos;s glance can tell a man if she&apos;s interested (or whether to walk away now) 
 If she looks down and then moves her eyes in a sweeping motion across the floor it almost certainly means that she is attracted to someone.  But an instant stare into a man&apos;s eyes or over his head on meeting is very bad news for a suitor 
 
&apos;Pink slime&apos; sounds gross, but how does it taste? 
 The pink slime burger also was perfectly seared and drew me in with an equally alluring aroma. But no juices collected on the plate. Or dribbled out. Or were apparent in the meat in really any way. The taste was - OK...t was not bad. But nor was it good. It was flat. I added more salt. No. It was simply one-dimensional....And then there was the texture. Unpleasantly chewy bits of what I can only describe as gristle, though they were not visible, seemed to stud the meat of the pink slime burger. The result was a mealy chew that, while not overtly unpleasant, didn&apos;t leave me wanting another bite.

Twice as expensive as we were lead to believe

So many accounting tricks were used to &apos;reduce&apos; the apparent cost of Obamacare so that it could be pushed through Congress, we are only now beginning to learn its true costs as Philip Klein points out .
 President Obama&apos;s national health care law will cost $1.76 trillion over a decade, according to a new projection released today by the Congressional Budget Office, rather than the $940 billion forecast when it was signed into law. 
 
That&apos;s twice as expensive as we thought.  If a car dealer did this, he would rightly be accused of &quot;bait and switch&quot;.

Of course, these numbers are so large, it&apos;s impossible to grasp them.

Revolt against Obamacare&apos;s Central Committee - the IPAB

My faith in the inherent soundness of the American citizenry is strengthened when 75% of Americans are against Obamacare and a clear majority think it&apos;s a bad thing, according to a CNN/Gallup poll.

One example of a very bad thing that&apos;s received too little attention: the unaccountable, unelected Central Committe e of Obamacare, the IPAB, will not be required to tell us what regulations they plan to enact and whatever regulations they do promulgate  will not be reviewable either in administrative proceedings or in the courts.  The IPAB is the rationing board, the ultimate in government price control .
 Last week, 24 medical organizations representing 350,000 doctors urged Congress to repeal Medicare’s new Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). That’s the right prescription for improving American health care and protecting access to innovative treatments for seniors. 
 Getting rid of the health care rationing board 
 The IPAB is the ultimate backstop to try to reining in the costs of the gigantic new entitlement...If the IPAB survives, it’s predictable what will occur: It will try small steps and then larger and more onerous ones aimed at reining in costs. And when all those fail, the reimbursement rates will be slashed. The Democrats may declare “rationing” isn’t in the cards, but when health-care providers can’t be adequately reimbursed, they limit or eliminate certain treatment options. 
Even Democrats are joining the Independent Payment Advisory Revolt 
 The vehicle is a bill from Tennessee Republican Phil Roe that would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, the new ObamaCare bureaucracy with vast powers to control health care and health markets starting next year. A straight majority of the House has joined Mr. Roe as co-sponsors—some 234 Members, including 20 Democrats.
---
 This turn is remarkable because the IPAB really does embody ObamaCare&apos;s innermost I values and beliefs—to wit, that health decisions are too important to leave to the people receiving the care (patients), the people providing the care (doctors and hospitals), the people paying for the care (taxpayers), or even the people who got the government involved in the first place (politicians).
 --
The irony is that the White House is expanding the government-run health care that it says the government can&apos;t be trusted to run by itself, even as its unaccountable, unelected board undermines democratic consent. The IPAB was relieved of the normal checks and balances of notice-and-comment rulemaking, and its edicts aren&apos;t subject to administrative or even judicial review. Consumers have far more rights of legal recourse under the private health plans that Mr. Obama deplores. Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:39 AM | Permalink 
Government failing elderly in Britain

Walter Russell Mead, 50% of UK Nursing Home Patients Abused By Government Health Care 
 Fans of government health care keep telling us that government can do the job, and they point to countries like the UK as examples where single payer, government run health care systems deliver high quality, compassionate care.

They are either grossly ignorant or they are lying through their teeth.

A recent study by a British healthcare regulator finds that half of all elderly people in Britain’s nursing homes are being denied basic health services.

Unthinkable thoughts on birth control

Quite apart from the encroachment on religious freedom that the government mandate that all employers must offer free birth control, abortifacients and sterilization to their employees, comes the issue of birth control.    The way Democrats are talking about it, birth control is an unqualified good and ought to be given away free.    They call it a &quot;women&apos;s health issue&quot; but let&apos;s take a look at just how healthy birth control pills are.  Not that I would outlaw birth control pills, but I believe that just as we put warning signs on cigarette packages,  women should know the truth about the risks they take when they begin taking the pill.
 
The Pill Is Not Good for Women 
 Women on the whole disproportionately bear the burden of the new sexual regime. They are expected to dose themselves with a Group 1 carcinoge n for approximately two-thirds of their fertile years. They sustain greater emotional costs from casual sex. They are at greater risk of contracting STDs and disproportionately suffer from their long-term consequences, such as cervical cancer and fertility loss .And even after 50 years with the Pill, as many as half of all pregnancies are still unintended. Women, not men, must make the heart-wrenching choice between abortion, reckoned a tragic outcome even by its supporters, and bearing a child with little to no paternal support. After all, since children were negotiated out of the bargain by the availability of contraception and abortion, men have secured a strong rationale to simply ignore or reject pregnancies that result from uncommitted sexual relations . Nobel-laureate economist George Akerlof predicted nearly two decades ago that this would lead directly to the feminization of poverty, as it ruefully has. 
 Poisoned by the Pill 
 hormonal contraceptives have been declared a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO).  A carcinogen is a substance that causes cancer, by causing changes in the DNA structure of cells. Estrogen-progestogen contraceptives have achieved the dubious distinction of sharing this carcinogenic ranking with such toxic substances as arsenic, asbestos and plutonium.  But unlike arsenic, asbestos, plutonium this is one carcinogen the government will recommend for perfectly healthy women.
--
The carcinogenic information about the pill is itself a bitter pill for doctors to swallow.  Dr. Lanfranchi said:“25 years down in my career, when I hear that I’ve been handing out a Group 1 carcinogen for the last 25 years, I’m going to be resistant to that.&quot; 
 Killer Compromise 
 Since 1975, there has been a 400 percent increase in breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. This mirrors the increased use of birth control over these same years.
 
A Mayo Clinic study confirms that any girl or woman who is on hormonal birth control for four years prior to her first full-term pregnancy increases her breast cancer risk by 52 percent. 
 
 Women who use hormonal birth control for more than five years are four times more likely to develop cervical cancer. 

 The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the World Health Organization, classifies all forms of hormonal contraception as Group 1 carcinogens. This group of cancer-causing agents also includes cigarettes and asbestos. How is it that the Food and Drug Administration can require cigarette manufacturers to place warning labels and photos of corpses on cigarette packages to warn consumers of the health dangers while they take the equally harmful substance of hormonal birth control and force companies to give it away free to women of all ages? 
No religious organization, Business Insider writes Time to Admit It.  The Church Has Been Right on Birth Control 
 Here&apos;s the thing, though: the Catholic Church is the world&apos;s biggest and oldest organization. It has buried all of the greatest empires known to man, from the Romans to the Soviets. It has establishments literally all over the world, touching every area of human endeavor. It&apos;s given us some of the world&apos;s greatest thinkers, from Saint Augustine on down to René Girard. When it does things, it usually has a good reason. Everyone has a right to disagree, but it&apos;s not that they&apos;re a bunch of crazy old white dudes who are stuck in the Middle Ages.

The Church teaches that love, marriage, sex, and procreation are all things that belong together. That&apos;s it. But it&apos;s pretty important. And though the Church has been teaching this for 2,000 years, it&apos;s probably never been as salient as today.

 Today&apos;s injunctions against birth control were re-affirmed in a 1968 document by Pope Paul VI called Humanae Vitae.  He warned of four results if the widespread use of contraceptives was accepted: • General lowering of moral standards
• A rise in infidelity, and illegitimacy
• The reduction of women to objects used to satisfy men.
• Government coercion in reproductive matters. Does that sound familiar?  Because it sure sounds like what&apos;s been happening for the past 40 years. 
So why are these facts so little known?  James Taranto writes about Unthinkable Thoughts or how feminism deforms intellectual culture.

Rick Santorum&apos;s view that advances in birth control have had deleterious social consequences, most notably in contributing to the breakdown of the family. To our surprise, a not-insignificant number of our readers have pushed back against this idea, which some find counterintuitive and others downright unthinkable.
--
T he Food and Drug Administration approved the pill for contraceptive use in 1960. Over the next half-century, the marriage rate declined and the illegitimacy rate skyrocketed,
 --
Santorum&apos;s argument is not really all that counterintuitive. It posits that the availability of birth control changed the culture in ways that encouraged illegitimacy. There is scholarly support for this hypothesis, in the form of a 1996 study in The Quarterly Journal of Economics
--
Santorum is doing a service to American intellectual culture by giving voice to ideas the feminist elite would like to decree unthinkable.
--
But when a decent young man professes a desire to marry an old-fashioned girl and take financial responsibility for his family, Yoffe treats him as a deviant. She denounces him as &quot;sexist&quot; even though he is careful to affirm that women have every right to work outside the home if they choose to do so. He mentions nothing about politics, yet she feels compelled to bring Santorum, the feminists&apos; Emmanuel Goldstein, into the mix.

Would you mistake sepsis for the flu?

 Within a day of his eczema being infected Marc was dead 
 One Wednesday night last February, Marc Franks, a fit, 38-year-old company director, mentioned a patch of eczema on his right arm.

As his wife Barbara recalls: ‘I’d given birth to our fourth child three months before, so I didn’t really pay much attention. Marc said the eczema was cracked, dry and probably infected. But he said the pain wasn’t too bad — he’d had eczema before and it always cleared up, so we weren’t too worried.’

The next morning, he said he felt fine and went off to work, leaving Barbara, 38, at home in Didsbury, Manchester, with daughters Ashlea, seven, and Rowan, four, and sons Thomas, five, and Owen, now 15 months.

But Marc felt so unwell that he returned home to spend the day in bed. The couple assumed he’d picked up the winter vomiting bug that had affected the rest of the family. He had an upset stomach and Barbara made sure he kept well hydrated. 
He died of sepsis that same day.

Do you know the warning signs of sepsis?  Would you mistake it for the flu?
 There are 102,000 cases of sepsis (previously known as blood poisoning or septicaemia) each year in Britain and it kills 37,000 people — more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined. Sepsis is also the biggest killer of pregnant women, who are particularly susceptible because their immune systems are suppressed in pregnancy. However, it can strike any age.
--
What few realise is that there doesn’t have to be a cut or wound to get blood poisoning. ‘Any type of infection — including chest infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, burst ulcers, appendicitis, bites and skin infections such as eczema can trigger sepsis ,’ says Dr Daniels.

‘ And it can kill rapidly — within 24 hours in some cases — so spotting it early is vital.’ 
--
says Dr Daniels. ‘The problem is that symptoms can be similar to flu and be non-specific — but t here are key symptoms that set it apart.’
 
These are a rapid heart rate, a high or very low temperature ( below 36c or above 38.3c), shallow rapid breathing and confusion or slurring. Dr Daniels says patients with two or more of these symptoms should seek medical advice.

‘If a patient also has cold, pale or mottled skin, loses consciousness or has not passed water for more than 18 hours, they need to be taken to hospital as an emergency as soon as possible.’ Posted by Jill Fallon at 2:35 PM | Permalink 
Personalized Cancer Treatment

 Instapundit points to an article in the MIT Technology Review about Personalizing Cancer Drugs from  Foundation Medicine, a company that is offering a test that helps oncologists choose drugs  targeted to the genetic profile of a patient&apos;s tumor cells.
 “Starting this spring, for about $5,000, any oncologist will be able to ship a sliver of tumor in a bar-coded package to Foundation’s lab. Foundation will extract the DNA, sequence scores of cancer genes, and prepare a report to steer doctors and patients toward drugs, most still in early testing, that are known to target the cellular defects caused by the DNA errors the analysis turns up. Pellini says that about 70 percent of cases studied to date have yielded information that a doctor could act on—whether by prescribing a particular drug, stopping treatment with another, or enrolling the patient in a clinical trial.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:23 PM | Permalink

&quot;You can cut your risks from most major diseases by 50 to 80 percent. All you have to do is get enough D&quot;

If this article doesn&apos;t encourage you to start getting enough Vitamin D, you&apos;re a hopeless case.

 

 Sunshine, Vitamin D and Death by Scientific Consensus
 
 The &quot;consensus&quot; on sunlight exposure has badly misled us towards massive vitamin D deficiencies

The “scientific consensus” that has held sway for four decades regarding both exposure to the sun and vitamin D has collapsed. What has emerged in place of the old “settled science” is the knowledge that most people in America are seriously vitamin D deficient or insufficient....
 
Simply put, unless you are one of the few people with optimal serum D levels, such as lifeguards and roofers in South Florida, you can cut your risks from most major diseases by 50 to 80 percent. All you have to do is get enough D . It also means we can significantly reduce both health care costs and the staggering national deficit by taking a few simple steps.
--
In truth, however, sensible sun exposure and vitamin D3 supplementation would do far more for our national health than the current health care bill . Even better, the benefits to society could be achieved without spending hundreds of billions of dollars. If an “Army of Davids” took it upon itself to spread the word, they could achieve what government is apparently incapable of achieving.
---
Though Holick began documenting the connection between vitamin D insufficiencies or deficiencies thirty years ago, the scientific floodgates have opened in the last year or two. Word of this massive body of evidence has only really begun to permeate the scientific community in the last few months.

 Optimal vitamin D serum blood levels, attained through sunlight or supplementation, dramatically reduce the risk of many diseases other than bone maladies. Many of the most serious are ameliorated by an astonishing 50 to 85 percent. These diseases include cancers, from breast and colon to deadly melanoma skin cancers.
 
Yes, that’s right. The really nasty skin cancers can be prevented by getting moderate, sensible sunshine or through vitamin D supplementation. Non-melanoma skin cancers do increase somewhat with sun exposure, especially with sun burns. These skin cancers, however, are relatively benign as they tend not to spread into other parts of the body. They are easily detected and removed because they appear on skin exposed to the sun.
--
 The big killers and most expensive diseases respond similarly to adequate D. I’m talking about hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. So do type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes (to a lesser extent), rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral vascular disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, autoimmune diseases, and apparently even viral diseases such as H1N1 and AIDS.
 
I predict that other diseases will also be linked to vitamin D insufficiencies as more studies are performed. Even conditions such as autism and schizophrenia may be directly related to prenatal or infantile vitamin D deficiency.
--
 Many of the benefits of D, incidentally, appear rapidly. Holick and others who prescribe D in clinical situations report that patients often experience dramatic improvements in quality of life within months. Not only do hypertension and bone density respond quickly, the neuromuscular impact of D is such that many of those who experience body pains and muscular weakness are relieved quickly when their serum blood levels are adjusted. Depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and various other maladies can respond extremely quickly to the sunshine vitamin. Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:32 PM | Permalink | TrackBack

&quot;When neither doctor nor patient can make the right decision, it is vital to have a caring family member advocate on your behalf.&apos;

 How a diagnosis of stage III stomach cancer profoundly changes an oncologist 
 By the reckoning of my physicians, survival was a percentage, and a horrible one — fifteen to seventy percent if I completed the treatment regimen.  That seemed to be an incredibly wide spread.  More and more I found myself thinking about percentages. If I completed the regimen and the disease returned, there were seemingly no other viable treatment options. It was morphine and palliative care. I was 39 years old. Death was a 100 percent certainty, eventually. So did it matter?

During one particularly desperate moment, I decided that I had had enough. I refused further treatment. I lay in my bed without anxiety, comfortable that I had made the correct decision. I watched the events around me, including the distress of my husband, Brian.

My doctors couldn’t override it or persuade me to change my mind, but, luckily, my husband, Brian, could and did. From my mental cocoon, Brian was by my side convincing me to finish treatment.

 My dreams of dying were not the products of anxious moments of terror. I was simply incapable of making the right decision for myself . My doctors were professional but ultimately could not decide for me. When neither doctor nor patient can make the right decision, it is vital to have a caring family member advocate on your behalf. Without Brian, and his tireless commitment to my recovery, I wouldn’t be here today.
 
While I am still battling cancer and have not yet returned to work nor am I leading a normal life, my illness has changed me profoundly as a physician. No amount of doctoring can prepare you for being a patient.  During the past year, I have endured multiple treatment methods, metastasis, and most recently the discovery of a brain tumor that threatens my eyesight.  The past year has been full of the most vulnerable moments in my life.

If anything, it’s that recognition of vulnerability as well as expertise that makes me a better doctor today. Posted by Jill Fallon at 7:39 PM | Permalink

&quot;High soda intake is a good marker for poor overall diet, and poor overall attention to health&quot;

Carbonated drinks  what we call Soda is linked to lung disease

 

 

 
 
 More bad news for soda lovers: in addition to obesity and heart disease, the sugary drinks may be tied to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Australian researchers found.
 
People who consumed at least a half a liter of soft drinks a day were more than twice as likely to develop either lung condition compared with those who didn&apos;t partake at all (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.60), Zumin Shi, MD, of the University of Adelaide in Australia, and colleagues reported in Respirology.

The cross-sectional study, however, couldn&apos;t prove causality, and researchers not involved in the study suspect an overall unhealthy diet effect might be at play.

 Ovarian cancer is one of the most feared diseases, as it hard to detect and often leads to death.

And efforts to concoct a solution have been futile, as the cure rate has only been bumped up by two percent in the last three decades.

But a research team at McGill appears to have made a breakthrough by learning that the cancer actual begins in the fallopian tubes.
 
&quot;We were barking the wrong tree. the name we got it wrong, we got the origin of ovarian cancer wrong. We got the test that we should be using for this wrong,&quot; said Dr. Lucy Gilbert, the MUHC oncologist who lead the research.

The revelation has led to better screening of the hard-to-detect condition, which is frequently overlooked because its first symptoms appear benign, they include bloating and more frequent urination. Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:26 PM | Permalink 
Reversing Alzheimer&apos;s in mice with a widely available cancer drug

 Cancer Drug reverses Alzheimer&apos;s in Mice 
 A widely available cancer drug has shown remarkable success in reversing Alzheimer’s disease in mice, raising hope of a breakthrough against incurable dementia in humans, US researchers said Thursday.

 Mice treated with the drug, known as bexarotene, became rapidly smarter and the plaque in their brains that was causing their Alzheimer’s started to disappear within hours, said the research in the journal Science.

 “We were shocked and amazed, ” lead author Gary Landreth of the Department of Neurosciences at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Ohio told AFP.

“Things like this had never, ever been seen before,” he said.

The drug works by boosting levels of a protein, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), that helps clear amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.
--
Six hours after mice got the drug, soluble amyloid levels fell by 25 percent, ultimately reaching 75 percent reductions. The effect lasted up to three days, said the study.

Soon after taking the drug, mice performed better on tests of mental ability and showed improved responses to odors.

Could some obesity be infectious?

 Gut microbe imbalance is catching, study finds 
 A study from Yale University found that both obesity and liver disease can be triggered by a family of proteins called inflammasomes that alter the balance of microbes in the stomach.

Amazingly, this altered intestinal environment can be passed on - making obesity an infectious condition.
The finding came to light during a study on stomach bacteria in mice.

Senior study author Professor Richard Flavell,said: &apos;When healthy mice were co-housed with mice that had altered gut microbes, the healthy mice also developed a susceptibility for development of liver disease and obesity.&apos;

NAFLD is the result of metabolic syndrome, a collection of disorders that includes obesity and diabetes, and is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the western world.

It is estimated that up to 30 million people suffer from NAFLD in the United States alone.

Professor Flavell said the next step will be to extend the research to see if the same effect can be seen in humans.
&apos;We found, in mice, that targeted antibiotic treatment brought the microbial composition back to normal, and thus eased the liver disease.  Our hope is that our findings may eventually lead to a treatment for humans.&apos; Posted by Jill Fallon at 11:08 AM | Permalink

Carbonated drinks increases risk of heart attack, stroke

For all those who just can&apos;t get going without a Coke in the morning or in the afternoon, you better reconsider.  You&apos;re far better off with coffee or tea, hot or iced.

 A daily can of diet fizzy drink &apos;increases risk of heart attack or stroke&apos; 
 Those who drink diet soft drinks daily are &apos;43 per cent more likely&apos; to have heart attacks

Carbonated drinks can cause long-term liver damage similar to that of chronic alcoholism

 Researchers from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and Columbia University Medical Center claim those who drink diet soft drinks are 43 per cent more likely to have heart attacks, vascular disease or strokes than those who have none.

Previous analysis of soft drinks has shown that the soft drinks, which have a substantial amount of artificial sweeteners, can cause liver disease similar to that caused by chronic alcoholism.
--
The U.S. research team studied the soft drink and diet soft drink consumption of 2,564 study participants over a 10-year period - along with their risk of stroke, heart attack and vascular death.

They found those who drank diet soft drinks every day were 43 per cent more likely to have suffered a &apos;vascular&apos; or blood vessel event than those who drank none, after allowing for pre-existing vascular conditions such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes and high blood pressure.

The latest study appears in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

Vit D, the Sunshine Vitamin

If you live and work  in the northern half of the country, it&apos;s almost impossible to get enough vitamin D in the winter from sunshine alone.  So take a supplement.    The RDA for adults according to the National Institutes for Health is  600 IU.

 Colds, heart disease, even cancer: Why the weather could be to blame 
 Low levels of the ‘sunshine vitamin’ have been linked to conditions ranging from colds to heart disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and cancer.
 
Last week, it was reported low levels may be linked to cot death.
--
Vitamin D not only helps the body absorb calcium (vital for healthy bones), but also plays a part in the immune system by helping reduce inflammation in the body.

This may explain the link with disease — chronic inflammation is thought to trigger heart disease and cancer. Vitamin  D also regulates cell growth, which might explain any possible cancer link.
---
It&apos;s been well known for years that low levels of the nutrient are linked to weak bones in adults and children. But there has been a spate of studies linking it to a range of major health problems, many of which are on the rise.

These include diabetes — one study last year found obese children with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as adults.

Another found adults with low levels had a 57 per cent increased risk of developing the disease.  There could also be a link to the auto-immune condition Crohn’s disease. Researchers found patients may have a reduced ability to absorb the vitamin.

Vitamin D has been linked to cancer. A study in the BMJ showed those with the highest levels of the vitamin in their blood had a 40 per cent lower risk of bowel cancer compared to those with the lowest levels of the vitamin.

Researchers have also suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and multiple sclerosis. Low levels have even been linked to rheumatoid arthritis. Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:50 PM | Permalink

Milk as a Memory Drug

 Drinking just one glass of milk a day could boost your brain power 
 Milk has long been known to help build healthy bones and provide the body with a vitamin and protein boost.  But now it’s being hailed as a memory aid after a study found those who regularly have milk – and other dairy products such as yoghurt, cheese and even ice cream – do better in key tests to check their brainpower. 
 
 Scientists asked 972 men and women to fill in detailed surveys on their diets, including how often they consumed dairy products, even if only having milk in their tea and coffee.  The subjects, aged 23 to 98, then completed a series of eight rigorous tests to check their concentration, memory and learning abilities.

The study, published in the International Dairy Journal, showed adults who consumed dairy products at least five or six times a week did far better in memory tests compared with those who rarely ate or drank them 
 
The researchers said: ‘New and emerging brain health benefits are just one more reason to start each day with low-fat or fat-free milk. 
I get my milk in glass bottles from Crescent Ridge Dairy delivered to my front porch each week by my milkman Sean.  It&apos;s the most delicious milk I&apos;ve ever tasted.  Maybe it&apos;s the small batch milk that makes the difference.

The &quot;Spanish Conondrum&quot;

 Fried food won&apos;t kill you - ask any Spanish chef 
 Now, a new study, published in the British Medical Journal hints at a “Spanish conundrum”. They love a bit of fried food, the Spaniards, and consume so much olive oil that one’s inclined to wonder if they think it’s one of their five-a-day.
--
The BMJ study of Spanish adults finds that “the consumption of fried foods was not associated with coronary heart disease or with all cause mortality”. Nor is this some half-hearted piece of research. It&apos;s a meaningful sample of 40,000 people.

So what is their secret? Well, to start with, you won’t find deep-fried Mars Bars going down in the tapas bars of Seville and Granada. The study also makes the point that cooking is done in fresh oil. Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:24 PM | Permalink 
A mother&apos;s love is priceless

 Why a mother&apos;s love really is priceless: It prevents illness even into middle age 
 Tender loving care in childhood was found to reduce a person’s risk of conditions including diabetes and heart disease in adulthood, according to researchers at Brandeis University in Boston.

They examined 1,000 people from low-income backgrounds, which has been shown by a wealth of previous research to be related to poorer health in later life and lower life expectancy.

However, they found some people from disadvantaged families managed to buck this trend – and they tended to have had a loving mother.

Psychology professor Margie Lachman said events in childhood seem to leave a ‘biological residue’ on health during adult life.

When what you know just ain&apos;t so

Mark Twain, the American author and humorist once said, “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.  It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”

 Myths and misses about Alzheimer&apos;s Disease 
 1. There’s no difference between Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Dementia is the umbrella which covers all diseases that cause cognitive decline in adulthood, including Alzheimer’s disease which accounts for 60%

 2. Alzheimer’s disease occurs only in the elderly . Sadly no, although it is much more common in the elderly

 3. Alzheimer’s disease can be diagnosed with certainty only at autopsy . Multiple studies comparing patients’ examinations and behavior with autopsy findings have demonstrated that patients can be diagnosed with accuracy approaching 90% by physicians familiar with the disease.

 4. Because there’s no cure, there’s no reason to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease early in its course .  This myth may account for the sobering and distressing estimate that only about half of all individuals with Alzheimer’s disease have been diagnosed, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.  ...Alzheimer’s patients benefit from early diagnosis in multiple ways,
 
 5. There’s no treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. This is perhaps the most pernicious myth.  While there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, it is not true that there is no treatment.  Drug treatment can slow the inexorable decline of this disease.  But treatment entails more than just drug therapy Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:18 PM | Permalink

Insider tips to surviving a hospital stay

The happy hospitalist gives you some Insider tops to surviving your hospital stay 
 10. Bring your own pillow . Trust me.

9. Bring a laptop computer or request one from the hospital . Hospitals all have free wireless these days and many will actually provide you with a laptop if you just ask.

8. Bring an accurate and updated medication list with you . Nothing leaves you more vulnerable to hospital errors than to have your doctor give you medication you haven’t taken in months or for you to miss medications that haven’t been updated by your five outpatient doctors since they bought their worthless EMR three years ago.

7. Write down all your questions early. Your doctor will only come to your room once a day (because they only get paid by Medicare to come once in a day) and any unanswered questions will have to wait until the following day. Posted by Jill Fallon at 8:28 PM | Permalink

Good news about tequila and beer

 Tequila Can Be Turned into Diamonds 
 “We were in doubt over whether the great amount of chemicals present in tequila, other than water and ethanol, would contaminate or obstruct the process, ” the study’s co-author, Lius Miguel Apåtiga, told PhysOrg. “It turned out to be not so. The results were amazing, same as with the ethanol and water compound, we obtained almost spherical shaped diamonds of nanometric size. There is no doubt; tequila has the exact proportion of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms necessary to form diamonds.”

Now that they know the process works, scientists can use the tequila-made diamond film substance for everything from semiconductors to radiation detectors. 
 10 Surprising Health Benefits of Beer
 
 1. Stronger Bones
 
 Beer contains high levels of silicon, which is linked to bone health. In a 2009 study at Tufts University and other centers, older men and women who swigged one or two drinks daily had higher bone density, with the greatest benefits found in those who favored beer or wine. However, downing more than two drinks was linked to increased risk for fractures. 
 2. A Stronger Heart 
 A 2011 analysis of 16 earlier studies involving more than 200,000 people, conducted by researchers at Italy’s Fondazion di Ricerca e Cura, found a 31 percent reduced risk of heart disease in those who quaffed about a pint of beer daily, while risk surged in those who guzzled higher amounts of alcohol, whether beer, wine, or spirits. 
 3. Healthier Kidneys 

 4. Boosting Brain Health 
 A beer a day may help keep Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia at bay, researchers say. 
 5. Reduced Cancer Risk 
 A Portuguese study found that marinating steak in beer eliminates almost 70 percent of the carcinogens, called heterocyclic amines (HCAs) produced when the meat is pan-fried. Researchers theorize that beer’s sugars help block HCAs from forming. 
 6. Boosting Vitamin Levels 
 A Dutch study, performed at the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute, found that beer-drinking participants had 30 percent higher levels of vitamin B6 levels in their blood than their non-drinking counterparts, and twice as much as wine drinkers. Beer also contains vitamin B12 and folic acid. 
 7. Guarding Against Stroke 
 Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that moderate amounts of alcohol, including beer, help prevent blood clots that block blood flow to the heart, neck and brain—the clots that cause ischemic stroke, the most common type. 
 8. Reduced Risk for Diabetes 
 Drink up: A 2011 Harvard study of about 38,000 middle-aged men found that when those who only drank occasionally raised their alcohol intake to one to two beers or other drinks daily, their risk of developing type 2 diabetes dropped by 25 percent. The researchers found no benefit to quaffing more than two drinks. The researchers found that alcohol increases insulin sensitivity, thus helping protect against diabetes. 
 9. Lower Blood Pressure 
 Wine is fine for your heart, but beer may be even better: A Harvard study of 70,000 women ages 25 to 40 found that moderate beer drinkers were less likely to develop high blood pressure—a major risk factor for heart attack—than women who sipped wine or spirits. 
10. Longer Life
 In a 2005 review of 50 studies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that moderate drinkers live longer. The USDA also estimates that moderate drinking prevents about 26,000 deaths a year, due to lower rates of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Posted by Jill Fallon at 3:49 PM | Permalink 
&quot;Four Britons are dying of dehydration and malnutrition in hospital each day&quot;

Why a government-run health service is so problematic.

Cristina Odone in the Telegraph Visiting a patient in a British hospital? Then take them food and water, just to be safe 
 While GPs are preparing to go on strike, and consultants and nurses ratchet up their attacks on the Coalition&apos;s proposed reforms to the NHS, four Britons are dying of dehydration and malnutrition in hospital each day . Few deaths can be as agonising as those caused by lack of liquids and nutrients, yet few deaths are as preventable.
--

Critics (and I&apos;m often one) of NHS staff complain usually about their indifference, self-righteousness, and us-against-them mentality. Now there is another charge to add to that list: letting patients die of hunger and thirst. No wonder family members insist on staying by their loved ones&apos; bedsides in the ward: they fear for their lives. The problem is some of the most vulnerable patients have no family visiting them: who then looks after their welfare? The sad answer is no one.

It&apos;s a shameful &quot;first&quot; for Britain: the NHS comes first in Europe when it comes to the percentage of hospital patients suffering malnutrition: a whopping 58%, compared to 24% in the Netherlands and just over 30% in Denmark. You have to go to Vietnam to find a similarly horrific number of malnourished hospital patients. 
The stories told by the commenters would make you weep.
 My father died recently in horrible circumstances at Southampton General. In a ward of 8 or 9 distressed old men it was like a scene from Bedlam. At night a West African nurse frightened the old boys by not displaying one iota of sympathy or care. The noise in the ward was unbelievable . Buzzers and alarms going of constantly for no apparent purpose. Nurses striding around skilfully avoiding eye contact like workers at B&amp;Q.

My mother who had been married to my dad for 60 odd years was constantly harassed for being in the ward to look after him, trying to make him eat and trying to wet his parched mouth. When my sister and I finally found a nurse who would stop and talk to us she explained he was on the &apos;Liverpool Pathway&apos; hardly a user friendly term of explanation. It certainly went over my mother&apos;s head. 
I have many posts on the Liverpool pathway.

 Perils of the Pathway 

“My mother was going to be left to starve and dehydrate to death. It really is a subterfuge for legalised euthanasia of the elderly on the NHS. ”

It really does seem that the Liverpool pathway has become a protocol to deal with all elderly patients and thus the reason to give minimum care and so hasten their deaths.

For the life of me, I can not understand how doctors or hospitals, even under the guise of &apos;policy&apos; or &apos;protocol&apos;, can deny  anyone who wants food and water no matter how old or sick.

 The &quot;Death Pathway&quot; 
 “Forecasting death is an inexact science,”they say. Patients are being diagnosed as being close to death “without regard to the fact that the diagnosis could be wrong.

“As a result a national wave of discontent is building up, as family and friends witness the denial of fluids and food to patients.&quot;

The warning comes just a week after a report by the Patients Association estimated that up to one million patients had received poor or cruel care on the NHS.
--

He said: “I have been practising palliative medicine for more than 20 years and I am getting more concerned about this “death pathway” that is coming in.

“It is supposed to let people die with dignity but it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
--

He said that he had personally taken patients off the pathway who went on to live for “significant” amounts of time and warned that many doctors were not checking the progress of patients enough to notice improvement in their condition.

Preventing MS

 National MS Society Convenes Summit to Explore Vitamin D Trials to Prevent MS 
 Background: Research is increasingly pointing to a reduced level of vitamin D in the blood as a risk factor for developing MS. Years ago, MS researchers wondered why MS occurs less often in regions of the world where exposure to sunlight is high. Dr. Hayes – a professor of biochemistry and microbiology – and colleagues suggested that vitamin D, which is made by cells in the skin in response to sunlight, may suppress the immune response involved in MS. She and others have since shown that in lab mice, vitamin D can reduce the effects of EAE, an MS-like disease.
--
“We are people from all over the world and we have one common purpose – to stop this disease,” noted Dr. Hayes. “The research that has been done by the people in this room and others provides us with strong evidence that vitamin D may help.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:04 PM | Permalink

Breast cancer vaccine from the army cuts recurrence in half

 The Army Has An Amazing Breast Cancer Vaccination That Cuts Recurrence In Half 
 Military researchers have developed a cancer vaccine that is cutting recurrence rates in cancer survivors in half, according to American Forces Press Service.

The vaccine, dubbed E-75, targets a protein commonly over-expressed in breast cancer cells called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2/neu.

“The idea is to train the immune system to recognize that protein or piece of protein that’s highly expressed on cancer cells, but not on normal cells,” said Army Colonel George E. Peoples, director and principal investigator for the Cancer Vaccine Development Program at the San Antonio Military Medical Center. “That way the immune system can differentiate what’s abnormal and normal. If the immune system can recognize it, it marks it for death, basically.”

People&apos;s team took a unique approach to developing their version of a cancer vaccine by testing its effectiveness on cancer survivors, who are currently disease free but are at risk for recurrence. Most often cancer vaccines are tested on end-stage cancer patients. Peoples pointed out that it&apos;s not surprising that the vaccines have not been found helpful in these cases seeing as a vaccine is supposed to stimulate the immune system and a healthy immune system is not found in end-stage patients.

The outcome of the 200-patient trial that started in 2001 is very promising, said Peoples. The cancer survivors, who received an injection once a month for six months, saw a recurrence rate of 10% as compared to 20% recurrence rate in the control group.

Binge drinking and Drunkorexia

There have always been people who drank too much, but binge drinking seemed to be limited to college frat parties.  Today it seems binge drinking is the only way some people know how to drink.

“It’s not just the usual suspects who are binge drinking,” said Dr. Robert Brewer, who leads the C.D.C.’s alcohol program. “This is not just a problem of high school kids and college students. It’s a problem across the lifespan.”
---
 Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the alcohol consumed by adults and 90 percent of the alcohol consumed by youths. 

 More than 38 MILLION U.S. adults binge drink on a weekly basis 
 College-age drinkers average nine drinks when they get drunk, government health officials said Tuesday.

That surprising statistic is part of a new report highlighting the dangers of binge drinking, which usually means four to five drinks at a time.
--
Health officials estimate that about half of the beer, wine and liquor consumed in the United States by adults each year is downed during binge drinking.
 
&apos;I know this sounds astounding, but I think the numbers we&apos;re reporting are really an underestimate,&apos; said Dr. Robert Brewer, who leads the alcohol program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC report is based on telephone surveys last year of more than 450,000 adults. They were asked about their alcohol drinking in the past month, including the largest number of drinks they had at one time. 
 

CDC Vital Signs 

 Age group with most binge drinkers: 18-34 years Age group that binge drinks most often: 65+ years Income group with most binge drinkers: more than $75,000 Income group that binge drinks the most often and drinks most per binge: less than $25,000 Most alcohol-impaired drivers binge drink. Most people who binge drink are not alcohol dependent or alcoholics. More than half of the alcohol adults drink is while binge drinking. More than 90% of the alcohol youth drink is while binge drinking. 

Combining binge drinking with starvation is the next dangerous step . Drunkorexia is the act of skipping meals to have more calories to binge drink.
 Combining starvation and binge drinking puts young women at risk of developing more serious eating disorders or alcohol abuse problems, as well as in danger of alcohol poisoning, risky sexual behavior and chronic diseases in later life. Women are more vulnerable to liver damage and cirrhosis at lower levels of alcohol consumption than men. Alcohol also increases a woman’s risk of breast cancer and the risk rises with the level of alcohol consumed. 
Sadly, too many young people are going to be in the position of Matt Maded with cirrhosis of the liver and no liver donors to be found.  He stopped drinking when he was 21, now he&apos;s looking at a very early death.

 &apos;I started drinking aged 10&apos;: Alcoholic, 26, desperately in need of new liver sits by phone waiting for a life-saving call .
 He was drinking 16 cans and a bottle of spirits as a teenager and was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis when he was 21

He only has a  20 per cent chance of getting the donor liver he needs.

Your appendix may be good for something

 Your Appendix Could Save Your Life 
 You may have heard the appendix is vestigial, a relict of our past like the hind leg bones of a whale. Parker heard that too, he just disagrees. Parker thinks the appendix serves as a nature reserve for beneficial bacteria in our guts. When we get a severe gut infection such as cholera (which happened often during much of our history and happens often in many regions even today), the beneficial bacteria in our gut are depleted. The appendix allows them to be restored.  In essence, Parker sees the appendix as a sanctuary for our tiny mutualist friends, a place where there is always room at the inn. If he is right, the appendix nurtures beneficial bacteria even as our conscious brains and cultures tell us to kill, kill, kill them with wipes and pills.

Fish Oil, Leukemia and Alzheimer&apos;s

 Fish Oil May Cure Leukemia 
 Fish oil has long been touted for its heart, neurological, and cancer risk-lowering health benefits. Now, an ingredient that can be extracted from fish oil may lead to a cure for leukemia.
 
According to Penn State researchers, a compound called delta-12-protaglandin J3 (D12-PGJ3) appears to target leukemia stem cells. The compound killed the stem cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in mice, said Sandeep Prabhu, Penn State associate professor of immunology and molecular toxicology in the Department of Veterinary and Medical Sciences.

The potentially curing compound comes from Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish and in fish oil.
--
The researchers have applied for a patent and are also preparing to test the compound on humans. 
I&apos;ve been touting the benefits of fish oil for a long time.    Its wonders keep growing.

 

 A fish-rich eating plan &apos;could help prevent Alzheimer&apos;s disease&apos; by stopping brain from shrinking 
 Study reveals those with diets high in omega-3 fatty acids are less likely to lose brain capacity later in life 

U.S. researchers found that elderly people with high levels of omega 3 found in oily fish and vitamins common in fruit and vegetables did better in memory tests than those with a less healthy diet.

Brain scans confirmed those with the highest levels of vitamin D and omega 3 and vitamins B, C and E, also had a significantly larger brain volume. Conversely people whose blood had higher levels of trans fats - found in cakes and fried foods, as well as red meat - had the worst scores and less brain tissue.

This is thought to be the first study to investigate nutrient levels through blood tests rather than looking at food diaries or questionnaires.
--
The scientists, from Oregon Health&amp;Science University, say this gives a more accurate picture because it does not rely on memory or honesty, and because in old age some people’s blood absorbs more of the nutrients they eat than others. 
 Diet to Beat Alzheimers 
 Study author Dr Gene Bowman said: “It is very exciting to think that people could potentially stop their brains from shrinking and keep them sharp by adjusting their diet.”
 
The discovery could save millions from the misery of the illness, which robs sufferers of their memories and their ability to care for themselves, with everyday tasks from eating to washing becoming almost impossible. Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:55 PM | Permalink 
Proactive Genomics

A landmark project by the Mayo Clinic.

 Doctors store patients&apos; genetic code in revolutionary step towards personalising care 
 U.S. doctors will start working out what drug or therapy works best for a patient using their genetic code, it emerged today.

The revolutionary step of personalising their care will be taken by mapping a patient&apos;s entire genetic code in advance to make prescriptions more effective.

It is hoped thousands will take part in the landmark project run by the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

Volunteers will have all 23,000 genes in their genetic code sequenced and stored with their medical records from early next year.
 
It is part of an ambitious move towards an era of &apos;proactive genomics&apos; that puts modern genetics at the centre of patient care. 
--
The Mayo Clinic&apos;s director of the Centre for Individualised Medicine, Dr Gianrico Farrugia, said the cost of sequencing a person&apos;s whole genome – some 23,000 genes – has fallen so rapidly that it was now comparable to the price of a single gene test.

The project will help managers at the clinic decide whether it makes sense to read and store a patient&apos;s whole genome early on, instead of ordering single genetic tests as and when the need arises.

He told the Guardian: &apos;We are convinced that whole genome sequencing is going to radically change the way we practice medicine. Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:43 AM | Permalink

Winter stroll

It&apos;s a small study granted, but it seems to show that walking clears fatty foods from the bloodstream.

 That Christmas afternoon stroll really does work. 
 Working off Christmas dinner with a festive family walk might be healthy advice, according to new research.

Scientists believe exercise helps to clear harmful fatty food molecules from the bloodstream.
Experts who studied 12 overweight and obese men on treadmills found that activity appeared to alter the structure of lipid blood fats.
-- 
 
 Winter Stroll in Westmount Park by Ingrid Harrison 
 Study leader Dr Jason Gill, from the University of Glasgow, said: &apos;We can think of the level of lipids in our blood as being like the level of water in a bath.

&apos;To reduce the water level you can either turn off the tap, or increase the size of the plughole to let it drain out.

&apos;For blood lipids this is equivalent to producing less, or breaking them down more.  &apos;Our research suggests that exercise works at the &apos;plughole&apos; end of the process, increasing the body&apos;s ability to break down the fats faster. We think this might occur through structural changes to the lipid particles making them more amenable to clearance from the blood.&apos;

Cancer vaccine closer than ever

A new wonder vaccine against cancer using our immune system to fight against &quot;rogue&quot; sugars in tumors.  It could be on the market by 2020

 

 New super vaccine could tackle 70% of lethal cancers and is better than &apos;wonder drug&apos; Herceptin 
 A vaccine that could deal a serious blow to seven in ten lethal cancers has been developed by scientists.

In tests, it shrunk breast tumours by 80 per cent, and researchers believe it could also tackle prostate, pancreatic, bowel and ovarian cancers.  Even tumours that resist treatment with the best medicines on the market, including the ‘wonder drug’ Herceptin, may be susceptible to the vaccine

The experiments done so far have been on mice, but researchers hope to pilot  the drug on people within two years.

If all goes well, the vaccine – one of the first to combat cancer – could be on the market by 2020.
More than 300,000 cases of cancer are diagnosed in Britain each year and the disease kills around half this number annually.

Rather than attacking cancer cells, like many drugs, the new treatment harnesses the power of the immune system to fight tumours. The search for cancer vaccines has until now been hampered by fears that healthy tissue would be destroyed with tumours. 

 To get round this, researchers from the University of Georgia and the Mayo Clinic in the United States focused on a protein called MUC1 that is made in bigger amounts in cancerous cells than in healthy ones. Not only is there more of it, but a sugar that it is ‘decorated’ with has a  distinctive shape. The vaccine ‘trains’ the immune system to recognise the rogue sugar and turn its arsenal against the cancer. 

 ‘It activates all three components of the immune system to reduce tumour size by an average of 80 per cent.’
 
 The misshaped MUC1 sugar is found in 90 per cent of breast and pancreatic cancers and around 60 per cent of prostate cancers, as well as many other tumours.The researchers believe more than 70 per cent of all cancers that kill may be susceptible to the vaccine. Despite their excitement, the work is still only at an early stage.

Becoming a cyborg

Just in case you thought an artificial heart was as good as the real thing, Peter Houghton tells the truth about what it does to a person as a person, The Cold Reality of an Artificial Heart 
 Houghton is the first permanent lifetime recipient of a Jarvik 2000 left ventricular-assist device. Seven years ago, it took over for the heart he was born with. Since then, he has walked long distances, traveled internationally and kept a daunting work schedule.

 At the same time, he reports, he&apos;s become more &quot;coldhearted&quot; and &quot;less sympathetic in some ways.&quot;

He doesn&apos;t feel like he can connect with those close to him. He wishes he could bond with his twin grandsons, for example. &quot;They&apos;re 8, and I don&apos;t want to be bothered to have a reasonable relationship with them and I don&apos;t know why,&quot; he says.

He can only feel enough to regret that he doesn&apos;t feel enough. 
It&apos;s a fascinating read.

Death panels

Catching up on the news after almost three weeks away from the Internet, politics was less interesting than ever, but other stories were more shocking than ever.  In particular, this story about the brain surgeon who went to Washington to be briefed on how Obamacare would effect advanced neurosurgery for people over 70.

 Full Transcript: Neurosurgeon Briefed by HHS Reveals Obamacare&apos;s Death Panels (Hint: Patients Are Called &apos;Units&apos;)
 
 I just returned from Washington, DC, where we were reading over what the Obama health care plan would be for advanced neurosurgery for patients over 70, which we all found quite disturbing. As our population gets older, the majority of our patients are getting over 70. They&apos;ll require stroke therapy, aneurysm therapy, and basically what the document stated is that if you&apos;re over 70 and you come into an emergency room... if you&apos;re on government-supported health care, you&apos;ll get &quot;comfort care&quot;.
 
ML: Wait a minute... what’s the source for this?

Jeff: This is Obama’s new health care plan for advanced neurosurgical care.

ML: And who issued this? HHS?

Jeff: Yes. And basically they don’t call them patients, they call them units. And instead of, they call it “ethics panels” or “ethics committees”, would get together and meet and decide where the money would go for hospitals, and basically for patients over 70 years of age, that advanced neurosurgical care was not generally indicated.

ML: So it’s generally going to be denied?

Jeff: Yes, absolutely... If someone comes in at 70 years of age with a bleed in their brain, I can promise you I’m not going to get a bunch of administrators together on an ethics panel at 2 in the morning to decide that I’m OK to do surgery.

ML: Is this published somewhere where the general public could get a hold of it?

Jeff: Not yet. 
I assume that government-supported health care includes Medicare that everyone over 65 must join.
The conclusion I draw is that if you have a stroke and you&apos;re 70 or older, you&apos;re out of luck.

Over In the U.K., in the National Health Service, doctors are failing to inform up to half of families that their loved ones have been put on a scheme to help end their lives, the Royal College of Physicians has found. 
 In addition to the withdrawal of fluid and medication, patients can be placed on sedation until they pass away. This can mean they are not fed and provided with water and has led to accusations that it hastens death. 
--

The Liverpool Care Pathway was intended for use in hospices but was given approval by the Department of Health in 2006 leading to widespread use in hospitals. Concerns about the pathway were raised first in The Daily Telegraph in 2009 when experts warned that in some cases patients have been put on the pathway only to recover when their families intervened, leading to questions over how people are judged to be in their “last hours and days”.

Old Age or low B12

Jane Brody says It Could Be Old Age, or It Could Be Low B12 
 It is an important question. As we age, our ability to absorb B12 from food declines, and often so does our consumption of foods rich in this vitamin. A B12 deficiency can creep up without warning and cause a host of confusing symptoms that are likely to be misdiagnosed or ascribed to aging.
--
A severe B12 deficiency results in anemia, which can be picked up by an ordinary blood test. But the less dramatic symptoms of a B12 deficiency may include muscle weakness, fatigue, shakiness, unsteady gait, incontinence, low blood pressure, depression and other mood disorders, and cognitive problems like poor memory.
--
In its natural form, B12 is present in significant amounts only in animal foods, most prominently in liver (83 micrograms in a 3.5-ounce serving). Good food sources include other red meats, turkey, fish and shellfish. Lesser amounts of the vitamin are present in dairy products, eggs and chicken. Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:20 PM | Permalink

A baby aspirin every day

That baby aspirin you&apos;ve been taking every day because your doctor it&apos;s good for your heart  may also be cutting your risk of cancer by 60%

 Aspirin every day can cut cancer risk by 60%: British scientists find first proof of preventative effect
 
Increasing numbers of doctors are taking painkiller for insurance against the disease
 Taking aspirin regularly can cut the long-term risk of cancer, according to the first major study of its kind.

British researchers found it can reduce the risk by 60 per cent in people with a family history of the disease.
 
The landmark research covering 16 countries is the first proof that the painkiller has a preventive action that is likely to benefit anyone using it every day. Posted by Jill Fallon at 6:41 PM | Permalink

Loops for better hearing

Great news for the hearing impaired, A Hearing Aid That Cuts Out All the Clatter 

And it all has to do with a hearing loop.
 The technology, which has been widely adopted in Northern Europe, has the potential to transform the lives of tens of millions of Americans, according to national advocacy groups. As loops are installed in stores, banks, museums, subway stations and other public spaces, people who have felt excluded are suddenly back in the conversation.

A hearing loop, typically installed on the floor around the periphery of a room, is a thin strand of copper wire radiating electromagnetic signals that can be picked up by a tiny receiver already built into most hearing aids and cochlear implants. When the receiver is turned on, the hearing aid receives only the sounds coming directly from a microphone, not the background cacophony. 
The response of one composer, Richard Einhorn, who had lost much of his hearing.
 “There I was at ‘Wicked’ weeping uncontrollably — and I don’t even like musicals,” he said. “For the first time since I lost most of my hearing,  live music was perfectly clear, perfectly clean and incredibly rich.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:00 AM | Permalink

Alzheimer&apos;s and cellphones

Good news for everyone. Blood pressure drugs can lower Alzheimer&apos;s risk by up to 50 per cent
 
 Taking newer blood pressure drugs cuts the risk of Alzheimer&apos;s by up to 50 per cent, British scientists say.

Patients on these new drugs are also less likely to develop vascular dementia – a condition caused by problems in blood supply to the brain – than those on older medication.

The first study of its kind opens the door for a treatment that might delay, slow or even prevent dementia. 
Details at the link.

 Largest study on cellphones, cancer finds no link 
 Danish researchers can offer some reassurance if you&apos;re concerned about your cellphone: Don&apos;t worry. Your device is probably safe.

 The biggest study ever to examine the possible connection between cellphones and cancer found no evidence of any link, suggesting that billions of people who are rarely more than a few inches from their phones have no special health concerns.

The Danish study of more than 350,000 people concluded there was no difference in cancer rates between people who had used a cellphone for about a decade and those who did not. Posted by Jill Fallon at 11:49 AM | Permalink

Crowdsourcing and connecting for caregivers and the chronically ill

Coming to market are a number of products aimed at the chronically ill and their caregivers.

First off, A Shoe for Wanderers , GPS tracking devices embedded in shoes for seniors suffering Alzheimers or dementia.  A boon for adult children who want to know where their parents are.

Springwise looks at A dedicated social network and web portal for the chronically ill that plans to rollout in 2012 after its trial and service to patients with congestive heart failure

The web portal is called Wellaho 
 By using the Wellaho web portal, patients can connect with a community of people who suffer from conditions similar to theirs, to share stories, thoughts and advice. Meanwhile, a dashboard allows patients to monitor their progress against key statistics given by their physician, as well as enabling them to set goals and note symptoms which can be viewed by their doctor and support network. The software also enables patients to set up emails, texts and phone calls as reminders for medical appointments, or to remind about the correct dosages and times for medications...... Additionally, online resources containing the latest news and information on clinical trials, research, and treatments specific to the patient’s condition are available through the service. 
Two other sites noted by Springwise.  The first a web app to tap medical crowds for personalized cancer treatment The app is Cancer commons .  The second is a medical site that helps patients find the most promising new treatments. The site is Medify 

For caregivers there is Caregiver Village and if you register they will donate $1 to the organization of your choice that supports caregivers .  It&apos;s a virtual village where you can play a game and solve a mystery and in so doing learn valuable self care techniques.  There are tip sheets, online training courses and my favorite, book clubs, where you can connect and share with other caregivers.  There are even apps for your iPhone and iPad.

Another benefit of Omega 3

Most older women are well nourished and don&apos;t need vitamins yet they take them anyway.

Now with researchers finding a l ink between vitamin use and higher death rates among older women, they should just skip them.  Except for vitamin D.

And, most likely, Omega-3-fatty acids.

 

But then, I&apos;ve always been a fan of Splendid Salmon.  Growing up, I and my brothers and sisters had to take a spoonful of cod liver oil every day during the winter and we never got colds or got sick.

Now, I mainly get my Omega-3-fatty acids with MegaRed &apos;made from pure Antarctic krill&apos; because the pills are very small and don&apos;t taste fishy.    I am convinced that&apos;s why I have no aches or pains to complain of.

Just about all menopausal women develop osteopenia, a decrease in bone density and a normal sign of aging.  That&apos;s quite different from osteoarthritis , a degenerative arthritis or a degenerative joint disease which you want to do everything to avoid.

 Omega-3 fatty acids shown to prevent or slow progression of osteoarthritis 
 According to the University of Bristol study, funded by Arthritis Research UK and published in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage , omega-3-rich diets fed to guinea pigs, which naturally develop osteoarthritis, reduced disease by 50 per cent compared to a standard diet. 

 The research is a major step forward in showing that omega-3 fatty acids, either sourced from fish oil or flax oil, may help to slow down the progression of osteoarthritis, or even prevent it occurring, confirming anecdotal reports and &quot;old wives&apos; tales&quot; about the benefits of fish oil for joint health.

 Lead researcher Dr John Tarlton, from the Matrix Biology Research group at the University of Bristol&apos;s School of Veterinary Sciences, said classic early signs of the condition, such as the degradation of collagen in cartilage and the loss of molecules that give it shock-absorbing properties, were both reduced with omega-3.

&quot;Furthermore, there was strong evidence that omega-3 influences the biochemistry of the disease, and therefore not only helps prevent disease, but also slows its progression, potentially controlling established osteoarthritis,&quot; he said.
---

On the back of the results of his study, Dr Tarlton said that following government guidelines on dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids could be effective in reducing the burden of osteoarthritis. Fish oil is far more effective than the flax oil based supplement, but for vegetarians flax oil remains a viable alternative.
 
&quot;Most diets in the developed world are lacking in omega-3, with modern diets having up to 30 times too much omega-6 and too little omega-3. Taking omega-3 will help redress this imbalance and may positively contribute to a range of other health problems such as heart disease and colitis.&quot;
 
 
 In Fish Oil: Known Benefits, Little Risk . I admit to being a bit of a nut on the benefits of coffee, tea, beer, chocolate, Vitamin D and Omega 3.  I  link to a series of posts on the value of Omega 3 before and after heart attacks, to lessen the risk of cancers of the breast, colon and prostate, to fight asthma, to lose weight faster, to treat depression, to feed the human brain and to lower the murder rate.

New advances against cancer

Who would have thought that Up to 40% of cancers &apos;are caused by viruses&apos;: Discovery offers hope of vaccines and new therapies
 
 It has been known for decades that viruses cause some types of cancer but it was thought to be only 10 to 20 per cent of cases.

The best known are the hepatitis B and C bugs, which can cause liver cancer , and the human papilloma virus (HPV) which can cause cervical cancer. 

Last week scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found a viral link with medulloblastoma, the most common form of childhood brain tumour
 
It follows the discovery two years ago that Merkel cell carcinoma , an aggressive skin cancer, often follows infection by the polyomavirus which is common among animals and can spread to humans.

It is also claimed that prostate cancers could be caused by viruses. 
News this week is that Two Cancer Studies Find Bacterial Clue in Colon
 
 T he new tools of genomic analysis offered an opportunity to look for a connection . What Dr. Holt and another group of researchers, working independently, have found is completely unexpected and puzzling. One particular species of bacterium never particularly prevalent in the colon seems to have a disturbing affinity for colon cancers.

The two research groups discovered the link by analyzing genetic material in tumor samples. They then subtracted human genes from the mix. What remained were microbe genes.
 
An analysis of these microbial genes showed that a type of bacterium, Fusobacterium, was abundant in the tumors although it normally is not among the more prominent species in the gut. Not only were the bacteria lurking around the cancer cells, but Dr. Holt found in subsequent experiments that they actually were burrowing into tumor cells — “which is kind of creepy,” he said. An ability to invade cells, he said, is often what distinguishes a disease-causing microbe from one that is harmless.

Of course, that doesn’t prove that Fusobacteria are causing tumors. They might just find the cancer cells a good place to live. Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:11 PM | Permalink

Elephant in the Room

I believe that all women, particularly young ones,  should be aware of all the risks for breast cancer, even if it runs counter to the prevailing beliefs.

 In the pink 

The pink awareness campaign is packaged, quite profitably, as an expression of genuine concern about women’s health. So surely it is reasonable to expect that such concern be matched by an accurate presentation of all the known risk factors, and by an insistence upon the very best corresponding prevention recommendations, right? After all, early detection measures such as screening are not nearly the same thing as solid prevention.

Indefensibly, however, most awareness efforts fail to feature some factors known to reduce breast cancer risk: having children, avoiding induced abortions, and refraining from oral contraceptives (OC) . True, there is no guaranteed way for anyone to dodge or develop breast cancer, but that does not mean there are not risk factors. Women today are delaying childbirth as never before, and having fewer children. Younger women are using OC for longer periods of time. And well over a fifth of all pregnancies in America end in abortion – hardly the rarity its “safe, legal and rare” advocates say it should be. If you suspect that these reproductive risk factors might have something to do with the 40 percent increase in the incidence of breast cancer over the last 30 years, you have spotted the elephant in the room . 
---
 The steroids taken by more than 100 million women around the world to prevent pregnancy -- oral contraceptives – are known human carcinogens, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In 2006, the Mayo Clinic concluded that a woman who takes OC before her first full-term pregnancy stands a 44 percent greater chance of contracting breast cancer prior to menopause, compared with those who don’t take OC before giving birth. Using OC for four of more years prior to first full-term pregnancy is even more risky.
--
 Induced abortion is also a major risk factor. A recent (2007) multi-country study found that having had an abortion was the greatest predictor of subsequent breast cancer. Going back decades, study after study (with only a few exceptions) has demonstrated the connection; a methodologically sound review of the available evidence determined that it r aises the risk of breast cancer by approximately 30 percent.

Are you getting your Vitamin B12?

 Study Finds Vitamin B12 May Prevent Memory Loss
 
 A new study has found a link between poor nutrition and cognitive problems in older adults. The study, published Monday in the journal Neurology, found that adults over 65 with a vitamin B12 deficiency are more likely to have lower brain volumes and cognitive impairment than those with adequate B12.
 ---
“We showed that four out of five markers of B12 deficiency were strongly associated with poor cognitive performance overall, and more specifically, poor episodic memory and perceptual speed,” said Christine Tangney, Ph. D., the study’s lead author and associate professor of clinical nutrition at Rush.

The researchers also found that brain volume was significantly lower in those with high levels of markers for B12 deficiency. 
The Institute of Medicine recommends 2-6 micrograms of vitamin B12 for adults over 50.

Foods rich in vitamin B12 are fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk and milk products

&quot;It does not tell a story. It contains &apos;just the facts&apos;&quot;

From MIT &apos;s Technology Review Why Doctors Don&apos;t Like Electronic Health Records 
 Jerome Groopman, a Harvard internist, wrote in How Doctors Think, &quot;Clinical algorithms can be useful for run-of-the-mill diagnosis and treatment ... but they quickly fall apart when doctors need to think outside their boxes, when symptoms are vague, or multiple and confusing, or when test results are inexact.&quot;

 The computer is oversold as a tool to improve health care, implement reform, cut costs, and empower patients. The reasons are obvious to anyone who treats patients. You cannot look a computer in the eye. You cannot read its body language. You cannot talk to an algorithm. You cannot sympathize or empathize with it.
 
We physicians are not Luddites or troglodytes. We are savvy about using the Internet, technology applications, and social media. For us, medicine mixes art and science. What we seek from patients are clues, constellations of signs and symptoms, and stories. We choose not to be reduced to data-entry clerks sorting through undigested computer bytes.
 
A string of numbers containing demographic, laboratory, and other patient information, no matter how systematically assembled or gathered, is not narrative. It does not tell a story. It contains &quot;just the facts,&quot; as Sergeant Joe Friday used to say. That is why an ophthalmologist told me that when he gets an EHR summary, he ignores it: &quot;It does not tell me the patient&apos;s story. It does not tell me why the patient is here, what troubles the patient, and what the referring doctor wants me to do.&quot; Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:21 PM | Permalink

MS and neuro-steroids

 Could a daily pill stop or even reverse multiple sclerosis? 
 Doctors have made an &apos;exciting&apos; breakthrough that could lead to a new treatment to stop - or even reverse the symptoms - of multiple sclerosis.

Researchers have discovered that people with MS have significantly lower levels of brain chemicals called neuro-steroids.

Neuro-steroids help build brain cells and maintain their function, connecting different areas of activity in the brain.

Scientists and neurologists at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada believe that it would be possible to replace the missing chemical with a daily pill that would represent a completely different way of dealing with the disease that affects more than 85,000 people in the UK.
--

Dr Chris Power announced the discovery in a research paper in the latest issue of Brain.
He said: &apos;This frankly is an exciting breakthrough and has huge potential. The role of neurosteroids in the brain has been known for some time but no one thought - until now - that they might play a role in MS.&apos;
--
&apos;We are talking about it being at least six or seven years away as a treatment but I am optimistic about our chances even though there are a number of hurdles to overcome.&apos; Posted by Jill Fallon at 7:06 PM | Permalink

Protective fatty acids for pregnant women

 Low-fat yoghurt &apos;child asthma risk&apos; during pregnancy 
 
 Pregnant women who eat low-fat yoghurt can increase the risk of their child developing asthma and hay fever, a study says.
 
At the European Respiratory Society conference, researchers will suggest this could be due to an absence of protective fatty acids in yoghurt.
 
The diets of more than 70,000 Danish women were analysed and their children followed until the age of seven.
--
But the results showed that milk intake during pregnancy was not linked to any increased risk of asthma.

In fact, milk was shown to protect against asthma development.

Forget the lottery. Search out medicare/medicaid fraud

One disabled man in New Jersey did and earned $15.4 million.

In the U.S. a &quot;qui tam&quot; action can be brought by any individual under the False Claims Act with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to bring suit on its behalf.    Whistleblowers, called &quot;relators&quot; , the person filing under the act stands to receive 15-25% of any recovered damages.    With at least $87 billion a year lost to Medicare/Medicaid fraud, there exists the potential to make a
great deal of money for  enterprising individuals or groups  employing all the  technological tools and information at hand to ferret out fraud.

 Disabled New Jersey Man Earns $15 Million Exposing Largest Medicaid Fraud In History
 
 Richard West was shocked when he went for some dental work and found his Medicaid benefits had maxed out.
Pulling up his Medicaid record, he totaled the care he&apos;d received, the bills submitted by his provider -- and found the problem.
According to The Star-Ledger, West, 63, found the company arranging his nursing care, Maxim Healthcare, w as over-billing the government for hundreds of hours of service from people he&apos;d never seen.
 
 
 After calling several government hot-lines and receiving no help, he got a lawyer of his own. That phone call unraveled a fraud stretched across 40-states and resulted in a $150 million settlement  -- the largest for healthcare fraud in history.  Monday, Maxim agreed to return $121.5 million in state and federal claims; $8.4 million to the VA, and pay a $20 million fine.

 For exposing the fraud West will receive $15.4 million. 
 
 Tuckerton man&apos;s resolve helps uncover multimillion-dollar health care fraud 
 A one-time auto mechanic, truck driver, commercial fisherman and carpenter before his disease — a genetic disorder that prevents muscles from functioning — put him in a wheelchair, West gets 16 hours of nursing and home health care a day. He said he brought his case only because no one would listen to him.

He said it was not hard to figure out what was going on. &quot;The hard part was turning them in,&quot; he remarked.  West, who lives in Tuckerton, said he tried going through a county social worker, to the state Medicaid waiver office, and then the Medicaid hot line for fraud.  &quot;No one ever did anything,&quot; he complained.

Robin Page West, his attorney (and no relation to him), said winning will be a mixed blessing.  &quot;He no longer qualifies for Medicaid,&quot; she noted with a smile. 
 &quot;The three most salient characteristics of Medicare and Medicaid fraud are: It’s brazen, it’s ubiquitous, and it’s other people’s money, so nobody cares,&quot; writes  Michael Cannon in Entitlement Bandits. 

 Judging by official estimates, Medicare and Medicaid lose at least $87 billion per year to fraudulent and otherwise improper payments, and about 10.5 percent of Medicare spending and 8.4 percent of Medicaid spending was improper in 2009 . Fraud experts say the official numbers are too low. “Loss rates due to fraud and abuse could be 10 percent, or 20 percent, or even 30 percent in some segments,” explained Malcolm Sparrow, a mathematician, Harvard professor, and former police inspector, in congressional testimony.

The GAO reports that Medicare Fraud is Four Times Greater than the profits of all the health insurers in the country !

Take your B vitamins to stave off Alzheimer&apos;s and eat your chocolate

Great advances on the Alzheimer&apos;s front

 Daily Vitamin B pill can  help stave off Alzheimer&apos;s 
 A daily vitamin pill could dramatically slow the onset of memory loss in old age and even protect against Alzheimer&apos;s disease, researchers have found. 

 The tablet, containing high doses of B vitamins and folic acid, reduced memory decline by 70 per cent in some elderly people.
It also halved the rate of brain shrinkage in some patients - a physical symptom associated with forgetfulness that can lead to full blown Alzheimer&apos;s disease.
 --
In future people could be tested for vitamin B levels in middle age and alter their diet to boost their chances of remaining healthy, researchers said.

A full scale national trial to establish whether the breakthrough can actually delay the slide into Alzheimer&apos;s and other forms of dementia is expected to begin within the next year. 
 Insulin may slow Alzheimer&apos;s, study finds
 
 Inhaling it through the nose twice daily seems to slow symptoms of memory loss. More study is needed, but researchers are encouraged .
--
Dr. Jacobo Mintzer, an Alzheimer&apos;s expert at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston who was not involved in the study, hailed the research as &quot;a new way of thinking&quot; about treating dementia.

&quot;As a clinician, I would not tell my patients to get their hopes up,&quot; he said. &quot;But as a scientist, I always get very encouraged when the paradigm shifts,&quot; as he said it has here.
--
&quot;A safe, easy delivery system — those are things we&apos;d love to see for any kind of treatment for Alzheimer&apos;s disease,&quot; said Laurie Ryan, a neuropsychologist who directs clinical trials involving dementia at the National Institute on Aging, which funded the pilot study. 
And the benefits of dark chocolate every day keep adding up, making it a far superior health food than soy or tofu. 

Chocolate &apos;as good for you as exercise&apos; or so experiments with mice show.
 Scientists found that small amounts of dark chocolate may improve health in a similar way to exercise. 

The researchers focused on the mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses in cells that generate energy, and discovered that a plant compound found in chocolate, called epicatechin, appeared to stimulate the same muscle response as vigorous activity.

Dr Moh Malek, from Wayne State University in Detroit, who led the US study on mice, said: &apos;&apos;Mitochondria produce energy which is used by the cells in the body. More mitochondria mean more energy is produced the more work can be performed.

 &apos;&apos;Aerobic exercise, such as running or cycling, is known to increase the number of mitochondria in muscle cells. Our study has found that epicatechin seems to bring about the same response - particularly in the heart and skeletal muscles.&apos;&apos;

Reality bites

FORTY may be the new 30, but try telling that to your ovaries.

In the New York Times, Fertility is a Matter of Age No Matter How Young a Woman Looks 
 Advances in beauty products and dermatology, not to mention manic devotion to yoga, Pilates and other exercise obsessions, are making it possible for large numbers of women to look admirably younger than their years. But doctors fear that they are creating a widening disconnect between what women see in the mirror and what’s happening to their reproductive organs.
 
“Somewhere between 30 and 40 your internal organs are aging but you don’t feel it, and now you don’t even see it,” said Dr. Karyn Grossman, a dermatologist with practices in Manhattan and Santa Monica, Calif. “At least you used to get some visual feedback.”
---
 “Everyone in my life told me how young I looked for my age,” she said. “ I assumed it was the same on the inside as it was on the outside.”
 
Why it&apos;s time to regulate the IVF industry.  It should have been done years ago. Creepy: One sperm donor, 150 kids
 
 As more women choose to have babies on their own, and the number of children born through artificial insemination increases, outsize groups of donor siblings are starting to appear. While Ms. Daily’s group is among the largest, many others comprising 50 or more half siblings are cropping up on Web sites and in chat groups, where sperm donors are tagged with unique identifying numbers.

Now, there is growing concern among parents, donors and medical experts about potential negative consequences of having so many children fathered by the same donors, including the possibility that genes for rare diseases could be spread more widely through the population. Some experts are even calling attention to the increased odds of accidental incest between half sisters and half brothers, who often live close to one another.
--

 “We have more rules that go into place when you buy a used car than when you buy sperm,” said Debora L. Spar, president of Barnard College and author of “The Baby Business: How Money, Science and Politics Drive the Commerce of Conception.
--
Although other countries, including Britain, France and Sweden, limit how many children a sperm donor can father, there is no such limit in the United States.

“Just as it’s happened in many other countries around the world,” Ms. Kramer said, “we need to publicly ask the questions ‘ What is in the best interests of the child to be born?’ and ‘Is it fair to bring a child into the world who will have no access to knowing about one half of their genetics, medical history and ancestry?’
 
“These sperm banks are keeping donors anonymous, making women babies and making a lot of money. But nowhere in that formula is doing what’s right for the donor families.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:34 AM | Permalink

Prunes for your bones

 Want super strong bones? How a handful of prunes a day could help prevent fractures 
 They may be known for helping you over an embarrassing episode of constipation but prunes have another very useful effect.

Scientists have found that post-menopausal women can protect themselves against osteoporosis and bone fractures by simply eating around 10 of them a day.

Florida State and Oklahoma State academics proved that dried plums are far better than figs, dates, dried strawberries, dried apples, and raisins for improving bone density. 
 

--
 &apos;Over my career, I have tested numerous fruits, including figs, dates, strawberries and raisins, and none of them come anywhere close to having the effect on bone density that dried plums, or prunes, have,&apos; said Bahram H. Arjmandi, Florida State professor and chairman of the U.S. Department of Nutrition, Food and Exercise Sciences.

 &apos;All fruits and vegetables have a positive effect on nutrition, but in terms of bone health, this particular food is exceptional.&apos;
 --
&apos;Don&apos;t wait until you get a fracture or you are diagnosed with osteoporosis and have to have prescribed medicine,&apos; he said.

&apos;Do something meaningful and practical beforehand. People could start eating two to three dried plums per day and increase gradually to perhaps six to 10 per day. Prunes can be eaten in all forms and can be included in a variety of recipes.&apos; Posted by Jill Fallon at 1:25 AM | Permalink

Drink your wine, save your mind

 

 A glass or two of wine or beer a day can help to stave off Alzheimer&apos;s, biggest ever study finds
 
 A glass or two of wine each day can help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer&apos;s, the biggest ever study has found.
 
Researchers discovered those who indulged in light to moderate social drinking were 23 per cent less likely to develop forms of dementia and cognitive impairment.

&apos;It is well accepted that a glass of wine is good for your heart and reduces coronary artery and cardiovascular diseases,&apos; said Edward J Neafsey, a co-author of the study carried out at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.

He added that moderate alcohol consumption had the same effect on the brain. Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:15 PM | Permalink

Get up off the couch

If you sit all day before a computer and then go home and sit before the tube, you are risking a premature death especially if you are a woman.

 Excessive sitting linked to premature death in women 
 Research released last fall found that women who sat for more than six hours a day had a 37 percent increased risk of premature death, compared to 18 percent for men. Those results stayed the same, even when factors such as an individual&apos;s diet, amount of physical activity and smoking were taken into account.

Dr. Alpa Patel, senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, is the lead author of that study, the largest on how sitting affects mortality. The study was based on information from surveys of 123,000 people who participated in the study between 1992 and 2006. 
 TV shortens life by 22 minutes per viewing hour after age 25 says study out of Queensland, Australia.

 Only 15 minutes of daily exercise makes a big difference
 
 The study found t hose who exercised just 15 minutes a day — or 90 minutes a week — cut their risk of death by 14 percent and extended their life expectancy by three years compared with those who did no exercise. Both men and women benefited equally from the minimum activity.

DRACO is in your future

Wonderful news about a  new broad spectrum anti-viral therapy  dubbed DRACO

 New drug could cure nearly any viral infection 
 Most bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, discovered decades ago. However, such drugs are useless against viral infections, including influenza, the common cold, and deadly hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola.

Now, in a development that could transform how viral infections are treated, a team of researchers at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory has designed a drug that can identify cells that have been infected by any type of virus, then kill those cells to terminate the infection.
 
In a paper published July 27 in the journal PLoS One, the researchers tested their drug against 15 viruses, and found it was effective against all of them — including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, H1N1 influenza, a stomach virus, a polio virus, dengue fever and several other types of hemorrhagic fever.

&quot; Camels weren’t designed to carry such a load.&quot;

 ObamaCare&apos;s Most Frightening Consequence: Not Enough Doctors 
 ObamaCare’s defenders promised the law would increase patient access to care, but a closer look shows that increased regulations combined with higher demand for health services could cause many physicians to give up practicing medicine. 
The Doctor shortfall In 2016 will be  63,000 doctors, in 2020,  91,500 doctors say The Associations of American Medical Colleges.

Dr. Bob is selling his practice.  This is his perspective 
 The past year or so has been one of the most challenging in many a season, on a number of fronts. Professionally, the passage of Obamacare has made it abundantly clear that the independent private practitioner is a dying breed, and likely will disappear — with the exception of cash-only, concierge-style arrangements — within the next few years. The administrative burden is crushing — unfunded mandates, such as pay-for-performance, compliance programs, HIPAA, mandated “government certified” EMRs (even though existing, non-certified ones are fully functional), and intrusive, abusive audits by the Feds and third party carriers. Such mandates and regulatory excesses place, or will soon place, such an overwhelming burden on the solo physician or small group as to make their continued existence unsustainable, even in the near term — and the full implementation of Obamacare will put roses on their grave. Reimbursements are dropping precipitously (my income dropped about 25% last year), as expenses spiral upward (employee health insurance rates are up 25%; malpractice rates up 15%, etc., etc.). The small business model of solo practice or small medical group is rapidly becoming extinct: its executioner, Big Government and Big Insurance.

 The medical-legal environment remains as hostile and capricious as ever — I have endured two lawsuits in the past three years, both resolved with decidedly mixed outcomes while taking an enormous toll both in time wasted and emotional sobriety. I hope to share some insights thus gleaned on this horrendously dysfunctional system in the not-too-distant future.

Personally, although my health remains good, t he exhaustion borne of these and other struggles had taken much of the joy and energy from life. The ti me for renewal was long overdue.

And so, big changes are in store: my practice will be sold in the next few months to a large medical group affiliated with a nearby hospital, and I will have as a primary responsibility inpatient hospital care, with a much diminished office practice focusing primarily on my specialty of male infertility and vasectomy reversal. I have decidedly mixed feelings about this change — I anticipated going to my deathbed as a private, solo practitioner, loving the independence and rich patient relationships which this brings.

But I am weary. After nearly 30 years in private practice, I am not sure which straw broke the camel’s back, but it is most surely broken. It is a weariness born of 14 hour days; of dictating charts and finishing paperwork until 8 or 9 pm each night, after starting the day at 7 am; of endless audits by the insurance industry and Medicare; of the constant threat of litigation; of the crushing burden of one more federal requirement mandated but never recompensed; of a host of ever-expanding administrative burdens having nothing to do with patient care, and everything to do with bureaucratic micromanagement of the profession. And this before we have even begun to see the nightmare which Obamacare will inflict. Camels weren’t designed to carry such a load. 
 Well, Isn&apos;t THAT Special is his comment to the news that hedge funds are financing medical malpractice cases to the tune of $10 billion in 2010.

Cure for the common cold?

 Could zinc be a cure for the common cold? Taking supplements could shorten illness length by 40 per cent 
 It is medicine’s holy grail, eluding doctors and scientists for centuries. But remarkably, the cure for the common cold could be no more complicated than a mineral supplement.

Taking high doses of zinc can cut the length of colds by almost half, according to research. The evidence emerged from the combined results of 13 trials which tested the ability of zinc lozenges, which dissolve in the mouth and are widely available, to fight off colds.

 Three of the studies showed taking daily doses of zinc acetate higher than 75 milligrams – seven times more than is generally recommended – as soon as symptoms began, shortened colds by an average of 42 per cent. 

 Five others, using other types of zinc salt at doses greater than 75mg, resulted in a 20 per cent reduction. But five studies of doses lower than 75mg showed no benefit at all.
 
The idea that zinc lozenges might be effective against colds stems from an accidental observation in the early  1980s. Doctors saw that the cold of a three-year-old girl with leukaemia vanished when she dissolved a zinc tablet in her mouth.
--
Zinc deficiency is very common, with less than half of Britain’s population eating even half the recommended daily allowance.

It is not stored in the body, although can be found in tissue and bones. It aids the immune system, helps wounds heal, is important for proper taste and smell, and vital for male fertility. It may slow sight loss caused by age-related macular degeneration. Rich sources include shellfish, lamb, liver, steak, pumpkin seeds and wholegrains. Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:58 AM | Permalink

&quot;We are now experiencing the greatest avoidable epidemic in history”

 Broken Promises: How the AIDS establishment has betrayed the developing world. 
 Harvard University researcher Edward Green rose to prominence in the AIDS controversy with his 2003 book, Rethinking AIDS Prevention. His new book, Broken Promises: How the AIDS Establishment has Betrayed the Developing World, chronicles the continuing battle over how to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Green, a key player in the struggle, documents how two radically different strategies have competed for funding and support. 
One is a risk elimination strategy: abstinence, faithfulness to one partner with condom used only if one partner in a couple is already infected.  The other is the sex-positive condom code with no need to change sexual behavior if condoms are used.
 The evidence for the failure of condom marketing and distribution programs and the success of fidelity/delay was clear, yet many of western experts and those funding prevention programs continued to insist that condoms were the only solution and all Africa needed was more condoms. Not only was the money spent on these programs wasted, but money to deal with Africa’s other health care needs dried up.

 Through his first book, Rethinking AIDS Preventio n, Green had been able to convince some key leaders that behavior change was more effective than condom promotion. Others were convinced by their own research that prevention should focus on fidelity/delay, with condoms used only as a back-up.
--
 Green was facing an entrenched AIDS establishment run by gay AIDS activists, population controllers, and suppliers of condoms, all committed to the sexual revolution and determined to impose that revolution on Africa . Green was appalled by the racism he found among those involved in condom promotion. They commented privately that AIDS spread in Africa because African men are incapable of controlling their sexual urges and therefore the only answer is condoms. This in spite of research which showed that Africans when faced with the facts about HIV transmission are able to substantially change their behavior. 
The Pope got it right.
 In spite of mounting evidence of the failure of condom programs, the AIDS establishment ridiculed as anti-scientific anyone who did not support their strategy. When Pope Benedict XVI was asked about AIDS in Africa, he said that “… if Africans do not help by responsible behavior, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics. On the contrary, they increase it.” For this he was roundly condemned, but according to Green, “He had summarized the best current research on AIDS prevention in Africa.”
 --
 HIV has infected some forty-six million people in Africa and eighteen million have died. Green believes this could have been brought under control two decades ago, had ABC been employed, but because it was not “we are now experiencing the greatest avoidable epidemic in history.”

Khoruts and his colleagues reported last summer that they were able to use a fecal transplant to treat and apparently cure a woman with a life-threatening Clostridium difficile infection, which causes severe inflammation of the colon. The patient had an extremely poor prognosis: Suffering from chronic diarrhea, she had lost 60 pounds over eight months. “All antibiotics were failing, and she was in really bad shape,” Khoruts says. In a last-ditch effort to improve her condition, he mixed a small sample of the patient’s husband’s stool with saline solution and injected it into her colon. Within 24 hours her diarrhea had stopped. After a few days, the symptoms were gone.

In studying this patient’s progress, Khoruts was initially surprised to find that there was a nearly complete replacement of the woman’s microbial flora with her husband’s microbes. “By the time these patients get to this desperate treatment point, they’ve taken so many antibiotics that their microbiome has been decimated,” he says. “So when we transplant the new bacteria, they simply move in to occupy the empty space.” Before Khoruts and his team performed the procedure, no research had been done on how fecal transplants work or how they impact the microbiome. “Since then we’ve done another 23 patients,” he reports, “all with dramatic stories.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:57 AM | Permalink | TrackBack

Astonishingly good health news

 Aspirin a day &apos;could reduce risk of lethal skin cancer by 40%&apos; 
 Taking a daily aspirin could protect people from developing melanoma, a study has revealed.

Scientists found those who regularly took painkillers and especially aspirin over five years cut their melanoma risk by 40 per cent.

A team led by Dr Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski of Harvard Medical School, analysed and compared the medical records of 1,000 people and asked them to recall their use of painkillers.

&apos;Our data at least supports the hypothesis that long-term steady aspirin use has an effect,&apos; study co-author Dr Robert Stern told MSNBC. The latest study appears in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 
Fair-skinned people, of course, should always wear sunscreen and stay out of the sun when it is at its height. But for the millions, like me, who had severe sunburns when they were young, this study is encouraging news.  I&apos;m already on a daily dose of baby aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.

 Wonder Cure for Diabetes 
 Eating an ultra low-calorie diet can cure Type 2 diabetes in just eight weeks, dramatic new research has shown.

Even people who have suffered from the condition for years found the drastic diet could jump-start their body’s production of insulin.

The breakthrough is good news for the nearly 2.5million people in Britain who have this type of diabetes, which is caused by the pancreas not producing enough insulin to break down glucose in the blood.

It could revolutionise the treatment of what has always been seen as a lifelong problem.

Professor Roy Taylor, of Newcastle University, who led the research, said: “To have people free of diabetes after years with the condition is remarkable – and all because of an eight-week diet. For many years it has been assumed that Type 2 diabetes is a life sentence. It’s chronic, it’s progressive, people need more and more tablets, and eventually they need insulin. It’s a downhill slope. However, we have been able to show that it is in fact reversible.

“We have been able to put diabetes into reverse by a very low-calorie diet over a short period of time.

“What is really important and very new is the changes in the body that go along with this. Specifically, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas have gone to sleep in Type 2 diabetes, they are not really doing very much.

“As the level of fat in the pancreas has reduced, we have seen these insulin-producing cells come completely back to normal, and that is truly remarkable.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:23 PM | Permalink

The latest mishap with Obamacare. Medicaid for the middle class? 
 President Barack Obama&apos;s health care law would let several million middle-class people get nearly free insurance meant for the poor, a twist government number crunchers say they discovered only after the complex bill was signed. 

The change would affect early retirees: A married couple could have an annual income of about $64,000 and still get Medicaid, said officials who make long-range cost estimates for the Health and Human Services department.
--
Up to 3 million more people could qualify for Medicaid in 2014 as a result of the anomaly. That&apos;s because, in a major change from today, most of their Social Security benefits would no longer be counted as income for determining eligibility. It might be compared to allowing middle-class people to qualify for food stamps.

The Biggest Skin Cancer Breakthrough in 30 years

Late stage patients with melanoma have very few options until now.

 Skin cancer &apos;wonder&apos; drugs that could offer years more life in biggest breakthrough for 30 years 
 Two ‘wonder’ drugs significantly increase the chances of surviving advanced melanoma – the most dangerous and aggressive form of skin cancer, it was revealed today.

It is the biggest breakthrough in the fight against the disease for more than 30 years, say doctors, with patients getting extra months and sometimes years of life.

Trials show the drugs ipilimumab and vemurafenib both prolong survival.But the best results suggest that, using ipilimumab, the number of patients alive three years after diagnosis is almost twice that of those receiving standard treatment.

In the U.S. there were an estimated 68,000 new cases of melanoma in 2010, with 8,700 reported deaths. Posted by Jill Fallon at 3:54 PM | Permalink

Breakthroughs in genetic medicine

Lots of news on the genetic front that promise new drugs in the future based on your personal genetic profile.

 Scientists, in two separate studies, find genetic link to depression - 3p25-26
 “In a large number of families where two or more members have depression we found robust evidence that a region [of chromosome 3] called 3p25-26 is strongly linked to the disorder,” said Gerome Breen, lead author of the King’s study. “These findings are truly exciting as possibly for the first time we have found a genetic locus for depression.“
00
---
Many genes – probably more than 100 – contribute to a greater or lesser extent to depression. But unlocking the mechanism of just one, even if it is responsible directly for only a small part of the genetic risk, could make an important contribution to understanding the disease, said Lefkos Middleton, Professor of Clinical Neurology at Imperial College London. 
 Scientists find &quot;master switch&quot; gene for obesity - KLF14 gene
 Scientists have found that a gene linked to diabetes and cholesterol is a &quot;master switch&quot; that controls other genes found in fat in the body, and say it should help in the search for treatments for obesity-related diseases.

In a study published in the journal Nature Genetics, the British researchers said that since fat plays an important role in peoples&apos; susceptibility to metabolic diseases like obesity, heart disease and diabetes, the regulating gene could be target for drugs to treat such illnesses.

&quot;This is the first major study that shows how small changes in one master regulator gene can cause a cascade of other metabolic effects in other genes,&quot; said Tim Spector of King&apos;s College London, who led the study.

&quot;Terminal Male Idiocy&quot;

 Manhood is Now the Biggest Risk Factor for Early Death 
 Even the average man will shorten his life span like a Cro-Magnon. Compared to women, Mahalik finds, guys are less likely to wear sunscreen, take their pills, accept bed rest, administer self-exams, develop a network of emotional support, mix in some healthy food, or exercise safely. Alternatively, he is vastly more likely to snuff himself out by smoking and drinking, drinking and driving, drugging and sexing, committing suicide or getting killed, or dying in virtually every conceivable way except childbirth. The reason for all this &quot;stupid stuff,&quot; says Mahalik, is men &quot;don&apos;t want to be seen as pussies or wimps.&quot;

But can society change these ideas? ....Mahalik says, envisioning a campaign that raises awareness of terminal male idiocy the same way prior efforts have addressed anorexia in women. 
All those new Men&apos;s Health Commissions springing up in states have to make good health be seen as manly.

&quot;World Health Report 2000 was an intellectual fraud of historic consequence&quot;

Remember that WHO study that ranked the health care systems of nearly 200 nations that showed the US way down on the list?
 In October 2008, candidate Obama used the study to claim that “29 other countries have a higher life expectancy and 38 other nations have lower infant mortality rates. ” On June 15, 2009, as he was beginning to make the case for his health-care bill, the new president said: “As I think many of you are aware, for all of this spending, more of our citizens are uninsured, the quality of our care is often lower, and we aren’t any healthier. In fact, citizens in some countries that spend substantially less than we do are actually living longer than we do.” 
Turns out it could be The Worst Study Ever 
 In fact, World Health Report 2000 was an intellectual fraud of historic consequence—a profoundly deceptive document that is only marginally a measure of health-care performance at all. The report’s true achievement was to rank countries according to their alignment with a specific political and economic ideal—socialized medicine—and then claim it was an objective measure of “quality.”
-- 
At its most egregious, the report abandoned the very pretense of assessing health care. WHO ranked the U.S. 42nd in life expectancy. In their book, The Business of Health, Robert L. Ohsfeldt and John E. Schneider of the University of Iowa demonstrated that this finding was a gross misrepresentation. WHO actually included immediate deaths from murder or fatal high-speed motor-vehicle accidents in their assessment, as if an ideal health-care system could turn back time to undo car crashes and prevent homicides.
--
 What we have here is a prime example of the misuse of social science and the conversion of statistics from pseudo-data into propaganda . The basic principle, casually referred to as “garbage in, garbage out,” is widely accepted by all researchers as a cautionary dictum. To the authors of World Health Report 2000, it functioned as its opposite—a method to justify a preconceived agenda. The shame is that so many people, including leaders in whom we must repose our trust and whom we expect to make informed decisions based on the best and most complete data, made such blatant use of its patently false and overtly politicized claims .

The Medicare Heist

 Medicare as we known it isn&apos;t an option. Betsy McCaughey
 Medicare as we&apos;ve always known it is already gone. It was eviscerated by President Obama&apos;s health law.
--
 The truth is that the Obama health law reduces future funding for Medicare by $575 billion over the next 10 years and spends the money on other programs, including a vast expansion of Medicaid. In 2019, Medicare spending under the Obama health law is projected to be $14,731 per senior, instead of $16,162 if the law had not passed, according to Medicare actuaries (Health Affairs, October 2010).
--
The fact is that Mr. Obama&apos;s law raids Medicare. Mr. Ryan&apos;s plan, on the other hand, stops the Medicare heist and puts the funds &quot;saved&quot; in this decade toward health care for another generation of retirees.

Beginning in 2022, the Ryan plan offers each new Medicare enrollee a choice of private health plans and a premium paid to the plan they choose. The key is that the premium will be equivalent to what Medicare is projected to spend under the Obama health law: $15,000 a year on average, more for the oldest enrollees, less for the youngest, all inflation adjusted.
__
The Ryan proposal also includes a $7,800 annual medical savings account to help low-income seniors with out-of-pocket costs.
--
So what can retiring Americans count on in 2022 and after? The Obama health law leaves that up to an unelected board of presidential appointees called the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a cost-cutting panel.
--
 Will Americans now in their 40s and 50s choose to put their health care in the hands of this cost-cutting board, or pick their own health plan when they retire? Whatever decision the nation makes should not turn on the false claim that President Obama has protected Medicare.

It spattered all over.&quot;  Fire Chief Mike Robbins said the blaze destroyed the room where the fire started and everything in it, and the rest of the house suffered smoke and water damage.  The Arkport Village Fire Department as well as the North Hornell Fire Department required about 15 minutes to put out the fire

IPAB &apos;Death Panel&apos; ?

Remember that acronym.  It stands for the Independent Payment Advisory Board.  It is the single biggest difference between the President&apos;s plan and Paul Ryan&apos;s Plan.

 In his speech on the deficit, Obama pointed to IPAB as an answer to Paul Ryan’s plan. In Ryan’s vision, competition among insurers will force efficiencies and lower prices. Under Obama’s plan, in contrast, health-care prices for the elderly would be controlled by IPAB. Ryan’s plan puts consumers in the driver’s seat, but also exposes them to the risk of bad choices and limited subsidies. While Obama’s plan offers government-guaranteed care, IPAB’s price controls will lead to one-size-fits-all rationing. As IPAB caps Medicare payments for various services, the elderly will be unable to obtain many kinds of care, or will experience de facto rationing via long treatment delays and sharp declines in the quality of care. And by the way, IPAB rationing will hit many current seniors, whereas Ryan’s reform of Medicare will never affect anyone now 55 or older.

Blueberries and apples are really, really good for you

 Blueberries can slash body&apos;s fat cells by up to three-quarters

 
 Slimmers should start snacking on blueberries, as they slash the number of fat cells in the body by up to three-quarters, say scientists.

Researchers found the fruit can break down existing fat cells and prevent new ones from forming, making them a potentially powerful weapon in the fight against rising obesity. 
 
 Blueberries, which have already been lauded as a superfood for their ability to help prevent heart disease and Type-2 diabetes, contain high levels of polyphenols – groups of chemicals with potential health benefits.

Tests revealed polyphenols can cut the number of fat cells in the body by 73 per cent with a large dose and 27 per cent with the smallest dose, the American Society for Nutrition’s Experimental Biology 
 Apple a day does keep the doctor away 
 It found that women on an &apos;apple diet&apos; saw their cholesterol drop by almost a quarter in six months, while they also lost weight.

Dr Bahram Arjmandi, of the department of nutrition, food and exercise sciences at Florida University, described the results as &quot;incredible&quot; 
 

 In the study, 80 women aged 45 to 65 were asked to eat 75 grams of dried prunes a day for a year, and the other 80 were asked to eat the same amount of dried apple, in addition to their normal diets.

Blood samples were taken at the start of the study and at three, six and 12 months.  Dr Arjmandi said that &quot;incredible changes in the apple-eating women happened by 6 months- they experienced a 23 per cent decrease in LDL cholesterol, which is known as the &apos;bad cholesterol&apos;.&quot;

Best investment they ever made

This is the first case I know of where an umbilical cord was preserved for its stem cells and, in fact, saved a young girl&apos;s life.

 Cord blood stem cells used to help cure girl of brain cancer in Spain
 
 A four-year-old girl has become the first patient in Spain to recover from brain cancer after being treated with stem cells from her own umbilical cord blood.

Alba was born healthy in 2007, but at age two she was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer. Her treatment consisted of extracting the majority of the tumor from her brain. She was then given chemotherapy to reduce and eventually eliminate the remainder of the tumor.

Alba&apos;s blood system was destroyed during the final round of chemo, thus requiring a transplant of cord blood stem cells.

The procedure was carried out in 2009 by Dr. Luis Madero of the Department of Oncology and Hematology at the Nino Jesus Hospital in Madrid.

Today, four year-old Alba is a healthy girl.
--
 Alba’s father, Santiago, who is a computer engineer, and her mother, Teresa, a literature professor, agreed that keeping the blood from Alba’s umbilical cord was the “best investment” they ever made.
 
Santiago said he had previously seen a report “on the treatment for Parkinson’s using stem cells … and was sympathetic to the idea of using stem cells to treat degenerative diseases.”

 “Keeping the umbilical cord is a wager for the future, a life insurance policy that you don’t know if you will need but that could save a life,” Teresa added.

Study of a lifetime

Well worth reading. Epidemiology: Study of a lifetime 
 In 1946, scientists started tracking thousands of British children born during one cold March week. On their 65th birthday, the study members find themselves more scientifically valuable than ever before.
--
All told, the results from the 1946 birth cohort — now known as the National Survey of Health and Development and run by the Medical Research Council (MRC) — have filled 8 books and some 600 papers so far. Perhaps more than anything else, the survey has shown that early life matters — a lot. &quot;Ultimately, where you get to in early adulthood is strongly influenced by where you come from,&quot; says Michael Wadsworth, who led the study for nearly 30 years,
--
the study is lending a touch of immortality to all its participants, whether men and women, born into comfort or poverty. Traces of them will live on in preserved DNA, cell lines frozen in liquid nitrogen — and in their records, now all transferred from punch cards to computers. &quot;You&apos;re very aware that your memory is going,&quot; says Ward. &quot;But you also know that in the archive is a version of you.&quot; Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:24 AM | Permalink

Flying and not getting sick

After reading this

 In 2007, Charles P. Gerba, a professor of environmental microbiology at the University of Arizona, swabbed airplane bathrooms and tray tables on eight flights to see what bugs might be lurking onboard. Four out of six tray tables tested positive for the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and norovirus, the highly contagious group of viruses that can cause a miserable one- or two-day bout of vomiting, diarrhea and cramping, was found on one tray. Most of the bathrooms he swabbed had E. coli bacteria. Thirty percent of sinks, flush handles and faucet handles had E. coli, as did 20 percent of toilet seats, according to his research. 

I&apos;m going to take more seriously the Practical Traveler&apos;s advice How Not to Get Sick From a Flight 

Wash your hands before touching your face and before eating and drinking.  Looks like I&apos;ll be carrying one of those hand sanitizers.

UPDATE

And I&apos;m going to start using those disinfectant  wipes offered at the grocery store before using a grocery cart . 
 Gerba says 72% of the carts had a positive marker for fecal bacteria. When they examined some of the samples, they found Escherichia coli, also known as E. coli, on half of them.

Researchers say they actually found more fecal bacteria on grocery cart handles than you would typically find in a bathroom, mainly because bathrooms are disinfected more often than shopping carts.

Since most stores do not routinely wash and disinfect their carts, it&apos;s up to you to do it. Posted by Jill Fallon at 4:27 AM | Permalink

Looking for love in all the wrong places

 Dr. Sanity 
 Part of my job is dealing with chemical addictions and the addicts who have them. One definition of chemical dependency that I particularly like and have seen validated over and over again is this: &quot;Chemical dependency is essentially a committed pathological love relationship to a mood altering chemical substance.&quot;
 
I thought of that definition when I saw these photos posted by a sheriff in Portland Oregon that show more vividly than anyone can describe the destructive effects of meth. Scared straight: Drugs before and after.

&quot;Many patients can find happiness in ways that we simply cannot imagine&quot;

The human ability to adjust and be happy even with extreme disability is extraordinary and reassuring.

 Many locked-in syndrome patients happy 
 You are awake, aware and probably unable to move or talk — but you are not necessarily unhappy, says the largest study of locked-in syndrome ever conducted.

A surprising number of patients with the condition say they are happy, despite being paralyzed and having to communicate mainly by moving their eyes. Most cases are caused by major brain damage, often sustained in traumatic accidents.
---

Sixty-five patients used a scale to indicate their sense of well-being, with 47 saying they were happy and 18 unhappy. They were also asked a variety of questions about their lives, including their ability to get around or participate in social functions, or if they had ever considered euthanasia.

Only a handful of patients said they often had suicidal thoughts. The patients responded to questions largely by blinking.

Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, said of the results: &quot;We cannot and should not presume to know what it must be like to be in one of these conditions.&quot;

The Power of Napping

As a long time proponent of napping, I relished this post from the Art of Manliness. For all my jobs, I always kept a straw basket that held a mat, a blanket and a small down pillow so that I could nap under the desk when I had to.

 Unleash the Power of the Nap 

 
 But in reality, the nap stigma is incredibly misplaced. Naps can be one of the most powerful tools for self-improvement; they can increase not only our health and well-being but our intelligence and productivity as well. This is something great men have known all along. Famous thinkers and leaders like Edison, JFK, Churchill, and Napoleon were all ardent nappers. We’ll cover the specific napping habits of famous men in a future post.
 

 -- 

 While the pace of modern life may keep us from being the biphasic sleepers we were meant to be, the urge for a daytime snooze is still hardwired into our biology. Studies have shown that when people are put into an environment that lacks any indication of time, they will fall into the long sleep at night/shorter nap during the day pattern. Thus most of us are daily fighting tooth and nail against our body’s natural circadian rhythm, and this is wreaking havoc on our well-being, turning us into a horde of zombies that crave espresso instead of brains.
 
 
The authors list the benefits of napping

 Increases alertness Improves learning and working memory Prevents burnout and reverses information overload Heightens your senses and creativity Improves health Improves mood 
And then show you how to tailor your nap to your needs. Posted by Jill Fallon at 6:13 PM | Permalink 
&quot;This is not a 15-minute conversation, and it should not happen in the back of the ambulance on the way to the ICU at 3 in the morning.&quot;

 More candor urged in care of dying cancer patients 
 
 WASHINGTON – Patients don&apos;t want to hear that they&apos;re dying and doctors don&apos;t want to tell them. But new guidance for the nation&apos;s cancer specialists says they should be upfront and do it far sooner. 

 The American Society of Clinical Oncology says too often, patients aren&apos;t told about options like comfort care or even that their chemo has become futile until the bitter end. 

 To help families broach the topic, too, the group developed an easy-to-read booklet about those choices, from standard care to symptom relief, and advice about what to ask to maximize remaining time. 

 &quot;This is not a 15-minute conversation, and it should not happen in the back of the ambulance on the way to the ICU at 3 in the morning,&quot; says ASCO chief executive Dr. Allen Lichter. &quot;When everyone is well and has their wits about them, it&apos;s time to start the process.&quot; 

 The guidance and booklet — available at http://www.cancer.net — mark an unusually strong push for planning end-of-life care, in a profession that earns more from attacking tumors than from lengthy, emotional discussions about when it&apos;s time to stop. 

 &quot;This is a clarion call for oncologists . to take the lead in curtailing the use of ineffective therapy and ensuring a focus on palliative care and relief of symptoms throughout the course of illness,&quot; the guidance stresses.

Miracle Milkweed

I love it when a common weed is found to have surprising benefits, especially for people with fair skin like me who are especially prone to sun damage and all that entails as one grows older.

 Common garden weed &apos;cures skin cancer&apos; say scientists 
 
 The sap from a plant known as petty spurge or milkweed - found by roadsides and in woodland - can &apos;kill&apos; certain types of cancer cells when applied to the skin. It works on non-melanoma skin cancers, which affect hundreds of thousands of Britons each year.  They are triggered by sun damage and, although not usually fatal, can be disfiguring without treatment .
 

 ...a team of scientists in Australia has carried out a clinical study of sap from Euphorbia peplus, which is related to Euphorbia plants grown in gardens in the UK. The study of 36 patients with a total of 48 non-melanoma lesions included basal cell carcinomas (BCC), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and intraepidermal carcinomas (IEC), a growth of cancerous cells confined to the outer layer of the skin. Patients had failed to respond to conventional treatment including surgery, or they refused or were unsuitable for surgery because of their age. 

 The patients were treated once a day for three consecutive days by an oncologist using a cotton bud to apply enough of the E.peplus sap to cover the surface of each lesion. The initial results were impressive, says findings to be released this week in the British Journal of Dermatology. After only one month 41 of the 48 cancers had completely gone. Patients who had some of the lesions remaining were offered a second course of treatment. After an average of 15 months following treatment, two thirds of the 48 skin cancer lesions were still showing a complete response.

Junk Food

In Europe, researchers followed 12,000 volunteers over 6 years to analyze their diets and lifestyles.

They discovered that those who ate a lot of junk food with trans-fats, like pastries and fast food had a 48% increase in the risk of depression.

 Bad eating can give you depression .
 
 The report, published in the online journal PLoS ONE, noted the research was performed on a European population that enjoys a relatively low intake of trans-fats -- making up only 0.4 percent &quot;of the total energy ingested by the volunteers.&quot; 

 &quot;Despite this, we observed an increase in the risk of suffering depression of nearly 50 percent,&quot; said researcher Miguel Martinez. 

 &quot;On this basis we derive the importance of taking this effect into account in countries like the US, where the percentage of energy derived from these fats is around 2.5 percent.&quot; 


 --- This rise is attributable, according to the authors, &quot;to radical changes in the sources of fats consumed in Western diets, where we have substituted certain types of beneficial fats -- polyunsaturated and monounsaturated in nuts, vegetable oils and fish -- for the saturated and trans-fats found in meats, butter and other products such as mass-produced pastries and fast food.&quot;

&quot;Paternalism run amok&quot;

John Tierney in Heavy Doses of DNA Data with Few Side Effects 
 
 When companies tried selling consumers the results of personal DNA tests, worried doctors and assorted health experts rushed to the public’s rescue. What if the risk assessments were inaccurate or inconsistent? What if people misinterpreted the results and did something foolish? What if they were traumatized by learning they were at high risk for Alzheimer’s or breast cancer or another disease. 

 The what-ifs prompted New York State to ban the direct sale of the tests to consumers. Members of Congress denounced the tests as “snake oil,” and the Food and Drug Administration has recently threatened the companies with federal oversight. Members of a national advisory commission concluded that personal DNA testing needed to be carefully supervised by experts like themselves.
 

 But now, thanks to new research, there’s a less hypothetical question to consider: What if the would-be guardians of the public overestimated the demand for their supervisory services? 
 

 -- 

 “Up until now there’s been lots of speculation and what I’d call fear-mongering about the impact of these tests, but now we have data,” says Dr. Eric Topol, the senior author of a report published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine. “ We saw no evidence of anxiety or distress induced by the tests.”
 

 -- 

 That may be the self-empowered future, but for now residents of New York still can’t be trusted to buy these tests directly. I t’s paternalism run amok , says Lee Silver, a professor of molecular biology and of public policy at Princeton, who is developing another variety of genetic test for consumers. “It seems like a no-brainer,” Dr. Silver says, “t hat any competent adult should be free to purchase an analysis of their own DNA as long as they have been informed in advance of what could potentially be revealed in the analysis. You should have access to information about your own genome without a permission slip from your doctor.”

Drink up

Cheers.

 

 Study: Abstaining from alcohol significantly shortens life 

 
 A newly released study shows that regular drinkers are less likely to die prematurely than people who have never indulged in alcohol. You read that right: Time reports that abstaining from alcohol altogether can lead to a shorter life than consistent, moderate drinking. 

 Surprised? The tightly controlled study, which looked at individuals between ages 55 and 65, spanned a 20-year period and accounted for variables ranging from socioeconomic status to level of physical activity. Led by psychologist Charles Holahan of the University of Texas at Austin, it found that mortality rates were highest for those who had never had a sip, lower for heavy drinkers, and lowest for moderate drinkers who enjoyed one to three drinks per day. 


 -- A possible explanation for this is that alcohol can be a great social lubricant, and strong social networks are essential for maintaining mental and physical health. Nondrinkers have been shown to demonstrate greater signs of depression than their carousing counterparts, and in addition to the potential heart health and circulation benefits of moderate drinking (especially red wine), it also increases sociability.

An &apos;elaborate fraud&apos;

 Retracted autism study an &apos;elaborate fraud,&apos; British journal finds 
 
 A now-retracted British study that linked autism to childhood vaccines was an &quot;elaborate fraud&quot; that has done long-lasting damage to public health, a leading medical publication reported Wednesday.
 

 An investigation published by the British medical journal BMJ concludes the study&apos;s author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study -- and that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; Wakefield was responsible. 

 &quot;It&apos;s one thing to have a bad study, a study full of error, and for the authors then to admit that they made errors,&quot; Fiona Godlee, BMJ&apos;s editor-in-chief, told CNN. &quot;But in this case, we have a very different picture of what seems to be a deliberate attempt to create an impression that there was a link by falsifying the data .&quot;

Liquid Biopsy

This is a big deal

 Blood test to spot cancer gets big boost - Johnson and Johnson announce plans to bring &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; to market

 
 BOSTON — A blood test so sensitive that it can spot a single cancer cell lurking among a billion healthy ones is moving one step closer to being available at your doctor&apos;s office.
 

 Boston scientists who invented the test and health care giant Johnson&amp;Johnson will announce Monday that they are joining forces to bring it to market. Four big cancer centers also will start studies using the experimental test this year. 

 Stray cancer cells in the blood mean that a tumor has spread or is likely to, many doctors believe. A test that can capture such cells has the potential to transform care for many types of cancer, especially breast, prostate, colon and lung.

Alzheimer&apos;s is like a clogged drain

 Insights Give Hope for New Attack on Alzheimer&apos;s 
 
 The first sign the disease is developing — before there are any symptoms — is a buildup of amyloid. And for years, it seemed, the problem in Alzheimer’s was that brain cells were making too much of it. 

 But now, a surprising new study has found that that view appears to be wrong. It turns out that most people with Alzheimer’s seem to make perfectly normal amounts of amyloid. They just can’t get rid of it. It’s like an overflowing sink caused by a clogged drain instead of a faucet that does not turn off.

Fountain of youth?

Is lenalidomide the fountain of youth?

 Eureka! Now scientists discover the drug that could give you a longer and healthier life 
 
 Until now it has merely been the stuff of fairy tales and science fiction.
 

 But a ‘fountain of youth’ drug which could help pensioners stay fit and healthy long into old age has been unveiled by doctors. 

 In tests, tiny amounts of the drug lenalidomide massively boosted immune system chemicals key to fighting off invaders from bugs to tumours. 

 Concentrations of one of the protective compounds rose more than 100-fold. 

 ---And the minuscule amounts of the drug needed mean that treatment is likely to be side-effect free, the doctors behind the breakthrough believe.

Face-blind

 The Economist interviews Oliver Sachs who is face-blind and writes that 2.5% of the population is like him, suffering from prosopagnosia.
 
 One can react and respond in all sorts of different ways to blindness. Some people will avoid embarrassment and confusion and all social contact. Others will become extremely attentive to matters of dress and movement and voice, so much so that they become tuned automatically to how people are dressed and how they move. For my part I think I’m good at recognising posture and movement. I’m a little bit on the reticent side—that’s a primary characteristic of face blindness. People should perhaps &quot;out&quot; themselves. In the book I tell a story where a man goes to a physician and says he can&apos;t recognise people, and so his life has become &quot;a round of apology and offence&quot;. The matter must be aired. If people know you&apos;re face blind you don&apos;t have to apologise.

Aspirin the Wonder Drug

My mother used to call aspirin &quot;the wonder drug&quot; because it worked so effectively and nobody really knew how. All they knew was this extract from willow bark reduced fever and treated pain.

Aspirin, acetyl salicylic acid, we learned prevents strokes and heart attacks. Now new studies show that Daily aspirin &apos;can cut cancer death rate by 50 per cent&apos; 
 The study has led to the 100-year-old painkiller – costing just 1p a tablet – being hailed as ‘the most amazing drug in the world’. Experts say healthy middle-aged people who start taking low-dose aspirin around the age of 45 or 50 for 20 to 30 years could expect to reap the most benefit, because cancer rates rise with age. 
 The study, published in The Lancet medical journal, looked at eight trials where heart patients were allocated daily aspirin or dummy treatment for five years. 

 
The heart benefits had already been reported – this time the researchers wanted to discover what happened to death rates from cancer. They found dramatic results, with aspirin linked to fewer deaths from a host of cancers. 

 
After five years of taking aspirin, death rates fell by 34 per cent for all cancers and 54 per cent for gastrointestinal cancers.
 
 
 

 Aspirin was the trade name registered in 1899 by the German Company Bayer, but, a s part of the war reparations specified in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles , it lost its status as a registered trademark in France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Schizophrenia the result of a virus?

Could schizophrenia be caused by a virus? A tantalizing thesis explored in The Insanity Virus by Douglas Fox in Discover Magazine

 Schizophrenia has long been blamed on bad genes or even bad parents. Wrong, says a growing group of psychiatrists. The real culprit, they claim, is a virus that lives entwined in every person&apos;s DNA. 
 
 The facts of schizophrenia are so peculiar, in fact, that they have led Torrey and a growing number of other scientists to abandon the traditional explanations of the disease and embrace a startling alternative. Schizophrenia, they say, does not begin as a psychological disease. Schizophrenia begins with an infection. 

 The idea has sparked skepticism, but after decades of hunting, Torrey and his colleagues think they have finally found the infectious agent. You might call it an insanity virus. If Torrey is right, the culprit that triggers a lifetime of hallucinations—that tore apart the lives of writer Jack Kerouac, mathematician John Nash, and millions of others—is a virus that all of us carry in our bodies. “Some people laugh about the infection hypothesis,” says Urs Meyer , a neuroimmunologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “But the impact that it has on researchers is much, much, much more than it was five years ago. And my prediction would be that it will gain even more impact in the future.”

Don&apos;t be upset about your moles
 People with more skin moles have less risk of bone disease and they look younger. You know, like Cindy Crawford
 Most people have somewhere between 30 and 40 moles on their bodies, but some have hundreds. According to the research, the more moles you have, the less wrinkles and blemishes. Another study showed that the mole-heavy were also less susceptible to osteoporosis and other bone problems associated with aging: People with over 100 moles got osteoporosis half as often as those with less than 25. 
 Researcher Dr. Veronique Bataille believes that an abundance of moles is an indicator of a factor to do with an individual’s DNA code. People with many moles have longer telomeres – a section of the DNA strand that determines how many times a cell will divide over its lifetime. The longer the telomeres, the more moles someone will have – and, the more youthful the appearance.

Children in the War Against Dementia

A moving story that illuminates and chills, Children Ease Alzheimer&apos;s in Land of Aging because it&apos;s a glimpse into our future.
 
 It is part of a remarkable South Korean campaign to cope with an exploding problem: Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. As one of the world’s fastest-aging countries, with nearly 9 percent of its population over 65 already afflicted, South Korea has opened a “War on Dementia,” spending money and shining floodlights on a disease that is, here as in many places, riddled with shame and fear. 

 South Korea is training thousands of people, including children, as “dementia supporters,” to recognize symptoms and care for patients. ---- 

 Hundreds of neighborhood dementia diagnostic centers have been created. Nursing homes have nearly tripled since 2008. Other dementia programs, providing day care and home care, have increased fivefold since 2008, to nearly 20,000. Care is heavily subsidized. 

 And a government dementia database allows families to register relatives and receive iron-on identification numbers. Citizens encountering wanderers with dementia report their numbers to officials, who contact families. 

 So the authorities promote the notion that filial piety implies doing everything possible for elders with dementia, a condition now called chimae (pronounced chee-may): disease of knowledge and the brain which makes adults become babies. But South Korea’s low birth rate will make family caregiving tougher. 

 “I feel as if a tsunami’s coming,” said Lee Sung-hee, the South Korean Alzheimer’s Association president, who trains nursing home staff members, but also thousands who regularly interact with the elderly: bus drivers, tellers, hairstylists, postal workers. “Sometimes I think I want to run away,” she said. “But even the highest mountain, just worrying does not move anything, but if you choose one area and move stone by stone, you pave a way to move the whole mountain.” 

 -- 

 The dementia caregiving program had made him “wonder why I wasn’t able to do that with my own grandma, and I think I should do better in the future to compensate for all my wrongdoing,” he said. “I could have taken care of my grandmother with a grateful feeling. If only I could have.”

Surgery dramatically lowers blood pressure

 New Surgery Drops Blood Pressure 30% 
 
 A new surgical technique can lower blood pressure by up to 30% by destroying tiny nerves in the arteries leading to the kidneys. These nerves regulate blood supply, but can be overactive in some patients, dangerously boosting blood pressure. This new procedure inserts a small probe through a catheter in the renal arteries and produces heat sufficient to kill off the nerves. 

 The surgery can be completed in about 40 to 60 minutes and only requires an overnight stay in the hospital. Only 10% of patients were unresponsive to treatment, according to research being published in The Lancet, compared to almost 50% who are unresponsive to traditional blood pressure medications. Furthermore, meds often only reduce blood pressure by 10%, making the new method almost three times better. 

 
 
 
 From MIT&apos;s Technology Review 
 

 
 


 
 A California company has shown how to dramatically lower blood pressure in hard-to-treat patients by destroying tiny nerves in the kidney. 

 The nerves are located inside the main arteries leading to the kidney. They affect blood pressure by controlling the release of sodium and an enzyme called renin, and by managing blood flow from the kidneys themselves. 

 The procedure was developed by Ardian , a medical device company based in Mountain View, California. Previous studies have shown that these nerves are overactive in many people with high blood pressure, says Murray Esler , who led the new research. By destroying these nerves in about 50 people, Esler could reduce those patients&apos; uncontrolled high blood pressure by nearly 30 percent. A study describing the work was presented today at the American Heart Association, and the work is published in The Lancet .

Why that annoying spare tire may save your life

Good news if you have a &apos;spare tire&apos; around your middle because stem cells taken from the fat around your waistline may be just the treatment you need when you get your first heart attack.
 
&apos;Spare tire&apos; could save lives: belly fat helped heart attack patients 
 Stem cells taken from waistline fat could be used as a treatment for heart attacks.

Scientists injected stem cells derived from waistline fat tissue into the hearts of coronary patients and found the cells reduced levels of damage, increased blood flow and improved the organs&apos; pumping ability.

Eleven men and three women who had suffered recent heart attacks took part in the pioneering pilot study, given the name Apollo.

Ten patients were treated with stem cells while four received a dummy &apos;placebo&apos; infusion.

Liposuction - a cosmetic procedure commonly used to reduce people&apos;s waistlines - was used to remove up to 250 cubic centimetres of fat from the patients&apos; bellies.

From each sample, the researchers isolated and extracted 20 million adult stem cells - regenerative cells with the potential to become more than one kind of tissue.

It took nine to ten minutes to infuse the stem cells into a patient&apos;s heart.

Six months later members of the treated group showed a 3.5 per cent improvement in heart perfusion, the heart&apos;s ability to receive oxygenated blood.

Compared with the placebo patients, they also experienced a 5.7 per cent increase in the amount of blood pumped out by the heart&apos;s left ventricle chamber.

On average, the amount of damaged heart muscle in the treated patients was halved from 31.6 per cent to 15.4 per cent. In the non-treated group, levels of heart damage remained the same. 
A follow up trial will recruit 375 patients from around Europe

The &quot;Anti-bone trifecta&quot;

The childhood disease rickets is a softening of the bones that can lead to fractures and deformity.  The predominant cause is vitamin D deficiency.  Famine in developing countries often results in severe malnutrition of young children leading to rickets.  When you see a child with bowed legs, the child probably has rickets.

 

In most cases, rickets is easily cured with milk, sunshine and exercise.  In the absence of vitamin D, either from sunshine or from supplements, calcium can not be absorbed by the body.

Rickets was a scourge in the 19th century when young children were sent to work long days in factories and now it looks as if it will be a scourge in the 21st century as well.

 Too little milk, sunshine and exercise: It&apos;s an anti-bone trifecta.
 
 But cases of full-blown rickets are just the red flag: Bone specialists say possibly millions of seemingly healthy children aren&apos;t building as much strong bone as they should - a gap that may leave them more vulnerable to bone-cracking osteoporosis later in life than their grandparents are.

&quot;This potentially is a time-bomb,&quot; says Dr. Laura Tosi, bone health chief at Children&apos;s National Medical Center in Washington. 
 In England, middle class children are suffering rickets as parents cover them in sunscreen and limit time outside in sunshine
 It is thought extensive use of sunscreen, children playing more time on computer games and TV rather than playing outside and a poor diet are to blame.
 
Professor Nicholas Clarke, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton General Hospital and professor of paediatric orthopaedic surgery at the University of Southampton, said
 “We are facing the daunting prospect of an area like Southampton, where it is high income, middle class and leafy in its surroundings, seeing increasing numbers of children with rickets, which would have been inconceivable only a year or so ago. ”

 
 Nutritional ignorance in the US among middle-class families is also leading to rickets according to a professor of pediatrics. Parents on vegetarian diets mistakenly believe that their child is allergic to milk and switch to soy-based or rice-based drinks.
 &quot;Soy and rice beverages may look like cow&apos;s milk, but these products may not contain the amount of calcium and vitamin D that&apos;s needed for proper growth and development,&quot; Posted by Jill Fallon at 3:47 PM | Permalink

Skin into blood and dangerous popcorn

A quick round-up on health and medical news this week.

Very good news on the medical front as Scientists Turn Skin Cells Directly into Blood Cells. 
 In an important breakthrough, scientists at McMaster University have discovered how to make human blood from adult human skin.

The discovery, published Nov. 7 in the journal Nature, could mean that in the foreseeable future people needing blood for surgery, cancer treatment or treatment of other blood conditions like anemia will be able to have blood created from a patch of their own skin to provide transfusions. Clinical trials could begin as soon as 2012.
--

The discovery was replicated several times over two years using human skin from both young and old people to prove it works for any age of person. 
The potential of this discovery is enormous.  In 5 years time, we may be donating patches of our own skin before surgery or treatment of cancer.

 Those convenient popcorn bags that you can just pop into the microwave are popping out dangerous chemicals

 
 University of Toronto scientists have found that many paper food packages, like microwave popcorn bags, are popping dangerous chemicals into the products they contain.

And significant levels of those chemicals and the products they break down into are now in human blood, the study’s co-author says.

“We found these food contact paper chemicals in human blood in high concentrations,” says Scott Mabury, an environmental chemist at the U of T.

Indeed, he says that a large portion of the so-called Perfluorinated carboxylic acids — or PFCAs that have been worrying doctors and global regulatory agencies for a decade likely come from paper junk food wrappers.

“The normal example is popcorn bags and pizza boxes, but the fact of the matter is it’s much more widespread than that,” says Mabury.

“Many, many papers that are used in the food packaging industry contain these (chemicals).” 
The best course of action is to take frozen food out of its wrappers and cover with paper towels before microwaving.

As for popcorn, it tastes much better if you use a popcorn popper.

&quot;Taking insurance companies out of the mix of routine services&quot;

C. Edmund Wright lowered his health care costs for himself and his family and his premium went down 11%.

 Health Care 101: How We Lowered Our Costs 
 Now I am not an Ivy League grad; nonetheless, I figured out how to dramatically lower my health care costs two years in a row. And by costs, I mean both insurance premiums and overall expenditures for health care -- without sacrificing anything.

In other words, I have succeeded in &quot;bending down the cost curve&quot; for our family.

Moreover, I submit that this case study -- of my rather typical family of five -- is a valid microcosm of how our country can address most of our nation&apos;s health care cost issues. And again, it is by doing the very opposite of what our government is trying to force down our collective throats.
--
And this is something that almost everyone could do. It is common sense and not hard to understand. By taking insurance companies out of the mix of routine services, we have reduced the cost of routine services -- and saved a ton of money on the insurance premiums. The bureaucratic involvement in every transaction is a huge cost that no one seems to calculate when trying to reduce costs.
 
In fact, ObamaCare infuses even more bureaucratic involvement in every aspect of our life. How can this possibly work? It cannot, of course, not to mention the fact that it is offensive and totalitarian.

Medical Reversals and Bad Science

A Greek mathematical genius, who is also an American-trained physician,  becomes a &quot;meta-researcher&quot; and discovers that much of medical research is &quot;misleading, exaggerated or flat-out wrong&quot;.

 

Described as &quot; neat and compact 45-year-old with a trim mustache, he presents as a sort of dashing nerd—Giancarlo Giannini with a bit of Mr. Bean&quot;, Professor John Ioannidis is profiled by David Freedman in the Atlantic, Lies, Damned Lies and Medical Science 
 In poring over medical journals, he was struck by how many findings of all types were refuted by later findings. Of course, medical-science “never minds” are hardly secret. And they sometimes make headlines, as when in recent years large studies or growing consensuses of researchers concluded that mammograms, colonoscopies, and PSA tests are far less useful cancer-detection tools than we had been told; or when widely prescribed antidepressants such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil were revealed to be no more effective than a placebo for most cases of depression; or when we learned that staying out of the sun entirely can actually increase cancer risks; or when we were told that the advice to drink lots of water during intense exercise was potentially fatal; or when, last April, we were informed that taking fish oil, exercising, and doing puzzles doesn’t really help fend off Alzheimer’s disease, as long claimed. Peer-reviewed studies have come to opposite conclusions on whether using cell phones can cause brain cancer, whether sleeping more than eight hours a night is healthful or dangerous, whether taking aspirin every day is more likely to save your life or cut it short, and whether routine angioplasty works better than pills to unclog heart arteries.
--

Ioannidis laid out a detailed mathematical proof that, assuming modest levels of researcher bias, typically imperfect research techniques, and the well-known tendency to focus on exciting rather than highly plausible theories, researchers will come up with wrong findings most of the time.
 
--
He zoomed in on 49 of the most highly regarded research findings in medicine over the previous 13 years -- that helped lead to the widespread popularity of treatments such as the use of hormone-replacement therapy for menopausal women, vitamin E to reduce the risk of heart disease, coronary stents to ward off heart attacks, and daily low-dose aspirin to control blood pressure and prevent heart attacks and strokes -- thirty-four of these claims had been retested, and 14 of these, or 41 percent, had been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated. If between a third and a half of the most acclaimed research in medicine was proving untrustworthy, the scope and impact of the problem were undeniable.
 --
We could solve much of the wrongness problem, Ioannidis says, if the world simply stopped expecting scientists to be right. That’s because being wrong in science is fine, and even necessary—as long as scientists recognize that they blew it, report their mistake openly instead of disguising it as a success, and then move on to the next thing, until they come up with the very occasional genuine breakthrough. But as long as careers remain contingent on producing a stream of research that’s dressed up to seem more right than it is, scientists will keep delivering exactly that.

Stupendous medical achievement

What a stupendous achievement this is.

 Boy Born Without Ears Receives Gift of Sound 
 Diego Neumaier Ortiz, a 12-year-old boy from Puebla, Mexico, was born with a condition called microtia, which left his ears almost completely undeveloped. Even with a hearing aid, sound was almost completely muffled for the young boy.

So Diego threw himself into a sport where he didn’t need to be conscious of his teammates’ calls: gymnastics. He learned to master the arts of vaulting, balance bars, and backflips. Recently, he became the junior gymnastics champion in all of Mexico. A visiting American doctor was watching from the bleachers, amazed by the child’s skill. He also noticed that Diego was deaf—and thought that something could be done to fix that.

The doctor contacted a well-known specialist in ear reconstruction, Dr. John Reinisch. He offered to take Diego’s complicated case for no charge.

In the operation, Dr. Reinisch and another surgeon, Dr. Joseph Roberson, created an outer ear for cosmetic purposes, then drilled a hole to access the inner ear and build an ear canal. The operation took nine hours, and the ear would require two weeks to heal.

When the doctors finally pulled back the gauze on Diego’s new ear, his mother praised the good work they had done. That was the first time Diego had heard her voice.

In return for the gift of hearing, Diego presented the doctors with a present of his own: his championship medals for his gymnastics wins.

“I don’t have anything to give them, but this is so valuable to me,” Diego told CBS. “I want to give them to Dr. Reinisch, because he is giving me something greater: two ears.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 7:19 PM | Permalink

Trauma Surgeon

It&apos;s astonishing to contemplate how much we depend on people we do not know.  Trauma surgeons  are a good example.    Imagine working 100 hours a week for 20 years in the midst of &quot;blood, guts, death and chaos&quot; with such responsibility for the lives of so many people.

 A night in a Detroit trauma ward 
 My old friend from journalism school Charlie LeDuff, who writes for the Detroit News, spent the night hanging around one of the city hospital&apos;s trauma wards. His host was chief surgeon Dr. Pat Patton, 46. Among patients with stab and gunshot wounds, Charlie gains some insight into the consequences of a crap economy, health insurance, and a routine evening for a surgeon who has regularly worked 100 hours per week in the ward... for the last twenty years.

From the Detroit News :
 The trauma surgeon — perhaps the most knowledgeable about the workings of the entire human body — is considered something of a butcher among the cutting class: a brute who is the jack of all trades, the master of none. A general surgeon like Patton may not understand the intricacies of neurosurgery, but he is able to cobble together the shattered pieces of a gunshot victim in a late-night marathon of surgery.

Patton’s most important tool appears to be his right index finger. That digit acts as his probe, his periscope, his divining rod, his cork. He can remember on more than one occasion saving the life of a gunshot victim who arrived at the hospital in the back of a sedan. He simply plugged the hole with his finger. 
Hats off for Dr. Patton.

In fighting colds, &quot;The enemy is us&quot;

 How Not to Fight Colds 
 if you’re keen on tamping down your own cold, “boosting” your immunity may be the last thing you want to do.
---
Here was a new insight in cold science: the symptoms are caused not by the virus but by its host — by the body’s inflammatory response. Chemical agents manufactured by our immune system inflame our cells and tissues, causing our nose to run and our throat to swell. The enemy is us.
--
It seems counterintuitive, but there it is: People with more active immune systems may be especially prone to cold symptoms. So getting a cold may be a positive sign that your biochemical defenses are working normally — a glass-half-full view of getting the sniffles. Posted by Jill Fallon at 12:33 AM | Permalink

The First Miracle Drug

 Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug 
 Every few months some miracle drug or other is rolled out with bells and confetti, but only once or twice in a generation does the real thing come along....

the birth of the first one is almost forgotten. It was injectable insulin, long sought by researchers all over the world and finally isolated in 1921 by a team of squabbling Canadians. With insulin, dying children laughed and played again, as parents wept and doctors spoke of biblical resurrections.

--
But the miracle went only so far: insulin was not a cure. In 1921, New York City’s death rate from diabetes was estimated to be the highest in the country, and today the health department lists diabetes among the city’s top five killers. Now though, it is adults who die, not children. What insulin did was turn a brief, deadly illness into a long, chronic struggle, 
 

Via Instapundit who commented 
 The Insta-Wife’s great grandmother died of diabetes just a few months before insulin came out. A reminder that for every miracle drug, there’s a “faster, please.” 
 
The real struggle came after the discovery - producing the drug and getting it from here to there.
 Meanwhile, the notion of allowing patients to test their own urine for glucose and calculate their own insulin doses was outlandish to most doctors. Diabetes was the first illness which forced them to cede some medical authority to the patient, said Jean Ashton, one of the exhibit’s curators. With insulin, diabetics suddenly acquired both the right and the responsibility to maintain their own health. 
The author of the piece, Abigail Zuger MD, tells the story of little Elizabeth Hughes, the daughter of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Charles Evan Hughes, very sick and frail who survived long enough to be one of the first Americans to take the new drug.
 The few dozen of her letters that survive from her six-month stay in Toronto, as she exuberantly regained health and strength, emphasize how desperately she wanted to stop being a patient forever.

It was a great day when she injected herself with insulin for the first time: “I can do it perfectly beautifully,” she wrote to her mother. “Now I feel so absolutely independent.” Posted by Jill Fallon at 4:42 PM | Permalink

Bad news about synthetic hormones

Now they tell us.

 Women&apos;s Brains on Steroids: Birth control pills appear to remodel brain structure 
 here are millions of cases of steroid use that occur daily with barely a second thought:  Millions of women take birth control pills, blithely unaware that their effects may be subtly seeping into and modulating brain structure and activity.

It is a huge experiment whose resolution will not be known for a while, but a new study in the journal Brain Research demonstrates that the effects are likely to be dramatic.  It found that birth control pills have structural effects on regions of the brain that govern higher-order cognitive activities, suggesting that a woman on birth control pills may literally not be herself -- or is herself, on steroids.
--
What happens, then, when the female brain gets a significant and artificial dose of steroid hormone, either progesterone, estrogen or both?  We know what happens below the waist, the pregnancies prevented.  What happens above the neck, as this steroidal tsunami washes over the neural coastline?

It appears that the brain, that sensitive organ replete with steroid receptors, reacts to its hormonal milieu with startling structural modifications 
Scientific American also reported that Birth Control Pills Affect Women&apos;s Taste in Men .
 
 Women on the pill are developing differently than nature intended and choosing mates they otherwise would not have chosen. 

 With little research on the long term effects, millions and millions of women have taken hormones for decades, but the evidence of the consequences is beginning to appear.

We&apos;ve already learned that post-menopausal women should stop taking hormones .
 &quot;An awful lot of breast cancer was caused by doctors&apos; prescriptions,&quot; said Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. 
More and more evidence is revealing the disastrous effects of synthetic hormones in our water supply that has led to deformed wildlife and the alarming rise in male infertility.  But, despite the evidence, there is almost total denial. The pill is sacrosanct, the sacred cow of the sexual revolution.

Save a Life

A new form of CPR - Continuous Chest Compression - can double a person&apos;s chances of survival who collapses from sudden cardiac arrest.

It&apos;s easier to learn, easier to perform and more effective than traditional CPR that recommended rescue breathing.

Continuous Chest Compression does not require certification or mouth-to-mouth and because of Good Samaritan laws in, I think, every state, you are not at legal risk.

Who knows?  Someday you may be in a position to save someone&apos;s life.  Watch and learn how to do it in this six-minute video.

&apos;Zero tolerance&apos; for dissent

‘&quot;There will be zero tolerance for this type of misinformation and unjustified rate increases.” said Kathleen Sibelius, Secretary, objecting to the claims by health insurers that increased costs imposed by Obamacare will force them to raise premiums.  Then she went on to threaten them, “We will also keep track of insurers with a record of unjustified rate increases: those plans may be excluded from health insurance Exchanges in 2014.”

Now I&apos;m not looking forward to premium increases any more than you are, but I was startled and then outraged that any public official would dare say such a thing.

Michael Barone calls it &quot;Gangster Government going after Obamacare critics&quot; 
 ”Congress shall make no law,” reads the First Amendment, “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”

Sebelius’s approach is different: “zero tolerance” for dissent.

The threat to use government regulation to destroy or harm a business because the owners disagree with government officials is thuggery. Like the Obama administration’s transfer of money from Chrysler bondholders to its political allies in the United Auto Workers, it is a form of gangster government. 
This is deeply alarming abuse of power.  From the Morning Bell of the Heritage Foundation
 Never before in the history of our republican form of government has an administration threatened to extinguish individual firms for merely communicating with their customers. But such are the dictatorial powers Obamacare grants to Secretary Sebelius. There are over 1,000 instances in the more than 2,700 page bill where Congress granted Secretary Sebelius new powers to regulate the health care industry. For example, her power to “determine” what does or does not count as a medical expense alone will decide the fate of many health insurance firms. 
In Get Ready for Your Health Care &apos;Re-Education&apos; we learn about some of the new requirements of the law placed on all insurers.

Under ObamaCare, insurers must now offer dozens of services for “free,” including various forms of cancer screening, vaccinations, and AIDS testing. But of course, there’s no such thing as a free lunch — instead the costs must be shifted to other customers. Hence, many insurers have started raising their rates, explaining that it is due to these new regulations.

But, according to Secretary Sibelius, they can&apos;t say a word about it or the power of the federal government will destroy their business.

Thuggish indeed.

Vitamin B stops memory loss

 10p pill to beat Alzheimer&apos;s disease: Vitamin B halts memory loss in breakthrough British trial 
 A simple vitamin pill could prevent millions from suffering the agony of Alzheimer&apos;s.

The tablet, costing as little as 10p a day and made up of three vitamin B supplements, cut brain shrinkage linked to memory loss by up to 500 per cent.

Oxford University researchers behind the landmark study said it offered the &apos;first glimmer of hope&apos; in the battle to find a drug that slows or stops the development of Alzheimer&apos;s. 
10p is about 16 cents.
 Professor David Smith, one of the study leaders, said: &apos;This is a very striking, dramatic result. It is our hope this simple and safe treatment will delay the development of Alzheimer&apos;s in many who suffer from mild memory problems.&apos;

Co-researcher Professor Helga Refsum added: &apos;Here we have a very simple solution: you give some vitamins and you seem to protect the brain.&apos; 
It will take about 5 years for all the drug trials to take place but Professor Smith said he
 would not hesitate’ to take the cocktail of 20mg of vitamin B6, 0.8mg of vitamin B9, or folate, and 0.5mg of vitamin B12, himself, if he were diagnosed with MCI.

The Alzheimer’s Research Trust, which part-funded the study, said that delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years could halve the number of those who die with the condition. Posted by Jill Fallon at 9:39 PM | Permalink

Tai Chi


 

 Tai Chi Reported to Ease Fibromyalgia 
 
 The ancient Chinese practice of tai chi may be effective as a therapy for fibromyalgia , according to a study published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine . 


 A clinical trial at Tufts Medical Center found that after 12 weeks of tai chi, patients with fibromyalgia , a chronic pain condition, did significantly better in measurements of pain, fatigue, physical functioning, sleeplessness and depression than a comparable group given stretching exercises and wellness education. Tai chi patients were also more likely to sustain improvement three months later. 

 “It’s an impressive finding, ” said Dr. Daniel Solomon, chief of clinical research in rheumatology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “ This was a well-done study. It was kind of amazing that the effects seem to carry over.” 
 Best of all, you can do Tai Chi no matter what your age. I know in my town, they offer free classes to seniors. Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:46 AM | Permalink

Good news on the melanoma front
Having lost someone to metastatic melanoma, I always pay attention to advances in treatment and I think this is very good news indeed.

 New drug shrinks many advanced melanomas: study 

 
 An experimental therapy that targets the protein that feeds certain types of advanced skin cancer has successfully shrunk tumors in up to 80 percent of test patients, a study has indicated. 

 The orally-administered medication, called PLX4032, &quot;shuts off&quot; tumors by neutralizing a mutated gene called &quot;BRAF&quot; that feeds the cancerous growths. 

 &quot;We have never seen an 80 percent response rate in melanoma, or in any other solid tumor for that matter, so this is remarkable,&quot; said Paul Chapman, senior author of the study and a doctor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 

 &quot;Metastatic melanoma has a devastating prognosis and is one of the top causes of cancer death in young patients,&quot; said Keith Flaherty of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and a lead author. 

 &quot;Until now, available therapies were few and unreliable, so these findings can really change the outlook for patients whose tumors are fueled by this mutation.&quot; 

 The study, published in the August 26 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, grew out of the discovery that BRAF mutations, which occur in roughly half of patients with melanomas, effectively feed and grow the tumors.

AA: The Power of the Group

 From Wired, Secret of AA: After 75 Years, We Don’t Know How It Works 
 
 “Doesn’t matter how much snow we get—a foot, 10 feet piled up in front of the door,” he says. “I will leave my apartment tomorrow and go find a meeting.” 

 He clasps his hands together and draws them to his heart: “You understand me? I need this.” Daily meetings, the man says, are all that prevent him from winding up dead in the gutter, shoes gone because he sold them for booze or crack. And he hasn’t had a drink in more than a decade. 

 The resolve is striking, though not entirely surprising. AA has been inspiring this sort of ardent devotion for 75 years . 

 ------ It’s all quite an achievement for a onetime broken-down drunk. And Wilson’s success is even more impressive when you consider that AA and its steps have become ubiquitous despite the fact that no one is quite sure how—or, for that matter, how well—they work. The organization is notoriously difficult to study, thanks to its insistence on anonymity and its fluid membership. And AA’s method, which requires “surrender” to a vaguely defined “higher power,” involves the kind of spiritual revelations that neuroscientists have only begun to explore. 



 What we do know, however, is that despite all we’ve learned over the past few decades about psychology, neurology, and human behavior, contemporary medicine has yet to devise anything that works markedly better. “In my 20 years of treating addicts, I’ve never seen anything else that comes close to the 12 steps,” says Drew Pinsky, the addiction-medicine specialist who hosts VH1’s Celebrity Rehab . “In my world, if someone says they don’t want to do the 12 steps, I know they aren’t going to get better.” 

 ------ One thing is certain, though: AA doesn’t work for everybody. In fact, it doesn’t work for the vast majority of people who try it. And understanding more about who it does help, and why, is likely our best shot at finally developing a system that improves on Wilson’s amateur scheme for living without the bottle. 

 ___There’s no doubt that when AA works, it can be transformative. But what aspect of the program deserves most of the credit? Is it the act of surrendering to a higher power? The making of amends to people a drinker has wronged? The simple admission that you have a problem? Stunningly, even the most highly regarded AA experts have no idea.
 

 

 There is evidence that a big part of AA’s effectiveness may have nothing to do with the actual steps. It may derive from something more fundamental: the power of the group.... after a review of nearly 200 articles on group therapy, a pair of Stanford University researchers pinpointed why the approach works so well: “Members find the group to be a compelling emotional experience; they develop close bonds with the other members and are deeply influenced by their acceptance and feedback.”

Health care better in church-run hospitals


 U.S. church-run hospitals provide higher quality care — Thomson Reuters study 

 Catholic and other church-owned systems are significantly more likely to provide higher quality performance and efficiency to the communities served than investor-owned systems, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis of the quality performance of 255 health systems in the United States.

Catholic health systems are also significantly more likely to provide higher quality performance to the communities served than secular not-for-profit health systems, it said. By contrast, investor-owned systems have significantly lower performance than all other groups.
 
That&apos;s no surprise to me. People who work in a church-run hospital are far more likely to be religious and see their vocation, not only as a way to serve the sick but also a way to serve God. Not by chance do many of elderly Jews I know of reside in Catholic nursing homes. &quot;They get the best care there,&quot; says a Jewish friend, &quot;Care that is motivated by love.&quot;

 Daniel Burke writes about the stud y in the Huffington Post

 The report was short on specific reasons for religious hospitals&apos; success, saying that further study will be required to understand the differences. The performance measures included mortality rates, the number of medical complications, readmission rates, lengths of stay, profitability, and other factors.

The Catholic church in the U.S. runs 624 hospitals and 499 long-term health care facilities, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

&quot;When your mission is rooted in Jesus who healed the sick, only top quality care will do,&quot; said Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the U.S. bishops. &quot;This study confirms what many take for granted. The church leads in providing quality health care efficiently.&quot; Posted by Jill Fallon at 11:07 AM | Permalink

Learning about Medicare

In a short time, I will qualify for Medicare and here are some things I am learning that does not make me feel confident.

 1. Medicare is going broke even faster than we thought. 
In an unprecedented dissent, the chief actuary of Medicare rejects the rosy projections from the 2010 Medicare Trustees Report.
 
He couldn&apos;t,  in good conscience, sign the report, so he issued an alternative memo.

 The Deadly Pact: How Obamacare will &apos;save&apos; money 

. ...To clarify, t he above provision gives the Health Secretary the discretion to remove life-extending treatment from the reach of seniors and place them in state wards for the purposes of making the &quot;transition&quot; to death as painless as possible. This &quot;transition&quot; can be activated for virtually any reason, including &quot;a history of multiple readmissions&quot; or &quot;risk factor.&quot; Both of these qualifiers describe more than half the country, making this provision a transparent attempt by government to cut costs by forcibly cutting lives short.

It will be a while before I look for a new gym

I cancelled my gym membership a few months back when my favorite yoga teacher, Michael Preston, a politically incorrect fifty-year-old male who not only understood what aging bodies could do and couldn&apos;t do and made laugh at once in every session, moved away.    With him gone, the gym just seemed boring and  I just go very much once Spring arrived and I could begin working in my garden and taking long walks.

Just as well after reading in the New York Times the ease with which, even at the best gyms, one can pick up serious skin diseases and irritating, even horrific, infections.      In sum, one in three people have a skin disease that is communicable.

The advice one athletic trainer and co-author of the report gives may be good advice, but it sure takes the steam out of any desire I might have had to find a new gym.

 If you plan to work out in a gym or use a locker room, Mr. Foley suggested that before choosing a facility, you quiz the management about the cleaning agents used (they should be approved by the Environmental Protection Agency) and daily cleaning schedule for all surfaces and equipment. If exercise mats are not cleaned between classes, he suggested bringing your own. Antibacterial wipes or spray bottles should be provided and used by everyone to clean equipment after a workout. 

 Be Sure Exercise is All You Get at the Gym

Reversing AIDS

A powerful video on how the effects of AIDS can be reversed.

 

Via Brutally Honest 

It must be acknowledged that President&apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief begun in 2003, the largest U.S. foreign aid program in history, the bulk of which has been invested in people who already infected has saved and will save millions of lives.

Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said 
 In my annual medical mission trips to Africa during the Bush administration, I saw the cost of treatment for HIV with life-saving antiretrovirals (ARVs) drop from $4,000 a year to $125. The number of Africans on ARVs jumped from 50,000 to 2.1 million.

Bewildering Complexity

 Obamacare Only Looks Worse Upon Further Review writes Kevin Hassett

 68 grant programs, 47 bureaucratic entities, 29 demonstration or pilot programs, six regulatory systems, six compliance standards and two entitlements.

Getting that massive enterprise up and running will be next to impossible. So Democrats streamlined the process by granting Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius the authority to make judgments that can’t be challenged either administratively or through the courts.
 
Via The Corner, comes this portrait of Obamacare with PDF, if you can bear looking more closely here 

 
 &quot;We have to pass the bill so you can find out what’s in it,”  Nancy Pelosi
 

 
 The chart was developed by Republicans on the Joint Economic Committe e.

 Brownback, the committee’s ranking member, added, “This updated chart illustrates the overwhelming expansion of government control over health choices and the bewildering complexity facing everyone affected by this law.&quot;
--
In addition to capturing the massive expansion of government and the overwhelming complexity of new regulations and taxes, the chart portrays:

$569 billion in higher taxes;
$529 billion in cuts to Medicare;
swelling of the ranks of Medicaid by 16 million;
17 major insurance mandates; and
the creation of two new bureaucracies with powers to impose future rationing: the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and the Independent Payments Advisory Board.

Brady admits committee analysts could not fit the entire health care bill on one chart. “This portrays only about one-third of the complexity of the final bill. It’s actually worse than this.”

Very little medical benefits from the sequencing of the human genome so far

After ten years spent on sequencing the human genome, genetic scientist Craig Venter admits to Der Spiegel, &quot;We have learned nothing from the Genome.&quot;
 
 Venter: That&apos;s what you say. And what else have I learned from my genome? Very little. We couldn&apos;t even be certain from my genome what my eye color was. Isn&apos;t that sad? Everyone was looking for miracle &apos;yes/no&apos; answers in the genome. &quot;Yes, you&apos;ll have cancer.&quot; Or &quot;No, you won&apos;t have cancer.&quot; But that&apos;s just not the way it is.

SPIEGEL: So the Human Genome Project has had very little medical benefits so far?

Venter: Close to zero to put it precisely.
--
SPIEGEL: Why is it taking so long for the results of genome research to be applied in medicine?

Venter: Because we have, in truth, learned nothing from the genome other than probabilities. How does a 1 or 3 percent increased risk for something translate into the clinic? It is useless information.

The dangers of loneliness

 Loneliness is a killer: It&apos;s as bad for your health as alcoholism, smoking and over-eating, say scientists. 

 Obesity and alcoholism may be bad for your health, but there’s a less obvious condition out there that is just as dangerous – loneliness.

According to a study t he support of family, friends and neighbours can increase your chances of living to a healthy old age by 50 per cent.

 But the findings, based on an analysis of more than 300,000 people, suggest social isolation is as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or being an alcoholic.

It also does more damage to your health than not exercising – and is twice as harmful as obesity.

The American scientists who made the discovery say lack of social support should be added to the ‘short list’ of risk factors for an early grave.
--
 
 The researchers looked at data from 148 previously published studies that measured people’s social networks and tracked their health for an average of seven and a half years.

 The data did not show whether people were in ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ relationships – simply the number of people they were in contact with regularly.
 
The authors of the study believe the health benefits of positive friendships could be even stronger. ‘The data simply show whether they were integrated in a social network,’ said Dr Holt-Lunstad.

 ‘That means the effects of negative relationships are lumped in there with the positive ones. They are all averaged together. ’

 
We are from the beginning, relational beings and we find ourselves and who we are in our relationships.  Social relationships are essential to good health and well-being.

Hospital Delirium

My mother thought she was captured by the Chinese while Justin Kaplan saw

 “Thousands of tiny little creatures,some on horseback, waving arms, carrying weapons like some grand Renaissance battle,” who were trying to turn people “into zombies.” Their leader was a woman “with no mouth but a very precisely cut hole in her throat.”
 
 Hallucinations in Hospital Pose Risk to Elderly
 
 Disproportionately affecting older people, a rapidly growing share of patients, hospital delirium affects about one-third of patients over 70, and a greater percentage of intensive-care or postsurgical patients, the American Geriatrics Society estimates.

“A delirious patient happens almost every day,” said Dr. Manuel N. Pacheco, director of consultation and emergency services at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He treated Mr. Kaplan, whom he described as “a very learned, acclaimed person,” for whom “this is not the kind of behavior that’s normal.” “People don’t talk about it, because it’s embarrassing,” Dr. Pacheco said. “They’re having sheer terror, like their worst nightmare.”
--

Frequently, geriatricians say, delirium is misdiagnosed, or described on patient charts as agitation, confusion or inappropriate behavior, so subsequent doctors might not realize the problem. One study found “delirium” used in only 7 percent of cases; “confusion” was most common. Another study of delirious older emergency-room patients found that the condition was missed in three-quarters of them.

Earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer&apos;s

Many more people are going to be told they have incipient Alzheimer&apos;s when the new rules take effect in the fall.  The hope is earlier diagnosis - long before memory loss is apparent - will lead to more effective drug treatment.

 Rules to change in diagnosing Alzheimer&apos;s 

 If the guidelines are adopted in the fall, as expected, some experts predict a two- to threefold increase in the number of people with Alzheimer’s disease.
 ---
 But researchers are now convinced that the disease is present a decade or more before dementia.

 “Our thinking has changed dramatically,” said Dr. Paul Aisen, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of California, San Diego, and a member of one of the groups formulating the new guidelines. “ We now view dementia as a late stage in the process.”
 
The new guidelines include criteria for three stages of the disease: preclinical disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and, lastly, Alzheimer’s dementia.
--
Under the new guidelines, for the first time, diagnoses will aim to identify the disease as it is developing by using results from so-called biomarkers — tests like brain scans, M.R.I. scans and spinal taps that reveal telltale brain changes.
--
 “This has implications for everybody alive, anybody who is getting older, ” Dr. Doraiswamy said. Among other things, he said, it will encourage a lot more testing. And, Dr. Doraiswamy said, “diagnosis rates, like testing rates, only go in one direction — up.”

The risks of contraceptives

Contraceptives are far more dangerous than women think.

 According to the US Drug Watchdog the serious side effects of birth control pills such as Yaz and Yasmin are potentially putting millions of women at risk for stroke, heart attack and even death.

Also woman who have used the pill are now showing up in their 30&apos;s with breast cancer (prior to the pill breast cancer was a post-menopausal women&apos;s disease). Next time you are at the pharmacy ask for the insert information inside the very box that is provided to the consumer when they purchase a contraceptive.  On NuvaRing&apos;s website (a common contraceptive) risks associated with the drug include blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, high blood pressure, heart disease, gallbladder disease, liver tumors, and cancer of the reproductive organs and breasts.

How many doctors are telling women who go in for contraceptives these stunning statistics? Women who use hormonal contraceptives for a minimum of 4 years prior to their first full term pregnancy have a 52% higher risk of developing breast cancer (Mayo Clinic Proceedings). Women who use a hormonal contraceptive for more then 5 yrs are 4 times more likely to develop cervical cancer (International Agency of Research on Cancer). Instead many doctors convince married and single woman to go on contraceptives when they go into the office.

Natural Family Planning (NFP) is a highly reliable form of not only spacing children but helping couples to conceive. Recent studies have shown it to be 99% effective.

Emotionally stunting Botox

 

Botox can stunt you emotionally, but may help if you&apos;re depressed.  So does smiling.

 Smiling makes you happy research into botox shows 

 Botox, used to fight facial wrinkles, is made of an extremely toxic protein called Botulinum toxin that temporarily paralyses the muscles that cause creases.

That means no lines, but also no moving of the muscles at all which often makes faces look frozen.

Now the lack of facial expressions may influence emotional experiences as well, the research found.

A person with limited ability to make facial expressions was found to also have a limited ability to feel emotions.
 
 Bad news for Botox users If your face is too tight to show disgust, you won&apos;t be able to get rid of the feeling, instead you think about disgusting things more often.

Good news, Botox may ease depression So does smiling,  Even if you&apos;re faking it, smiling releases endorphrins that make you feel better

And the blind see in a &quot;roaring success&quot;

Thanks to adult stem cells, the New England Journal of Medicine reports blindness reversal in dozens of patients .

- Dozens of people who were blinded or otherwise suffered severe eye damage when they were splashed with caustic chemicals had their sight restored with transplants of their own stem cells--a stunning success for the burgeoning cell-therapy field, Italian researchers reported Wednesday.

The treatment worked completely in 82 of 107 eyes and partially in 14 others, with benefits lasting up to a decade so far. One man whose eyes were severely damaged more than 60 years ago now has near-normal vision.

“This is a roaring success,” said ophthalmologist Dr. Ivan Schwab of the University of California, Davis, who had no role in the study--the longest and largest of its kind.

New blood test coming to diagnose breast cancer

Very good news for women and the men who love them.

At the recent annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Washington, D.C. came the announcement that a new Blood test detects breast cancer before any sign of a lump. 

 A blood test that detects breast cancer more than a year before any symptoms appear could dramatically improve survival rates.

The test looks for raised levels of a certain protein that is already known to increase once cancer has developed. But in a new study, researchers found levels of the protein, called epidermal growth factor receptor, were already high up to 17 months before women were diagnosed with breast cancer.
--
The latest development came from a study of more than 400 breast cancer victims by scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle.

The volunteers were all taking part in a major, long-running U.S. study, called the Women&apos;s Health Initiative, a 15-year investigation that began in 1991 and involved more than 100,000 volunteers.

Every volunteer donated blood samples to the study for routine testing. When researchers identified women who later developed breast cancer, they analysed the blood samples they had given up to 17 months before their diagnosis.

These were then compared with another group of cancer-free women from the same study.

The results showed those with the highest levels of epidermal growth factor receptor were nearly three times more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later date.
-
Epidermal growth factor receptor is a protein on the surface of all cells. But in excess quantities, it can trigger uncontrolled growth of cancerous tissue.

Dr Christopher Li, who led the research, said it was too early for the biomarker test to be used on its own as a cancer diagnosis. But it could form part of the screening process if further trials confirm the early findings.

A blood test to spot cancer Before tumors develop

 The simple blood test that spots cancer six years before tumours develop 

 A simple blood test to spot cancer up to six years before a tumour forms could be available in Britain next year.
The brainchild of a Nottingham University cancer specialist, it could provide vital early warning of lung and breast cancers - diseases that between them claim almost 50,000 lives annually.
--
Diagnostic techniques such as scans and biopsies focus on tumours that have already formed but the new test can detect that something is wrong well before the cancer does any damage.

The Oncimmume test picks up telltale signs of a germinating cancer in the blood.  The signals - generated by the immune system - can be detected up to five years before a cancer is spotted, from just two teaspoons of blood.

Professor John Robertson, the breast cancer specialist who spent 15 years developing the test, said: &apos;We are starting to understand carcinogenesis in a way that we have never seen before - seeing which proteins are going wrong and how your immune system responds.

&apos;It&apos;s as if your body is shouting &quot;I&apos;ve got cancer&quot; way before a tumour can be detected.

Presentations on the technology are due to be made at the American Society of Clinical Oncology&apos;s annual conference in Chicago next week.

Man infected with computer virus

 Man infected with computer virus and no, it&apos;s the Onion, it&apos;s the BBC.
 
A British scientist says he is the first man in the world to become infected with a computer virus.

Dr Mark Gasson from the University of Reading contaminated a computer chip which was then inserted into his hand.

The device, which enables him to pass through security doors and activate his mobile phone, is a sophisticated version of ID chips used to tag pets.

In trials, Dr Gasson showed that the chip was able to pass on the computer virus to external control systems.

If other implanted chips had then connected to the system they too would have been corrupted, he said.

Dr Gasson admits that the test is a proof of principle but he thinks it has important implications for a future where medical devices such as pacemakers and cochlear implants become more sophisticated, and risk being contaminated by other human implants.
--
Professor Rafael Capurro of the Steinbeis-Transfer-Institute of Information Ethics in Germany told BBC News that the research was &quot;interesting&quot;.

&quot;If someone can get online access to your implant, it could be serious,&quot; he said.

Professor Capurro contributed to a 2005 ethical study for the European Commission that looked at the development of digital implants and possible abuse of them.

&quot;From an ethical point of view, the surveillance of implants can be both positive and negative,&quot; he said.

&quot;Surveillance can be part of medical care, but if someone wants to do harm to you, it could be a problem.&quot;

Genetic testing at Walgreens

 Walgreens to sell genetic tests, FDA investigating 
 
Walgreens will begin selling personal genetic testing kits on Friday, the first major retail chain in the U.S. to offer the home tests. CVS plans to have the same test kits in its stores by August.

Both drug store chains are buying the kits from Pathway Genomics, a San Diego-based startup that offers genetic health and ancestry reports.

The over-the-counter tests, which have been available through a few Internet retailers, haven&apos;t reached a mass audience until now. And their pending arrival has scientists and bio-ethicists concerned that consumers will misuse or misunderstand the results.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the Tribune Tuesday that it is investigating the medical claims two-year-old Pathway is making in marketing its genetic test to consumers. The test has not been approved by U.S. regulators.

Aspirin and dark chocolate

Always have on hand  aspirin and dark chocolate, aspirin for a heart attack, dark chocolate for a stroke.

 Dark chocolate &apos;can reduce risk of brain damage after stroke&apos; 

 Dark chocolate can reduce brain damage following a stroke, a study suggests.

Scientists have discovered that a compound called epicatechin, commonly found in dark chocolate, protects the brain against strokes by shielding nerve cells.

They based their findings on tests in mice and hope the effects can be replicated in humans. 

Advice from the Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide. Aspirin for a heart attack 

If you think you may be having a heart attack, you need to get aspirin in your system quickly.  Aspirin works by inhibiting the platelets that otherwise would clot around a cholesterol-laden plaque thereby causing more blockage in a coronary artery

 For the best results, chew a single full-sized 325-mg tablet.

The Doctor&apos;s Demeanor

I&apos;ve wondered for a long time why medical research is not doing more to harness the power of placebos.

Today in the Boston Globe fake medical treatments can work amazingly wel l.

 For a range of ailments, from pain and nausea to depression and Parkinson’s disease, placebos--whether sugar pills, saline injections, or sham surgery--have often produced results that rival those of standard therapies.
--
“In the last 10 years we’ve made tremendous strides in demonstrating the biological veracity of the placebo effect,” says Ted Kaptchuk, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the coauthors of the Lancet article. “The frontier is, how do we utilize what is clearly an important phenomenon in a way that’s consistent with patient-practitioner trust, and informed consent?”
--
according to advocates, there’s enough data for doctors to start thinking of the placebo effect not as the opposite of medicine, but as a tool they can use in an evidence-based, conscientious manner. Broadly speaking, it seems sensible to make every effort to enlist the body’s own ability to heal itself--which is what, at bottom, placebos seem to do. And as researchers examine it more closely, the placebo is having another effect as well: it is revealing a great deal about the subtle and unexpected influences that medical care, as opposed to the medicine itself, has on patients.
 
And then I learned how much depends on context.

 “Medicine is intensely meaningful,” says Daniel Moerman, a professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who coined the phrase “meaning response.” “It’s this highly stylized, highly ritualized thing.” He urges us to “forget about the stupid placebo and start looking at the system of meaning involved.”
--
“It’s amazing,” says Kaptchuk. “Connecting with the patient, rapport, empathy . . . that few extra minutes is not just icing on the cake. It has biology.”

It may be, then, that the simplest and least ethically hazardous way to capitalize on the placebo effect is to acknowledge that medicine isn’t just a set of approved treatments--it’s also a ritual, with symbolism and meaning that are key to its efficacy.
--
 Whether we call it the placebo effect or use new terms, the research in this field could start to put a measurable healing value on doctors’ time and even demeanor, rather than just on procedures and pills. And that could change medicine in a way that few blockbuster drugs ever could.

Why am I not surprised?

Do you know what the chief actuary for Medicare wrote in a memorandum to his boss, the secretary for HHS, Kathleen Sibelius, about the costs of the new health bill a week before the final vote on the health care bill?  Why weren&apos;t we told?  Why am I not surprised?

The Prowler reports 

 Sebelius&apos;s staff refused to review the document before the vote was taken.

&quot;The reason we were given was that they did not want to influence the vote,&quot; says an HHS source. &quot;Which is actually the point of having a review like this, you would think.&quot;...

&quot;We know a copy was sent to the White House via their legislative affairs staff,&quot; says the HHS staffer, &quot;and there were a number of meetings here almost right after the analysis was submitted to the secretary&apos;s office. Everyone went into lockdown, and people here were too scared to go public with the report.&quot;
 
James Capretta summarizes 

 The actuary says that the legislation will increase health care costs, not reduce them — by about $300 billion over a decade.

 The actuary also says that the financial incentives in the bill will lead many employers to stop offering coverage altogether. That means about 14 million people with job-based insurance today will lose it. Moreover, he estimates that the cuts in Medicare Advantage will reduce enrollment by 7 million people. So much for keeping the Democrats’ other mantra of “keeping the coverage you have today.”
--
 The memo says the Medicare cuts will total nearly $600 billion through 2019, and that they will almost certainly jeopardize access to care for seniors by driving scores of institutions into financial distress. 
--
The various taxes and fees on insurers and producers of drugs and devices will largely get passed on to consumers, says the memo. In other words, these taxes will hit the middle class hard and drive their premiums up, not down.

The actuary says the new long-term care insurance program created in the bill faces “a significant risk of failure” due to adverse selection — meaning that the program will attract the kind of enrollment that will require higher costs than can be covered by the premiums collected.
 
Neoneocon in her usual way puts her finger on it in The calm before the storms 

 The problem is that most Americans’ trust in the ability of Congress to solve such things, or even to tackle them in a way that will not make them worse, is nonexistent. The idea that our representatives would listen to our concerns, be responsive to our needs, and then have the intelligence to craft solutions based on common sense and/or intelligent thought or even well-meaning effort has been waning over the years but has finally evaporated. If there had been any lingering faith in Congress, HCR erased it.
--
 We assume that the cure will be worse than the disease. We expect that the bills will be rushed through without proper debate and enacted at the stroke of midnight, like evil spells in a fairy tale. We are no longer surprised at the depth and breadth of the corrupt and shady behind-the-scenes deals involved. We know the legislations will be lengthy and complex. We do not think our representatives possess the intelligence to even understand the bills they pass—that is, if they bother to read them at all—and either do not appreciate their negative consequences or actually intend them to do us harm. We know that, just when we think we’ve driven a fatal stake into the heart of an unpopular bill, it rises and staggers forward to attack us.

Laughter is the best medicine and the best exercise

 Forget going to gym – &apos;laughercise&apos; session just as good for you 

 CURLING up with laughter has similar effects on the body as pumping iron in the gym, a study has shown.

Sessions of mirthful laughter – dubbed &quot;laughercise&quot; by researchers – enhance mood, reduce stress hormones, boost
the immune system and lower blood pressure and levels of &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, researchers have found.

Like physical exercise, they also appear to stimulate appetite, offering a potential way to help malnourished patients who are off their food.

Laughter has long been thought of as the &quot;best medicine&quot; but recent research has shown that it really can have health benefits.

Previous research by US scientists led by Californian physician Dr Lee Berk has demonstrated how laughter improves mood, reduces stress and activates immune system cells, especially those which combat cancer.

Laughter has also been shown to benefit blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

The latest study from Dr Berk&apos;s team suggests that some of the effects of laughter mirror those of repetitive exercise.

&quot;Clearly better without the booze&quot;

No matter how old you are, alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can cause serious problems as you age and stopping can bring real benefits to the rest of your life.

 The Aging Drinker 

 

 For years, therefore, medical groups have called for screening every patient, including older ones, for alcohol and other drug use. But as Ms. Sharp’s recently published study in The Journal of Applied Gerontology shows, many doctors still neglect to ask older patients about drinking. Her survey of 101 primary care physicians found that 73 percent reported screening new patients over 65 for alcohol use at their first appointments, and only 44 percent screened their existing patients.

Dr. Oslin’s 85-year-old patient, for instance, had seen a series of specialists, plus his primary care doctor, and all had missed his alcohol dependence.
--
Perhaps, Ms. Sharp speculated, doctors don’t look for alcohol problems because they think older people can’t or won’t stop drinking anyway.
--
But older people can indeed benefit from treatment or intervention. In fact, older people dependent on alcohol do better in treatment than younger people, Dr. Oslin has found. They’re more likely to attend therapy sessions and take prescribed medication, and less likely to relapse.
--
It can be worth the fight. The 85-year-old he saw continued to abstain from drinking and continued seeing his psychiatrist. He was able to rejoin family activities and stopped taking antidepressants.

“He only lived another 14 months, but he was clearly better without the booze,” Dr. Oslin said. “The family got to see their husband and father again for the first time in a long time. They were very grateful that they had that year with him.”

Walking instead of back surgery

 Taking a stairway to health 

 So this guy goes to the doctor for back pain and the diagnosis is pretty awful: The patient is going to need spinal surgery again, for the third time in three years.

Charles Fleming thought back on all the misery he&apos;d endured the first two times he was cut open like a Christmas goose. He gave about two seconds&apos; worth of consideration to the doctor&apos;s proposed disc-ectomy and said thanks, doc, but not just yet.

He couldn&apos;t face the knife again.

Just one problem: What to do about the crippling pain?
--
He started modestly, covering two blocks or so in those early days, back in 2006. Then he got braver, and looser, and soon he was up to half a mile, followed by a mile, followed by long, therapeutic walks that felt really good. Much better than surgery, in fact.

Fleming is no doctor, but he thinks he has a reasonable medical explanation for this miracle cure called walking.
 

He ended up walking the historic staircases in Los Angeles and writing a book about them.

 Fleming says there are roughly 400 staircases in Greater L.A., and he has &quot;walked, measured, studied, photographed and mapped more than 275&quot; of them in researching &quot;Secret Stairs, A Walking Guide to the Historic Staircases of Los Angeles.&quot;
--

There&apos;s something magical about the stair walks. You leave the known city behind and visit a quiet place built for an entirely different kind of living. Bungalows, some of them 100 years old, sit amid towering oaks and wildflowers, no roads or cars in sight.

His mind&apos;s eye had gone blind

 One day in 2005, a retired building surveyor in Edinburgh visited his doctor with a strange complaint: His mind’s eye had suddenly gone blind.

The surveyor, referred to as MX by his doctors, was 65 at the time. He had always felt that he possessed an exceptional talent for picturing things in his mind. The skill had come in handy in his job, allowing MX to recall the fine details of the buildings he surveyed. Just before drifting off to sleep, he enjoyed running through recent events as if he were watching a movie. He could picture his family, his friends, and even characters in the books he read.

Then these images all vanished. The change happened shortly after MX went to a hospital to have his blocked coronary arteries treated. As a cardiologist snaked a tube into the arteries and cleared out the obstructions, MX felt a “reverberation” in his head and a tingling in his left arm. He didn’t think to mention it to his doctors at the time. But four days later he realized that when he closed his eyes, all was darkness.
 
 The Brain: Look Deep Into The Mind&apos;s Eye 

 We take visual imagination for granted. But the blank inner world of a patient called MX demonstrates the rich neural processes needed to create the images in our heads.

 Postpartum depression affects between 5 percent and 25 percent of new mothers.  Symptoms — including sadness, fatigue, appetite changes, crying, anxiety and irritability — usually occur in the first few months after child birth.  There is a simple way to alleviate postpartum depression in just a few hours: sleep deprivation.

If a depressed mother stays up all night, or even the last half of the night, it is likely that by morning the depression will lift. Although this sounds too good to be true, it has been well documented in over 1,700 patients in more than 75 published papers during the last 40 years. [1]  Sleep deprivation used as a treatment for depression is efficacious and robust: it works quickly, is relatively easy to administer, inexpensive, relatively safe and it also alleviates other types of clinical depression. Sleep deprivation can elevate your mood even if you are not depressed, and can induce euphoria. This throws a new light on insomnia.

All this offers hope that studying sleep deprivation may lead to new, unique and rapid treatments for depression.

Natural sounds

As someone who listens to natural sounds - ocean waves, birdsong, croaking frogs and waterfalls - on my computer more than I do music, this story resonated with me.

 &quot;In Pursuit of Silence&quot;: How noise really is killing us 

 In his new book, &quot;In Pursuit of Silence: Listening for Meaning in a World of Noise,&quot; George Prochnik argues that this barrage of noise is more than just a nuisance; it poses a real threat to our cardiovascular system and mental health, our ability to concentrate, and, perhaps most dangerous of all, it turns our political discourse into a shrill barrage.
--
 

 The noise we suffer from today is more incessant. We have a different set of issues -- nighttime noise and air traffic being some of the most obvious culprits -- but in the 19th century, even people from the working class often lived in situations where it was easier to find an actual quiet space or a space where the sound of civilization was mixed with some kinds of natural sounds. It&apos;s important to remember that not all noises are created equal, and many surveys have demonstrated that people&apos;s reactions to noise vary wildly depending on whether they&apos;re natural or mechanical. Even at loud volumes sounds like birds singing and waterfalls are soothing.
 --
 

 Noise wreaks havoc on all different parts of our bodies. The heart rate accelerates. We get vasoconstriction. It&apos;s been shown that the elevated blood pressure from nighttime noise continues all through the day. Even if we&apos;re not fully aroused by noise, sleep is fragmented. Loss of sleep is tied to all kinds of immune and heart problems, and a real laundry list of ailments. The really scary thing is even if we do habituate mentally to noise, that doesn&apos;t change what&apos;s happening to our bodies.

Pedal Vision

I&apos;ve always liked Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio but never than when he looked at his overweight inmates and instituted a new program called &quot;Pedal Vision&quot;

 Arpaio gets inmates moving on electricity-generating cycles 

 The stationary bikes are customized so that as an inmate pedals, a connected television is powered once the cycle generates 12 volts of electricity.

One hour of pedaling equals one hour of television viewing for the inmates, according to Arpaio.

Arpaio said the inmates will only be able to watch television in the television room if they choose to pedal.

Inner voice

Yes, I hear a voice when I read and never thought twice about it  until I read this.

 Do you hear a voice in your head when you read? If not... you could be dyslexic

 Professor Rod Nicolson, head of work psychology at the University of Sheffield, has been studying dyslexia for many years and was inspired to investigate internal speech after meeting Gary at a conference in 2004. He believes he has found a link between lack of inner speech and poor reading ability.

&apos;Children start off having to say every word out loud,&apos; he says. &apos;At some stage, as their reading improves, so does their ability to sight-read [to read in their heads] and that is the stage at which reading really takes off.

By the age of eight or nine, most children can read in their heads. The development of the inner voice seems to be automatic for most people, but our data suggests a link with fluent reading, in that the process of learning to sight-read actually helps inner-speech develop.

&apos;Everyone assumes everyone else is the same. However, we have found not everyone has an inner voice and in those who don&apos;t, literacy levels are often poor.

Spoonful of sugar

Why you should never buy pre-sweetened anything.  Always add your own spoonful of sugar.

 A sweet problem: Princeton researchers find that high-fructose corn syrup prompts considerably more weight gain 

A Princeton University research team has demonstrated that all sweeteners are not equal when it comes to weight gain: Rats with access to high-fructose corn syrup gained significantly more weight than those with access to table sugar, even when their overall caloric intake was the same.

 In addition to causing significant weight gain in lab animals, long-term consumption of high-fructose corn syrup also led to abnormal increases in body fat, especially in the abdomen, and a rise in circulating blood fats called triglycerides
--
The rats in the Princeton study became obese by drinking high-fructose corn syrup, but not by drinking sucrose. The critical differences in appetite, metabolism and gene expression that underlie this phenomenon are yet to be discovered, but may relate to the fact that excess fructose is being metabolized to produce fat, while glucose is largely being processed for energy or stored as a carbohydrate, called glycogen, in the liver and muscles.

“Slap upside the head of the government.”

 Monday Morning Coming Down
 
 Who has better credit than Uncle Sam? If you ask the bond market, that elite list includes Berkshire Hathaway, Procter&amp;Gamble, Lowe’s, Johnson&amp;Johnson, and a host of other blue-chip corporate borrowers. The U.S. government has the ability to levy taxes on the largest national economy in the world, a vast and fearsome revenue-collection apparatus, and more than two centuries of constitutional government under its belt. P&amp;G has Tampax.
-
As hangover headaches go, this is going to be brutal, and investors apparently have more faith in Johnson&amp;Johnson’s ability to sell Tylenol than in Washington’s ability to pay for it. Mitchell Stapley, an analyst with Fifth Third Asset Management, told Reuters that the numbers coming out of the bond market are a “slap upside the head of the government.”
--
So here’s a prediction for you: Obamacare is not going to happen, regardless of the fact that the president is going to sign it into law today, regardless of what happens in the 2010 and 2012 elections, and regardless of any speech given anywhere in Washington. The government’s ability to simply say “Make it so!” and ignore economic reality is coming up against its limit.
--
Obamacare will be a huge new outlay on an already bloated federal budget, two-thirds of which is committed to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, national defense, and interest payments on the national debt. Somebody’s not going to get paid. Bond investors are worried that it’s going to be them, but my bet is that it’s going to be those who have put their faith in Obamacare. But, hey, it was fun while it lasted. Have a Tylenol.

Will you be a revenue loss or a cost savings?

 &quot;In a private fee-for-service medical system, a dead patient is a revenue loss. In the National Health Service (UK), a dead patient was a cost savings.&quot; -Harry Bailey MD 1930-2003.

 A Unique Perspective on the Delivery of Medical Care 

Via The Anchoress who offers two anecdotes of her own in Obamacare&amp;the Aging Population .

 

Since the Health Care Reform Act cuts $500 billion from Medicare, does anyone doubt that seniors will be urged and too soon required to take the painkiller instead of surgery?

Why don&apos;t we ever learn the Lessons of History? 

 With the elimination of private expenditures for health services, the form and amount of medical care were now dependent upon the budgetary priorities of the State. All members of the medical industry were put on low fixed monthly salaries and were mandated to examine and treat an overwhelming daily quota of patients. Medical research became dependent upon inadequate annual budgetary allocations from the government. Doctors’ and nurses’ incomes no longer depended on their professional skills or the number of patients they treated. Total unionization of the medical profession made it practically impossible for anyone to be fired. Without markets and prices determining the value and availability of health care, the government imposed a rationing system for medical services and pharmaceutical products.

“The patient doesn’t seem to be in the picture.”

 “The patient doesn’t seem to be in the picture.” It adds: “We were struck by the virtual absence of mention of patients and families ... whether we were discussing aims and ambition for improvement, measurement of progress or any other topic relevant to quality.

“Most targets and standards appear to be defined in professional, organisational and political terms, not in terms of patients’ experience of care.”
 
The above quote is from a report by the Massachusetts-based Institute for Healthcare Improvements on Great Britain&apos;s National Health Care Service.

Not so hard to believe when read Neglected by &apos;lazy&apos; nurses, man, 22, dying of thirst rang the police to beg for water. 

 Told by the doctors that everything was under control, the police left and the man died the next day.

Sources say they are investigating the possibility of a corporate manslaughter charge against St George&apos;s Hospital in Tooting, South London.

Mr Gorny, from Balham, worked for Waitrose and had been a keen footballer and runner until he was diagnosed with a brain tumour the year before his death.

The medication he took caused his bones to weaken and he was admitted to St George&apos;s for a hip replacement in May last year. The operation left him immobile and unable to get out of bed.

His 50-year-old mother says that he needed to take drugs three times a day to regulate his hormones. Doctors had told him that without the drugs he would die.

Although he had stressed to staff how important his medication was, she said, no one gave him the drugs. She said that two days after his hip operation, while Miss Cronin was at work, he became severely dehydrated but his requests for water were refused.

He became aggressive and nurses called in security guards to restrain him.  After they had left, he rang the police from his bed to demand their help.
 
Back to the report on the NHS from the London Times which reports were suppressed by the government.
 
 Lord Darzi, the former health minister, commissioned the three reports from international consultancies to assess the progress of the NHS as it approached its 60th anniversary in 2008. They have come to light after a freedom of information request.
--
 

 They diagnose a blind pursuit of political and managerial targets as the root cause of a string of hospital scandals that have cost thousands of lives.
 
That&apos;s the basic core problem of nationalized health care.  When the government takes over management, politics and managerial targets become more important than patient care.

Genetic test to help you lose weight

The amount of weight you will lose on a diet appears to be related to your genetic makeup.

 New gene test may help you pick your diet 

 Can&apos;t lose weight on a low-fat diet? Maybe you need to cut carbs instead, and a new genetic test may point the way, maker Interleukin Genetics Inc reported on Wednesday.

The small study of about 140 overweight or obese women showed that those on diets &quot;appropriate&quot; for their genetic makeup lost more weight than those on less appropriate diets, researchers told an American Heart Association meeting.
--

Massachusetts-based Interleukin&apos;s $149 test looks for mutations in three genes, known as FABP2, PPARG and ADRB2.

The company says 39 percent of white Americans have the low-fat genotype, 45 percent have the type that responds best to a diet low in processed carbohydrates and an unlucky 16 percent have gene mutations that mean they have to watch both fat and processed carbohydrates.
--
Over a year, people on diets appropriate to their genetic makeup, as determined by the test, lost 5.3 percent of body weight. People on mismatched diets lost 2.3 percent, the Stanford researchers told the meeting.

Cholesterol levels improved in line with weight loss, they said.

Beep, It&apos;s Your Medicine Nagging You

Finally, a pill container that beeps when you need to take your medication.

The Wall St Journal reports. 

 The container—actually a high-tech top for a standard pill bottle called a &quot;GlowCap&quot; —is equipped with a wireless transmitter that plugs into the wall. When it is time for a dose of medicine, the GlowCap emits a pulsing orange light; after an hour, the gadget starts beeping every five minutes, in arpeggios that become more complicated and insistent. After that, the device can set off an automated telephone or text message reminder to patients who fail to take their pills. It also can generate email or letters reporting to a family member or doctor how often the medication is taken.

It is one of the high-tech ways companies are grappling with medicine noncompliance.  Only about half of patients who are prescribed a medication for a chronic condition are still taking the drug regularly after a year...

HSAs: Improving Health and Saving Money

I&apos;ve long been in favor of Health Savings Accounts or HSAs as they are known.  Mitch Daniels, Governor of Indiana shows how such accounts have improved health and saved money, lots of money.

 Hoosiers and Health Savings Accounts
 
 The HSA option has proven highly popular. This year, over 70% of our 30,000 Indiana state workers chose it, by far the highest in public-sector America. Due to the rejection of these plans by government unions, the average use of HSAs in the public sector across the country is just 2%.
--
State employees enrolled in the consumer-driven plan will save more than $8 million in 2010 compared to their coworkers in the old-fashioned preferred provider organization (PPO) alternative. In the second straight year in which we&apos;ve been forced to skip salary increases, workers switching to the HSA are adding thousands of dollars to their take-home pay.
--
The state is saving, too. In a time of severe budgetary stress, Indiana will save at least $20 million in 2010 because of our high HSA enrollment. Mercer calculates the state&apos;s total costs are being reduced by 11% solely due to the HSA option.
--
Most important, we are seeing significant changes in behavior, and consequently lower total costs. In 2009, for example, state workers with the HSA visited emergency rooms and physicians 67% less frequently than co-workers with traditional health care. They were much more likely to use generic drugs than those enrolled in the conventional plan, resulting in an average lower cost per prescription of $18. They were admitted to hospitals less than half as frequently as their colleagues. Differences in health status between the groups account for part of this disparity, but consumer decision-making is, we&apos;ve found, also a major factor.

Overall, participants in our new plan ran up only $65 in cost for every $100 incurred by their associates under the old coverage

&quot;Death on a cellular scale is ..oddly pro-life&quot;

Is Aging the Body&apos;s Cure for Cancer ?

Maybe so according to a study from an international team based at Newcastle University in England.

 The Newcastle team, working with the University of Ulm in Germany, used a comprehensive “systems biology” approach, involving computer modelling and experiments with cell cultures and genetically modified mice, to investigate why cells become senescent. In this aged state, cells stop dividing and the tissues they make up show physical signs of deterioration, from wrinkling skin to a failing heart.

The research, published by the journal Molecular Systems Biology, shows that when an ageing cell detects serious damage to its DNA – caused by the wear and tear of life – it sends out specific internal signals.

These distress signals trigger the cell’s mitochondria, its tiny energy-producing power packs, to make oxidising “free radical” molecules, which in turn tell the cell either to destroy itself or to stop dividing. The aim is to avoid the damaged DNA that causes cancer.
 
 

 Verum Serum comments

 But I’m taken by the ironic, almost poetic nature of this discovery. In a real biological sense death, at least death on a cellular scale, is found to be oddly pro-life . Aging turns out to be a gradual battle against more catastrophic failure.  It’s all very counter-intuitive and yet somehow not unpleasant to learn.

Genetic testing at the drugstore?

In the coming era of personalized medicine, it&apos;s the pharmacists, not the health care firms, who are investing in ways to make the benefits of the sequencing of the human genome widely accessible.

 CVS Wants Your Genes 

 About 100 million American have their prescription benefits managed by one of two companies, Medco or CVS Caremark. And both companies have recently invested in firms that aim to make genetic testing more accessible and easier for doctors and patients to interpret.

Medco is also funding studies to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specific pharmacogenomics tests, including those for the blood thinner warfarin and the breast cancer drug tamoxifen.

Beer for osteoporosis and Frankincense for cancer

 Beer May Be Good for Your Bones 

a new analysis of 100 commercial beers shows the hoppy beverage is a significant source of dietary silicon, a key ingredient for bone health.

 --
The type of silicon in beer, called orthosilicic acid, has a 50 percent bioavailability, meaning that much is available for use in the body. Some foods, like bananas are rich in silicon but only 5 percent is bioavailable. This soluble form of silica found in beer could be important for the growth and development of bone and connective tissue, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Past research has suggested that moderate beer consumption may help fight osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue.

Another past study involving nearly 1,700 women reported last year in the journal Nutrition showed participants who were light to moderate beer drinkers had much better bone density than non-drinkers. The researchers suggested the beer&apos;s plant hormones, not the alcohol, could be responsible for the bone boost. 

 

The BBC explores the history and the promise of frankincense as a cure for cancer

 

 Scientists have observed that there is some agent within frankincense which stops cancer spreading, and which induces cancerous cells to close themselves down. 
 

Immunologist Mahmoud Suhail is quoted &quot;Cancer starts when the DNA code within the cell&apos;s nucleus becomes corrupted.  It seems frankincense has a re-set function. It can tell the cell what the right DNA code should be. Frankincense separates the &apos;brain&apos; of the cancerous cell - the nucleus - from the &apos;body&apos; - the cytoplasm, and closes down the nucleus to stop it reproducing corrupted DNA codes.&quot;
--
Currently, with chemotherapy, doctors blast the area around a tumour to kill the cancer, but that also kills healthy cells, and weakens the patient. Treatment with frankincense could eradicate the cancerous cells alone and let the others live.
The task now is to isolate the agent within frankincense which, apparently, works this wonder

Fish Oil: Known Benefits, Little Risk

The Wall St Journal reports fish oil pills may be able to spare some young people with signs of mental illness from a progression into fully developed schizophrenia.

 A Study Finds Mental Benefit of Fish Oil 

 No one knows what causes schizophrenia but one hypothesis is that people with the disease don&apos;t process fatty acids correctly, leading to damaged brain cells. Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil could help brain cells repair and stabilize, the researchers speculate.

Dr. Janet Wozniak of Harvard Medical School said the findings might reasonably cause psychiatrists to recommend fish oil to some patients because there are known benefits and little risk.
 
This is not the first study that found a correlation between omega 3 fatty acids, mental illness and crime.

In 2003 a study from South Africa saw the Clinical potential of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of schizophrenia. 

The Australian press did a round-up of studies being conducted around the world studying the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the brain in its article, Crime, punishment and a junk-food diet .  Can violent behavior be attributable at least in part to nutritional deficiencies?

 The British prison trial at Aylesbury jail showed that when young men there were fed multivitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids, the number of violent offences committed in the prison fell by 37 per cent. 

In 2006, the New York Times asked whether Eating Salmon Will Lower the Murder Rate? 

 In 2001, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a senior clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, published a study, provocatively titled &quot;Seafood Consumption and Homicide Mortality,&quot; that found a correlation between a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids (most often obtained from fish) and lower murder rates.
 --
 Consider, for example, a study conducted by researchers in Finland. They tested prisoners convicted of violent crimes and found that they had lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids than ordinary, healthy subjects. Why? Omega-3&apos;s foster the growth of neurons in the brain&apos;s frontal cortex, the bit of gray matter that controls impulsive behavior. Having enough of these fatty acids may keep violent impulses in check.
 

 



I admit to being a bit of nut on the benefits of coffee, bear, chocolate, Vitamin D and Omega 3.    Here are a few on Omega -3

Eye test to spot Alzheimer&apos;s

Going to get your eyes examined will take on new meaning with the Eye test that spots Alzheimer&apos;s 20 years before symptoms. 

A test that can detect Alzheimer&apos;s up to 20 years before any symptoms show is being developed by British scientists.
The simple and inexpensive eye test could be part of routine examinations by high street opticians in as little as three years, allowing those in middle age to be screened.

Dementia experts said it had the power to revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer&apos;s by making it possible for drugs to be given in the earliest stages.

 ___
 

 

The eye test would provide a quick, easy, cheap and highly-accurate diagnosis.

It exploits the fact that the light-sensitive cells in the retina at the back of the eye are a direct extension of the brain.
Using eye drops which highlight diseased cells, the UCL researchers showed for the first time in a living eye that the amount of damage to cells in the retina directly corresponds with brain cell death.

They have also pinpointed the pattern of retinal cell death characteristic of Alzheimer&apos;s. So far their diagnosis has been right every time.

With research showing that cells start to die ten to 20 years before the symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s become evident, it could allow people to be screened in middle age for signs of the disease.

Health round-up: Hearing skin, the virus of loneliness and the future of fat

 Loneliness spreads like a virus
 A lonely person will be less trusting of others, essentially &quot;making a mountain out of a molehill,&quot; said study researcher John Cacioppo, a psychologist at the University of Chicago. An odd look or phrasing by a friend that wouldn&apos;t even be noticed by a chipper person could be seen as an affront to the lonely, triggering a cycle of negative interactions that cause people to lose friends.
 

 Vitamin D shows heart benefits
 
There is more and more evidence that vitamin D is a critical player in numerous other aspects of metabolism. A new study suggests many Americans aren’t getting anywhere nearly enough of the vitamin, and it may be affecting their heart health.
--
The findings, which are being presented today at an American Heart Association conference in Orlando, don’t prove that lack of vitamin D causes heart disease; they only suggest a link between the two. But cardiologists are starting to pay increasing attention because of what they’re learning about vitamin D’s roles in regulating blood pressure, inflammation and glucose control — all critical body processes in cardiovascular health. 

 Surprise! Your skin can hear 
 We not only hear with our ears, but also through our skin, according to a new study. 
 
The finding, based on experiments in which participants listened to certain syllables while puffs of air hit their skin, suggests our brains take in and integrate information from various senses to build a picture of our surroundings. 
 
Along with other recent work, the research flips the traditional view of how we perceive the world on its head. 
 
&quot;[That&apos;s] very different from the more traditional ideas, based on the fact that we have eyes so we think of ourselves as seeing visible information, and we have ears so we think of ourselves as hearing auditory information. That&apos;s a little bit misleading,&quot; study researcher Bryan Gick of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, told LiveScience. 
 
&quot;A more likely explanation is that we have brains that perceive rather than we have eyes that see and ears that hear.&quot;
With such abilities, Gick views humans as &quot;whole-body perceiving machines.&quot; 
 
The research, funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada and the National Institutes of Health, is detailed in the Nov. 26 issue of the journal Nature.

Is there anything that beer can&apos;t do?

 Beer could be the new weapon against cancer 

 MEN now have another excuse to go down the pub thanks to new research suggesting that a compound in beer may prevent prostate cancer.

Tests showed that the ingredient, xanthohumol, blocked a biological pathway that allows prostate cancer to be fuelled by the male hormone testosterone.

The disease is commonly treated with drugs that act in a similar way.

Xanthohumol is a powerful antioxidant derived from hops. It belongs to a family of chemicals called flavonoids found in fruits and vegetables that are known to have anti-cancer properties.

Previous studies have already suggested that xanthohumol may block the female hormone oestrogen&apos;s ability to stimulate breast cancer. Scientists now believe it may have a similar effect in men.

In laboratory tests, the compound blocked the molecular &quot;switch&quot; that allows testosterone to trigger changes in prostate cells that may lead to cancer.

Pregnancy stem cells

 Life-saving pregnancy stem cells 

 Italians suggest tailor-made treatments for babies possible 

 A pregnant woman carries stem cells that could be used in critical medical treatments for her baby, either in the womb or later in life, a team of Italian scientists has announced. These cells, found in the womb during pregnancy, can be removed during a simple antenatal test and stored for future use, concluded the study, which appears in next week&apos;s edition of the Cloning and Stem Cells journal.
--
&apos;&apos;We took these cells from women whose fetuses were affected with spinal muscular atrophy and we were able to correct the genetic defect using genetic therapy,&apos;&apos; said Novelli. Although the technique is not yet sophisticated enough to cure the disease, the team says the day could come when corrected cells could be injected back into the fetus to treat genetic disorders before birth.

A breakthrough in MS?

 Researcher&apos;s labour of love leads to MS breakthrough 

 What he learned in his medical detective work, scouring dusty old books and using ultra-modern imaging techniques, could well turn what we know about MS on its head: Dr . Zamboni&apos;s research suggests that MS is not, as widely believed, an autoimmune condition, but a vascular disease.
 ---
More radical still, the experimental surgery he performed on his wife offers hope that MS, which afflicts 2.5 million people worldwide, can be cured and even largely prevented.
--
 For the Italian professor, however, the quest was both personal and professional and the results were stunning. 

Fighting for his wife&apos;s health, Dr. Zamboni looked for answers in the medical literature. He found repeated references, dating back a century, to excess iron as a possible cause of MS. The heavy metal can cause inflammation and cell death, hallmarks of the disease. The vascular surgeon was intrigued – coincidentally, he had been researching how iron buildup damages blood vessels in the legs, and wondered if there could be a similar problem in the blood vessels of the brain.

Using ultrasound to examine the vessels leading in and out of the brain, Dr. Zamboni made a startling find: In more than 90 per cent of people with multiple sclerosis, including his spouse, the veins draining blood from the brain were malformed or blocked. In people without MS, they were not.

He hypothesized that iron was damaging the blood vessels and allowing the heavy metal, along with other unwelcome cells, to cross the crucial brain-blood barrier. (The barrier keeps blood and cerebrospinal fluid separate. In MS, immune cells cross the blood-brain barrier, where they destroy myelin, a crucial sheathing on nerves.)

More striking still was that, when Dr. Zamboni performed a simple operation to unclog veins and get blood flowing normally again, many of the symptoms of MS disappeared.

Market-based health care solutions

Seven market-based health care solutions that have lowered health care costs and improved both access and quality of service  have gone unnoticed. Congress to Healthcare Market: Drop Dead
 
1. Retail clinics
2. Retail clinic-hospital partnerships
3. On-site workplace healthcare clinics
4. Affordable $4 generic drugs that have already saved consumers $1 billion since Walmart introduced them in 2008.
5. Prepaid medical plans
6. Concierge medicine
7. High-deductible health insurance plans along with individually owned and managed health savings accounts.

Just for the record, the CBO released its cost analysis of the Republican health care plan and found it would reduce health care premiums and the deficit by $68 billion over 10 years.

How were the Republicans able to reduce costs?

• by creating high-risk insurance pools
• allowing people to purchase health insurance policies across state lines
• instituting medical malpractice reforms

Today, small businesses  - the ones who create the majority of jobs - have difficulties finding affordable health plans for their employees because they lack the negotiating leverage a large business has.  Under the Republican plan, rates would drop 7-10% for  small business plans, 5-8% for the individual market and only 0-3% for large corporations.

Health Round-up

Here are some miscellaneous health care stories from the past several days that seem worthy of notice.

I never knew that breast-feeding your baby helps you shed extra weight you gain during the pregnancy.
 Breast-Feed the Baby, Love the Calorie Burn 

Dr Miriam Grossman, a psychiatrist who spent 20 years counseling college students is on a tear to challenge the &quot;sex ed oligarchy&quot; What&apos;s missing in sex education. 
 
She specifically wants to smash the ideas that &quot;sex trumps everything&quot; in life, and &quot;promiscuity, experimentation and fringe behaviors&quot; are healthy.

 In Britain with recent changes to assisted suicide rules,  a group of leading lawyers, peers and former judges warn Elderly and disabled could be forced to commit suicide under changes to rules 

 “The current law acts as a powerful deterrent against abuse and exploitation of vulnerable people and has been firmly upheld by Parliament.  Removing these safeguards could lead to increase in vulnerable and disabled people being pressured into ending their lives.” 
 
 

Elder medical care is not one of the six core areas that are the focus of medical school training. The American Geriatric Society calls out to all medical schools to prepare all medical students to treat the elderly .  There are just not enough geriatricians to go around (only 1 geriatrician for 2546 elderly today and in 20 years only 1 for 5000 elderly)

There are drugs that work to prevent prostate cancer and breast cancer.  So why aren&apos;t people at risk taking them?
Gina Kolata tries to figure out why Medicines to Deter Some Cancers Are Not Taken 
 
Much of what Americans do in the name of warding off cancer has not been shown to matter, and some things are actually harmful. Yet the few medicines proved to deter cancer are widely ignored.

 &quot;Rumbles through the medical community&quot; as a third study questions the effectiveness of the popular cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin.
 
A widely prescribed and expensive cholesterol drug is not as effective as niacin, a cheap vitamin, in helping to unclog coronary arteries in people already taking statins, the standard medicines used to lower cholesterol, according to a new study.

More on the Worst Bill Ever

The Wall St Journal calls it The Worst Bill Ever 

 In a rational political world, this 1,990-page runaway train would have been derailed months ago. With spending and debt already at record peacetime levels, the bill creates a new and probably unrepealable middle-class entitlement that is designed to expand over time. Taxes will need to rise precipitously, even as ObamaCare so dramatically expands government control of health care that eventually all medicine will be rationed via politics.

Yet at this point, Democrats have dumped any pretense of genuine bipartisan &quot;reform&quot; and moved into the realm of pure power politics as they race against the unpopularity of their own agenda. The goal is to ram through whatever income-redistribution scheme they can claim to be &quot;universal coverage.&quot; The result will be destructive on every level—for the health-care system, for the country&apos;s fiscal condition, and ultimately for American freedom and prosperity.
--

Mr. Obama rode into office on a wave of &quot;change,&quot; but we doubt most voters realized that the change Democrats had in mind was making health care even more expensive and rigid than the status quo. Critics will say we are exaggerating, but we believe it is no stretch to say that Mrs. Pelosi&apos;s handiwork ranks with the Smoot-Hawley tariff and FDR&apos;s National Industrial Recovery Act as among the worst bills Congress has ever seriously contemplated. 

 Annual Medicare Fraud: $60 Billion; Annual Profits of Top Ten Insurance Companies: $8 billion 

 As 60 Minutes reported last week, Medicare fraud is rampant and has now replaced the cocaine (ahem) business as the major criminal activity in South Florida 

 House Republicans Find 111 New &apos;Bureaucracies&apos; in Health Care Bill 

 Among some off the new agencies, the list cites a Health Insurance Exchange; the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation; the Public Health Investment Fund; the Public Health Workforce Corps; an Assistant Secretary for Health Information; the Food and Drug Administration Office of Women&apos;s Health; grant programs for alternative medical liability laws, infant mortality programs and other issues; and about 100 other government-sponsored creations.

 

 26 reasons to oppose Pelosi&apos;s health care bill, H.R. 3962 .  Here are a few:

 • Permits federal taxpayer funding of abortion services, above and beyond the status quo of current law.

• Provides for a &quot;health care czar&quot; called the Health Choices Commissioner, who could forcibly enroll individuals in government-run insurance and whose tasks include requiring random compliance audits on Americans&apos; health benefits plans.

• Allows for &quot;community organizations&quot; like ACORN and Planned Parenthood to assist the Health Choices Commissioner in enrolling individuals in the Health Insurance Exchange.

• Provides for 13 new and different tax increases, including an employer mandate excise tax.

• &quot;Grandfathers&quot; out of existence individual health insurance coverage.

• Retains the &quot;death panels&quot; by providing for bureaucrats working for a new comparative effectiveness institute funded by a tax on health benefits. The institute could publish the protocols needed to deny patients access to life-saving treatments on cost grounds.

• Contains NO ban on federal promotion of assisted suicide and/or health care rationing of treatments.

• Slashes Medicare payments to providers by more than $400 billion.

Another reason to floss

 There&apos;s growing evidence of a link between heart disease and gum disease. 

 That’s the conclusion of a “consensus’’ statement written by leading gum disease specialists and cardiologists published online earlier this year in the American Journal of Cardiology and the Journal of Periodontology.

“The mechanism of the relationship strongly points to inflammation’’ as the culprit in both cardiovascular disease and periodontitis, or gum disease, says Dr. Thomas E. Van Dyke, a professor of periodontology and oral biology at the Boston University School of Medicine.
--
Dr. Paul Ridker, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, notes that “cardiologists now understand that inflammation is a major risk factor for heart disease. Patients with periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis all have chronic inflammation, and all turn out to have higher cardiac risk than previously appreciated.’’

A girl is more likely to die from an adverse reaction to Gardasil than from cervical cancer

In 2006 the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug Gardasil as a vaccine against certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) which is the primary cause of cervical cancer in women.  Gardasil is manufactured by Merck and the company has aggressively marketed the drug  including political contributions through its PAC.

Many state and local governments have proposed that Gardasil be required for school girls as young as those entering the sixth grade.

 

Now one of the lead researchers for the Merck drug, Dr. Diane Harper,  says the &quot;Pubic should receive more complete warnings.&quot;

 &quot;Parents and women must know that deaths occurred. Not all deaths that have been reported were represented in Dr. Slade&apos;s work, one-third of the death reports were unavailable to the CDC, leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the CDC is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real, but small risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil.&quot;
 
After 26 million vaccinations, Dr. Harper says it will have NO effect on the rate of cervical cancer in the U.S.

 To date, 15,037 girls have officially reported adverse side effects from Gardasil to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). These adverse effects include Guilliane Barre, lupus, seizures, paralysis, blood clots, brain inflammation and many others. The CDC acknowledges that there have been 44 reported deaths.&quot; 

 Merck&apos;s Dr. Harper told CBS News that a girl is more likely to die from an adverse reaction to Gardasil than from cervical cancer. 
 
 What would be the point in promoting the inoculation of millions of girls and women with a useless, sometimes dangerous drug? And it really is useless: Merck&apos;s current project is to push it to pre-teen girls, but Dr. Harper pointed out that, once a girl hits puberty, any effectiveness of the vaccine disappears, and she has to start over again with the course of shots. And by the way, the efficacy of the drug in pre-teen girls hasn&apos;t actually been tested.
 

 One thing we know about Gardasil is that each three-dose treatment costs $360, which has helped Merck a lot. It&apos;s been one of the company&apos;s top-selling drugs.

Good news for chronic fatigue sufferers

Chronic fatigue syndrome has frustrated sufferers and doctors alike because nobody knew what caused the disease or how best to treat it.  That just changed.

 Scientists say that a retrovirus may cause chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis)

 Researchers found the virus, known as XMRV, in the blood of 68 out of 101 chronic fatigue syndrome patients. The same virus showed up in only 8 of 218 healthy people, they reported in the journal Science.
But lead scientist Judy Mikovits from the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada, said further blood tests revealed 95 per cent of the ME patients had antibodies to the virus. This indicated they had been infected with XMRV.

This indicated they had been infected with XMRV.
--

The XMRV virus is a retrovirus, like the HIV virus that causes AIDS. As with all viruses, a retrovirus copies its genetic code into the DNA of its host but uses RNA - a working form of DNA - instead of using DNA to do so.
 

 

 Reports the New York Times
 
 “I think this establishes what had always been considered a psychiatric disease as an infectious disease,” said Dr. Mikovits, who is research director at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Reno, a nonprofit center created by the parents of a woman who has a severe case of the syndrome. Her co-authors include scientists from the National Cancer Institute and the Cleveland Clinic.

Dr. Mikovits said she and her colleagues were drawing up plans to test antiretroviral drugs — some of the same ones used to treat HIV infection — to see whether they could help patients with chronic fatigue. If the drugs work, that will help prove that the virus is causing the illness. She said patients and doctors should wait for the studies to be finished before trying the drugs.

--
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said the discovery was exciting and made sense.

“My first reaction is, ‘At last,’ ” Dr. Schaffner said. “In interacting with patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, you get the distinct impression that there’s got to be something there.”
--

He added, “ This is going to create an avalanche of subsequent studies.”

Another NHS outrage

A plumber by trade, Torron Eeles fell down the stairs and broke his arm on December 3, 2008.

 
Here he is today

 Plumber with shattered arm left horrifically bent out of shape has operation &apos;cancelled four times&apos;
 

 Mr Eeles claims his first two operations at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital i... were cancelled due to a lack of beds and operating time respectively.

His third operation in February was postponed after he was found to have high blood pressure, while the fourth, scheduled for May, was abandoned because of concerns about his smoking.
 
He can&apos;t work, but because he can turn on a tap and raise his arm, he doesn&apos;t qualify for temporary disability benefits.

Government health care, government rules.  He didn&apos;t stop smoking, so no operation for him.

Why cut reimbursement rates to cardiologists and oncologists?

I&apos;m all for incentives to increase the number of doctors, especially general practitioners.

But I don&apos;t know why the Administration proposes to cut the prices paid for cardiologists and oncologists by 11% and 19% respectively so they can pay general practitioners more.

 Obama&apos;s War on Specialists 

 this boost for GPs comes at the expense of certain specialties. The 2010 rules, which will be finalized next month, visit an 11% overall cut on cardiology and 19% on radiation oncology. They&apos;re targets only because of cost: Two-thirds of morbidity or mortality among Medicare patients owes to cancer or heart disease.
--
The way Medicare works is that Congress decides each year how much it wants to spend on doctors, period. If one area of medicine receives a larger slice of this pie, another must accept a smaller one.
--
Jack Lewin, who heads the American College of Cardiology, said in an interview that the crackdown will cause &quot;a horrible disruption&quot; that will force many community and independent practices to close their doors, lay off staff or make senior patients wait days or weeks for tests and services.
--
HHS justified its decision with a flimsy survey whose data it won&apos;t release and whose results can&apos;t be replicated. Dr. Lewin told us that both HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and budget director Peter Orszag refuse to meet with him to discuss the topic.


 

Why heart disease and cancer, the biggest killers as people grow older?

Especially on top of a $500 billion cut in Medicare spending in the proposed health care bills.

Will seniors and boomers who are about to swell the senior ranks and so required to use Medicare stand for this?

Asperger Syndrome at work

Penelope Trunk, the Brazen Careerist, has Asperger&apos;s Syndrome.

 

This week she is offering career advice on How to deal with Asperger Syndrome at work .

 People often tell me that I should write career advice for people with Asperger Syndrome. This is because I am surrounded by people who have Asperger’s, and I have it myself.  Please, do not tell me I don’t have it. First of all, it looks very different in men and women, and most of you have experience with men. Second, I’m way more weird in person than I am on the blog. And surely you thought it was the other way around.

So, anyway, the reason I’m good at giving career advice is because I had to learn things systematically, which helps me break it down for everyone else.

For example, I had to learn that a candy dish on someone’s desk means “I like to talk with people.” Other people read this cue instinctively.
--

I don’t really do career coaching. I don’t have patience. But often career coaches send people with Asperger’s to me, because mostly, these people are extremely difficult to coach.

They are difficult to coach because the biggest problem is that non-verbal cues that are obvious to everyone else are totally lost on people with Asperger’s. For example, you can tell when you are boring someone, but someone with Asperger’s cannot—we just keep talking.

Playing football and concussions

Does getting hit and tackled week after week affect your future life?  Yes says a recent study commissioned by the National Football League.

Former players get Alzheimer&apos;s or other memory-related disease at a rate 19 times more than the normal rate for men 30-49.

 Dementia Risk Seen in Players in N.F.L. Study 

 The findings could ring loud at the youth and college levels, which often take cues from the N.F.L. on safety policies and whose players emulate the pros. Hundreds of on-field concussions are sustained at every level each week, with many going undiagnosed and untreated.

“This is a game-changer — the whole debate, the ball’s now in the N.F.L.’s court,” said Dr. Julian Bailes, the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the West Virginia University School of Medicine

Get More Sleep

 

Sleep boosts the immune system and Lack of Sleep Increases the Risk of Catching a Cold 

 Sleep and immunity, it seems, are tightly linked. Studies have found that mammals that require the most sleep also produce greater levels of disease-fighting white blood cells — but not red blood cells, even though both are produced in bone marrow and stem from the same precursor. And researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have shown that species that sleep more have greater resistance against pathogens.

“Species that have evolved longer sleep durations,” the Planck scientists wrote, “appear to be able to increase investment in their immune systems and be better protected.”

CBO vs AARP

The Congressional Budget Office director told Senator Max Baucus that his
 plan to cut $123 billion from Medicare Advantage—the program that gives almost one-fourth of seniors private health-insurance options—will result in lower benefits and some 2.7 million people losing this coverage .

 Medicare and Gag Orders 

 

Imagine that. Last week Mr. Baucus ordered Medicare regulators to investigate and likely punish Humana Inc. for trying to educate enrollees in its Advantage plans about precisely this fact. Jonathan Blum, acting director of a regulatory office in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), said that a mailer Humana sent its customers was &quot;misleading and confusing to beneficiaries, who may believe that it represents official communication about the Medicare Advantage program.&quot;

Meanwhile, we have the case of the Association for the Advancement of Retired Persons (AARP), and its fanciful Medicare claims. The self-styled seniors lobby is using all its money and influence to cheer on ObamaCare, even though polls show that most retired persons oppose it. AARP has spent millions of dollars on its TV ad campaign and bulletins and newsletters to its members, including eight million direct-mail letters over Labor Day. The AARP Web site claims that it is a &quot;myth&quot; that &quot;health care reform will hurt Medicare,&quot; while it is a &quot;fact&quot; that &quot;none of the health care reform proposals being considered by Congress will cut Medicare benefits or increase your out-of-pocket costs.

&quot;the person-hood of the patient is pushed to the margin of medical attention&quot;

Abraham Verghese is at the First Stanford Symposium on Bedside Medicine and reports

 An anthropologist from Mars looking at our hospitals might conclude that the &apos;work&apos; of medicine takes place in rooms far removed from the patient, typically in front of a computer screen. The actual patient and the person-hood of the patient is pushed to the margin of medical attention while the &apos;iPatient&apos;, the virtual patient rules.

Last night we talked about the ritual of the exam, and how important that ritual is. Rituals are about transformation, and the careful exam has all the elements of ritual, including a sacred space, a ceremonial garb (white coat and patient gown), a routine that is mysterious to the patient and includes disrobing and touch (which in any other context would be assault). Rituals are about transformation (think wedding, baptism etc) and this ritual when done well, is transformative, it establishes the physician-patient bond, it recognizes the body of the patient (the soma as opposed to the image of the body), and it is therapeutic, particularly in chronic disease, where the ritual repeated at every visit conveys to the patient that we are with them on the journey, we will not abandon them.

 If We Can&apos;t Measure It, It Doesn&apos;t Exist 

 

I&apos;ve been hearing from a doctor friend just how poorly trained new residents are in developing relationships with their patients.    We see fabulous technological advances in medicine, yet the art of medicine is neglected and that is where the trust and healing takes place.

Reason 568 on why not to pass health care reform bill

We could lose half the doctors practicing today.

 45% Of Doctors Would Consider Quitting If Congress Passes Health Care Overhaul 

 Two of every three practicing physicians oppose the medical overhaul plan under consideration in Washington, and hundreds of thousands would think about shutting down their practices or retiring early if it were adopted, a new IBD/TIPP Poll has found.

The poll contradicts the claims of not only the White House, but also doctors&apos; own lobby — the powerful American Medical Association — both of which suggest the medical profession is behind the proposed overhaul.

It also calls into question whether an overhaul is even doable; 72% of the doctors polled disagree with the administration&apos;s claim that the government can cover 47 million more people with better-quality care at lower cost.

&quot;Healthcare is the growth industry of the 21st century&quot;

Richard Fernandez discusses Another Point of View that takes into account the thinking of  Robert Fogel, Nobel Prize winning economist.

 Fogel argues that because most Americans have satisfactorily met their food, shelter and clothing needs, people are willing to spend a greater fraction of each extra dollar on health care, simply because it matters more to them then say, extra comestibles, which they have enough of. To some extent the American propensity to spend more on health care resembles the demand for a luxury good [2], “a good for which demand increases more than proportionally as income rises”.

---
An aging but still functional society, in Fogel&apos;s apparent view, would naturally demand more health care than skateboards, but for so long as they can sustainably pay for it through a well functioning market, there is no need to suppress demand. On contrary, health care will be one of the fundamental demand drivers of technology for biotechnology and other new industries way into the 21st century. In the long struggle between man versus death, humanity, having basically beaten starvation and cold, would naturally turn its efforts to fighting old age and disease.

 Consequently, there is no need to suppress the demand for healthcare. Expenditures on healthcare are driven by demand, which is spurred by income and by advances in biotechnology that make health interventions increasingly effective. Just as electricity and manufacturing were the industries that stimulated the growth of the rest of the economy at the beginning of the 20th century, healthcare is the growth industry of the 21st century . It is a leading sector, which means that expenditures on healthcare will pull forward a wide array of other industries including manufacturing, education, financial services, communications, and construction.

Seniors face cancer and cardiac care cuts

New policy changes at an office I had never heard of before -the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) - threatens access to medical services for millions of heart and cancer patients on Medicare.

 Medicare facing cancer and cardiac care cuts 
 
If enacted as scheduled on Jan. 1, 2010, policy changes recommended by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) -- the government&apos;s insurer for the elderly and disabled -- will severely cut current Medicare reimbursements to cardiologists and oncologists for critical care services that are provided to patients in physicians&apos; offices or other out-of-hospital setting, such as chemotherapy to treat cancer, and various cardiac procedures to monitor and treat heart disease, such as nuclear imaging and heart catheterization.
--

Yet the policymakers at CMS, who base their decisions on numbers and statistics, are unilaterally and dramatically changing the delivery of heart and cancer care by proclaiming that care for heart disease and cancer is too costly, while treatment for other diseases has greater value.Seniors

&quot;Largest event held in Washington, ever&quot;

In my lifetime, I have never seen such a spontaneous, self-organized rally of up to so many  --- 2 million people according to the Daily Mail, 60,000 according to ABC News.  The spokesman for the National Park Service is quotes as saying, &quot;It is a record.... We believe it is the largest event held in Washington, D.C., ever.&quot; 

 

It was a remarkable event by ordinary people who are rightly alarmed about what&apos;s happening and not happening in Washington.

Nick Gillespie on the scene says 

 First, the crowd was truly huge. Second, the crowd was from all over the place (both geographically and ideologically). And third, the crowd, well-behaved and stunningly normal in the main, was genuinely pissed off at out of control spending and government policies. &quot;Stop spending,&quot; was the basic answer to any questions about what Congress and the president should do come tomorrow. Throw the bums of either party out come next fall was the second most-common answer.

 I&apos;m with them, the people pushing back.  The government is not fixing the economy, but making everything worse.

The president&apos;s chief economic advisor Larry Summers warns that the unemployment rate could stay &quot;unacceptably high&quot; for years  which means no new jobs are being created in the private sector.

Already, 2 out of 5 Californians don&apos;t have a job !

 

So the idea we are starting a trade war with China at the behest of the steelworkers&apos; union is mind-boggling because it could so easily &quot;ratchet up into a full-blown trade war and inflict serious economic damage on both countries. &quot;

The problem that got us into this mess, the bad regulation of the financial services sector, has not and is not being fixed.

 Bloomberg reports that  Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize- winning economist  says

 the U.S. has failed to fix the underlying problems of its banking system after the credit crunch and the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

“In the U.S. and many other countries, the too-big-to-fail banks have become even bigger,” Stiglitz said in an interview today in Paris. “The problems are worse than they were in 2007 before the crisis.”
 
Which brings me to health care.    Why doesn&apos;t the President just fix Medicare and Medicaid which will go broke in the next 10 years?  Why does he want to cut benefits to seniors by cutting the only part Medicare that is competitive?

 Medicare  for Dummies says the Wall St Journal, with &quot;contradictions worthy of the Marx Brothers&quot;

 No cuts, for anyone—except, that is, for the 24% of senior beneficiaries [who] are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage program, which Democrats want to slash by $177 billion or more because it is run by private companies. Mr. Obama called that money &quot;unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies—subsidies that do everything to pad their profits but don&apos;t improve the care of seniors.&quot;

In fact, Advantage does provide better care, which is one reason that enrollment has doubled since 2003. It&apos;s true that the program could be better designed, with more competitive bidding and quality bonuses. But Advantage&apos;s private insurers today provide the kind of care that Mr. Obama said he would mandate that private insurers provide for the nonelderly—&quot;to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventative care.&quot;

Advantage plans have excelled at filling in the gaps of the a la carte medicine of traditional Medicare, contracting with doctors and hospitals to coordinate care and improve quality and covering items such as vision, hearing and management of chronic illness. If seniors in Advantage lose this coverage because of the 14% or 15% budget cut that Mr. Obama favors, well, that&apos;s &quot;waste and abuse.&quot;

Liposuction leftovers make easy stem cells

Who knew that recycling fat could have such astounding effects?

 Fat sucked out of chunky thighs or flabby bellies might provide an easy source of stem cells made using new and promising technology, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.

They found immature fat cells in the material removed during liposuction were easy to transform into cells called induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells.

They were easier to work with than the skin cells usually used to make iPS cells, the team at Stanford University&apos;s School of Medicine in California reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Alternative to hip replacement in our future

In what I think is a major medical breakthrough, British scientists are using adult stem cells to avoid hip replacements .

 
Doctors in Southampton are using the pioneering technique, where a patient’s damaged bones are repaired using their own stem cells.

Patients hailed the treatment, after many found they could walk normally again without any pain and without the need for hip replacement surgery.

So far six patients have had the treatment with only one failure, doctors said.
 
The numbers are small but the prospects are huge.

 Under the treatment, surgeons at Spire hospital used purified cells from bone marrow extracted from the pelvis.

The stem cells, which are immature cells that can develop into different kinds of tissue, were then mixed with “cleaned, ground-up” bone from another patient, after they had a hip replacement operation.

They then finished with dead tissue being removed before surgeons filled the cavity with the mixture of stem cells and donated bone.
--

Prof Oreffo, who is currently leading a team researching how stem cell technology can be used to repair human skeletal tissue, told Sky News that stem cells used chemical signals to attract blood vessels.

&quot;Bone is a living vibrant tissue. These stem cells generate new tissue and drive new blood vessel formation to bring in nutrients,&quot; he said.

Placebo effect = a reasonable expectation of getting better

In Wired, Placebos getting more effective.  Drugmakers are desperate to know why .  So what&apos;s the problem?

I n a 1955 paper titled &quot;The Powerful Placebo,&quot; published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Beecher described how the placebo effect had undermined the results of more than a dozen trials by causing improvement that was mistakenly attributed to the drugs being tested. He demonstrated that trial volunteers who got real medication were also subject to placebo effects; the act of taking a pill was itself somehow therapeutic, boosting the curative power of the medicine. Only by subtracting the improvement in a placebo control group could the actual value of the drug be calculated.
--
Beecher&apos;s double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial—or RCT—was enshrined as the gold standard of the emerging pharmaceutical industry . Today, to win FDA approval, a new medication must beat placebo in at least two authenticated trials.

Beecher&apos;s prescription helped cure the medical establishment of outright quackery, but it had an insidious side effect. By casting placebo as the villain in RCTs, he ended up stigmatizing one of his most important discoveries. The fact that even dummy capsules can kick-start the body&apos;s recovery engine became a problem for drug developers to overcome, rather than a phenomenon that could guide doctors toward a better understanding of the healing process and how to drive it most effectively.
 

 After prodding by Potter and others, the NIH focused on the issue in 2000, hosting a three-day conference in Washington. For the first time in medical history, more than 500 drug developers, doctors, academics, and trial designers put their heads together to examine the role of the placebo effect in clinical trials and healing in general.
--

Ironically, Big Pharma&apos;s attempt to dominate the central nervous system has ended up revealing how powerful the brain really is. The placebo response doesn&apos;t care if the catalyst for healing is a triumph of pharmacology, a compassionate therapist, or a syringe of salt water. All it requires is a reasonable expectation of getting better. That&apos;s potent medicine.

 The Way We Age Now
 

 
 

So I was quite interested in this profile on Atul Gawande in Harvard Magazine, Surgeon, Health Policy Scholar and Writer. 

 On the desk in his office at the Brigham is a framed copy of Sylvia Plath’s poem “The Surgeon at 2 a.m.” She describes a patient’s innards as “tubers and fruits/Oozing their jammy substances.” From the surgeon’s perspective, she writes: “I worm and hack in a purple wilderness.” Gawande notes that Plath, not a surgeon, nevertheless got things just right. “That,” he says, “is the really amazing thing, and that’s the difference between me and a real writer.”

He likes the Plath poem because it casts the surgeon in an ambiguous light. “Most writing about people in medicine casts them as either heroes or villains,” he says. “That poem captures the surgeon as a merely human, slightly bewildered, a little bit benighted person in a world that is ultimately beyond his control.”

Chocolate &apos;cuts death rate&apos; in heart attack survivors

I&apos;m putting together a post about all the good ideas for health care reform, but I couldn&apos;t resist this

 Chocolate &apos;cuts death rate&apos; in heart attack survivors 

 PARIS (AFP) – Heart attack survivors who eat chocolate two or more times per week cut their risk of dying from heart disease about three fold compared to those who never touch the stuff, scientists have reported.

Smaller quantities confer less protection, but are still better than none, according to the study, which appears in the September issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine.

Earlier research had established a strong link between cocoa-based confections and lowered blood pressure or improvement in blood flow.

It had also shown that chocolate cuts the rate of heart-related mortality in healthy older men, along with post-menopausal women.

But the new study, led by Imre Janszky of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, is the first to demonstrate that consuming chocolate can help ward off the grim reaper if one has suffered acute myocardial infarction -- otherwise known as a heart attack.

&quot;It was specific to chocolate -- we found no benefit to sweets in general,&quot; said Kenneth Mukamal, a researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a co-author of the study.
--

&quot;Our findings support increasing evidence that chocolate is a rich source of beneficial bioactive compounds,&quot; the researchers concluded.

Remarkable statement by American College of Surgeons

 The American College of Surgeons is &quot;deeply disturbed&quot;  by the uninformed public comments President Obama continues to make 

 Yesterday during a town hall meeting, President Obama got his facts completely wrong. He stated that a surgeon gets paid $50,000 for a leg amputation when, in fact, Medicare pays a surgeon between $740 and $1,140 for a leg amputation. This payment also includes the evaluation of the patient on the day of the operation plus patient follow-up care that is provided for 90 days after the operation. Private insurers pay some variation of the Medicare reimbursement for this service.

Three weeks ago, the President suggested that a surgeon’s decision to remove a child’s tonsils is based on the desire to make a lot of money. That remark was ill-informed and dangerous, and we were dismayed by this characterization of the work surgeons do. Surgeons make decisions about recommending operations based on what’s right for the patient.

We agree with the President that the best thing for patients with diabetes is to manage the disease proactively to avoid the bad consequences that can occur, including blindness, stroke, and amputation. But as is the case for a person who has been treated for cancer and still needs to have a tumor removed, or a person who is in a terrible car crash and needs access to a trauma surgeon, there are times when even a perfectly managed diabetic patient needs a surgeon. The President’s remarks are truly alarming and run the risk of damaging the all-important trust between surgeons and their patients.

We assume that the President made these mistakes unintentionally, but we would urge him to have his facts correct before making another inflammatory and incorrect statement about surgeons and surgical care.

Paglia calls it Obama&apos;s healthcare horror

La Paglia on Obama&apos;s healthcare horror 

 
But who would have thought that the sober, deliberative Barack Obama would have nothing to propose but vague and slippery promises -- or that he would so easily cede the leadership clout of the executive branch to a chaotic, rapacious, solipsistic Congress? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom I used to admire for her smooth aplomb under pressure, has clearly gone off the deep end with her bizarre rants about legitimate town-hall protests by American citizens. She is doing grievous damage to the party and should immediately step down.

There is plenty of blame to go around. Obama&apos;s aggressive endorsement of a healthcare plan that does not even exist yet, except in five competing, fluctuating drafts, makes Washington seem like Cloud Cuckoo Land. The president is promoting the most colossal, brazen bait-and-switch operation since the Bush administration snookered the country into invading Iraq with apocalyptic visions of mushroom clouds over American cities.

You can keep your doctor; you can keep your insurance, if you&apos;re happy with it, Obama keeps assuring us in soothing, lullaby tones. Oh, really? And what if my doctor is not the one appointed by the new government medical boards for ruling on my access to tests and specialists? And what if my insurance company goes belly up because of undercutting by its government-bankrolled competitor? Face it: Virtually all nationalized health systems, neither nourished nor updated by profit-driven private investment, eventually lead to rationing.

I just don&apos;t get it. Why the insane rush to pass a bill, any bill, in three weeks? And why such an abject failure by the Obama administration to present the issues to the public in a rational, detailed, informational way? The U.S. is gigantic; many of our states are bigger than whole European nations. The bureaucracy required to institute and manage a nationalized health system here would be Byzantine beyond belief and would vampirically absorb whatever savings Obama thinks could be made. And the transition period would be a nightmare of red tape and mammoth screw-ups, which we can ill afford with a faltering economy.
 
 As with the massive boondoggle of the stimulus package, which Obama foolishly let Congress turn into a pork rut, too much has been attempted all at once; focused, targeted initiatives would, instead, have won wide public support. How is it possible that Democrats, through their own clumsiness and arrogance, have sabotaged healthcare reform yet again? Blaming obstructionist Republicans is nonsensical because Democrats control all three branches of government. It isn&apos;t conservative rumors or lies that are stopping healthcare legislation; it&apos;s the justifiable alarm of an electorate that has been cut out of the loop and is watching its representatives construct a tangled labyrinth for others but not for themselves. No, the airheads of Congress will keep their own plush healthcare plan -- it&apos;s the rest of us guinea pigs who will be thrown to the wolves.

When dogs have it better off

Theodore Dalrymple on the British health service, Man vs. Mutt 

 In the last few years, I have had the opportunity to compare the human and veterinary health services of Great Britain, and on the whole it is better to be a dog.

As a British dog, you get to choose (through an intermediary, I admit) your veterinarian. If you don’t like him, you can pick up your leash and go elsewhere, that very day if necessary. Any vet will see you straight away, there is no delay in such investigations as you may need, and treatment is immediate. There are no waiting lists for dogs, no operations postponed because something more important has come up, no appalling stories of dogs being made to wait for years because other dogs—or hamsters—come first.

The conditions in which you receive your treatment are much more pleasant than British humans have to endure. For one thing, there is no bureaucracy to be negotiated with the skill of a white-water canoeist; above all, the atmosphere is different. There is no tension, no feeling that one more patient will bring the whole system to the point of collapse, and all the staff go off with nervous breakdowns. In the waiting rooms, a perfect calm reigns; the patients’ relatives are not on the verge of hysteria, and do not suspect that the system is cheating their loved one, for economic reasons, of the treatment which he needs. The relatives are united by their concern for the welfare of each other’s loved one. They are not terrified that someone is getting more out of the system than they.

Undue influence at the end of life

People are legitimately worried about the end-of-life provisions in the health care bill.  While I am all for end-of-life planning with the necessary documents and I&apos;m also against unnecessary medical treatments that can make the end of life a hell on earth, I believe these are private decisions by the person and the family involved.  When doctors are paid to initiate these conversations and have the ability to execute documents on the spot, I am very concerned that economic and political concerns will have too great an influence on a vulnerable population.

So is Charles Lane, a member of the editorial staff of the The Washington Post, who writes in Undue Influence 

 About a third of Americans have living wills or advance-care directives expressing their wishes for end-of-life treatment. When seniors who don&apos;t have them arrive in a hospital terminally ill and incapacitated, families and medical workers wrestle with uncertainty -- while life-prolonging machinery runs, often at Medicare&apos;s expense. This has consequences for families and for the federal budget.

Enter Section 1233 of the health-care bill drafted in the Democratic-led House, which would pay doctors to give Medicare patients end-of-life counseling every five years -- or sooner if the patient gets a terminal diagnosi

 

--
Patients may refuse without penalty, but many will bow to white-coated authority. Once they&apos;re in the meeting, the bill does permit &quot;formulation&quot; of a plug-pulling order right then and there. So when Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) denies that Section 1233 would &quot;place senior citizens in situations where they feel pressured to sign end-of-life directives that they would not otherwise sign,&quot; I don&apos;t think he&apos;s being realistic.

 
--
But Section 1233 goes beyond facilitating doctor input to preferring it. Indeed, the measure would have an interested party -- the government -- recruit doctors to sell the elderly on living wills, hospice care and their associated providers, professions and organizations . You don&apos;t have to be a right-wing wacko to question that approach.
 
Mickey Kaus puts it more succinctly 

 Tip for Dems: If you don&apos;t want people to think that subsidized, voluntary end-of-of-life counseling sessions are the camel&apos;s nose of an attempt to cut costs by limiting end of life care, then don&apos;t put them in a bill the overarching, stated purpose of which is to cut health care costs! .
 
Meanwhile we learn more about Oregon health care from a newspaper in Britain than we do in our own press

 The chilling truth about the city where they pay people to die 

 His body ravaged by cancer, lumberjack David Prueitt barely had the strength to raise the cup to his lips.

In it was a mix of apple sauce and dozens of crushed barbiturate pills, legally prescribed by the 42-year-old&apos;s doctor to end his life.

Within minutes, the drugs had started to take effect, the terminally-ill man slipping into unconsciousness as his wife sat by his side.

If all had gone to plan, David would have quickly and peacefully passed away, his breathing becoming more laboured until it eventually stopped altogether.

But it did not happen like that. Instead, after three days in a deep coma, David suddenly woke up. &apos;Honey?&apos; he said to his wife. &apos;What the hell happened? Why am I not dead?&apos;

For another 13 days, coherent but racked with pain, David survived before finally succumbing to the disease and dying naturally in his home near Portland, Oregon&apos;s most populous city.

In that time he would be transformed from just another death to be recorded under Oregon&apos;s policy of assisted suicide into a figurehead for opponents of the U.S. state&apos;s deeply controversial Death With Dignity Act.

&apos;He took five times the amount of barbiturates that should kill somebody and he still didn&apos;t die,&apos; his older brother Steve told the Daily Mail this week.

&apos;If anything, he should have been brain-dead. But he told us that, while unconscious, he had found himself before God and been told: &quot;Not this way, David.&quot; God chose David as his spokesman, absolutely.&apos;

He adds: &apos;It definitely made it very clear to me that we are not supposed to determine our own deaths.&apos;

&quot;Negative Economic Unit&quot;

 

 graphic from American Digest 
 

 

When Barbara’s lung cancer reappeared during the spring of 2008 her oncologist recommended aggressive treatment with Tarceva, a new chemotherapy. However, Oregon’s state run health plan denied the potentially life altering drug because they did not feel it was &quot;cost-effective.&quot; Instead, the State plan offered to pay for either hospice care or physician-assisted suicide.
--
The answer is simple. Oregon state officials controlled the process of healthcare decision-making—not Barbara and her physician. Chemotherapy would cost the state $4,000 every month she remained alive; the drugs for physician-assisted suicide held a one-time expense of less than $100. Barbara’s treatment plan boiled down to accounting. To cover chemotherapy state policy demanded a five percent patient survival rate at five years. As a new drug, Tarceva did not meet this dispassionate criterion. To Oregon, Barbara was no longer a patient; she had become a &quot;negative economic unit.&quot;

From the trenches

From the trenches, the perspective of a doctor, ObamaCare and me .

i n the past 6 months I have cared for three young children on Medicaid who had corneal ulcers. This is a potentially blinding situation because if the cornea perforates from the infection, almost surely blindness will occur. In all three cases the antibiotic needed for the eradication of the infection was not on the approved Medicaid list.

Each time I was told to fax Medicaid for the approval forms, which I did. Within 48 hours the form came back to me which was sent in immediately via fax, and I was told that I would have my answer in 10 days. Of course by then each child would have been blind in the eye.

Each time the request came back denied. All three times I personally provided the antibiotic for  each patient which was not on the Medicaid approved  list. Get the point -- rationing of care.
--

We are being lied to about the  uninsured. They are getting care. I operate  at least 2  illegal immigrants each month who pay me nothing, and the children&apos;s hospital at which I operate charges them nothing also.This is true not only on Atlanta, but of every community in America.

The bottom line is that I urge all of you to contact your congresswomen and congressmen and senators to defeat this bill. I promise you that you will not like rationing of your own health.

&quot;Bureaucratic prestidigitation&quot; on obesity

Did you ever wonder how so many Americans became obese, seemingly all of a sudden?

Blue Crab Boulevard explains
 
 The sudden upward spike is actually the result of bureaucratic fiat. The fact is that in 1998 the National Institutes of Health waved its magic wand and simply created the sudden, sharp spike with some bureaucratic prestidigitation:

In 1998, the National Institutes of Health lowered the overweight threshold for BMI 27.8 to 25 to match international guidelines. The move added 30 million Americans who were previously in the “healthy weight” category to the “overweight” category.
 
To be amazed and shocked by this shows a basic lack of fact-checking. People who had previously been completely “normal” (as if anyone really were) were suddenly reclassified as obese. Now the bureaucrats are demanding solutions to the crisis they manufactured out of thin air, so to speak.

Your Standing Army

Who knew that a spleen was so important?

 Finally, the Spleen Gets Some Respect 

 Scientists have discovered that the spleen, long consigned to the B-list of abdominal organs and known as much for its metaphoric as its physiological value, plays a more important role in the body’s defense system than anyone suspected.

Reporting in the current issue of the journal Science, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School describe studies showing that the spleen is a reservoir for huge numbers of immune cells called monocytes, and that in the event of a serious trauma to the body like a heart attack, gashing wound or microbial invasion, the spleen will disgorge those monocyte multitudes into the bloodstream to tackle the crisis.

“The parallel in military terms is a standing army,” said Matthias Nahrendorf, an author of the report. “You don’t want to have to recruit an entire fighting force from the ground up every time you need it.”

Question of the Day

In the long run obese people die sooner thus saving us money.  Sure, they are more expensive to treat on an annual basis, but since they die sooner, their lifetime health care costs are less.

Health news roundup

I am, alone of all my friends, a big milk drinker.  Yes, the milkman still delivers my milk in glass bottles each week straight from Crescent Ridge Farm. 

But I&apos;m not going to lord it over them that milk drinkers have longer lives because of the reduced incidences of coronary heart disease and stroke, up to 15-20%

But I will warn them against sunbeds.  Even before studies showed that tanning beds definitely cause cancer , DEFINITELY cause cancer, I wouldn&apos;t go near them given my red hair and pale and freckled skin.  I used to use those self-tanners but now I can&apos;t be bothered.

 A large independent review has show that organic food &apos;has no health benefits&apos; over conventionally grown food, but when it comes to certain fruits and vegetables, I discern a far better flavor.

But the worse health news of all is that Divorce damages your health - and getting remarried barely helps. 

 Divorced people have 20 per cent more chronic health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer than married people, according to the study of 8,652 people aged between 51 and 61 by Professor Linda Waite of the University of Chicago.

They also have 23 per cent more mobility problems, such as difficulty climbing stairs or walking short distances.

 

Do they have a &apos;right&apos; to health care?  Do the obese?  Do alcoholics?

No says Theodore Dalrymple in the Wall St. Journal There is no &apos;right&apos; to health care - for anyone.

 If there is a right to health care, someone has the duty to provide it. Inevitably, that “someone” is the government. Concrete benefits in pursuance of abstract rights, however, can be provided by the government only by constant coercion.
--
The question of health care is not one of rights but of how best in practice to organize it. America is certainly not a perfect model in this regard. But neither is Britain, where a universal right to health care has been recognized longest in the Western world.

Not coincidentally, the U.K. is by far the most unpleasant country in which to be ill in the Western world.

 I wondered about this talk of right to health care because if you have a right, how can the government can decide who gets what medical procedure?

 Econoblogger Megan McCardle describes it far more vividly

 
The other major reason that I am against national health care is the increasing license it gives elites to wrap their claws around every aspect of everyone&apos;s life.  Look at the uptick in stories on obesity in the context of health care reform.  Fat people are a problem!  They&apos;re killing themselves, and our budget!  We must stop them!  And what if people won&apos;t do it voluntarily?  Because let&apos;s face it, so far, they won&apos;t.    Making information, or fresh vegetables, available, hasn&apos;t worked--every intervention you can imagine on the voluntary front, and several involuntary ones, has already been tried either in supermarkets or public schools.  Americans are getting fat because they&apos;re eating fattening foods, and not exercising.  How far are we willing to go beyond calorie labelling on menus to get people to slim down?
--

These aren&apos;t just a way to save on health care; they&apos;re a way to extend and expand the cultural hegemony of wealthy white elites.  No, seriously.  Living a fit, active life is correlated with being healthier.  But then, as an economist recently pointed out to me, so is being religious, being married, and living in a small town; how come we don&apos;t have any programs to promote these &quot;healthy lifestyles&quot;?  When you listen to obesity experts, or health wonks, talk, their assertions boil down to the idea that overweight people are either too stupid to understand why they get fat, or have not yet been made sufficiently aware of society&apos;s disgust for their condition.  Yet this does not describe any of the overweight people I have ever known, including the construction workers and office clerks at Ground Zero.  All were very well aware that the burgers and fries they ate made them fat, and hitting the salad bar instead would probably help them lose weight.  They either didn&apos;t care, or felt powerless to control their hunger.  They were also very well aware that society thought they were disgusting, and many of them had internalized this message to the point of open despair.  What does another public campaign about overeating have to offer them, other than oozing condescension?

Vaccines now made with aborted fetal DNA

For some time now parents with autistic children, in numbers increasing every year,  wondered whether the vaccines given them had been contaminated with mercury in the form of Thimerosal, a mercury containing organic preservative.

The FDA has removed thimerosal from all vaccines given to children under 6 while conducting studies to determine whether vaccines containing trace amounts of mercury as a preservative in vaccines against contamination by microbes could have a causal relationship to autism.  They concluded on the basis of their studies and studies in the U.K. Denmark, and Sweden that it did not.

Now an even graver question has arisen.

 Is Aborted Fetal DNA in Vaccines Linked to Autism? 

 Despite research ruling out mercury (Thimerosal) or the measles portion of one specific vaccine, autism continues to rise to a level of one in every 64 children in the UK.

The NVAC [1] draft report recommends further study of the potential for vaccines to contribute to autism in children who have underlying mitochondrial disease, a worthwhile study given the clinical history of such children developing autism after vaccinations (see [2] Poling case). What the NVAC has overlooked, however, in their recommendations, is that epidemic regressive autism is associated with the switch from using animal cells to produce vaccines to the use of aborted human fetal cells for vaccine production. Now when we vaccinate our children, some vaccines also deliver contaminating aborted human fetal DNA. The safety of this has never been tested. 

Autism and autism spectrum disorder are polygenic diseases, meaning that multiple genes have been shown to be associated with these diseases. Studies have also clearly shown that there is an environmental component, a trigger, that is required. Vaccines are an obvious potential environmental trigger for autism because of the almost universal childhood exposure to vaccines in first world countries.
--
Those studies have largely ruled out the new measles portion of the MMR II or mercury as the environmental trigger for autism. However, the compelling temporal association between this new MMR vaccine and autism cannot be ignored or explained away. What has been ignored is the fact that this new MMR vaccine introduced the use of aborted fetal cells for vaccine production. At one point, as much as 94 percent of children in the U.S. and 98 percent of children in the UK were given this vaccine.
 
Today, more than 23 vaccines are contaminated by the use of aborted fetal cells. There is no law that requires that consumers be informed that some vaccines are made using aborted fetal cells and contain residual aborted fetal DNA.
--
Preliminary bioinformatics research conducted at SCPI indicates that “hot spots” for DNA recombination are found in nine autism-associated genes present on the X chromosome. These nine genes are involved in nerve-cell synapse formation, central nervous system development and mitochondrial function.

Could genomic insertion of the aborted fetal DNA, found in some of our childhood vaccines since 1979, be an environmental trigger for autism? Could the fact that genes critical for nerve synapse formation and nervous system development are found on the X chromosome provide some explanation of why autism is predominantly a disease found in boys? Could the “hot spots” identified in these autism-associated genes be sites for insertion of contaminating aborted fetal DNA?

 These questions must be answered, and quickly. Recent literature suggests that autism spectrum disorder may now impact one out of every 100 children. The pharmaceutical industry is also currently moving to replace more animal-produced vaccines with aborted-fetal-cell production and also to produce biologic drugs using aborted fetal cells.

More on rationing of medical care to seniors

 GovernmentCare’s Assault on Seniors 

 Since Medicare was established in 1965, access to care has enabled older Americans to avoid becoming disabled and to travel and live independently instead of languishing in nursing homes. But legislation now being rushed through Congress—H.R. 3200 and the Senate Health Committee Bill—will reduce access to care, pressure the elderly to end their lives prematurely, and doom baby boomers to painful later years.

The Congressional majority wants to pay for its $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion health bills with new taxes and a $500 billion cut to Medicare. This cut will come just as baby boomers turn 65 and increase Medicare enrollment by 30%. Less money and more patients will necessitate rationing. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 1% of Medicare cuts will come from eliminating fraud, waste and abuse.
 
How it began with comparative effectiveness research which Betsy McCaughey writes is code for limiting care based on the patient&apos;s age.

 The assault against seniors began with the stimulus package in February. Slipped into the bill was substantial funding for comparative effectiveness research, which is generally code for limiting care based on the patient’s age. Economists are familiar with the formula, where the cost of a treatment is divided by the number of years (called QALYs, or quality-adjusted life years) that the patient is likely to benefit. In Britain, the formula leads to denying treatments for older patients who have fewer years to benefit from care than younger patients.

When comparative effectiveness research appeared in the stimulus bill, Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., (R., La.) a heart surgeon, warned that it would lead to “denying seniors and the disabled lifesaving care.” He and Sen. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) proposed amendments to no avail that would have barred the federal government from using the research to eliminate treatments for the elderly or deny care based on age.
 
From Family Security Matters who,  unlike just about everyone in Congress, has read the health care  bill

 PG 425 Lines 4-12 Government mandates Advance Care Planning Consultations. Think Senior Citizens end of life prodding.

Pg 425 Lines 17-19 Government will instruct&amp;consult regarding living wills, durable powers of attorney. Mandatory!

PG 425 Lines 22-25, 426 Lines 1-3 Government provides approved list of end of life resources, guiding you in how to die.

PG 427 Lines 15-24 Government mandates program for orders for end of life. The Government has a say in how your life ends.

Pg 429 Lines 1-9 An &quot;advanced care planning consultant&quot; will be used frequently as patients’ health deteriorates.

PG 429 Lines 10-12 &quot;advanced care consultation&quot; may include an ORDER for end of life plans. AN ORDER from the Government to end a life!

Pg 429 Lines 13-25 - The Government will specify which Doctors can write an end of life order.

PG 430 Lines 11-15 The Government will decide what level of treatment you will have at end of life.

 

Who will decide what treatment you will get?  Your doctor or the government.  George Will asks about Our New Medical Judges? 

 If President Obama has his way, another such unelected authority will be created -- a manager and monitor for the vast and expensive American health-care system. As part of his health-reform effort, he is seeking to launch the Independent Medicare Advisory Council, or IMAC, a bland title for a body that could become as much an arbiter of medicine as the Fed is of the economy or the Supreme Court of the law.
--
Under his plan, the president would name five physicians or other health-care-savvy members to serve for five-year terms on its board, picking one of them as chairman. Like the nominees to the Fed and the Supreme Court, they would have to be confirmed by the Senate.

Each year, IMAC would have two responsibilities. First, it would recommend to the president updated fees that Medicare would pay doctors, hospitals, rehab centers, nursing homes, labs, home-care and ambulance services, equipment manufacturers, and all other providers. That is now done by Congress itself, and the lobbying by potent hometown individuals and institutions is one reason Medicare costs keep growing.
--
....Second, IMAC would annually recommend a set of broader reforms to improve the quality or reduce the cost of medical care. On each report, the president would have 30 days to approve or reject the recommendations, but he would have to act on the whole package, not pick it apart.

If he approved, the package would go to Congress and could be overruled only by joint action of the Senate and House within 30 days. Absent that, the secretary of health and human services would order the changes into effect.
---
 Americans will have to decide if they are comfortable having those commissioners determine how they will be treated when they are ill.

The Dirty Secret of ES

Just as the Obama administration has promulgated federal funding rules for embryonic stem cells,  Forbes magazine reveals The Dirty Secret of Embryonic Stem Cell Research 
 

Hope for any benefits from ES research is decades away.

 Thomson blamed simple biology. Among other problems, ES cells require permanent use of dangerous immunosuppressive drugs. T hey have a nasty tendency to form tumors both malignant and benign including teratomas--meaning &quot;monster tumor.&quot; Teratomas can grow larger than a football and can contain eyeball parts, hair and teeth. Yech!
 
OK, so how many &quot;decades?&quot;

&quot;The routine utilization of human embryonic stem cells for medicine is 20 to 30 years hence,&quot; embryonic stem cell research advocate William Haseltine and then-chief executive officer of Human Genome Sciences.
 
Others say &apos;three to five decades&apos; or &apos;never in my lifetime&apos;.

 Meanwhile adult stem cells (AS) have proved to be just as flexible as embryonic stem cells (ES) without the health concerns or moral baggage.

AS cells have now treated scores of illnesses including many cancers, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, immunodeficiency disorders, neural degenerative diseases, anemias and other blood conditions. They&apos;ve been used in over 2,000 human clinical trials. There has never been an ES cell clinical trial. Former National Institutes of Health director Dr. Bernadine Healy, once an ES cell research enthusiast,&quot; now calls them &quot;obsolete.&quot;

 That&apos;s why it hardly makes sense to vastly increase federal research funding for ES cells. Medical research spending is always a zero-sum game. However big the overall budget, every dollar approved for one grant is a dollar lost to others.
 

UPDATE; Researchers produce cells they say are identical to embryonic stem cells 

 Two groups of Chinese researchers have performed an unprecedented feat, it was announced today, by inducing cells from connective tissue in mice to revert back to their embryonic state and producing living mice from them.

By demonstrating that cells from adults can be converted into cells that, like embryonic stem cells from fetuses, have the ability to produce any type of tissue, the researchers have made a major advance toward eliminating the need for fetal cells in research and clinical applications.

&apos;Uh-oh&quot; on the Health Plan

I dislike being pressed to make any financial decision &quot;right now&quot; because I feel I&apos;m being swindled.    I feel that same way about the health care proposal now before the Congress.

What I read and see makes me want to yell to all of Congress, &quot;Stop, stop.  Go home.  Take a break and come to your senses.&quot;

 Wall St Journal 

 Mr. Obama&apos;s February budget provided the outline, but the House bill now fills in the details. To wit, tax increases that would take U.S. rates higher even than most of Europe. Yet even those increases aren&apos;t nearly enough to finance the $1 trillion in new spending, which itself is surely a low-ball estimate. Meanwhile, the bill would create a new government health entitlement that will kill private insurance and lead to a government-run system.

The most remarkable quality of this health-care exercise is its reckless disregard for economic and fiscal reality. With the economy still far from a healthy recovery, and the federal fisc already nearly $2 trillion in deficit, Democrats want to ram through one of the greatest raids on private income and business in American history. The world is looking on, agog, and wondering why the United States seems intent on jumping off this cliff. 
 
The Congressional Budget Director says all the various health care proposals will increase, not reduce federal government spending and so the Federal Budget is on an unsustainable path 

While the Vice President says We Have to Go Spend Money to Keep From Going Bankrupt 

The Investors&apos; Business Daily says the individual private health insurance is illegal under the House plan. I t&apos;s Not an Option
 

 It didn&apos;t take long to run into an &quot;uh-oh&quot; moment when reading the House&apos;s &quot;health care for all Americans&quot; bill. Right there on Page 16 is a provision making individual private medical insurance illegal.
 --
So we can all keep our coverage, just as promised — with, of course, exceptions: Those who currently have private individual coverage won&apos;t be able to change it. Nor will those who leave a company to work for themselves be free to buy individual plans from private carriers.
--
What wasn&apos;t known until now is that the bill itself will kill the market for private individual coverage by not letting any new policies be written after the public option becomes law.
-
The public option won&apos;t be an option for many, but rather a mandate for buying government care. A free people should be outraged at this advance of soft tyranny.
 

 Dick Morris points out that rationing health care  is inevitable and it&apos;s older people who will suffer the most.
 Obama’s health care proposal is, in effect, the repeal of the Medicare program as we know it. The elderly will go from being the group with the most access to free medical care to the one with the least access . Indeed, the principal impact of the Obama health care program will be to reduce sharply the medical services the elderly can use. No longer will their every medical need be met, their every medication prescribed, their every need to improve their quality of life answered.


It is so ironic that the elderly - who were so vigilant when Bush proposed to change Social Security - are so relaxed about the Obama health care proposals. Bush’s Social Security plan, which did not cut their benefits at all, aroused the strongest opposition among the elderly. But Obama’s plan, which will totally gut Medicare and replace it with government-managed care and rationing, has elicited little more than a yawn from most senior citizens.

Rick Moran asks 

So what do we get after spending at least a trillion dollars over 10 years? The [5] CBO says we would still have 17 million legal Americans not insured. We would also almost certainly have some form of rationing. And the chances are good that we would have a system performing much worse for people who are insured today.

Alive and happy

 

 At 19, Meg was told her brain tumor was inoperable by her British doctors.  Nonsense said her mother, I won&apos;t let my daughter die .

Without the doctor she found in Boston who did operate successfully, Meg would not be alive, married and with a new job in publishing and a new charity to give support to other people suffering with brain tumors.

Meg was out of hospital within three days and back home within the month, just in time to celebrate her 2:1 degree result. Soon after she took a job in publishing.

&apos;I can&apos;t forget about my brain tumour as I still have annual scans and will need them for the rest of my life,&apos; she says. &apos;But they show that everything is fine and there are no cancer cells. I&apos;m incredibly lucky.&apos;

Meg didn&apos;t hesitate when Josh, an investment consultant, proposed on a trip to Venice last summer.

&apos;Sadly Professor Black wasn&apos;t able to come to the wedding,&apos; says Meg. &apos;But Josh and I thought about him so much that day. I owe my life to him - and to my mum who wouldn&apos;t give up until she had found a cure.
--
&apos;I&apos;ve no doubt that, without my operation, I&apos;d now be dead. Britain is gradually catching up with America. But, sadly, we still don&apos;t yet have the same high level of technology. I wish everyone could have the same chance I had.&apos;

Coffee and Alzheimer&apos;s

 Daily caffeine dose may delay progress of Alzheimer&apos;s, researchers say 

 Three large cups of coffee a day could help to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s disease and even reverse the condition, researchers say.


A daily dose of caffeine can suppress the degenerative processes in the brain that can lead to confusion and memory loss, a study in mice suggests.

Although drinking coffee has previously been linked to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s, this is the first study to suggest that caffeine can directly target the disease itself.

&quot;Stirring up apathy&quot;

Mark Steyn on why &quot;stirring up apathy&quot; is the key to understanding the health care debate 

 Willie Whitelaw, a genial old buffer who served as Margaret Thatcher&apos;s deputy for many years, once accused the Labour Party of going around Britain stirring up apathy. Viscount Whitelaw&apos;s apparent paradox is, in fact, a shrewd political insight, and all the sharper for being accidental. Big government depends, in large part, in going around the country stirring up apathy – creating the sense that problems are so big, so complex, so intractable that even attempting to think about them for yourself gives you such a splitting headache it&apos;s easier to shrug and accept as given the proposition that only government can deal with them.

Take health care. Have you read any of these health care plans? Of course not. They&apos;re huge and turgid and unreadable. Unless you&apos;re a health care lobbyist, a health care think-tanker, a health care correspondent or some other fellow who&apos;s paid directly or indirectly to plow through this stuff, why bother? None of the senators whose names are on the bills have read &apos;em; why should you?

Adult stem cells cure a form of blindness

 

 Stem cells used to help cure sight loss
 

 COATING a common contact lens with stem cells could help restore a person&apos;s sight, Australian scientists have found .

University of New South Wales medical researchers used the technique to treat the damaged corneas of three patients, all of whose vision improved within weeks of the groundbreaking procedure.
--

Stem cells were harvested from the eyes of each patient and then cultured inside a contact lens, which was then stuck onto a damaged cornea in a &quot;transplant&apos;&apos; of regenerative cells.

&quot;The procedure is totally simple and cheap,&apos;&apos; said the university&apos;s Dr Nick Di Girolamo.

&quot;Unlike other techniques ... there&apos;s no suturing, there is no major operation, all that&apos;s involved is harvesting a minute amount - less than a millimetre - of tissue from the ocular surface.&apos;&apos;

The lens stayed on for 10 days allowing stem cells to change their form, colonise and repair the cornea. 

With so many successes from adult stem cells, I can not understand why any scientist or researcher would want to get entangled with the moral quagmire of embryonic stem research

Down syndrome gene starves tumor growth

A newly-discovered astonishing surprise of life: the extra chromosome carried by people with Down&apos;s syndrome carries a gene that causes cancer tumors to be starved of the blood they need to survive.

 &quot;Most people don&apos;t appreciate the fact that these individuals with Downs potentially hold a secret that might lead to quite substantial and revolutionary new treatments for cancer,&quot; said Dr. David Sweetser, who treats patients and researches cancer at MassGeneral Hospital for Children but was not involved in the Downs project. &quot;The obvious hope is that this is going to give us information to help develop a tool that we could use to treat a whole variety of solid tumors.&quot;

 Delaying Retirement Can Ward Off Alzheimer&apos;s Disease

Health care rationing has begun: the elderly hardest hit

Last week the  trustees reported that the Medicare will run out of money in less than 10 years, by 2017, two years ahead than projected last year.  Social security will run out of money in 2037.  It will start running deficits in 2017.  The trust funds have always been a fiction since the surpluses have been used to reduce budget deficits.

 From the summary issued by the trustees 
 Medicare&apos;s annual costs were 3.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008, or about three quarters of Social Security&apos;s, they are projected to surpass Social Security expenditures in 2028 and reach 11.4 percent of GDP in 2083. 

The argument goes Medicare is going to bankrupt us which is why we have to have universal health care.  To which Megan McArdle replies 

 I hear this argument quite often, and it&apos;s gibberish in a prom dress .  Any cost savings you want to wring out of Medicare can be wrung out of Medicare right now:
 

The Wall St Journal reports that t he &quot;unfunded liability&quot; of Medicare over the next 75 years is  $38 trillion .  Yes, trillion.  It&apos;s hard to wrap your mind around just how big a trillion is. 

 A trillion seconds ago, no one on this planet could read and write. Neither the Roman Empire nor the ancient Chinese dynasties had yet come into existence. None of the founders of the world&apos;s great religions today had yet been born.

A million seconds is 13 days.
A billion seconds is 31 years.
 A trillion seconds is 31,688 years
 

Do you believe the White House estimate that it could save $2 trillion in health care over 10 years just like that the Boston Globe asks.

President Obama is right that the cost of healthcare, now more than 16 percent of the economy, is simply unsustainable.
--
But will the industry&apos;s gauzy pledges of better coordination of care, more standardization of insurance claim forms, reduced administrative costs, and greater efficiency actually yield the promised savings?

Wesley Smith says we&apos;re Pushing Health Care Rationing By Not Discussing Health Care Rationing 

 rationing prohibits health care funders from paying for otherwise covered treatments, based on the patient’s age, state of health, disability, or perhaps, because the patient committed politically incorrect lifestyle crimes such as smoking or being overweight.
 

The rationing has already begun and the elderly are hardest hit.

Viking Pundit reports on a story in the Boston Globe on the &quot;pathbreaking effort to cut medical costs&quot; begun by Massachusetts General Hospital: send home the frail elderly from the hospital sooner and reduce their emergency room visits. 
 

Medicare is now the country&apos;s largest purchaser of health care.  OMB budget chief Peter Orszag believes that &quot;comparative effectiveness research&quot; will determine what works best.  Problem is virtual colonoscopies work best for the elderly but not for anyone else.  So as the  WSJ reports in How Washington Rations , Medicare now will refuse to reimburse for virtual colonoscopies.

The problem is that what &quot;works best&quot; isn&apos;t the same for everyone. While not painless or risk free, virtual colonoscopy might be better for some patients -- especially among seniors who are infirm or because the presence of other diseases puts them at risk for complications. Ideally doctors would decide with their patients. But Medicare instead made the hard-and-fast choice that it was cheaper to cut it off for all beneficiaries. If some patients are worse off, well, too bad.
---
All this is merely a preview of the life-and-death decisions that will be determined by politics once government finances substantially more health care than the 46% it already does. Anyone who buys Democratic claims about &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;affordability&quot; will be in for a very rude awakening.

David Brooks in Fiscal Suicide Ahead says that for Obama Health care costs are now the crucial issue of his whole presidency.

Sensible and cost-effective health care

For the past 50 years, we&apos;ve tried to control health care spending  and no one is satisfied with the results.  Yet, for the most part, we have better care, more advanced technology and more effective medicines than we did 50 years ago.  But there&apos;s no question we waste enormous amounts of money and even more is lost to fraud.  We cut back again and again on payments to doctors who treat Medicaid and Medicare patients with the result that make almost no money treating such patients.

Seems to me there are two ways to go.  Either the government takes over and imposes  price controls and rations health care or we let the market do it.  Now, I can hear you say, but the market hasn&apos;t done it and it&apos;s not fair.

One country did it and did it well while spending far less.    Singapore put the consumer in control with money each individual was required to put aside for health care.  By using the money wisely and getting the care they wanted, they had money left over they could use in retirement.  A twofer.

 American health care policies are sick by Robert Herbold

I believe it&apos;s just plain silly for the folks in Washington D.C. to consider spending an additional $600 billion for healthcare. Why throw money at an ineffective and bureaucratic system that is totally out-of-control? Why not figure out how to get it under control before deciding to drown it with more borrowed money from the Chinese or, even worse, further taxing the rich and thus retarding investment that might have a chance of turning around our economy?
--

So, what countries seem to be handling healthcare most effectively and efficiently? Well, there&apos;s one nation that has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world as well as the third longest average lifespan for its citizens - and it spends only 3.7 percent of its GDP on healthcare. That country is Singapore.
--

Singaporeans participate in a mandatory savings program that sets up a &quot;Medisave&quot; account for each individual. The individual is required to pay a small percentage of his or her income each month into that account, and employers also make a contribution. For individuals who are unemployed, there is a government subsidy. Singaporeans also engage in a &quot;Medishield&quot; program, which is a national catastrophic illness insurance plan. Premiums for the Medishield program are small, because it is government subsidized; as a result, the premiums are paid for out of an individual&apos;s Medisave account.

Choice and Competition

Most significantly, when individuals in Singapore feel the need to go to a physician, they select the doctor based on the quality of the care they believe they will get and the cost associated with going to that physician. In essence, physicians compete for the patient&apos;s business. Individuals select carefully since it&apos;s their Medisave account money that&apos;s used to pay for the chosen physician.

Individuals cannot take money out of their Medisave accounts except for medical use. On the other hand, these accounts grow steadily over time because the government invests these funds for the individual in a safe and modestly performing investment fund.

What&apos;s important here is that the money is not the government&apos;s. It&apos;s the individual&apos;s money and, at retirement age, people actually have access to these funds. That&apos;s why individuals use the funds wisely.

Good news on the health beat

 Eating fatty foods may boost your memory, say scientists 

 Researchers at the University of California-Irvine think so. A team of scientists found that oleic acids from fats are converted into a memory-enhancing signals in the part of the brain responsible for remembering emotional events.

Oleic acid, or OEA, is found in unsaturated fats - or so-called &quot;good fat&quot; - such as olive oil, grape seed oil and acai berries.
---

Researchers said OEAs helps animals remember where they found a nice, fatty meal.

&quot;By helping mammals remember where and when they have eaten a fatty meal, OEA&apos;s memory-enhancing activity seems to have been an important evolutionary tool for early humans and other animals,&quot; Dr. Daniele Piomelli said.

&quot;Remembering the location and context of a fatty meal was probably important survival mechanism for early humans.&quot;
 
My sister has had multiple sclerosis for thirty years so I really appreciate this quite good news Adult stem cells cure multiple sclerosis patient in Canada 

Alex Normandin, 26, of Montreal, Canada has been cured of his Multiple Sclerosis following the implantation of his own Adult Stem Cells. The stem cell therapy was done in conjunction with a research program in Ottawa with Dr. Mark Freedman.

Former FDA Commissioner David Kessler explores why we just can&apos;t resist fat, salt and sugar food when wrapped up together in &quot;highly palatable&quot; junk food. 
 Instead of satisfying hunger, the salt-fat-sugar combination will stimulate that diner&apos;s brain to crave more, Kessler said. For many, the come-on offered by Lay&apos;s Potato Chips -- &quot;Betcha can&apos;t eat just one&quot; -- is scientifically accurate.
--
&quot;Highly palatable&quot; foods -- those containing fat, sugar and salt -- stimulate the brain to release dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with the pleasure center, he found. In time, the brain gets wired so that dopamine pathways light up at the mere suggestion of the food, such as driving past a fast-food restaurant, and the urge to eat the food grows insistent. Once the food is eaten, the brain releases opioids, which bring emotional relief. Together, dopamine and opioids create a pathway that can activate every time a person is reminded about the particular food. This happens regardless of whether the person is hungry. 

Now that we know that, we can drink white tea that contains anti-obesity substances. 

 Marc Winnefeld led a t eam of researchers from Beiersdorf AG, Germany, who studied the biological effects of an extract of white tea – the least processed version of the tea plant Camellia sinensis. He said, &quot;In the industrialized countries, the rising incidence of obesity-associated disorders including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes constitutes a growing problem. We&apos;ve shown that white tea may be an ideal natural source of slimming substances&quot;.
 

With the rise of autistic disorders among Somali immigrants in Sweden and Minnesota, a condition that never appeared in Somalia,

Proponents of the vitamin D–autism link say there is biological plausibility to their theory. They cite a 2007 review by Allan Kalueff, a researcher now at Tulane University, in Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care. That review—based on more than 20 studies of animals and humans—concluded that vitamin D during gestation and early infancy was essential for &quot;normal brain functioning.&quot;

Swine Flu

The swine flu (H1N1) is transmitted from person to person like this.

 



I&apos;m late to post on the swine flu because I&apos;ve spent much of my time trying to figure out how serious it is and what the average person can do about it aside from washing their hands a lot and postponing any vacation to Mexico.    Apart from the baby who died in Texas, swine flu in the U.S. seems to be quite mild.    In Mexico, the crisis is severe with 149 deaths; the government is going all out to stem the spread canceling public events, closing schools and restaurants in Mexico City.

One of the most alarming bits of new was that Obama in Mexico earlier this month was showed around the city&apos;s anthropology museum by Dr. Felipe Solis who died the next day from &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms, making the President coming closer to almost anyone in the country to contracting the virus.  We did learn later that the President was fine and that Dr. Solis has died of pneumonia. 
 
There&apos;s no question that one of the consequences of a flat world, interconnected in ways unimaginable, that fears of a global pandemic will characterize our future.

 Contagion on a Small Planet 
 An urbanizing planet  knitted by transportation is an extraordinarily welcoming world for infectious disease, particularly easily transmitted viruses like the flu. That’s why it wasn’t surprising Saturday when the World Health Organization concluded that the outbreaks of swine flu focused in central Mexico as well as a school in New York City and several other places around the United States officially constituted “a public health emergency of international concern&quot;. 

My brother works for the WHO in Geneva and yesterday sent me this graph after WHO raised the global alert level to phase 4.  Click for larger image.

 



The good news is that the U.S. government is far better prepared to deal with a pandemic than it was a few years ago.  After the avian flu scare, President George Bush issued a pandemic flu preparedness plan. Since 2006, $6.2 billion has been appropriated to stockpile antivirals, step up surveillance and improve vaccine-making and technology.

 CDC tips for individuals 

What should you do?

1. Don&apos;t panic.  Eat pork if you want.
2. Wash your hands often with soap and water.
3. Have antibacterial handwash in your car so you can use it wherever you are.
4. If you are sick, stay home.  If you have flu symptoms, stay home unless you have difficulty in breathing, dizziness, pain in the chest or vomiting.  Then see a doctor.  The anti-viral drugs Tamiflu and Reflenza are only available with a doctor&apos;s prescription.
5. You might want a mask if you come into close contact with flu-infected people, either a disposable surgical mask or a painter&apos;s mask.  The most effective are N95 respirators but make sure they are approved by the CDC.
5. Check your own state of preparedness.

Do you have two weeks worth of food and water and necessary medications?

Cultivating Friendship

Close friendships often have a greater effect on health than a spouse or a family member.  They will shape your life, sustain it and make it better.

 What Are Friends For?  A Longer Life 

 Researchers are only now starting to pay attention to the importance of friendship and social networks in overall health. A 10-year Australian study found that older people with a large circle of friends were 22 percent less likely to die during the study period than those with fewer friends. A large 2007 study showed an increase of nearly 60 percent in the risk for obesity among people whose friends gained weight. And last year, Harvard researchers reported that strong social ties could promote brain health as we age.

“In general, the role of friendship in our lives isn’t terribly well appreciated,” said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. “There is just scads of stuff on families and marriage, but very little on friendship. It baffles me. Friendship has a bigger impact on our psychological well-being than family relationships.”

 

 

 The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one .
- Ralph Waldo Emerson

 It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them. 
- Ralph Waldo Emerson

 If a man does not make new acquaintance as he advances through life, he will soon find himself left alone. A man, Sir, should keep his friendship in constant repair .

Don&apos;t Let the Bedbugs Bite

Those nocturnal tiny insects that feed on the blood of humans are back. Jane Brody tells you how to keep them from biting.
 

 

 
 

 Although this blood-sucking parasite has been around for thousands of years, it was mainly associated with impoverished dwellings and fleabag hotels. Now, as the authors pointed out, “international travel, immigration, changes in pest control practices, and insecticide resistance” have ganged up to create “a resurgence in developed countries,” including the United States.

“Bed bug infestations have been reported increasingly in homes, apartments, hotel rooms, hospitals and dormitories in the United States since 1980,” they wrote. Reported infestations in San Francisco doubled from 2004 to 2006; telephone complaints in Toronto rose 100 percent in six months during 2002; and the number of bed bug samples sent to authorities in Australia was 400 percent higher from 2001 to 2004, compared with the previous three years.
--
Most people who are bitten by bed bugs do not react. Of the 30 percent or so who do, many mistake the small, pink, itchy bumps for mosquito bites, although people may become more suspicious and more sensitive with repeated bites....People who are highly sensitive react with intense itching that prompts scratching and can lead to infections......most bed bug lesions can be treated with an anti-itch product like calamine lotion or a topical or oral corticosteroid and antihistamine. If bites become infected, a topical or oral antibiotic may be needed.
 
Just don&apos;t pick up discarded mattresses, sofas or cushioned chairs off the street.

When you travel, check for bedbugs with the small flashlight you should always have with you.

If your bed has been infested, you have no choice but to call a professional.

Nasal irrigation for allergies

 Nasal irrigation works , as many recent studies attest, to ease allergy symptoms, stuffy nose and other nasal problems.
 
One benefit is that irrigation can clear nasal passages without dryness or “rebound” congestion, which occurs when overuse of decongestants leads to dependence and irritated tissue.

In one independent study in 2008, researchers examined a group of children with severe allergies. They found that regular nasal irrigation with a mild saline solution significantly eased symptoms and helped reduce the need for steroid nasal sprays. A 2007 study at the University of Michigan looked at 121 adults with chronic nasal and sinus problems. Over two months, the scientists found that those treated with nasal irrigation reported greater improvements than those treated with a spray.
 
The neti pot has been used for thousands of years, but some find it too awkward to use.  Today you can easily buy a saline spray that will remain sterile as long as you don&apos;t share it.    Natural and cheap.

Round-up of recent medical breakthroughs

If you or someone you love has to take a complicated regime of medicines, you might be pleased to learn that soon a microchip that tells the doctor if you&apos;ve taken your pills .

Digestible sensors in pills activate a harmless electrical charge when the pill is digested by the stomach which charge is picked up on a sensing patch on the patient&apos;s stomach that records the time and date the pill is digested,  sends it off to a mobile phone which in turn sends it to a secure web page.    Just 1 mm wide, the silicon microchips can&apos;t be seen by patients and can be added to any standard drug during the manufacturing process.

New research suggests that one speck of blood or tissue may be enough to diagnose cancer .

 Researchers at Stanford University, California, have developed a machine that separates cancer-associated proteins by means of their electric charge, which varies according to modifications on the protein’s surface.
 
There may be a &quot;good&quot; fat tissue - brown fat -that fights obesity but the downside is  that it works only when you turn down the heat and shiver.

And the best news of all. Bacon sandwich really does cure a hangover by boosting the level of amines which clear the head.

The Heart Can Change

 Even after a heart attack, the muscles of the heart can regenerate says the NIH

 It has long been assumed that when the heart is damaged — such as after a heart attack — heart muscle cells do not regenerate and the damage is permanent. This assumption has been challenged in recent years by evidence that heart muscle cells may in fact regenerate. Now, this latest research provides the most dramatic and clear-cut demonstration to date of heart cell regeneration after cardiac injury,&quot; says Claude Lenfant, M.D., director of the NHLBI, a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
 
You don&apos;t die with the same heart you were born with

 Heart muscle renewed over lifetime, study finds 

 About 1 percent of the heart muscle cells are replaced every year at age 25, and that rate gradually falls to less than half a percent per year by age 75, concluded a team of researchers led by Dr. Jonas Frisen of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The upshot is that about half of the heart’s muscle cells are exchanged in the course of a normal lifetime, the Swedish group calculates. Its results are to be published Friday in the journal Science.
 
Those nuclear weapons tested in the atmosphere until 1963 in essence &quot;labelled the cells of the entire world&apos;s population&quot;.

By measuring the amount of carbon 14 in the heart muscles, the scientists were able to calculate the turnover of cells in what was called a &quot;scientific tour de force&quot;

Gardasil, a boon or a danger?

In the past couple of years, the vaccine Gardasil has been touted as the best way to protect young women against cervical cancer.

Manufactured by Merck&amp;Co, the vaccine is designed to prevent the initial establishment of HPV, the human papillomavirius, that causes cervical cancer and is transmitted sexually.  Administered in three injections over six months, Gardasil is expensive ($360).

So effective was the new vaccine, many urged that it be given to all young teenage girls as a prophylactic before they became sexually active.  Some parents were horrified at the idea; most greeted the idea with great relief.

Since HPV infection shows no symptoms and has no cure , the vaccine was heavily promoted in commercials which showed teenage girls saying &quot;I want to be one less&quot; who gets the HPV virus.

A number of states mandated the vaccine despite the fact that no one knew the long term effects.

Now from CBS news comes new worries about Gardasil safet y and very serious side effects.

 The National Vaccine Information Center, a private vaccine-safety group, compared Gardasil adverse events to another vaccine, one also given to young people, but for meningitis. Gardasil had three times the number of Emergency Room visits - more than 5,000.

Reports of side effects were up to 30 times higher with Gardasil.

&quot;If I&apos;d have known, we never would have gotten the shot,&quot; said Emily Tarsell, whose daughter, Chris, died three weeks after her third Gardasil shot. She was one of the 29 fatalities reported in two years. &quot;And she&apos;d be here to hug.&quot;

Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder of the NVIC, said: &quot;Now we know from this report that there are more reactions and deaths associated with Gardasil than with another vaccine given in the same age group. It&apos;s irresponsible not to take action.&quot;
 
Mary Beth Bonacci says &quot;The vaccine is unnecessary, it&apos;s dangerous, and it&apos;s disabling and killing young women.&quot; 

 We have pap smears, which detect HPV-related warts and pre-cancerous changes to the cervix. It is because of our friend the pap smear that cervical cancer deaths declined 74% between 1955 and 1992 - - the same time period wherein the rate of unmarried sexual activity was rising dramatically. Those cervical cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society, continue to decline at a rate of about 4% a year.

We don&apos;t need Gardasil to prevent cervical cancer. Gardasil is the closest thing I&apos;ve ever seen to an out and out pharmaceutical hoax foisted on American women under the guise of &quot;public health.&quot;

Little girl saved

After little Morgan McCracken, 7, was hit in the head with a baseball in a backyard game, she seemed fine, but her parents, after reading about the death of Natasha Richardson took her to the emergency room after the little girl complained of a headache.

 Morgan was in such bad shape by the time they got there that she had to be transferred to a children&apos;s hospital by helicopter, where she was immediately taken into surgery, according to CNN.

The McCrackens learned there that Morgan had the same injury that Natasha Richardson had died of -- according to CNN, an epidural hematoma. Mr. McCracken told the cable news outlet: &quot;[Our doctor] told us that if we hadn&apos;t brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up.&quot;

But after Morgan&apos;s surgery and five days in the hospital, she&apos;s &quot;doing fine,&quot; according to CNN, which lists the danger signs to look out for in a head injury on their web site.

Cost of Alzheimer&apos;s, triple that of other older people

Another reason why Alzheimer&apos;s is the last thing you want to get.

 The health care costs of treating Alzheimer&apos;s are triple those of other older people and that doesn&apos;t  include the billions of hours of unpaid care from family members.

 That all adds up to at least $33,007 in annual costs per patient, compared with $10,603 for an older person without Alzheimer&apos;s, according to a report issued Tuesday by the Alzheimer&apos;s Association.
--
An estimated 5.3 million Americans have the disease; by next year nearly half a million new cases will be diagnosed, according to the Alzheimer&apos;s Association.

From 2000 to 2006, while deaths from heart disease, stroke, breast and prostate cancer declined, Alzheimer&apos;s deaths rose 47 percent.

Rethinking condoms

The Pope is in Africa, so naturally the talk turns to condoms.

 The premise of the question asked of the Pope was that the Catholic Church&apos;s position on AIDS was often considered unrealistic and ineffective. 

 &quot;I would say the opposite. I think that the reality that is most effective, the most present and the strongest in the fight against AIDS, is precisely that of the Catholic Church, with its programs and its diversity. I think of the Sant&apos;Egidio Community, which does so much visibly and invisibly in the fight against AIDS ... and of all the sisters at the service of the sick.

&quot;I would say that one cannot overcome this problem of AIDS only with money -- which is important, but if there is no soul, no people who know how to use it, (money) doesn&apos;t help.

&quot;One cannot overcome the problem with the distribution of condoms. On the contrary, they increase the problem.

&quot;The solution can only be a double one: first, a humanization of sexuality, that is, a spiritual human renewal that brings with it a new way of behaving with one another; second, a true friendship even and especially with those who suffer, and a willingness to make personal sacrifices and to be with the suffering. And these are factors that help and that result in real and visible progress.

&quot;Therefore I would say this is our double strength -- to renew the human being from the inside, to give him spiritual human strength for proper behavior regarding one&apos;s own body and toward the other person, and the capacity to suffer with the suffering. ... I think this is the proper response and the church is doing this, and so it offers a great and important contribution. I thank all those who are doing this.&quot;
 

Let&apos;s look at the  research done by Harvard professor Edward Green, senior research scientist at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies in &quot;Rethinking AIDS Prevention: Learning from Successes in Developing Countries&quot; , a book reviewed by Douglas Sylva in Saving Life 

There are, however, no condom &quot;successes&quot; in Africa. Something like 700 million condoms are shipped to the continent, year in and year out, courtesy of the U.N., the U.S., and the EU, yet infection rates remain stubbornly high. The UNICEF official approvingly cites Botswana&apos;s commitment to condoms — &quot;Let us follow the decision of the government of Botswana&quot; — but about 35 percent of that country&apos;s population is infected. That&apos;s the example the rest of the world should follow?

Whenever someone, usually an obscure African churchman, dares to raise such uncomfortable questions, the full might of the AIDS establishment comes down to smite him, and he is condemned as a religious zealot. Finally, though, there is a challenger to condom dominance who cannot be so easily dismissed. He is a distinguished public-health official, a paragon, in fact, of establishment credentials: Edward C. Green, senior research scientist at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. Green has had an epiphany of common sense and now has the courage to criticize the role of his colleagues as prophylactic missionaries to the Third World. In his important new book, Rethinking AIDS Prevention, he exposes the failure of the condom approach, and explains why AIDS experts cling to this failure.
--

Obviously, such people have a personal interest in ensuring that the basic lesson of the AIDS epidemic — promiscuous sex cannot be made consequence-free — never gets learned. As our &quot;polypartnering&quot; devotee makes clear, &quot;we should not use the HIV/AIDS crisis as an excuse to revert back&quot; to the bad old days of monogamy. And thus enters the lowly condom; it allows proponents of the sexual revolution to trumpet as &quot;safe&quot; risky sexual behavior.
--
Green makes the reasonable request that African public-health measures should be designed with the best interests of Africans in mind; most especially, that the schoolchildren of Africa should not be handed a box of condoms, and subjected to a program designed for the clients of New York&apos;s gay bathhouses, but encouraged instead to delay sexual activity.

Only calories count

It doesn&apos;t matter what your diet, only calories count.

Tara Parker-Pope: For people who are trying to lose weight, it does not matter if they are counting carbohydrates, protein or fat. All that matters is that they are counting something. 

 That is the finding of the largest-ever controlled study of weight-loss methods published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. More than 800 overweight adults in Boston and Baton Rouge, La., were assigned to one of four diets that reduced calories through different combinations of fat, carbohydrates and protein. Each plan cut about 750 calories from a participant’s normal diet, but no one ate fewer than 1,200 calories a day.

While the diets were not named, the eating plans were all loosely based on the principles of popular diets like Atkins, which emphasizes low carbohydrates; Dean Ornish, which is low-fat; or the Mediterranean diet, with less animal protein. All participants also received group or individual counseling.
--
The lesson, researchers say, is that people lose weight if they lower calories, but it does not matter how.

“It really does cut through the hype,” said Dr. Frank M. Sacks, the study’s lead author and professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health. “It gives people lots of flexibility to pick a diet that they can stick with.”

Playtime and nature time necessary for health and evelopment

 The brain uses two forms of attention. “Directed” attention allows us to concentrate on work, reading and tests, while “involuntary” attention takes over when we’re distracted by things like running water, crying babies, a beautiful view or a pet that crawls onto our lap.

Directed attention is a limited resource. Long hours in front of a computer or studying for a test can leave us feeling fatigued. But spending time in natural settings appears to activate involuntary attention, giving the brain’s directed attention time to rest.

“It’s pretty clear that all human beings experience attentional fatigue,” Dr. Faber Taylor said. “Our attention has to be restored from that fatigue, and there is a growing body of research evidence that nature is one way that seems particularly effective at doing it.”
 
The New York Times reports on recess.  Tara Parker-Pope concludes:
 The best way to improve children’s performance in the classroom may be to take them out of it.
 
 New research suggests that play and down time may be as important to a child’s academic experience as reading, science and math, and that regular recess, fitness or nature time can influence behavior, concentration and even grades.

Playtime and nature time are important not only for learning but also for health and development.

Gene linked to Alzheimer&apos;s

 Alzheimer&apos;s study finds parental link 

 Children of parents with Alzheimer&apos;s disease can develop memory problems in their 50s or even younger - much earlier than previously thought - according to a large study released yesterday by researchers at Boston University School of Medicine.

The study subjects, who carried a gene strongly linked to Alzheimer&apos;s, performed worse in memory tests, on average, than other middle-aged people who had the same gene but did not have a parent diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s. The difference in memory between the two groups was equivalent to approximately 15 years of brain aging, researchers found..

&quot;How big an effect we saw was surprising,&quot; said Dr. Sudha Seshadri, a BU associate professor of neurology and senior author of the study. &quot;It was like you were comparing two groups, 55-year-olds to 70-year-olds.&quot;

Doctor fixed data on autism

Surely you&apos;ve heard about the link between autism and vaccines.  Some parents have been terrified to have their young children vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. The fear of such vaccination led to the return of measles in England, Germany, Switzerland and Italy

The London Times reports that the doctor who sparked the scare with his study in the British medical journal Lancet
linking autism with vaccinations fixed the data to make the link.

 MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism. 

 THE doctor who sparked the scare over the safety of the MMR vaccine for children changed and misreported results in his research, creating the appearance of a possible link with autism, a Sunday Times investigation has found.
 
 Confidential medical documents and interviews with witnesses have established that Andrew Wakefield manipulated patients’ data, which triggered fears that the MMR triple vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella was linked to the condition.
--
Despite involving just a dozen children, the 1998 paper’s impact was extraordinary. After its publication, rates of inoculation fell from 92% to below 80%. Populations acquire “herd immunity” from measles when more than 95% of people have been vaccinated.

Last week official figures showed that 1,348 confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales were reported last year, compared with 56 in 1998. Two children have died of the disease.

Vitamin D to prevent MS

Maybe you&apos;ve heard the quote &quot;Genes Load the Gun, But Environment Pulls the Trigger&quot;.  That&apos;s what I thought of when I read this article in the London Times.

 Vitamin D is a ray of sunshine for multiple sclerosis patients 

 Multiple sclerosis could be prevented through daily vitamin D supplements, scientists told The Times last night.

The first causal link has been established between the “sunshine vitamin” and a gene that increases the risk of MS, raising the possibility that the debilitating auto-immune disease could be eradicated.

George Ebers, Professor of Clinical Neurology at the University of Oxford, claimed that there was hard evidence directly relating both genes and the environment to the origins of MS.  His work suggests that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and childhood may increase the risk of a child developing the disease.

He has also established the possibility that genetic vulnerability to MS, apparently initiated by lack of vitamin D, may be passed through families.  These risks might plausibly be reduced by giving vitamin D supplements to pregnant woman and young children.

“I think it offers the potential for treatment which might prevent MS in the future,” Professor Ebers said.  “Our research has married two key pieces of the puzzle. The interaction of vitamin D with the gene is very specific and it seems most unlikely to be a coincidence of any kind.”
--

Until now there has been no scientific proof of the links. However, Professor Ebers and his team have shown that vitamin D affects a particular genetic variant, identified as the one that increases the risk of developing MS threefold.

They suggest that a shortage of the vitamin alters this variant, thus preventing the immune system from functioning normally.

Adult stem cells reset immune systems in MS patients

This comes to late for my sister Debby who has had MS for more than 30 years but it offers great hope for early phase MS.

 Stem cells &apos;reset&apos; immune system in MS patients in study. 

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that impairs movement and coordination, while causing muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, slurred speech and vision problems.
--
But in the decade or more after onset, MS is characterised by gradual but irreversible neurological impairment. There is no known cure.

In clinical trials, a team of scientists led by Richard Burt of Northwestern University in Chicago essentially rebuilt the immune system of 21 adults -- 11 women and 10 men -- who had failed to respond to standard drug treatments.

First they removed defective white blood cells that, rather than protecting the body, attacks the fatty sheath, called myelin, that protects the nervous system.

The immune systems were then replenished with so-called haemopoeitic stem cells -- extracted from the patient&apos;s bone marrow -- capable of giving rise to any form of mature blood cell.
--

The procedure &quot;not only seems to prevent neurological progression, but also appears to reverse neurological disability,&quot; concluded the study, published in the British medical journal The Lancet.

The Sacrosanct Pill

 It&apos;s wise to be wary of the pill 

 According to the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations , an alarming rise in male infertility in developed nations is possibly caused by the quantities of synthetic female hormones, particularly estrogen, in the food chain and water. These quantities are directly attributable to increased use of the contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy.
--
Indeed, according to Canberra Hospital professor Peter Collignon, an opponent of recycling sewage water into the potable supply, estrogen can be more of a problem in recycled water than microbes because it cannot be filtered out and we simply do not know how well it breaks down. Just as the Romans drinking from lead cups unwittingly caused infertility in themselves, perhaps we are seeing after 30 years of contraceptive pill use the long-term effects of introducing artificial estrogen into our wider environment. So you see this is not just a preoccupation of the misogynistic old Vatican.

__
The evidence that synthetic hormones can have grotesque environmental effects has actually been around for a long time and it is mounting. As long ago as the 1980s, studies were done in the US which showed the effects of estrogen pollution on wildlife, famously alligators in Florida with deformed genitals.
--
There are so many reasons for being wary of the contraceptive pill. Why are we not questioning its prevalence?

The reason is, of course, that it is the sacred cow of the sexual revolution. One imaginative letter writer claimed the Catholic view of the pill was that it was &quot;the great Satan&quot;, and actually that is not a bad description. It was marketed as an instrument of sexual freedom, and it has provided that, particularly for men. But one might ask if for women it has been the means of sexual liberation or just a way of turning us into empty vessels for sex? Is it like the sexual revolution itself: a pretty and alluring package that turns out to be - for both sexes - like a series of empty boxes, one inside the other. At the end, there is nothing but an empty box.
 

It&apos;s astonishing when you think of it.  If there were any other cause for worldwide male infertility and environmental degradation, people would be up in arms.

Where is the EPA?  Where is the UN?  Where is the outrage?

Damage from Concussions

Maybe they don&apos;t pay professional athletes enough.  Take a look at the photo below to see the effect that repeated concussions have on a formerly healthy brain.

 

Until recently, the best medical definition for concussion was a jarring blow to the head that temporarily stunned the senses, occasionally leading to unconsciousness. It has been considered an invisible injury, impossible to test -- no MRI, no CT scan can detect it.

But today, using tissue from retired NFL athletes culled posthumously, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE), at the Boston University School of Medicine, is shedding light on what concussions look like in the brain. The findings are stunning. Far from innocuous, invisible injuries, concussions confer tremendous brain damage. That damage has a name: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

 Dead athlete&apos;s brains show damage from concussions. 

 CTE has thus far been found in the brains of six out of six former NFL players.

&quot;What&apos;s been surprising is that it&apos;s so extensive,&quot; said McKee. &quot;It&apos;s throughout the brain, not just on the superficial aspects of the brain, but it&apos;s deep inside.&quot;

CSTE studies reveal brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue of former NFL players who died young -- some as early as their 30s or 40s.

McKee, who also studies Alzheimer&apos;s disease, says the tangles closely resemble what might be found in the brain of an 80-year-old with dementia.

&quot;I knew what traumatic brain disease looked like in the very end stages, in the most severe cases,&quot; said McKee. &quot;To see the kind of changes we&apos;re seeing in 45-year-olds is basically unheard of.&quot;

The damage affects the parts of the brain that control emotion, rage, hypersexuality, even breathing, and recent studies find that CTE is a progressive disease that eventually kills brain cells. 

One man Chris Nowinski, once a Harvard football star, is responsible for starting these studies in the first place.
 
&quot;I realized when I was visiting a lot of doctors, they weren&apos;t giving me very good answers about what was wrong with my head,&quot; said Nowinski. &quot;I read [every study I could find] and I realized there was a ton of evidence showing concussions lead to depression, and multiple concussion can lead to Alzheimer&apos;s.&quot;

Nowinski decided further study was needed, so he founded the Sports Legacy Institute along with Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurosurgeon and the co-director of the CSTE. The project solicits for study the brains of ex-athletes who suffered multiple concussions.

Coffee Good

More evidence that coffee is good for you, in the short term and the long.

 Coffee Linked to Lower Dementia Risk
 

Drinking coffee may do more than just keep you awake. A new study suggests an intriguing potential link to mental health later in life, as well.
--

 After controlling for numerous socioeconomic and health factors, including high cholesterol and high blood pressure, the scientists found that the subjects who had reported drinking three to five cups of coffee daily were 65 percent less likely to have developed dementia , compared with those who drank two cups or less.
--
First, earlier studies have linked coffee consumption with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, which in turn has been associated with a greater risk of dementia. In animal studies, caffeine has been shown to reduce the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain , one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, coffee may have an antioxidant effect in the bloodstream, reducing vascular risk factors for dementia.
 

 Dr. Kivipelto noted that previous studies have shown that coffee drinking may also be linked to a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease.

Checklists cut surgery deaths by one third in Boston

 Harvard researchers report in the Boston Globe
 
 Deaths and complications dropped by an astounding one-third when operating room doctors and nurses completed a simple safety checklist before, during, and after surgery, according to a study led by Harvard researchers.

The eight hospitals that participated in the international study collectively reduced complications during hospital stays from 11 percent of patients before they began using the checklist to 7 percent of patients when using the checklist. Deaths dropped from 1.5 percent of patients to 0.8 percent.

&quot;It was beyond anything we expected,&quot; said Dr. Atul Gawande, senior author of the Harvard School of Public Health paper and a surgeon at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital. The impact of all the items on the checklist &quot;put together seems to have produced these really remarkable results,&quot; he said.
--
Completing the checklist out loud as a team is crucial to uncovering lapses that lead to problems, said Dr. Alex Haynes of the Harvard School of Public Health, the lead author and a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital.

&quot;Saying it verbally codifies things more than simply having one person check a box,&quot; Haynes said. It requires more attention, he said, and a greater sense of collective responsibility.
 
I posted The Art of Managing Extreme Complexity in the ICU over a year ago which excerpted chunks of Atul Gawande&apos;s article in the New Yorker.

One doctor looked at what happens when procedures are too complex to carry out reliably from memory alone by taking a page from pilot checklists.

Checklists help people with memory recall and make explicit the minimum, expected steps in complex processes.

What checklists do you use?

New and Improved and Free

Probably the best investment you can make in your own health and that of your family is to put together your family health history.

The Surgeon General agrees.  He&apos;s upgraded and simplified the software and it&apos;s all free.  Better  yet,  when you share your family health tree with a relative, the software can &quot;&apos;reindex&quot; so that relative becomes the center of his or her own tree and all that information you share takes its proper place.

 
Tracking red flags in family history 

 A good family health history is more important than a gene test in predicting your future medical needs, but it&apos;s hugely underused. Today, the government begins offering a free new service to try to change that - helping people compile a health history at home, e-mail it to relatives who can fill in the gaps, and even pop it into their doctors&apos; computers.

&quot;That is an amazingly positive investment,&quot; acting Surgeon General Steven Galson, whose office spearheaded the initiative, said. &quot;You&apos;re going to help your doctor learn a lot more about you by spending those 20 minutes, and you can share that invested time around your family and with your physicians.&quot;


The goal: Just as people create ancestral family trees, create a family &quot;health tree.&quot; It may sound old-fashioned in this era of gene discovery. But genetics specialists use these &quot;pedigrees&quot; to look for patterns of inherited illnesses that can provide a powerful window on someone&apos;s brewing health risks.

&quot;Family health history is the first genetic test, but it encompasses much more than genes,&quot; says James O&apos;Leary of the nonprofit Genetic Alliance.

A family&apos;s shared environmental or lifestyle factors are key, too. Add those together, and a family health tree &quot;is the way you identify what is important to pay more attention to,&quot; he explains.
---
A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found fewer than 30 percent of Americans have ever collected health information from relatives to compile such a history.


Today, the site reopens - at https://familyhistory.hhs.gov - after a high-tech facelift.

It&apos;s private; users download the information to their own computers. Then they can e-mail a tree-in-progress to relatives to fill in missing information.

&apos;Cancer-free&apos; comes at a cost

Now, that a &apos; Cancer-free&apos; baby is born in London, what will she die of?

 The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN.

Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems.

Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer.

People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetime.

 Not everyone is thrilled with this development.

&quot; This is not a cure for breast cancer,&quot; said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction.

What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects?

&quot;This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,&quot; she said. &quot;It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.&quot;

She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder.

&quot;They will be destroyed,&quot; she said. &quot;They will never be allowed to live.&quot;
--

Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are &quot;killed,&quot; she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal.

&quot;The message we are sending is: &apos;Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.&quot;

Deadly Scrubs

Yeew.  Guess what happened when hospitals stopped providing freshly-laundered scrubs for their doctors and nurses.

 Hospital Scrubs Are a Germy, Deadly Mess. Bacteria on doctor uniforms can kill you.

 Dirty scrubs spread bacteria to patients in the hospital and allow hospital superbugs to escape into public places such as restaurants. Some hospitals now prohibit wearing scrubs outside the building, partly in response to the rapid increase in an infection called &quot;C. diff.&quot; A national hospital survey released last November warns that Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infections are sickening nearly half a million people a year in the U.S., more than six times previous estimates.

The problem is that some medical personnel wear the same unlaundered uniforms to work day after day. They start their shift already carrying germs such as C.diff, drug-resistant enterococcus or staphylococcus. Doctors&apos; lab coats are probably the dirtiest. At the University of Maryland, 65% of medical personnel confess they change their lab coat less than once a week, though they know it&apos;s contaminated. Fifteen percent admit they change it less than once a month. Superbugs such as staph can live on these polyester coats for up to 56 days.

Do unclean uniforms endanger patients? Absolutely

 Blood Sugar Control Linked to Memory Decline 

 Spikes in blood sugar can take a toll on memory by affecting the dentate gyrus, an area of the brain within the hippocampus that helps form memories, a new study reports.

“When we think about diabetes, we think about heart disease and all the consequences for the rest of the body, but we usually don’t think about the brain,” he said. “This is something we’ve got to be really worried about. We need to think about their ultimate risks not only for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders, but also about their cognitive skills, and whether they will be able to keep up with the demands of education and a fast-paced complex society. That’s the part that scares the heck out of me.”

Red wine and marijuana

Via Ronnie Bennett, the pre-eminent elder blogger comes this news 
 
Memory can be an issue as we get older even without fear of dementia. Now, two new studies each have a different idea of what might help. You could try marijuana. Or, some different researchers suggest red wine. Make of it what you will.
 
Clicking on the links I found Scientists are high on the idea that marijuana reduces memory impairment 

 The more research they do, the more evidence Ohio State University scientists find that specific elements of marijuana can be good for the aging brain by reducing inflammation there and possibly even stimulating the formation of new brain cells.

The research suggests that the development of a legal drug that contains certain properties similar to those in marijuana might help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Though the exact cause of Alzheimer’s remains unknown, chronic inflammation in the brain is believed to contribute to memory impairment.

Any new drug’s properties would resemble those of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive substance in the cannabis plant, but would not share its high-producing effects. THC joins nicotine, alcohol and caffeine as agents that, in moderation, have shown some protection against inflammation in the brain that might translate to better memory late in life.
 
And Red, red wine: How it fights Alzheimer&apos;s 

 Reporting in the Nov. 21 issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry, David Teplow, a UCLA professor of neurology, and colleagues show how naturally occurring compounds in red wine called polyphenols block the formation of proteins that build the toxic plaques thought to destroy brain cells, and further, how they reduce the toxicity of existing plaques, thus reducing cognitive deterioration.

The Yawn Explained

I&apos;ve wondered about this all my life.  Why do we yawn?

Now, the Discovery channels claims to answer that question. It Cools Your Brain 

 If your head is overheated, there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll yawn soon, according to a new study that found the primary purpose of yawning is to control brain temperature.
The finding solves several mysteries about yawning, such as why it&apos;s most commonly done just before and after sleeping, why certain diseases lead to excessive yawning, and why breathing through the nose and cooling off the forehead often stop yawning.
The key yawn instigator appears to be brain temperature.
--

The new findings also explain why tired individuals often yawn, since both exhaustion and sleep deprivation have been shown to increase deep brain temperatures, again prompting a yawn-driven cool down. Yawning additionally appears to facilitate transitional states of the brain, such as going from sleep to waking periods.

&quot;Bouts of excessive yawning often precede the onset of seizures in epileptic patients, and predict the onset of headaches in people who suffer from migraines,&quot; he added.
 
Now  I recall when I used to suffer from migraines, I yawned a lot.

But Discovery solved the puzzle of why yawning is so contagious .

Some  contend it&apos;s the capacity for empathy, but why do we yawn just thinking about it?

Steve Platek, a cognitive neuroscientist at Drexel University is the go-to expert.
 
 Platek says he thinks it has to do with empathy. The way he sees it, the more empathetic you are, the more likely it is that you&apos;ll identify with a yawner and experience a yawn yourself. In a recent study, Platek looked at contagious yawning in people with &quot;high empathy,&quot; &quot;low empathy&quot; and everything in between. He found that higher empathy meant more yawn-susceptible and lower empathy meant more yawn-immune.

But that wasn&apos;t proof enough. So Platek put volunteers in M.R.I. machines and made them yawn again and again to pinpoint the areas of the brain involved. When their brains lighted up in the exact regions of the brain involved in empathy, Platek remembers thinking, &quot;Wow, this is so cool!&quot;

Some yawning researchers - of which there are few - have identified many types of yawns. There&apos;s the contagious yawn, the I&apos;m-tired yawn and the I-just-woke-up yawn. There&apos;s the threat yawn, which is the my-teeth-are-bigger-than-yours yawn that&apos;s so popular with primates. (&quot;People do it, too,&quot; says Platek, &quot;but unfortunately, we don&apos;t have scary teeth anymore.&quot;) There&apos;s also the sexual yawn. (One scientist claims that yawns are used in seduction.)

At some point, you have to wonder: why study yawning? It&apos;s quirky, interesting, but not important, right? Wrong, says Platek. Nearly every species on the planet yawns: insects, fish, birds, reptiles, mammals. &quot;Yawning is such a primitive neurological function,&quot; Platek says, &quot;it&apos;s a window into what happened during the evolution of the brain.&quot;

The good thing about yawning is that it&apos;s not boring. &quot;Scientists like me usually go to conferences and give talks about technical mumbo jumbo,&quot; Platek says. &quot;The audience always yawns, and we&apos;re up there thinking, Oh, man, they&apos;re so bored! But when I give a talk about yawning and they yawn, I think: Sweet! They&apos;re paying attention!&quot;

Carbs may turn out to be really good for you

 Cutting out the carbs may help you lose weight  -  but it can also help you lose your memory.

A study has found that dieters who avoid starchy foods do worse in mental tests than those who are allowed some pasta, bread and potatoes.

Carbohydrates are such an important source of energy for the brain that mental performance drops after just a week on an Atkins-style diet, the scientists found.
 
 Women who cut out carbohydrates &apos;could lose their memory.&apos; 

 The new study, carried out by scientists at Tufts University in Boston, America, looked at the impact of low-carb diets on the brain power of 19 women aged 22 to 55. The volunteers were put on either a low-calorie balanced diet or a low-carb diet.

Within a week, the ten women taking the low-carbohydrate diet were far worse at mental tests than those on the conventional low-calorie diet.

The tests looked at attention, long-term and short-term memory, visual attention and spatial memory.

The low-carb dieters showed a gradual decline in memory tasks compared with the low-calorie dieters.

Cold sores and Alzheimer&apos;s

Well this surprised me.

 Cold sore virus could be the clue to the cause of 60 per cent of Alzheimer&apos;s cases 

 The virus that causes cold sores may be one of the main causes of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, according to research that suggests that existing drugs could be used to treat the most common form of dementia.

Scientists at the University of Manchester have found new evidence that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) could be in up to 60 per cent of Alzheimer&apos;s cases.

The research, which was published in the Journal of Pathology, is in preliminary stages, but should the HSV1 role be confirmed, it could transform the way in which the debilitating disease is understood and treated.

The news is particularly exciting as products to treat the HSV1 virus are already widely available. Drugs including acyclovir and Zovirax have been on the market for many years, and are available over the counter.

&apos;One thing that is exciting about our research is that we already have drugs that have been used for a relatively long time against HSV1, which are cheap and well tolerated. If we are right, there is a good chance we could make progress quite quickly,&apos; said Professor Ruth Itzhaki, who led the research.

Distraction explains senior moments

Aging brings mental changes - including a slowdown of mere milliseconds - that drives us to distraction, Surveying the Brain for Origins of the Senior Moment in Science Journal by Robert Lee Holtz.

 Ms. Puccinelli, 69 years old, said. &quot;There is a lack of concentration. Because you&apos;re getting older, you get more concerned about it.&quot;

By recording the electrical activity of her mind at work, neurologist Adam Gazzaley at the University of California at San Francisco was using her healthy brain as a road map of mental changes that age brings to us all. In particular, Dr. Gazzaley and his colleagues were trying to understand why aging drives us all to distraction.
--
Among the brain circuits that focus attention and memory, his research suggests, aging is a matter of milliseconds. In experiments testing how well people of different ages could recall faces and landscapes, Dr. Gazzaley and scientists at UC Berkeley found that among older people, the brain was slightly slower -- 200 milliseconds or so -- to ignore irrelevant test information. That instant of interference was enough to disrupt a memory in the making, they found. 

We don&apos;t ignore distractions as easily as we once did.  Of course, diet and exercise play a role, but so does education.
 &quot;With the right kind of training, we can take an older mind and make it younger,&quot; Dr. Gazzaley says. &quot;The potential exists.&quot; 

A good social life also helps.
 An active social life also appears to slow the rate at which memory fails, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health reported this past July in the American Journal of Public Health.

 Despite its distractions, a healthy brain may also mellow with age. The roller-coaster rush of dopamine, a biochemical associated with heady feelings of reward, doesn&apos;t affect older people as strongly as it does the young, Dr. Berman reported this fall in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Is this evidence that, among older neurons and synapses, life can lose its savor? &quot;I would suggest it shows that older people are appreciating life in a different way,&quot; says Dr. Berman.

In other words, the dopamine drop may be a biochemical marker of something else: t he wisdom to accept with grace what we cannot change.

Mice with dementia

I don&apos;t know how much faith I&apos;d put in this, but it&apos;s another reason to avoid fast food unless you&apos;re on the road, pressed for time and really hungry.

 Research on mice links fast food to Alzheimer&apos;s 

 &quot;On examining the brains of these mice, we found a chemical change not unlike that found in the Alzheimer brain,&quot; Susanne Akterin, a researcher at the Karolinska Institutet&apos;s Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Research Center, who led the study, said in a statement.

&quot;We now suspect that a high intake of fat and cholesterol in combination with genetic factors ... can adversely affect several brain substances, which can be a contributory factor in the development of Alzheimer&apos;s.&quot;

&quot;It was like I was a fake person, like I didn&apos;t really exist&quot;

 US teen lives 118 days without a heart 
 
An American teen-ager survived for nearly four months without a heart, kept alive by a custom-built artificial blood-pumping device, until she was able to have a heart transplant, doctors in Miami said on Wednesday.

The patient, D&apos;Zhana Simmons of South Carolina, said the experience of living for so long with a machine pumping her blood was &quot;scary.&quot;

&quot;You never knew when it would malfunction...It was like I was a fake person, like I didn&apos;t really exist. I was just here,&quot; she said of living without a heart.

---
&quot;She essentially lived for 118 days without a heart, with her circulation supported only by the two blood pumps,&quot; said Dr. Marco Ricci, the hospital&apos;s director of pediatric cardiac surgery. During that time, Simmons was mobile but remained hospitalized.
--

 For now, D&apos;Zhana said she is glad she can now walk without the machine. She is looking forward to celebrating her 15th birthday on Saturday riding a boat off Miami&apos;s coast, and is grateful she will be able to see her five siblings and friends again soon at her home in Clinton, S.C.

Go to Church and Live Longer

The scientific evidence mounts:

 Attending Religious Services Sharply Cuts Risk Of Death, Study Suggests 

A study published by researchers at Yeshiva University and its medical school, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, strongly suggests that regular attendance at religious services reduces the risk of death by approximately 20 percent.
--

“Interestingly, the protection against mortality provided by religion cannot be entirely explained by expected factors that include enhanced social support of friends or family, lifestyle choices and reduced smoking and alcohol consumption,” said Dr. Schnall, who was lead author of the study. “There is something here that we don’t quite understand. It is always possible that some unknown or unmeasured factors confounded these results,” he added.

Others:

 Weekly Religious Attendance Nearly as Effective as Statins and Exercise in Extending Life 
 Improvements in life expectancy of those who attend religious services on a weekly basis to be comparable to those who participate in regular physical exercise and to those who take statin-type medications
 

 Go to Church and Breathe Easier 
 religious activity may protect and maintain pulmonary health in the elderly.

 Religious Attendance Linked to Lower Mortality in Elderly 
 The current findings build on a series of earlier studies at Duke and elsewhere showing that religious people have lower blood pressure, less depression and anxiety, stronger immune systems and cost the health care system less than people who are less religiously involved.
 
 Research Shows Religion Plays a Major Role in Health, Longevity 
 For the first time, that extra lifespan has been quantified. While there are differences between genders and races, in general those who go to church once or more each week can look forward to about seven more years than those who never attended.

Consolation for Allergy Sufferers

 Miseries of Allergies Just May Help Prevent Some Cancers
 
 Sneezing, coughing, tearing and itching just may help prevent cancer -- particularly colon, skin, bladder, mouth, throat, uterus and cervix, lung and gastrointestinal tract cancer, according to a new Cornell study.
 
Paul Sherman, Cornell professor of neurobiology and behavior led the team that analyzed 646 studies on allergies and cancers published over the past 50 years.
 
Sherman believes that allergy symptoms may help protect against cancer by shedding foreign particles from the body. Some of those particles, he said, might be carcinogenic or carry carcinogens.
--
.
So should people routinely suppress all allergy symptoms with medications? Sherman said the jury is still out. However, allergies are not merely disorders of the immune system, but rather are the evolved front line of defense against certain parasites and cancers. In sum, allergic reactions may be like fevers and morning sickness: uncomfortable responses that survived natural selection because they provided direct benefits.

Yoga on the Cancer Ward

Most philanthropists are happy to their names embossed on a plaque on a hospital wing.  Not Donna Karan, the fashion designer, who is bringing yoga teachers onto the cancer ward.

 In One Section of Beth Israel Hospital, Some Patients Are Saying &apos;Om&apos;, not &apos;Ah&apos; 

 While other hospitals in New York and across the country have dabbled in yoga, the new Beth Israel project is broader, better financed and more integrated into the medical protocol, and because of Ms. Karan’s concern that it might be dismissed as touchy-feely nonsense, it includes a research component. Ms. Karan hopes to prove that the Urban Zen regime can reduce classic symptoms of cancer and its treatment, like pain, nausea and anxiety (thereby cutting hospital stays and costs) and serve as a model for replication elsewhere.

Don&apos;t Go to the Hospital Alone

Not news, but important to remember.  Don&apos;t go to the hospital alone if you can possibly avoid it.

 Bedside Manner: Advocating for a Relative in the Hospital 

 Having someone with you in a hospital who is alert and asking questions can help stave off all kinds of potential problems, from mistaken identity to medication mixups to MRSA infections. An estimated 100,000 hospital patients die every year in the U.S. because of preventable errors. Many hospitals are under financial pressures to keep nursing staffs lean. A personal advocate can be a valuable resource. It doesn&apos;t have to be a relative -- and it can be more than one person -- as long as they know you and are willing to speak up.

&quot;If we could make only one change in health care, it should be to change the notion that families are visitors. Families are allies and partners for safety and quality,&quot; says Beverly Johnson, president of the nonprofit Institute for Family-Centered Care, which is leading a movement to involve families more.

A growing number of hospitals are doing just that -- including unlimited visiting hours, letting family members accompany patients to procedures and even stay during emergencies. &quot;We&apos;re drawing on the strength of the family. They&apos;re not out in the waiting room, wondering what&apos;s going on,&quot; says Pat Sodomka, senior vice president for Patient and Family-Centered Care at MCG Health Inc., which runs a 630-bed hospital in Augusta, Ga.

Is Addiction a False Spiritual Quest?

Is the medical approach to addiction fundamentally flawed?

 Mindful Hack reviews Theodore Dalrymple&apos;s book Romancing Opiates.
 
 . .. to conceive of opiate addiction as a disease seems, after my experience with thousands of drug addicts, to me to miss the fundamental point about it: that it is a moral or spiritual condition that will never yield to medical treatment, so called. 

This is a very literate way of explaining a situation often explained - as Dalrymple says - by recovered addicts in a much simpler way: &quot;I just didn&apos;t want to live that way any more.&quot; In my view, that is a form of spiritual experience - to discover that one need not live &quot;that way&quot; any more. 

Dalrymple worked for 14 years as a doctor in a larger general hospital and prison in a poor area of Britain.  Here he writes Heroin addiction isn&apos;t an illness --and we should stop spending millions &apos;treating it&apos;.
 
I had briefly run a drug-addiction clinic in a famous university town, at a time when I accepted what I now know to be myths about heroin addiction.
 

But as more addicts came to my attention -  I see up to 20 new cases a day in prison -  I began to think about it more. The medical perspective, that these people were ill and in need of treatment, seemed less and less convincing.

I discovered that most addicted prisoners stopped taking heroin in jail, even when it was available. They came into the prison starving and miserable, and went out relatively healthy.

--
There is a strenuous, almost outraged, rejection of the idea that addiction is, at bottom, a moral problem, or even that it raises any moral questions at all.

---
To conceive of heroin addiction as such seems to me to miss the fundamental point: it is a moral or spiritual condition that will never yield to medical treatment.
--
Having started with a vague supposition that the medical approach to addiction must be right, I came to a different conclusion: that such an approach, having started no doubt as an honest attempt to help addicts, now represented a combination of moral cowardice, displacement activity and employment opportunity.

The therapeutic juggernaut rolls on. It is easier, after all, to give people a dose of medicine than a reason for living. That is something the patient must minister to himself.

In coming to these conclusions, I felt I was living in a world in which the plainest of truths could neither be said out loud nor acknowledged.

Purple Tomato with Snapdragon Gene to Fight Cancer

By inserting two genes from a snapdragon into a tomato, British researchers breed purple tomatoes to fight cancer. 

 The snapdragon genes caused the fruit to produce high levels of anthocyanins, plant chemicals that give blackberries and blueberries their deep purple colour.

Research suggests that the compounds protect against certain cancers, as well as heart disease and age-related degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer&apos;s.

They may also combat inflammation, improve vision and hinder obesity and diabetes.
Both the skins and the flesh of the tomatoes are an intense deep purple colour. 

 

It worked on mice, trials with human volunteers are next.  Purple tomatoes could be on sale within three years but not in Britain or the EU which has far more rigorous safety tests for genetically modified food.

Placebos and Nocebos

 Half of U.S. doctors say they use placebo treatments.
 

About half of American doctors in a new survey say they regularly give patients placebo treatments – usually drugs or vitamins that won&apos;t really help their condition.

And many of these doctors are not honest with their patients about what they are doing, the survey found.

That contradicts advice from the American Medical Association, which recommends doctors use treatments with the full knowledge of their patients.

“It&apos;s a disturbing finding,” said Franklin G. Miller, director of the research ethics program at the U.S. National Institutes Health and one of the study authors. “There is an element of deception here which is contrary to the principle of informed consent.”
--

Most doctors used actual medicines as a placebo treatment: 41 per cent used painkillers, 38 per cent used vitamins, 13 per cent used antibiotics, 13 per cent used sedatives, 3 per cent used saline injections, and 2 per cent used sugar pills.

 Placebo from the Latin I will please. A doctor pleases the patient by prescribing a placebo,  a treatment that the doctor knows is ineffectual but the patient is led to believe is effective.

A placebo won&apos;t work if the patient knows it&apos;s a placebo.  So what to do about the ethical challenges?

Well to start, doctors shouldn&apos;t be prescribing antibiotics or sedatives.

 Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, one of the study’s authors, said doctors should not prescribe antibiotics or sedatives as placebos, given those drugs’ risks. Use of less active placebos is understandable, he said, since risks are low.

“Everyone comes out happy: the doctor is happy, the patient is happy,” said Dr. Emanuel, chairman of the bioethics department at the health institutes. “But ethical challenges remain.”
 

Mindful Hack writes about placebos and nocebos.
 

 Doctors use the placebo effect automatically in their work. For example, they behave confidently and reassuringly even when completely stumped by the patient&apos;s symptoms or faced suddenly with a life-threatening disorder. They are right to behave this way. A doctor&apos;s anxiety would trigger the placebo effect&apos;s evil twin, the nocebo effect. &quot;Nocebo&quot; means &quot;I will harm,&quot; and nocebos really do harm. Patients may be ill for longer periods and suffer worse symptoms if nocebo effects convince them that they are doomed.

Some consider the placebo effect a mystery. In March 2005, British science magazine New Scientist listed thirteen &quot;Things That Don&apos;t Make Sense&quot;, and the placebo effect was number one on their list. Of course, the placebo effect doesn&apos;t &quot;make sense&quot; if you assume, as they do, that the mind either does not exist or is powerless. The traditional Christian view is that the mind is grounded in the brain so long as we live in this world. Therefore, what the patient&apos;s mind perceives expresses itself in the brain and body. Both the placebo and nocebo effects are strong support for the traditional view.

Stayin&apos; Alive

The Bee Gees song Stayin&apos; Alive has almost the perfect rhythm to help jump-start a stopped heart. 

 The Seventies disco anthem contains 103 beats per minute, just three beats more than the 100 chest compressions per minute recommdended by the American Heart Association.

Keeping time with the song helped a small group of doctors at the University of Illinois medical school maintained close to the ideal number of chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

 “It’s a song everyone seems to know, whether they want to or not,” said Dr. David Matlock, the resident and researcher who led the study. He hopes further research will confirm its use in lay people trained in CPR as well.

 
What surprised me most in watching the great beginning to the movie Saturday Night Fever was that no one wore sports or running shoes.  No Nike or Reeboks to be seen.  John Travolta wears leather shoes to work in the paint store.

Prayer and Aspirin

Scientists are beginning to show that faith and belief in God can relieve pain. 

 Researchers at the Oxford Centre For Science Of The Mind, in Oxford University, in a study published in the journal Pain, conducted an experiment with electric shocks on 12 Roman Catholics and 12 atheists as they studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.

The Catholics in the experiment seemed to be able to block out much of the pain as they were able to activate part of the brain associated with conditioning the experience of pain, reported the Mail on Sunday. The study also found that participants who had strong religious belief could moderate their pain by thinking about it more positively.
--
The researchers found that the Catholics felt &quot;safe,&quot; &quot;taken care of&quot; and &quot;calmed down and peaceful,&quot; said that looking at the painting of the Virgin Mary.

Michael Gerson on the biological basis for spirituality, Faith Beyond the Frontal Lobes says
. .the brain is more like a muscle than a computer. The spiritual facility can be developed -- and it changes over our lifetimes, as our brains age. In this narrow sense, prayer and meditation work in the same way that aerobic training works on the heart muscle.

Beauty heals

From the New Scientist In pain?  Take one masterpiece, three times a day 

 THE power of art to heal emotional wounds is well known, but could contemplating a beautiful painting have the same effect on physical pain?

To investigate, Marina de Tommaso and a team from the University of Bari in Italy asked 12 men and women to pick the 20 paintings they considered most ugly and most beautiful from a selection of 300 works by artists such as da Vinci and Botticelli.
--
The subjects rated the pain as being a third less intense while they were viewing the beautiful paintings, compared with contemplating the ugly paintings or the blank panel. Electrodes measuring the brain&apos;s electrical activity suggested a reduced response to the pain when the subject looked at beautiful paintings

&quot;Being read your death sentence...

Robert Novak on his Brain Tumor 

 The first sign that I was in trouble came on Wednesday, July 23, when my 2004 black Corvette struck a pedestrian on 18th Street in downtown Washington while I was on my way to my office.
--
I promptly suffered another seizure in the ambulance, the second of three seizures that day. I gained admittance to the high-quality Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston, which has an excellent oncology staff. A biopsy was performed, which showed a large, grade IV tumor. In answer to my question, the oncologist estimated that I had six months to a year to live.

Being read your death sentence is like being a character in one of the old Bette Davis movies.

I believe I was able to withstand this shock because of my Catholic faith, to which I converted in 1998.

My dear friend, the Democratic political operative Bob Shrum, asked Sen. Kennedy&apos;s wife, Vicki, to call me about Dr. Friedman. I barely know Mrs. Kennedy, but I have found her to be a warm and gracious person. I have had few good things to say about Teddy Kennedy since I first met him at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, but he and his wife have treated me like a close friend. She was enthusiastic about Dr. Friedman and urged me to opt for surgery at Duke, which I did.

The Kennedys were not concerned by political and ideological differences when someone&apos;s life was at stake, recalling at least the myth of milder days in Washington. My long conversation with Vicki Kennedy filled me with hope.
--
There are mad bloggers who profess to take delight in my distress, but there&apos;s no need to pay them attention in the face of such an outpouring of good will for me. I had thought 51 years of rough-and-tumble journalism in Washington made me more enemies than friends, but my recent experience suggests the opposite may be the case.

Babies, Rickets and Breastfeeding

If a mother does not have enough vitamin, neither will the baby she breastfeeds.

Please check, no more babies with rickets.

 Vitamin D Deficiency May Lurk in Babies 

 “I thought I was doing the best thing for her,” said Stephanie Remy-Marquez, of Hyde Park, Mass., after blood tests showed her daughter had no detectable vitamin D. X-ray images of the baby’s wrists and knees showed the edges of the bones and growth plates as blurry and fraying instead of crisp and sharp.

“Breast milk is supposed to be an entire meal, dessert and drinks included,” Ms. Remy-Marquez said. “I thought it was the ultimate cocktail.”
--
Physicians have known for more than a century that exclusive breast-feeding may be associated with vitamin D deficiency and rickets, and that the condition is easily prevented and treated with inexpensive vitamin drops or cod liver oil. But doctors are reluctant to say anything that might discourage breast-feeding.

Now some researchers are also linking vitamin D deficiency with other chronic diseases like diabetes, autoimmune disorders and even cancer, and there have been calls to include blood tests of vitamin D levels in routine checkups.

You Got to Have Hope

Science Day reports on a growing body of research that suggests &apos;Hope&quot; Therapy Fights Depression.
 
We’re finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression.  And the good news is that hope is something that can be taught, and can be developed in many of the people who need it,” said Jennifer Cheavens, assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University.

“If you feel you know how to get what you want out of life, and you have that desire to make that happen, then you have hope,” Cheavens said.

Hope is different from optimism, which is a generalized expectancy that good things will happen, she said.  Hope involves having goals, along with the desire and plan to achieve them.

The downsides of the pill

 Oral Contraceptives Disrupt Ability to Choose Genetically Favorable Mate 
 
A recent study by the University of Liverpool found that the contraceptive pill may adversely affect a woman&apos;s natural ability to choose a genetically favorable mate.

According to Craig Roberts, a Lecturer in Evolutionary Psychology and one of the researchers in this study, women taking the pill began to prefer men with more genetically similar odors.  Addressing the implications of such a disruption, he states: &quot;Not only could [gene] similarity in couples lead to fertility problems, but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill, as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners.&quot;

These claims are not the first to question the pill&apos;s impact on hormone activity and sexuality.  Dr. David Brownstein, commenting on a study linking oral contraceptives to increased arterial plaque, emphasized the precarious balance of hormones needed for good health, a balance disrupted de facto in pill users:
Increased Risk of cerebrovascular disease and cervical cancer
&quot;Oral contraceptives totally disrupt the normal hormonal cascade. When the hormonal system is disrupted, cardiovascular disease, cancer, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and other serious illnesses will increase.  My clinical experience has clearly shown that it is impossible to adequately treat these illnesses if there is an imbalanced hormonal system/ 

 Increased risks of taking the pill 
 A woman taking the pill is 1.9 times more likely to die from cerebrovascular disease, it reports, and 2.5 times more likely to die from cervical cancer. The 25 year follow-up study with 46,000 British women also notes that the enhanced risk of death lasts for 10 years after women have stopped taking the pill.

American Life League President Judie Brown expressed great concern over the results of the study and the political agenda that pushes the use of the pill. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine any other drug with these documented lethal effects that would be applauded as a positive thing,&quot; she said. &quot;The truth is women are dying because they are using or have used birth control pills. We&apos;re not talking about increasing the risk of disease here. We&apos;re talking about death. Women are dying from the pill and no one seems to care.

&quot;For better or worse, for richer or poorer, for co-pays and deductibles.

Why some people are rushing into marriage.

 Health Benefits Inspire Rush to Marry or to Divorce 

Stephen L. J. Hoffman, an officiant at a wedding chapel in Covington, Ky., said he was no longer shocked that one of 10 couples cite health insurance as the reason they stand before him.

“They come in and say, ‘We were going to get married anyway, but right now we really need the insurance,’ ” said Mr. Hoffman. “There may be an unplanned pregnancy, or there is an illness, or they’ve lost their job and can’t get insurance.”

Though money and matrimony have been linked since Genesis, marrying for health coverage is a more modern convention. For today’s couples, “in sickness and in health” may seem less a lover’s troth than an actuarial contract. They marry for better or worse, for richer or poorer, for co-pays and deductibles.

More on why coffee is good

The York Times sorts out Coffee&apos;s Contradictions.
 
Coffee does not dehydrate, doesn&apos;t hurt your heart and in fact cuts cardiovascular risk if you drink no more than three cups a day, is unlikely to increase your blood pressure, cause cancer or lead to bone loss.

The health benefits of drinking coffee are considerable.

 Probably the most important effects of caffeine are its ability to enhance mood and mental and physical performance. At consumption levels up to 200 milligrams (the amount in about 16 ounces of ordinary brewed coffee), consumers report an improved sense of well-being, happiness, energy, alertness and sociability, Roland Griffiths of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine reported, although higher amounts sometimes cause anxiety and stomach upset.

Millions of sleep-deprived Americans depend on caffeine to help them make it through their day and drive safely. The drug improves alertness and reaction time. In the sleep-deprived, it improves memory and the ability to perform complex tasks.

For the active, caffeine enhances endurance in aerobic activities and performance in anaerobic ones, perhaps because it blunts the perception of pain and aids the ability to burn fat for fuel instead of its carbohydrates.

Recent disease-related findings can only add to coffee’s popularity. A review of 13 studies found that people who drank caffeinated coffee, but not decaf, had a 30 percent lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.

Another review found that compared with noncoffee drinkers, people who drank four to six cups of coffee a day, with or without caffeine, had a 28 percent lower risk of Type 2 diabetes. This benefit probably comes from coffee’s antioxidants and chlorogenic acid.

REMBER - Huge Breakthrough in Alzheimer&apos;s

 Daily pill that halts Alzheimer&apos;s is hailed as &apos;biggest breakthrough against disease for 100 years&apos;

 A new drug halts the devastating progress of Alzheimer’s disease, say British scientists.

It is said to be more than twice as effective as current treatments.

A daily capsule of rember, as the drug is known, stops Alzheimer’s disease progressing by as much as 81 per cent, according to trial results.

Patients with the brain disorder had no significant decline in their mental function over a 19-month period.

‘We appear to be bringing the worst affected parts of the brain functionally back to life,’ said Dr Claude Wischik, who led the research.

It is the first time medication has been developed to target the ‘tangles’ in the brain that destroy nerve cells, leading to deteriorating memory.

The drug helps to disrupt this process, preventing the formation of new tangles and loosening those already created.

Last night the findings were hailed as the biggest breakthrough in the battle against Alzheimer’s since 1907.

Contented Dementia

For those caring for a parent with Alzheimer&apos;s or dementia, Oliver James, one of Britain&apos;s leading clinical psychologists has a  new book that explains a revolutionary way to care for them, Using the Past to Sense of the Present 

He observed the work of his mother-in-law, Penny Garner.

 &quot;The SPECAL method works, irrespective of the cause,&quot; says Garner. &quot;It provides the key to communicating with the person and managing care in a way that vastly improves the quality of life.&quot;

As life expectancy increases, more people will develop dementia during their last years. The defining feature is generally described as short-term memory loss, but not by Garner. &quot;The key factor for me is that people are no longer able to store new facts about what has just happened, while continuing to store new feelings. I use the analogy of a photograph album. What SPECAL does is to make a present out of the past.&quot;
--

Dorothy died in 1984, when Garner was busy raising her three daughters. In 1990, however, Garner began working at Burford Hospital, Oxfordshire, with a group of day patients. Talking to them and their carers she refined her methods so that now, in the course of a two-hour interview, she can show the family how to keep the person contented. This involves identifying a familiar theme from the relative&apos;s past which gives them a link to established routines and a sense of independence.

SPECAL also teaches carers to avoid asking questions, because that means the person with dementia has to search their recent memories - and that can distress them. Carers are taught to supply reassuring information if the person with dementia asks questions. What the carer says is less important than the feelings their remark generates. The third rule is never to contradict, because that will also cause upset.
 

The book 24 hour Wraparound Care for Lifelong Well-being is available in England, but not yet in the United States.

Autism and television

Gregg Easterbrook reports on the study that TV Really Might Cause Autism. 

 Today, Cornell University researchers are reporting what appears to be a statistically significant relationship between autism rates and television watching by children under the age of 3.
--
The Cornell study represents a potential bombshell in the autism debate. &quot;We are not saying we have found the cause of autism, we&apos;re saying we have found a critical piece of evidence,&quot; Cornell researcher Michael Waldman told me.
--

If television viewing by toddlers is a factor in autism, the parents of afflicted children should not reproach themselves, as there was no warning of this risk. Now there is: The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends against any TV for children under the age of 2. Waldman thinks that until more is known about what triggers autism, families with children under the age of 3 should get them away from the television and keep them away.

Forty percent in a &apos;vegetative state&apos; are misdiagnosed

 John Cornwell writes about those trapped inside their bodies, apparently switched off to the world, 40% of whom are misdiagnosed in The Undead. 

 here’s at least one mordantly amusing and true story told to me by a psychologist at Putney’s Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability. “Young man with motorbike head injury in a coma. His mum, a keen evangelical, comes every day with friends to sing Onward, Christian Soldiers by his bedside. She’s hoping to stimulate his brain into action. It works: he comes round, but he can’t speak. So they fit him up with one of those Stephen Hawking-type laptops, and the first words he speaks are: “For God’s sake, Mum, shut it!” That’s about as funny as it gets on a brain-injury ward, but there’s a serious take-home message. Even minimally aware patients can retain emotions, personality, a capacity to suffer – and, as the young biker showed, attitude.
--
 
Cornwell writes about a small group of colleagues, Owen, the Prof,  Pickard Menon  and Coleman who are collaborating on innovative techniques for brain-damaged patients, the Impaired Consciousness Group.

 The biggest, most tragic clinical myth about brain injury today is that PVS can be reliably diagnosed by bedside observation alone. It has in fact been known for at least a decade, ever since a key survey of brain-injured patients, that misdiagnosis of the condition runs at more than 40%, a statistic originally calculated by Professor Keith Andrews, former head of the Putney hospital, and confirmed by recent surveys in Europe and North America. 
 

It&apos;s essential that we do the necessary imaging and brain-scanning to get the true information about patients before pulling the plug.    The demand for fresh organs for transplant is too great.

 According to Steven Laureys, professor of neurology at Liège University, there is constant pressure in many parts of the developed world to withdraw sustenance from vegetative patients in order to allow them to die so that their body parts can be harvested. In a recent study, Laureys reports, “slightly less than half of surveyed US neurologists and nursing-home directors believed that patients in a vegetative state could be declared dead”. His remarks should be set against the background of widespread shortages of organs and body parts for transplantation.

Misbegotten health policies for our daughters

Birth control  and sex education does no good for teen-age girls who want to get pregnant.

Girls know how to get pregnant.  Why do they choose to do so is the question.

In Planned Teen Parenthood , Daniel Moloney quotes research of sociologists who spent five years living in the same neighborhoods with poor unwed mothers.

 While the poor women we interviewed saw marriage as a luxury, something they aspired to but feared they might never achieve, they judged children to be a necessity, an absolutely essential part of a young woman’s life, the chief source of identity and meaning.
 
Moloney points out that providing contraception to teenagers without their parental consent or notification not only is common practice at high schools  but totally counter-productive.

 These girls need more parental involvement, not less. These young girls know how to have babies, so further sex ed isn’t needed. They want to have babies, so contraception is beside the point. The problem is that they think that they are ready to have babies, and they aren’t.

That’s where the parents should be stepping in, helping the girls to realize that they aren’t ready to be mothers...

Studies show that teens are less likely to have sex if they think their parents disapprove. But parents are often kept in the dark, thanks to misbegotten health care policies which view them as a threat to their daughter’s best interests.
__
 

Our nation’s “experts” are spectacularly ill-equipped to deal with teenage girls who want to be mothers. Indeed, laws designed to make contraceptives available to teenagers often make the problem worse.

Accidental Fungus

 Accidental fungus leads to promising cancer drug 
 

A drug developed using nanotechnology and a fungus that contaminated a lab experiment may be broadly effective against a range of cancers, U.S. researchers reported on Sunday.

The drug, called lodamin, was improved in one of the last experiments overseen by Dr. Judah Folkman, a cancer researcher who died in January. Folkman pioneered the idea of angiogenesis therapy -- starving tumors by preventing them from growing blood supplies.

Lodamin is an angiogenesis inhibitor that Folkman&apos;s team has been working to perfect for 20 years. Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology, his colleagues say they developed a formulation that works as a pill, without side-effects.

Vitamin D for chronic pain and fatigue

 An analysis of 22 clinical studies of patients with varied chronic pain and fatigue syndromes found almost all patients lacked vitamin D, U.S. researchers said.

Stewart B. Leavitt, editor of Pain Treatment Topics and author of the report, said when sufficient vitamin D supplementation was provided, the aches, pains, weakness and related problems in most of the patients either vanished or were at least helped to a significant extent.

Itching is something else utterly strange

Atul Gawande&apos;s essays in The New Yorker are always a must-read for me.

But I warn you, when you read The Itch, you will feel that &quot;diabolical and peculiar sensation&quot;.

You will want to scratch, so scratch and enjoy it.  So don&apos;t go so far as this poor woman.

 For M., certainly, it did: the itching was so torturous, and the area so numb, that her scratching began to go through the skin. At a later office visit, her doctor found a silver-dollar-size patch of scalp where skin had been replaced by scab. M. tried bandaging her head, wearing caps to bed. But her fingernails would always find a way to her flesh, especially while she slept.

One morning, after she was awakened by her bedside alarm, she sat up and, she recalled, “this fluid came down my face, this greenish liquid.” She pressed a square of gauze to her head and went to see her doctor again. M. showed the doctor the fluid on the dressing. The doctor looked closely at the wound. She shined a light on it and in M.’s eyes. Then she walked out of the room and called an ambulance. Only in the Emergency Department at Massachusetts General Hospital, after the doctors started swarming, and one told her she needed surgery now, did M. learn what had happened. She had scratched through her skull during the night—and all the way into her brain.
 
Itching it turns out is not pain,  but something else utterly strange.  Just why is it we can&apos;t tickle ourselves but we can  make ourselves itchy just by thinking about it?

Turns out it&apos;s all in our heads.  Direct visual input is only 20% of what we &apos;see&apos;; 80% comes from memory.

 The account of perception that’s starting to emerge is what we might call the “brain’s best guess” theory of perception: perception is the brain’s best guess about what is happening in the outside world. The mind integrates scattered, weak, rudimentary signals from a variety of sensory channels, information from past experiences, and hard-wired processes, and produces a sensory experience full of brain-provided color, sound, texture, and meaning. We see a friendly yellow Labrador bounding behind a picket fence not because that is the transmission we receive but because this is the perception our weaver-brain assembles as its best hypothesis of what is out there from the slivers of information we get. Perception is inference.
 
Best cure so far for those who experience sensations in &quot;phantom limbs&quot; is believe it or not -  a mirror.

 The mirror box, however, provides the brain with new visual input—however illusory—suggesting motion in the absent arm. The brain has to incorporate the new information into its sensory map of what’s happening. Therefore, it guesses again, and the pain goes away.

Wonder Drug &apos;Cures&apos; Shyness

Oxytocin, the natural hormone that assists childbirth bonding the mother to the infant, and dubbed the &apos;love drug&apos; because it also bonds lovers together is now being considered for use in the U.K. to treat shyness.

 Produced naturally in the brain during social interactions, it promotes romantic feelings, helps mothers bond with babies and makes people more sociable.

Oxytocin is released during orgasm and is also the key birthing hormone that enables the cervix to open and the contractions to work. Where labour has to be induced, it is often given to the mother intravenously to kick-start contractions.

Professor Zak said: &apos;We&apos;ve seen that it makes you care about the other person. It also increases your generosity towards that person. That&apos;s why (the hormone) facilitates social interaction.&apos;
 --

 Scientists find childbirth wonder drug that can &apos;cure&apos; shyness 

 Autistic patients given oxytocin as part of a study in New York found their ability to recognise emotions such as happiness or anger in a person&apos;s tone of voice - something which usually proved difficult - also improved.

Experiments by Dr Eric Hollander at the city&apos;s Mount Sinai School of Medicine found a single intravenous infusion of the chemical triggered improvements that lasted for two weeks.

Previous research has revealed autistic children have lower than usual levels of oxytocin in their blood.

Professor Zak said: &apos;Oxytocin does not cure autism, but it does reduce the symptoms.&apos;

Lance Armstrong Mice and &quot;Rediscovering the Logic of the Past&quot;

Just in time for aging boomers like myself, new drugs to treat aging on the horizon. 

 The general public has no idea what&apos;s coming,&quot; said David Sinclair, a Harvard Medical School professor who has made headlines with research into the health benefits of a substance found in red wine called resveratrol.
--
Sinclair said treatments could be a few years or a decade away, but they&apos;re &quot;really close. It&apos;s not something (from) science fiction and it&apos;s not something for the next generation.&quot;
--
He described how his research found that mice given large doses of resveratrol &quot;live longer, they&apos;re almost immune to the effects of obesity. They don&apos;t get diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer&apos;s as frequently. We delay the diseases of aging.&quot;

Sinclair showed video of mice on resveratrol running on a treadmill far more vigorously than those who didn&apos;t get the substance. He called them &quot;our Lance Armstrong mice.&quot;

A large dose meant the equivalent of a human drinking about 1,000 bottles of red wine daily, he said. 

The New York Times looks into it and finds New Hints That Red Wine May Slow Aging.
 
The secret appears to be protein agents that in people are called sirtuins.

And it seems Dr. Sinclair is co-founder of Sirtris, a start-up company seeking to develop drugs that activate sirtuins.

 &quot;The upside is so huge that if we are right, the company that dominates the sirtuin space could dominate the pharmaceutical industry and change medicine,” Dr. David Sinclair said.
--
the door has now been opened to drugs that exploit an ancient biological survival mechanism, that of switching the body’s resources from fertility to tissue maintenance. The improved tissue maintenance seems to extend life by cutting down on the degenerative diseases of aging.
 
I wonder whether the recent change in Burgundy resulting in a surge of quality will have any effect .

 The quality of Burgundy — red Burgundy in particular — has risen strikingly over the last two decades. From the smallest growers to the biggest houses, the standards of grape-growing and winemaking have surpassed anybody’s expectations. These days, Burgundy has very few bad vintages, and among good producers, surprisingly few bad wines.
--
“It’s not so much an improvement as a blooming,” said Becky Wasserman, an American wine broker who has lived in Burgundy since 1968. “It’s a realization of potential.&quot;
-
Most striking of all was the number of young producers making superb wines, whether they have taken charge of their family domains or started out new.
--
Few could have envisioned such a level of quality back in the early 1980s, a time when Claude Bourguignon, a French soil scientist who, with his wife, Lydia, works with numerous wine estates, famously said that the soil of the Sahara had more life in it than the soil of Burgundy.
-
Their first order of business was to wean the soil off two decades worth of chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.
--
Over the next 20 years a great many producers turned to organic farming, and others adopted biodynamic viticulture, a particularly demanding system that takes a sort of homeopathic approach to farming. These days it’s the rare farmer who still uses chemical herbicides in the vineyard.

“The soils are alive again,” Mr. Bourguignon said by telephone last week. “They’ve really changed, and it’s one of the reasons the wine has changed.”
--
“We can now understand what our grandparents were doing,” said Jean-Marie Fourrier of Domaine Fourrier in Gevrey-Chambertin. “We’re rediscovering the logic of the past.”

Drink Water from a Glass Not a Bottle

Drink water from a glass not a bottle unless you want &quot;smoker&apos;s lips&quot; , those lines and wrinkles around the lips that heavy smokers have.

 D.C. dermatologist Dr. Marilyn Berzin says &quot;When you&apos;re drinking from a water bottle, you&apos;re pretty much making the same face as you are when you&apos;re smoking a cigarette,&quot;

Berzin said that over time that face creates permanent lines.

People who drink from water bottles with either sport or straw tops or nozzles, consistently, all day long, for about two years, will start to develop noticeable smokers lips, according to Berzin.
 
Drinking from a wide-mouthed glass allows the upper lip to stay relaxed.

Health round-up

Three important medical advances this week.

 Enzyme drug  could reverse the onset of Alzheimer&apos;s 

 The researchers from Dundee University, led by Dr Calum Sutherland, say the enzyme can partially reverse the process that causes the abnormal structures of a protein called CRMP2.

This protein has a key role in the development of the &quot;tangles&quot; seen in Alzheimer&apos;s disease.
 
 Bone drug helped stave off breast cancer 
 
A drug used to strengthen the bones of women with breast cancer helped cut the risk of the cancer returning by 36 percent, European researchers said on Saturday, 
 
They said Zometa, sold by Swiss drug giant Novartis AG, helped women with early-stage breast cancer who were already taking hormone therapy to reduce their cancer risk. 
 
The finding comes from the first large-scale study to show a drug in the class known as bisphosphonates can reduce the risk that cancer will come back. 
 
&quot;I&apos;m convinced it&apos;s going to change the landscape,&quot; said Dr. Michael Gnant of the University of Vienna, who presented his findings at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. 
 
&quot;In these patients, I would expect it is going to be pretty much the standard of care pretty soon,&quot; Gnant said in a telephone interview. 

 A Mother&apos;s Gamble pays off 

Nate, a 2-year-old boy with a rare and deadly genetic disease that prevented his skin from attaching to his body was cured when a bone marrow disorder from his healthy 3 year-old brother gave him the protein, collagen VII,  he was born without.

Slow Medicine

Slow medicine encourages less aggressive and less costly care at the end of life reports the New York Times in For the elderly, being heard about life&apos;s end. 

 Grounded in research at the Dartmouth Medical School, slow medicine encourages physicians to put on the brakes when considering care that may have high risks and limited rewards for the elderly, and it educates patients and families how to push back against emergency room trips and hospitalizations designed for those with treatable illnesses, not the inevitable erosion of advanced age.

Slow medicine, which shares with hospice care the goal of comfort rather than cure, is increasingly available in nursing homes, but for those living at home or in assisted living, a medical scare usually prompts a call to 911, with little opportunity to choose otherwise.
--

The chief medical officer at U.C.L.A., Dr. Tom Rosenthal, said that aggressive treatment for the elderly at acute care hospitals can be “inhumane,” and that once a patient and family were drawn into that system, “it’s really hard to pull back from it.”

“The culture has a built-in bias that everything that can be done will be done,” Dr. Rosenthal said, adding that the pace of a hospital also discourages “real heart-to-heart discussions.”

Beginning that conversation earlier, as they do at Kendal, he said, “sounds like fundamentally the right way to practice.”

That means explaining that elderly people are rarely saved from cardiac arrest by CPR, or advising women with broken hips that they may never walk again, with or without surgery, unless they can stand physical therapy.
--

Some of those most in tune with slow medicine are the adult children who watch a parent’s daily decline. Suzanne Brian, for one, was grateful that her father, then 88 and debilitated by congestive heart failure, was able to stop medications to end his life.

“It wasn’t ‘Oh, you have to do this or do that,’ “ Ms. Brian said. “It was my father’s choice. He could have changed his mind at any time. They slowly weaned him from the meds and he was comfortable the whole time. All he wanted was honor and dignity, and that’s what he got.”

Is Vitamin D too good to be true?

Apparently not if you listen to the scientists .  Vitamin D could
 prevent cancer, heart disease and tuberculosis, preserve bones, and thwart autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile diabetes.
--
Just this month, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published a special supplement on Vitamin D highlighting widespread deficiencies &quot;in various populations throughout the world, including &apos;healthy&apos; people in developed countries where it was thought that Vitamin D deficiency was obsolete.&quot;


In March, Picciano chaired a session on Vitamin D at the Experimental Biology annual meeting, one of the largest gatherings of scientists in the world. Designed to pinpoint gaps in knowledge, the session was the second meeting on Vitamin D sponsored by the ODS in a year. In the wake of emerging positive results, the National Cancer Institute gathered scientists to review the nutrient&apos;s ability to reduce cancer risk, particularly of the breast, colon, prostate and lung. And last fall, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality issued an evidence-based review of Vitamin D that found it to be key for bone health at all ages, including in the prevention of falls in the elderly.

&quot;There are a lot of benefits to Vitamin D that have surfaced in the last 20 years,&quot; notes Hector DeLuca, a University of Wisconsin biochemist who has been a pioneer in Vitamin D research.

 

Normally, we&apos;d get our vitamin D from the sun, but now, given serious health and vanity concerns about damage to our skin, we take supplements.

Next time you go to the doctor, get your vitamin D level checked.  You may be surprised to learn that you too are deficient as are most adults in the U.S.

Lip Gloss Danger

You may think that your lip gloss offers a protective barrier against the sun, but experts say Lip gloss can invite skin cancer. 

 “These lip glosses can make more of the light rays penetrate directly through the skin instead of getting reflected off of the skin’s surface,” says Dr. Christine Brown, a dermatologist at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.
--

It&apos;s the moisture in lip gloss that&apos;s to blame, says Dr. Bruce Robinson, a Manhattan dermatologist. Your lips are equipped with a protective outer layer, but the hydration of a lip gloss &quot;kind of smooshes that down,&quot; Robinson says. Once that outer layer is effectively squashed, it&apos;s easier for UV rays to penetrate deeper into the skin.

&quot;Instead of having to travel through that thicker layer, it&apos;s more condensed,&quot; Robinson says. &quot;So the UV rays reach are reaching deeper layers of epidermis and dermis because you don&apos;t have this forcefield.&quot;
-
“Take a magnifying glass and put it over your lips,” Robinson says. When you apply lip gloss and go out in the sun, “that’s essentially what you’re doing.”
 

 

Just make sure your lip gloss or lip balm has SPF.

Doing Good with Menstrual Blood

If this is true, it&apos;s astonishing.

 Menstrual  Blood: A Valuable Source of Multipotential Stem Cells 
 Researchers seeking new and more abundant sources of stem cells for use in regenerative medicine have identified a potentially unlimited, noncontroversial, easily collectable, and inexpensive source -- menstrual blood.
--
Stromal stem cells derived from menstrual blood exhibit stem cell properties, such as the capacity for self-renewal and multipotency,&quot; said Amit N. Patel, MD, MS, Director of Cardiac Cell Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh&apos;s McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine. &quot;Uterine stromal cells have similar multipotent markers found in bone marrow stem cells and originate in part from bone marrow.&quot;
 
A day later, a Japanese study shows that cells from menstrual blood may be useful in repairing heart damage.
 
 The success rate is 100 times higher than the 0.2 to 0.3 percent for stem cells taken from human bone marrow, researcher Shunichiro Miyoshi, a cardiologist at Keio University&apos;s school of medicine, told French news agency AFP.

 

There&apos;s even a company that&apos;s begun menstrual blood banking !

It wasn&apos;t so long ago that the public and scientific consensus was that stem cells could only be harvested from human embryos.

I&apos;m not the only one who remembers the hysteria that surrounded President  Bush&apos;s decision not to allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. 

Charles Krauthammer does in Technology Vindicates Morality. So does the Anchoress who reminds us that embryonic stem cells have produced nightmarish results in the lab and never had a successful application. 

 

So far there have been 73 successful treatments using adult stem cells and none for embryonic stem cells. 

Doing good by doing no harm works.

Blueberries for the Great Forgetting

When David Brooks wrote The Great Forgetting that in era of aging population, &quot;memory is the new sex&quot;, he didn&apos;t know to add that blue is the new black.  Blue as in blueberries that is.  Or maybe he just forgot.

 Getting Forgetful?  Then Blueberries May Hold the Key 
 
Blueberries are a major source of flavonoids, in particular anthocyanins and flavanols. Although the precise mechanisms by which these plant-derived molecules affect the brain are unknown, they have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier after dietary intake. It is believed that they exert their effects on learning and memory by enhancing existing neuronal (brain cell) connections, improving cellular communications and stimulating neuronal regeneration.
 
And that&apos;s not all Science Daily has to say about blueberries.

Blueberries may act to protect the body against damage from oxidative stress and help your balance and coordination. A compound made of blueberries may become as effective in lowering cholestero l as commercial drugs with far fewer side effects.  After all, wild blueberries have been shown to relax arteries and reduce risks associated with cardiovascular disease.  And the natural pigments that produce that rich deep blue color may help prevent obesity.

Willpower is a muscle

I can remember hearing that willpower is a muscle that must be exercised to grow strong.

Now it seems that studies prove that consistently doing one activity that requires self-control seems to increase willpower.

 Tighten Your Belt, Strengthen Your Mind 

 In psychological studies, even something as simple as using your nondominant hand to brush your teeth for two weeks can increase willpower capacity. People who stick to an exercise program for two months report reducing their impulsive spending, junk food intake, alcohol use and smoking. They also study more, watch less television and do more housework. Other forms of willpower training, like money-management classes, work as well.
 
After giving up candy and chocolate for Lent, I found easier to control my sweet tooth by eating more fruits and vegetables for snacks and that effect has persisted after Easter.  Even though I now can eat all the chocolate I want, I &apos;m still cutting up cucumbers and celery for snacks.

Reversing cirrhosis

The advances in medical research are becoming astonishingly strange and small.

 Man-made molecules reverse liver cirrhosis in rats. 

Scientists in Japan have designed artificial molecules that when used with rats successfully reversed liver cirrhosis, a serious chronic disease in humans that until now can only be cured by transplants.
--

In the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers said they designed molecules that can block collagen production by liver &quot;stellate cells&quot;, which are also known to absorb vitamin A.

The scientists then loaded the molecules into carriers that were coated with vitamin A, which tricked the stellate cells into absorbing the molecules.

&quot;By packaging the (molecules) in carriers coated with vitamin A, they tricked the stellate cells into letting in the inhibitor, which shut down collagen secretion,&quot; the researchers wrote.

Drugs to reverse in humans may be available in just a few years.

Mind your belly

With the big health news being that a big belly can greatly increase a person&apos;s chance for Alzheimer&apos;s , I went searching around to see what was being offered on the Internet to reduce belly fat.

Forget the chinese herbs, the costly special supplements, the diet pills, the biggest fat burners seem to be ...apples and other fruit.

You can&apos;t get away from the simple truth.  Avoid fast foods, eat a variety of foods and plenty of fruits and vegetables and exercise.  Do that and all the odds are, you&apos;ll be fine and healthy.

Even Samuel Johnson knew that, “I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly, will hardly mind anything else.”

Dispatches from the Country of the Sick

Those of us, like me, who have always enjoyed good health still read accounts of those who are and who have been ill as messages from another country we never want to go to much as we wish the inhabitants well.

Cardiologist Dr. Thomas Graboys writes what it&apos;s like to be trapped in your own body with Parkinson&apos;s disease and betrayed by your own mind with an Alzheimer&apos;s-like dementia at 62. My Daily Battle. proves to be much easier with the support of a loving wife.

A riveting account of a brain scientist who suffered a stroke offers far more reports Tara Parker-Pope .

Insulin for a longer life

I have no idea what to make of this, but I&apos;ll pass it along anyway.

 Insulin could hold the key to long life, say scientists.
 
 Insulin may help us live longer and healthier lives, say scientists.
The drug used to treat diabetes slows the ageing process, according to their findings.

Researchers believe the insulin inhibits a gene which plays a part in ageing.

Living longer may have its downside

One of my favorite says is &quot;All blessings are mixed.&quot;

Now that we&apos;re living longer with fewer dying from heart disease and stroke, breast and prostate cancer than ever before, something else is going to kill us.

The Alzheimer&apos;s Association projects that 10 million baby boomers will suffer from Alzheimer&apos;s.

 Alzheimer&apos;s to Hit 1 in 8 Boomers 

 One aspect of the report says that, if they live to age 55, women are nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer&apos;s as men. The report&apos;s authors say that&apos;s also age-related. When researchers measure the risk of developing Alzheimer&apos;s at any particular age, men and women show no real difference, Senay notes. But to the extent that they outlive men, women are considered more likely to develop the Alzheimer&apos;s.

 

The good news is that the BigPharma is racing to develop cures.

Brighter future for Type 1 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes usually starts during childhood or adolescence unlike Type 2 diabetes which is an adult-onset disease often linked to obesity.

Those children and adolescents afflicted with Type 1 diabetes suddenly have a much brighter future thanks to some terminally ill mice who were returned to health after injection of BCG vaccine.

 Human trials to begin at MGH on &apos;diabetes cure&apos; 

 The first step in the human study is to determine whether the same strategy using BCG vaccination can be used to modify the abnormal autoimmune cells present in type 1 diabetes, sometimes called “juvenile-onset” diabetes.
--
“One of the beauties of this is that BCG is a drug that has been tried and tested for 80 years, “ said Dr Faustman.

“There is no multi- million-dollar drug approval pipeline. It is a generic drug and will be cheap to administer if it works for humans.”

Roundup of Good News on the Health Front

One of the biggest problems in caring for old people who live on their own is making sure they take their medicine.  One in three adults fail to take their prescribed medication.

New technology may help where nothing else does.  The Magnetrace.

 Sensor necklace records when pill is swallowed and prompts patient when it is time to take another. 

 &quot;Forgetfulness is a huge problem, especially among the elderly, but so is taking the medication at the wrong time, stopping too early or taking the wrong dose,&quot; said Maysam Ghovanloo, assistant professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology&apos;s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. &quot;Studies show that drug noncompliance costs the country billions of dollars each year as a result of re-hospitalization, complications, disease progression and even death.&quot;
 

There&apos;s a lot more going on in our guts than we know.

 Diabetes may be disorder of upper intestine: Surgery may correct it. 

 Dr. Rubino, who is a professor in the Department of Surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College and chief of gastrointestinal metabolic surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell.... &quot;When we bypass the duodenum and jejunum, we are bypassing what may be the source of the problem, 

Those gut feelings we have?  Researchers at Leeds have reviewed the literature and say Go with Your Gut 
 intuition is the result of the way our brains store, process and retrieve information on a subconscious level and so is a real psychological phenomenon which needs further study to help us harness its potential.
 
Researchers have found a protein in embryonic stem cells that inhibits the growth and spread of malignant melanoma , the deadly skin cancer.

And Training in the Arts Makes People Smarter. 

“A life-affirming dimension is opening up in neuroscience,” said Dr. Gazzaniga, “to discover how the performance and appreciation of the arts enlarge cognitive capacities will be a long step forward in learning how better to learn and more enjoyably and productively to live.&quot;

Pay more for your placebos

 More expensive placebos bring more relief 

 In marketing as in medicine, perception can be everything. A higher price can create the impression of higher value, just as a placebo pill can reduce pain.

Now researchers have combined the two effects. A $2.50 placebo, they have found, works better one that costs 10 cents.
--

“It’s all about expectations,” said the lead researcher, Dan Ariely,....“When you’re expecting pain relief, you’re secreting your own opioids,” Dr. Ariely added. “And when you get it on discount, you doubt it, and your body doesn’t react as well.”

The Flat Lesions that Lead to Colon Cancer

With colon cancer, the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States, an increasing number of people, having reached age 50,  are girding themselves for their first colonoscopy.

Anyone who&apos;s had one can tell you that the worst part is the preparation when you must drink what seems like gallons of a lime-flavored drink that operates as a harsh laxative.  One in four people can&apos;t take it and don&apos;t drink it all.

Now we learn that flat or depressed lesions can&apos;t be seen if there is any waste left in the intestine.  Yet, Easily Overlooked Lesions Tied to Colon Cancer.
 
 The study also raises doubts about whether “virtual colonoscopy,” performed by a CT scanner, will ever be able to take the place of the colonoscope inserted into the rectum, as many patients had hoped. The problem is that CT scans use X-rays to reveal shapes, and find polyps because they stick out. Flat lesions are unlikely to show up in such scans.

When &quot;Safe Sex&quot; Isn&apos;t

Too many young people think that oral sex is safe.  As Doctor Bernadine Healey points out in Clueless on STDs, Throat Cancer and Oral Sex.
 
 People seem clueless that sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human papillomavirus can take hold in parts of the oral cavity during sex with infected partners and that the oral contact can infect the genitals, too. HPV is a particularly scurrilous threat, since it incubates silently in the back of the mouth and is now linked to a dangerous form of throat cancer in both men and women similar to the one that arises in the cervix.
 
There&apos;s been an unexpected increase in oropharyngeal cancer, a cancer that develops at the base of the tongue,  among young people.

 It doesn&apos;t take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that this rise in oropharyngeal cancer is linked to changing sexual practices and, in particular, ones that involve bathing the throat with HPV-infected fluid. Increasingly, scientists are implicating HPV-16, and in some cases 18, the same ones that causes cervical cancer.
 
 

However good college kids are on using condoms for vaginal sex, very few use them for oral sex.

Priming the Pump

One in four people suffer from persistent fatigue that has nothing to do with any serious medical condition.

 The Cure for Exhaustion? More Exercise. 

 Regular exercise can actually go a long way in increasing feelings of energy — particularly in sedentary individuals.”

Why exercise helps fatigue isn’t clear, but Dr. Puetz said his findings suggest exercise acts directly on the central nervous system to increase energy and reduce fatigue. Notably, the improvements in energy and fatigue were not related to increases in aerobic fitness.

“A lot of people are overworked and not sleeping enough,” said Patrick O’Connor, co-director of the university’s exercise psychology laboratory. “Exercise is a way for people to feel more energetic.

Instant test for Alzheimer&apos;s coming

 The Instant Test that can Spot Alzheimer&apos;s 

The test uses a computer programme linked to an MRI brain scanner to look for the tell-tale signs of the disease in the brain.

In trials, it was able to accurately diagnose the condition in 96 per cent of patients.

Human experts get it right around 85 per cent of the time.

Its creators believe the test could be available in Britain in less than a year, ensuring patients are diagnosed earlier and more quickly.

 It could also help to reassure the &apos;worried well&apos; - those who are concerned that their memory lapses are more than just a normal sign of aging.
 
Another win for algorithms.

Depressing news

 Anti-depressants &apos;no better than dummy pills&apos; 

 Millions of Britons are taking anti-depressants for no reason, according to a study that found they made little difference to the condition.

Researchers discovered the drugs, which cost the taxpayer almost £300 million a year, generally work no better than dummy pills, and said exercise and therapy should first be prescribed instead.
---

The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science: Medicine, looked at the results of 35 clinical trials in the US involving 5,000 patients taking SSRIs, including Prozac, Efexor and Seroxat. Prof Kirsch said patients taking the drugs did improve, but so did those on a placebo - showing most of the effect was psychological.
 
Thank God for the placebo effect.

 Says a GP 
 I  see ever-increasing numbers of patients coming to my surgery because they feel psychologically out of sorts. In the main, a little sympathetic probing will get to the bottom of the problem: they are tired, stressed and finding it difficult to cope with the increasingly hectic pace of life. Generally drug therapy is not the solution.

But expectations of health and healthcare are changing and the public looks to medicine for an instant cure for any number of lifestyle troubles, even something to treat a general feeling of ennui.

Lacking time to talk and the reassuring community of a social network, we are increasingly prone to think that a bottle of pills might be just what the doctor ordered.

It isn&apos;t.
 
But it is Good news for therapists 

 &quot;For many, medication is successful. But talking therapies can have dramatic effects. We have put a lot of emphasis on medication in the past and it is about time we redressed the balance and put more emphasis on talking treatments.&quot;
 
Maybe &quot;compassion is an aphrodisiac.&quot;  After watching In Treatment, I&apos;m convinced of it.

 

Even if He Listens. He Cares. He Isn&apos;t Real.

Fatal to Women

Ovarian cancer has become known as the &apos;silent killer&apos; because it is so hard to detect at its early stages when treatment could do some good. Three times as lethal as breast cancer, ovarian cancer is the cause of more than 15,000 deaths a year.
 
Because the symptoms of early ovarian cancer are non specific, women tend to ignore them, thinking they will go away. Signs and symptoms from the Mayo clinic.

• Abdominal pressure, fullness, swelling or bloating
• Urinary urgency
• Pelvic discomfort or pain

So this is particularly good news from researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, 99% Detection on Early Stage Ovarian Cancer.
 
“The ability to recognize almost 100 percent of new tumors will have a major impact on the high death rates of this cancer,” said lead author Gil Mor, M.D., associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology&amp;Reproductive Sciences at Yale. “We hope this test will become the standard of care for women having routine examinations.”

Hat tip FuturePundit. 

Another disease that affects women almost exclusively is LAM (Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ), a progressive lung disease that affects women most often during their cild-bearing years. Smooth muscle cells grow uncontrollably invading the tissues of the lungs, the airways and blood and lymph vessels to form cell clusters and cysts that eventually create holes in the lungs, preventing the lungs from providing oxygen to the rest of the body. The LAM Foundation. 

 Yvonne DiVita tells the story of Alanna Nelson, a young mother recently diagnosed with LAM, who is fundraising with a bake sale this past weekend in Pennsylvania.

&quot;It is a genetic lung disease, which destroys healthy lung tissue by causing bubble-like cysts that cannot transfer oxygen to the blood. This means that people with LAM will eventually need full-time oxygen, and finally must resort to lung transplantation to stay alive. There is currently NO CURE and LAM is ultimately fatal.&quot;

About 1500 women have been diagnosed with LAM but some scientists estimate that as many as 250,000 may be going undiagnosed or misdiagnosed because the symptoms are so similar to asthma, bronchitis or emphysema.

Many doctors think pregnancy accelerates the disease.

So far no cure, no treatment though clinical trials are underway.

Music after a stroke

Listening to music after suffering a stroke is a great idea because the act of listening probably helps the patient recover from brain damage.

 Why music could be a tonic for stroke sufferers. 

 It is the first time such an effect has been shown in humans and scientists believe it could be a cheap, simple way to get stroke patients on the road to recovery.

Researcher Teppo Sarkamo of Helsinki University helped carry out the study.

He said newly diagnosed patients are often left on their own for large parts of the day, yet the first few months after a &quot;brain attack&quot; are ideal for rehabilitative training.

He said: &quot;Our research shows for the first time that listening to music during this crucial period can enhance cognitive recovery and prevent negative mood, and it has the advantage that it is cheap and easy to organise.

&quot;We suggest that everyday music listening during early stroke recovery offers a valuable addition to the patients&apos; care.&quot;

&quot;This drug makes women stupid&quot;

 This drug makes women stupid,&quot; Orli Etingin, vice chairman of medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, declared at a recent luncheon discussion sponsored by Project A.L.S. to raise awareness of gender issues and the brain. Dr. Etingin, who is also founder and director of the Iris Cantor Women&apos;s Health Center in New York, told of a typical patient in her 40s, unable to concentrate or recall words. Tests found nothing amiss, but when the woman stopped taking Lipitor, the symptoms vanished. When she resumed taking Lipitor, they returned.

&quot;I&apos;ve seen this in maybe two dozen patients,&quot; Dr. Etingin said later, adding that they did better on other statins. &quot;This is just observational, of course. We really need more studies, particularly on cognitive effects and women.&quot;
 
 Can a drug that helps hearts be harmful to the brain? 

 Cognitive side effects like memory loss and fuzzy thinking aren&apos;t listed on the patient information sheet for Lipitor, the popular cholesterol-lowering drug. But some doctors are voicing concerns that in a small portion of patients, statins like Lipitor may be helping hearts but hurting minds.
 
I take a small dose of a statin every day, but I have found that my thinking is not as clear.  After this article, I&apos;m going to go without for 2 months and see if I notice the difference.

 With HIV, growing older, faster 

Now more than a quarter of the estimated 1 million Americans living with HIV are, like Gibson and Golay, older than 50, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 2015, half will be older than 50. At least two long-range studies of people aging with HIV are underway, by the National Institutes of Health and the Veterans Health Administration.

A 2006 study by the New York-based AIDS Community Research Initiative of America on the interaction of HIV and aging on mental health found depression to be almost 13 times higher in longtime survivors than in the general population. As do the very elderly, whose suicide rate is the highest of any age group, longtime HIV survivors often grow despondent over health disabilities and the deaths of friends.

 &quot;Everybody I knew died in the late &apos;80s or early &apos;90s,&quot; said Los Angeles resident and longtime survivor Thomas Woolsey, 59. &quot;It sounds like I&apos;m the lucky one, but I don&apos;t really think so. What good is a life without any friends?&quot;

Living Long and Healthy Costs More

It&apos;s always been obvious to me that smokers pay more taxes and die sooner and, in the end, consume less health care.  Now there&apos;s a study to back up the notion that obese people and smokers are cheaper to treat. 

In the long run, healthy people who live long lives are more expensive.

 It costs more to care for healthy people who live years longer, according to a Dutch study that counters the common perception that preventing obesity would save governments millions of dollars.
--
&apos;&apos;Lung cancer is a cheap disease to treat because people don&apos;t survive very long,&apos;&apos; van Baal said. &apos;&apos;But if they are old enough to get Alzheimer&apos;s one day, they may survive longer and cost more.&apos;&apos;
--
Cancer incidence, except for lung cancer, was the same in all three groups. Obese people had the most diabetes, and healthy people had the most strokes.
--
Ultimately, the thin and healthy group cost the most, about $417,000, from age 20 on. The cost of care for obese people was $371,000, and for smokers, about $326,000.

Toxic Calcium

That&apos;s what some Swiss scientists are saying as they purport to unlock the mystery of sleep 

 Mehdi Tafti, head of the research project at Lausanne University&apos;s Centre for Integrative Genomics,... an expert in sleep disorders, has spent the past 20 years trying to work out why humans spend a third of their lives in bed.

His research team recently published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science journal, identifying a gene – Homer1a – that controls levels of calcium in neurons in the brain.

Mice, like humans, need calcium to function when awake, but the longer they are up and about, the more calcium builds up, and when the levels get too high, the neurons get over-stimulated.

Sleep, therefore, is nature&apos;s way of reducing these excessive calcium levels in the brain. And Homer1a plays a key role.

&quot;This gene regulates the levels of calcium to protect against hyperactivity of the brain,&quot; explained Tafti. &quot;The more you stay awake, the more
it is activated.&quot;

It rings an alarm bell in your head and tries to counterbalance the build-up, warning: &quot;Be careful, calcium is trying to get in – you have to regulate it otherwise it&apos;s going to be toxic,&quot; he added.

&quot;In animal models, sleep deprivation is lethal...It has never been tested in humans but long-term sleep deprivation would probably lead to death.

&quot;Don&apos;t Treat the Old and Unhealthy&quot;

Health care is on the mind of a lot of Americans.  Will they be able to afford heath care?  What kind of country are we that we can&apos;t guarantee health care for everyone?  Should it be a guaranteed right?  Should we require every American to carry health care insurance?  Should we have a single payer system, that is should the government pay for health care for everyone or should we continue with a mixed system of public and private systems.

For the time being, generally speaking,  I&apos;m  not going to write about the various proposals out there.  I&apos;ll just pass along some links I think you should see.

In Britain the financial strains of government provided health care are showing when doctors say Don&apos;t treat the old and unhealthy 

 Among the survey of 870 family and hospital doctors, almost 60 per cent said the NHS could not provide full healthcare to everyone and that some individuals should pay for services.

One in three said that elderly patients should not be given free treatment if it were unlikely to do them good for long. Half thought that smokers should be denied a heart bypass, while a quarter believed that the obese should be denied hip replacements.
--
Gordon Brown promised this month that a new NHS constitution would set out people&apos;s &quot;responsibilities&quot; as well as their rights, a move interpreted as meaning restric tions on patients who bring health problems on themselves. The only sanction threatened so far, however, is to send patients to the bottom of the waiting list if they miss appointments.

Is it a gimmick or a whole new way of being a doctor?

 Jay Parkinson is an easily accessible mobile doctor who makes housecalls in the Brooklyn, Park Slope area of New York, offers same or next day appointments and follow up eVisits and he&apos;s a hunk.

 

He says, &quot;The greatest predictor of health is giving a crap about yourself&quot;

He knows amazing doctors, healthcare prices and will help prevent illness (a preventive medicine residency at John Hopkins, a masters in public health from there too, and an MD from Penn State University).

He specializes in children and young adults, 18-40 with and without traditional health insurance.

You can contact him by phone, email, IM, text or video chat, 8 to 5 Monday through Friday, 24/7 for emergencies.

He calls himself a &quot;New Kind of Physician&quot; and says,
 When you need more than I provide, I ensure you wisely spend your money and pay the lowest price for the highest quality in order to optimize your health.
 
How does his practice work?
You enroll, he contacts you, you contact him, you get what you need.

Talk about a fresh, new approach, Jay has it.  Wow.

Salt - a cold killer?

Raw garlic is a natural anti-viral and honey is a natural antibiotic, it makes some sort of weird sense that salt water cures colds better than anything else.

 Salt water &apos;cures kids&apos; colds&apos;
 
 A nasal spray made from Atlantic Ocean seawater eased wintertime cold symptoms faster and slowed cough and cold symptoms from returning among children ages 6 to 10, researchers in Europe reported on Monday.

It may be that the salt water has a simple mechanical effect of clearing mucus, or it could be that trace elements in the water play some more significant role, though the exact reason why such a solution works is not known, said Dr Ivo Slapak and colleagues at the Teaching Hospital of Brno in the Czech Republic.

 

I&apos;ve written earlier about the amazing properties of salt water and the ameliorative effect it has on cystic fibrosis.

Reversing Alzheimer&apos;s Symptoms in Minutes

I sure hope this is true and pans out.;

 Drug &apos;Can Reverse Alzheimer&apos;s Symptoms in Minutes 

 A drug used for arthritis can reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s &quot;in minutes&quot;.

It appears to tackle one of the main features of the disease - inflammation in the brain.

The drug, called Enbrel, is injected into the spine where it blocks a chemical responsible for damaging the brain and other organs.

A pilot study carried out by U.S. researchers found one patient had his symptoms reversed &quot;in minutes&quot;.

Other patients have shown some improvements in symptoms such as forgetfulness and confusion after weekly injections over six months.
The study of 15 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer&apos;s has just been published in the Journal of Neuroinflammation by online publishers Biomed Central.

The experiment showed that Enbrel can deactivate TNF (tumour necrosis factor) - a chemical in the fluid surrounding the brain that is found in Alzheimer&apos;s sufferers.

I haven&apos;t been posting because I&apos;ve been sick and tired with the flu. But  I&apos;ve earned something I want to pass on.

Apart from wicked tiredness, headaches and muscle aches, what bothered me most was an extremely sore throat and a severe cough.

Cough drops, cough syrups, aspergum - nothing seemed to work until I googled and found that raw garlic fights viruses.

Yucky as that sounds, raw garlic chopped very fine actually made me feel better, a lot better.  Especially when followed by a honey chaser, another natural antibiotic, which was the most soothing thing I could do. That and iced water.

Honey and garlic.  Garlic and Honey.  You have both in your pantry or should.  You don&apos;t need the other stuff.

So why keep lots of OTC medications in your medicine cabinet that millions of youth use to get high?
 
About 3.1 million people between the ages of 12 to 25 use cough and cold syrup say officials who liken the level of abuse to use of LSD, methamphetamine or ecstasy.

 Stem Cells Reshape Breasts After Cancer 

 Dec. 17, 2007 (San Antonio) -- In a medical first, researchers have used stem cells to help reshape the breasts of women who have undergone a lumpectomy to remove a breast tumor.
 
 After a lumpectomy, breasts can be scarred or misshapened.  Injections of fat tissue have been tried but the fat most often dies or is reabsorbed.  Using fat and stem cell juice seems to work because the stem cells stimulate the breast tissue to make new blood vessels.

The Art of Managing Extreme Complexity in the ICU

Another brilliant article by Atul Gawande called The  Checklist in the New Yorker&apos;s Annals of Medicine.
 
 Intensive-care medicine has become the art of managing extreme complexity—and a test of whether such complexity can, in fact, be humanly mastered.

--
On any given day in the United States, some ninety thousand people are in intensive care. Over a year, an estimated five million Americans will be, and over a normal lifetime nearly all of us will come to know the glassed bay of an I.C.U. from the inside.
 

 
Wide swaths of medicine now depend on the lifesupport systems that I.C.U.s provide: care for premature infants; victims of trauma, strokes, and heart attacks; patients who have had surgery on their brain, heart, lungs, or major blood vessels. 

 
Critical care has become an increasingly large portion of what hospitals do. Fifty years ago, I.C.U.s barely existed. ...The average stay of an I.C.U. patient is four days, and the survival rate is eighty-six per cent. Going into an I.C.U., being put on a mechanical ventilator, having tubes and wires run into and out of you, is not a sentence of death. But the days will be the most precarious of your life. 

They are precarious because the average patient requires 178  individual actions per day and every one involves risks.  One of the biggest risks is that of a line infection, infections that are so common they are considered a routine complication.  80,000 people get line infections each year and of those between 5 and 28% die.

 The I.C.U., with its spectacular successes and frequent failures, therefore poses a distinctive challenge: what do you do when expertise is not enough?
 
 Intensive care is now too complex for clinicians to carry out reliably fro memory alone.  Taking a page from the pilot checklists, designed to help pilots fly planes too complicated to fly from memory alone, Peter Pronovost, a critical care specialist at John Hopkins, designed a checklist to take care of the problem of line infections.

 Pronovost and his colleagues monitored what happened for a year afterward. The results were so dramatic that they weren’t sure whether to believe them: the ten-day line-infection rate went from eleven per cent to zero. So they followed patients for fifteen more months. Only two line infections occurred during the entire period. They calculated that, in this one hospital, the checklist had prevented forty-three infections and eight deaths, and saved two million dollars in costs.
 
Checklists help people with memory recall and make explicit the minimum, expected steps in complex processes.

As the tagline on the New Yorker article says, If something so simple can transform intensive care, what else can it do?

&quot;Exercise&quot; Gene Found

The reason why exercise alleviates depression is because of an exercise-related gene in the brain called VGF.

Sooner is Better

Proteomics is a not a word you are familiar with, but you will be. Proteomics is a fast-growing filed that looks for telltale proteins in a person&apos;s blood to diagnose disease at a very early stage.

 Diagnosis 2.0 

 By the time a doctor diagnoses you with cancer or a neurodegenerative disease, you may have been living with it for years—a troubling fact, given that early detection is the most important factor in successful treatment. Now, Power3 Medical Products, a biotech firm in Houston, Texas, has developed simple, low-cost blood tests for breast cancer, Alzheimer&apos;s and Parkinson&apos;s that will allow physicians to spot disease the moment it shows up in a patient&apos;s body—years earlier than today&apos;s most advanced technologies can catch it. 
 

 --- 

 &quot;There&apos;s tremendous promise in proteomics,&quot; says Lance Liotta, a proteomic scientist at George Mason University. &quot;The early diagnosis and individualized therapy coming out of the science is going to change medicine.&quot;

When Sadness is Confused with Depression

 We are designed to be sad when faced with a loss whether it be a romance, a parent, a job or a dog. Being sad is not a chemical disorder that needs treatment with powerful drugs. 

 But the wide availability of anti-depressant drugs and the easy access to them has confused the distinction between normal sadness and the major disorder of depression which is the breakdown of normal psychological functioning. Even people who just have a case of the&quot;blahs&quot; say they are &quot;depressed.&quot; 

 So take with a grain of salt, reports that depression in the United States increased 300% from 1987 to 1997 or that 1 in 10 adults struggle with depression each year. 

 The Great Depression 

 The alleged epidemic of depression simply doesn’t exist. Horwitz and Wakefield are right: Millions who have been diagnosed with major depression never had it in the first place, even if their lives were nonetheless improved by the drugs they were prescribed.

The Great Relearning - Part 2

Consider the latest news out of Chicago. Are we going through the Great Relearning**, Part 2?

 Rickets returns as kids&apos; bones weaker. 

Rickets is a softening of the bones in children potentially leading to fractures and deformity.

Usually a disease seen only in developing countries, in most cases it can be easily cured with milk, sunshine and exercise. In the absence of vitamin D, either from sunshine or from supplements, calcium can not be absorbed by the body.

 But cases of full-blown rickets are just the red flag: Bone specialists say possibly millions of seemingly healthy children aren&apos;t building as much strong bone as they should, a gap that may leave them more vulnerable to bone-cracking osteoporosis later. 

 &apos;&apos;This potentially is a time-bomb,&apos;&apos; says Dr. Laura Tosi of Children&apos;s National Medical Center in Washington. 

That means parents have to insist that their kids drink their fortified milk, turn off the TV or computer and go outside and play.

Otherwise, they will grow up fat, with bowed legs, frequent fractures, deformed chests or curved spines, like this poor 2-year-old with rickets. 


***The Great Relearning comes from a brilliant essay by Tom Wolfe who observed that many social problems are the result of a large-scale rejection of well-established principles that were generally accepted by everyone until the 1960s.

 In 1968, in San Francisco, I came across a curious footnote to the psychedelic movement. At the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic there were doctors who were treating diseases no living doctor had ever encountered before, diseases that had disappeared so long ago they had never even picked up Latin names, diseases such as the mange, the grunge, the itch, the twitch, the thrush , the scroff , the rot. And how was it that they had now returned? ... The hippies, as they became known, sought nothing less than to sweep aside all codes and restraints of the past and start out from zero... And now , in 1968, they were relearning... the laws of hygiene... by getting the mange, the grunge, the itch, the twitch, the thrush , the scroff , the rot.

Disaboom - Live Forward

&quot;So I just ran over it with my wheelchair until she apologized&quot;

I am quite impressed with Disaboom which I happened upon yesterday, a site that delivers on the promise of the Internet.

For anyone who is living with a disability, this is the place to find others like you, to learn from their experiences and find resources available to help like a career center as well as the &quot;largest collection of accessibility reviews on everything from restaurants to travel hot spots&quot;.

For those who have been paralyzed by an accident, the videos showing adaptive sky diving and may be especially inspiring.

Founder Dr. J. Glen House knows whereof he speaks because he specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation and is also a quadriplegic.  His mission
 to create the first comprehensive, evolving source of information, insight, and personal engagement for the disability community.
 
 

Two of its core beliefs are close to my own.
 Expertise comes in many forms . Often the best advice comes not just from medical experts but also from “peers” – others who’ve walked the path you’re on. That’s why in addition to providing solid medical expertise, we’ve also put together the largest online network of individuals to share their personal experiences with you, providing honest, practical answers to hard questions.

 Knowledge is power – and so is community . Disaboom.com strives to provide you the tools and guidance you need to live active, engaged lives. But when it comes to sharing stories and personal insights, there’s nothing stronger than the power of community – which is why we’re connecting the millions touched by disability to both information and each other.

Life Imitates Art

Or maybe creative people have a greater sense about what&apos;s in the air.

 Justice O&apos;Connor&apos;s husband forms romance with fellow Alzheimer&apos;s patient. 

Last week I watched Away From Her , a movie starring Julie Christie as Fiona who, suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s disease,  decides she would be better off in a retirement home than with her husband of fifty years whom she dearly loves, despite some troubled spots that they never discuss.

New patients at the retirement home are not allowed visitors for thirty days so they can adjust more quickly.  When the husband finally is allowed to visit his wife he finds Fiona has fallen in love with a fellow patient.

The movie is a brilliant adaption by Sarah Polley of an Alice Munro short story, &quot;The Bear Came Over the Mountain.&quot;

&quot;We need our bacteria&quot;

Who would have thought that most infections ensure our health instead of compromise it.

Humans have 10 times more bacterial cells in their bodies than human cells. Without bacteria, there would not be humans.

Human life depends on certain infections.

Mitochondria are bacteria-like components of cells that take fats and sugars and make adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Every action that distinguishes a living human being from a dead human being is dependent on ATP.

&quot;We need our bacteria,&quot; Callahan said.

 Infections, Bacteria &apos;Critical for Healthy Living&apos; 

 
 Other research shows that sheltering a child from bacterial infections increases his or her chances of developing asthma and allergies. In fact, recent studies show that the more educated parents are, the more likely their children are to develop asthma and allergies possibly because these parents are more likely to worry about bacterial infections.

Of course, parents want to protect children from infectious diseases. Callahan draws an analogy between how parents teach their children to recognize unsavory characters and how society must differentiate good from bad bacteria and infectious microorganisms.

Radio waves targeting cancer

They diagnosed him with leukemia and told him he had nine months to live.  John Kanzlus, weakened by his chemotherapy treatments, drew on his lifetime of working with radio waves to devise a machine that targets cancer cells.

The miracle: It works.

Kanzlus got his hands on come nanoparticles from another cancer patient, Nobel Prize winning chemist Richard Smalley.

 &quot;John asked, &apos;Is this what you expected?&apos; For the first time in my life, I realized that a smile starts behind the eyes before it starts at the mouth, for Steve responded, &apos;This is much more than I expected.&apos; I watched his smile engulf his entire face.&quot;

Marianne finally realized: &quot;Could what John&apos;s working on be real?&quot; Curley phoned Smalley to tell him the news.

He remembered Smalley&apos;s response: &quot;Holy God.&quot;

 At 63, Kanzius is still receiving treatment for his cancer, which has recurred. He knows the process he developed may not be ready in time to save his life, but the project was never about him. &quot;I want to see the treatment work,&quot; he said. &quot;That would be my thanks.&quot;

Making the Most of Doctor Visits

Too many people don&apos;t know how to go about Making the Most of Doctor Visits 

 Though medical information has never been more accessible to consumers, many patients still don&apos;t have the skills to talk to their doctors and cram all the questions they have about their health into a brief visit. They often ignore what they don&apos;t understand, or leave delicate but important issues to the end and then run out of time. So to help patients get answers, health-care officials are offering new discussion aids, providing sample questions patients can ask, and offering advice ranging from making a list of your drugs, to starting with the biggest questions first, to checking that a doctor has your lab results before going to an appointment.
 
Laura Landro who writes The Informed Patient column for The Wall Street Journal has put together some good practical tips.
 
 1. Write down questions /issues for the doctor beforehand, in order of priority.
2. If it&apos;s a diagnostic visit, prepare a detailed list of symptoms
3. Bring a list of current medications and dosages.
4. Ask for decision-support aids, and print or reliable web-based information about condition and treatments.
5. Make sure before the visit that the doctor has received test results/reports from other labs or doctors.
6. If you&apos;re unsure whether you can effectively interact with the doctor, bring a family member or friend.
7. Take notes and/or ask the doctor if you can record the session for later review.

The physical afflictions of two tyrants

 Karl Marx was a miserable old sod who hated bourgeois convention and advocated class war not because of his experience in a German factory, but because of a face full of painful boils. 
 
So writes a professor of dermatology, An Exegesis of Marx&apos;s Facial Boils 
 
 &quot;The bourgeoisie will remember my carbuncles until their dying day,&quot; Marx told Friedrich Engels in a letter from 1867. 

 In the Scent of a Fuhrer , I learned that Adolf Hitler couldn&apos;t control his own flatulence.  He gave up meat and took up vegetables but  his private physician
 Dr. Theo Morell, recorded in his diary that after Hitler downed a typical vegetable platter, “constipation and colossal flatulence occurred on a scale I have seldom encountered before.&quot;
 
He resorted to a quack doctor who gave him Dr. Kosters anti-gas pills  that contained strychnine and Hitler took up to 16 a day
 The sallow skin, glaucous eyes and attention lapses noted by observers later in the war are consistent with strychnine poisoning; another ingredient in the pills, antropine, causes mood wings from euphoria to violent anger. Even more peculiar were the injections of amphetamines that Morell administered every morning before breakfast from 1941, which may have exacerbated the erratic behavior, inflexibility, paranoia and indecision that Hitler began to display increasingly as the war ground on. And there was a barrage of other supplements -- vitamins, testosterone, liver extracts, laxatives, sedatives, glucose and opiates, all intended to combat the dictator’s real or imagined ailments. After the war, U.S. intelligence officers discovered that Morell was pumping Hitler with 28 different drugs, including eye-drops that contained 10 percent cocaine (up to 10 treatment a day), a concoction made from human placenta and “potency pills” made from ground bull’s testicles. But despite the barrage of medicines, Morell’s diaries (which were recovered from Germany and are kept in the National Archives in Washington, D.C.) make clear that the bouts of “agonizing flatulence” remained a regular occurrence.

Stressing about money and work

Stressing about money and work keeps 48% of us up at night.

About 75% of us worry about money and work and the same percent say stress is making them sick.

The survey by the American Psychological Association says stress is getting worse and affecting every area of our lives.

While some of us drink too much or eat junk food to relieve stress, the majority of us read, listen to music or exercise instead.  More than a third of us pray.

The stress may be getting worse, but we&apos;re handling it better it seems.

&quot;We are such stuff as dreams are made on&quot;

So what is sleep for?  More and more, it looks like memory and learning.  And naps have the same effect!
 
 the new research underscores a vast transformation in the way scientists have come to understand the sleeping brain. Once seen as a blank screen, a metaphor for death, it has emerged as an active, purposeful machine, a secretive intelligence that comes out at night to play — and to work — during periods of dreaming and during the netherworld chasms known as deep sleep
 
 An Active, Purposeful Machine That Comes Out at Night to Play 

 Since then the study findings have come almost too fast to digest, and they suggest that the sleeping brain works on learned information the way a change sorter does on coins. It seems first to distill the day’s memories before separating them — vocabulary, historical facts and dimes here; cello scales, jump shots and quarters over there. It then bundles them into readable chunks, at different times of the night. In effect, the stages of sleep seem to be specialized to handle specific types of information, the studies suggest.
 
 &quot;We are such stuff
As dreams are made on; and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.&quot;

Lack of Sleep Makes Adolescents Stupider, Fatter and Gloomier.

Only 5% of high school seniors sleep 8 hours a night.  Half of adolescents get less than seven.

 Snooze or Lose 

Overstimulated, overscheduled kids are getting at least an hour’s less sleep than they need, a deficiency that, new research reveals, has the power to set their cognitive abilities back years.

 --
 Using newly developed technological and statistical tools, sleep scientists have recently been able to isolate and measure the impact of this single lost hour. Because children’s brains are a work-in-progress until the age of 21, and because much of that work is done while a child is asleep, this lost hour appears to have an exponential impact on children that it simply doesn’t have on adults.
--

Perhaps most fascinating, the emotional context of a memory affects where it gets processed. Negative stimuli get processed by the amygdala; positive or neutral memories get processed by the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala. The result is that sleep-deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories yet recall gloomy memories just fine.
 
 

It seems as though lack of sleep makes adolescents stupider,  fatter and gloomier.

An informational cascade

Is the connection between fat and diet an example of a mistaken consensus?

An &quot;informational cascade&quot; as one person after assumes that the rest can&apos;t be all wrong.
 
 Because of this effect, groups are surprisingly prone to reach mistaken conclusions even when most of the people started out knowing better....Cascades are especially common in medicine as doctors take their cues from others, leading them to overdiagnose some faddish ailments (called bandwagon diseases) and overprescribe certain treatments (like the tonsillectomies once popular for children). Unable to keep up with the volume of research, doctors look for guidance from an expert — or at least someone who sounds confident.
 
 John Tierney on Diet and Fat: A Severe Case of Mistaken Consensus 

 when the theories were tested in clinical trials, the evidence kept turning up negative. As Mr. Taubes notes, the most rigorous meta-analysis of the clinical trials of low-fat diets, published in 2001 by the Cochrane Collaboration, concluded that they had no significant effect on mortality.

Mr. Taubes argues that the low-fat recommendations, besides being unjustified, may well have harmed Americans by encouraging them to switch to carbohydrates, which he believes cause obesity and disease. He acknowledges that that hypothesis is unproved, and that the low-carb diet fad could turn out to be another mistaken cascade. The problem, he says, is that the low-carb hypothesis hasn’t been seriously studied because it couldn’t be reconciled with the low-fat dogma. 

UPDATE: Sissy Willis does much deeper analysis of both the Tierney piece and informational cascades in &quot; There are very few who can think, but every man wants to have an opinion.&quot;

Being conscientious wins in the long run

Being conscientious apparently dramatically lowers your risk for Alzheimer&apos;s, showing again the power of the mind over the body, in this case the brain.

 A surprising study of elderly people suggests that those who see themselves as self-disciplined, organized achievers have a lower risk for developing Alzheimer&apos;s disease than people who are less conscientious.

Astoundingly, the brains of some of the dutiful people in the study were examined after their deaths and were found to have lesions that would meet accepted criteria for Alzheimer&apos;s - even though these people had shown no signs of dementia.

&quot;This adds to our knowledge that lifestyle, personality, how we think, feel and behave are very importantly tied up with risk for this terrible illness,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;It may suggest new ideas for trying to delay the onset of this illness.&quot;
--

Renee Goodwin of Columbia University&apos;s Mailman School of Public Health was not involved in the new study but has done similar work that found a connection between conscientiousness and better health.

&quot;It&apos;s having self-discipline and energy, doing the healthy things,&quot; Goodwin said.

An Apple a Day

If you go out of your way to buy pomegranate or acai juice because they are packed with powerful anti-oxidants, here&apos;s two words for you from the Wall St Journal, New Respect for a Humble Juice. 

Apple juice.

Even better, apple cider.

(The best - cold apple cider with warm apple cider donuts.)

Far from being just &quot;sugar water&quot; as some pediatricians have said, new research shows &quot;thousands&quot; of phyto-chemicals in apple juice, mainly in the peel, some of which retard tumor growth, most of which work together in a synergy on different parts of the body.

 
 Studies at Cornell University&apos;s Department of Food Science have found that the unique combination of thousands of phytochemicals in apples -- mainly concentrated in the peel -- retard tumor growth in cell cultures and in animals. In particular, apples are high in triterpenoids, which have &quot;very potent activity in tumor cell growth,&quot; says lead researcher Rui Hai Liu.

Issues I&apos;ve changed my mind about #1

Because this week turns out to be an especially busy one for me, I&apos;ve decided to do some easy blogging and point to what others have written that have changed my mind in a significant way on a current issue.

#1 How many people without health care insurance should I worry about.

The U.S. Census says that 46.6 million persons are uninsured.
9.5 million of those are not citizens, so we don&apos;t have a responsibility to see that they are insured.    Only 37.1 million left.

The U.S. Census reports that 8.74 million of the uninsured make more that $75k a year.    Another 8.3 million of the uninsured make between $50k and $75k.    That&apos;s another 17 million I don&apos;t have to worry about since they can afford their own health insurance.  Even when I haven&apos;t had any income, I paid for my own health insurance.

So that leaves about 20 million without health insurance but who are still able to get emergency room healthcare for free.

 James Shott writes 

 ...If we believe the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is a frequent source for the mainstream media, Americans who do not qualify for current government programs and who make less than $50,000 a year total somewhere between 13.9 million and 8.2 million, no more than 5 percent of the population. Furthermore, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 45 percent of uninsured people will be uninsured for less than four months.

Which brings us to the ultimate question: Does it make any sense to destroy a health care system that 5 out of 100 people do not have adequate access to?

Unsnarling Medical Bills

 Services Help Unsnarl Medical Bills, Wall St Journal (link for subscribers only)

 I f you have a lot of medical bills and can&apos;t make sense of the explanation of benefit statements,  there are now web-based services and tools that can help unsnarl those medical bills, get you organized and give you a single summary of all your bills.

Many analysts recommend consumers create their own personal health records, essentially a record of an individual&apos;s important medical information. That&apos;s because the person who will truly be responsible for one&apos;s health care in the end is that person. If people change jobs frequently, their health-insurance companies and doctors will also change. Analysts also add that it&apos;s a good way to keep track of children&apos;s immunization records or early doctor&apos;s appointments for a newborn.

Women, don&apos;t get so cocky, you&apos;re not much better.

When experiencing chest pain, sweating and shortness of breath, call 911.

The Wall Street Journal reports that only about half of the people in the throes of a heart attack decide to call 911, the others are risking their own survival and, if they do survive,  the long-term health of their hearts.

Don&apos;t worry about &quot;bothering&quot; people, don&apos;t worry about the loss of control, don&apos;t worry about being embarrassed, think about saving your life, worry about sudden death.

An ambulance is much better than driving yourself or being driven to the emergency room.

First off, you&apos;re treated right away, you don&apos;t have to wait for hours.

If you are one of the 5% of people that go into cardiac arrest, if you&apos;re not revived within 2 minutes, you may be a goner.  Ambulances have the equipment to spark  your heart back into rhythm, cars don&apos;t.

 Errors in medical records aren&apos;t uncommon. &quot;They happen all the time,&quot; says Joy Pritts, research associate professor at Georgetown University&apos;s Health Policy Institute.

Mistakes can arise from a mistyped diagnosis code or transcription error to an inaccurate diagnosis or a diagnosis that is out-of-date, say because a patient has gotten his or her cholesterol under control. And, if you have a common name, other peoples&apos; records can end up in your file, says Ms. Pritts. Part of the problem is that the U.S. health-care system relies mainly on paper records, which make it harder to coordinate care and spot errors.

Many hospitals use electronic health records, but until the U.S. develops a comprehensive, consolidated system, the burden falls to individuals to keep tabs on their health histories.

Boomers&apos; Knees

I was in a rut.      A  few days away from the Internet and some ocean and sun in Maine and on Long Island and I feel much better.

I&apos;m also very glad that I sat out the high impact aerobics fad in the 80s and never &quot;went for the burn&quot; now that at least one doctor is asking Did Jane Fonda&apos;s Videos Give People Arthritis? 

 Dr. Solomon says the repetitive nature of high impact aerobics has had an adverse affect on many of the once devoted Fonda fans like Wares.

&quot;They have knee problems,&quot; she said. &quot;They all have early arthritis, or have terrible arthritis where they can&apos;t go up and down stairs.&quot;

Today, Dr. Solomon said these high impact exercise techniques are basically defunct because we now know how to exercise smarter.

Exercise Makes You Smarter

An expanding body of research is showing that exercise can create a stronger, faster brain reports the New York Times in Lobes of Steel .

 scientists have been finding more evidence that the human brain is not only capable of renewing itself but that exercise speeds the process.
 
Other factors contributing to neurogenesis , the creation of new brain cells: marijuana, moderate alcohol intake, sociability and chocolate while heavy alcohol consumption, stress and a diet high in saturated fats and sugar inhibit the production of new brain cells.

One in eight Australians affected by alcohol-related brain injury

You would probably feel cheated if you were served a &quot;standard size&quot; drink in a restaurant or bar, given that a standard size is about a can of beer or a small glass of wine.

That&apos;s probably why people fool themselves into thinking they are drinking less than they are.  If you drink more than 3 standard size drinks a day for women or more than 6 standard size drinks a day for men, you&apos;re on the way to injuring your brain.

Already, alcohol brain injury looms as a health crisis in Australia. 

 &quot;Alcohol-related brain injury affects as many as one in eight Australians,&quot; Ms Berton said.

&quot;It&apos;s slow, progressive and ultimately this damage affects a person&apos;s thinking, emotions, communication and ability to care for themselves.&quot; She said the damage was not confined to one demographic, affecting young and old, rich and poor, black and white, male and female.

&quot;People need to understand that it&apos;s not a question of how much you have to drink to sustain an alcohol-related brain injury, but how little.

Avoid Having Fat Friends

Not really, but if you want to be thin, have some thin friends whose behavior to influence you.

The question is why have people gotten so fat so fast ?

Dr. Christakis took the notion of an obesity  epidemic seriously when he began researching why people have gotten so fat so fast.  Using  data collected by the Framingham Study to reconstruct social networks, he found that

 friends affected each others’ perception of fatness. When a close friend becomes obese, obesity may not look so bad.

“You change your idea of what is an acceptable body type by looking at the people around you,” Dr. Christakis said.

Low-fat Diet Doesn&apos;t Halt Breast Cancer

After a seven year experiment involving more than 3000 women, a government study found that a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables  (higher than the recommended 5 servings a day) did NOT prevent the return of breast cancer.

 Earlier research on whether a healthy diet prevents breast cancer has shown mixed results. The new study was designed to be more rigorous. In this experiment, all the women had been successfully treated for early-stage breast cancer. Their average age was 53 when the study began.

Got Milk?

I&apos;ve always loved milk and I drink it often.  I even get my milk delivered in glass bottles from a nearby dairy.

Now, I learn that milk is healthier than I thought

 ... the Welsh study has found that regular consumption of medium chain fatty acids found in full-fat milk and dairy products (cheese and yoghurt) can have a positive effect on metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes and obesity while reducing the risk of stroke and heart attack by two third s. 

Xanthe Clay waxes eloquent in the London Telegraph, Full fat takes the cream 

 But enough of the science. Clotted cream with jam and scones, farmhouse cheese, rich whole milk, unctuous yogurts and butter, surely the finest toast topper of all, are jewels of our country&apos;s gastronomic heritage. They are also life-enhancingly delicious to eat. Caring about what we eat and how it tastes is surely the first step to healthy eating.

Families in the ICU

We all need our advocates who understand us when we&apos;re sick and in the hospital.  We also need people who love us.    So this is good news.

 ICUs&apos; New Message: Welcome, Families (Wall St Journal, link for subscribers)

 For decades, hospitals tried to keep visitors out of intensive-care units for more than a few minutes at a time. This year, Emory University Hospital here went the other way: It began inviting family members to move into the ward and take a hand in the patient&apos;s care.
---
A wave of recent studies shows that critically ill patients may benefit from having families present. There&apos;s even a case to be made, researchers say, for having loved ones present for resuscitation, brain-catheter insertions and other life-and-death procedures.

Earlier this year, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the largest international society representing intensive-care professionals, recommended that ICUs offer open visiting hours and increase family involvement. &quot;Why would we presume that we can dictate how often or who is allowed to visit during the patient&apos;s most trying moments on earth?&quot;

Use SRS to Diagnose a Stroke in 60 seconds

 &quot;I know of no disease that is as common or as serious as stroke and where you basically have one therapy and it’s only used in 3 to 4 percent of patients. That’s like saying you only treat 3 to 4 percent of patients with bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics.”
 
Dr. Mark Alberts, neurology professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University calls the situation where people don&apos;t recognize they are having a stroke and most hospitals, uncertain about stroke diagnoses, don&apos;t provide tPA , the only effective drug against stroke, &quot;a national embarrassment&quot;.

 Lost Chances for Survival Before and After Stroke 
 

Stroke kills 150,000 Americans each year, the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer, and leaves many more permanently disabled. With tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), one in three victims of stroke escaped serious injury. One problem is the clot-busting tPA must be administered within three hours of the stroke to be effective.

As I wrote before in Just a Minute, Save a Life , even lay people can diagnose a stroke in 60 seconds if they remember SRS, Smile, Raise, Speak.

 • Ask the individual to SMILE
• Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS
• Ask the person to SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE

If he or she has trouble with any of these tasks, call 9-1-1 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. Researchers are urging the general public to learn to ask these three questions quickly, to someone they suspect of having a stroke. Widespread use of this test could result in prompt diagnosis and treatment of a stroke, and prevent permanent brain damage.

Vitamin D, A Miracle Drug?

From Medpundit, the Vitamin D Connection .

In June, U.S. researchers will announce the first direct link between cancer prevention and the &quot;sunshine vitamin&quot;. First she quotes from a Globe and Mail story that costs $5 to read, so I&apos;m going along with her excerpt.

 A four-year clinical trial involving 1,200 women found those taking the vitamin had about a 60-per-cent reduction in cancer incidence, compared with those who didn&apos;t take it, a drop so large—twice the impact on cancer attributed to smoking—it almost looks like a typographical error.
--

One of the researchers who made the discovery, professor of medicine Robert Heaney of Creighton University in Nebraska, says vitamin D deficiency is showing up in so many illnesses besides cancer that nearly all disease figures in Canada and the U.S. will need to be re-evaluated. &quot;We don&apos;t really know what the status of chronic disease is in the North American population,&quot; he said, &quot;until we normalize vitamin D status.&quot;
 





Medpundit says 
 

 We&apos;ll need to see the numbers to know how jaw dropping that 60 percent reduction is. However, here&apos;s some food thought. Cholesterol is the building block for Vitamin D. And what have we been preaching - and doing - to patients even more emphatically than sun avoidance? Lowering cholesterols to very low levels.

 

That&apos;s probably why my doctor insists I take vitamin D along with my 10 mg dose of Zocor.

Honey for Diabetics

More good news about honey.

 Honey could save diabetics from amputation 

 Spreading honey on a diabetic ulcer could prevent the need to amputate an infected foot, researchers say.
 
Honey therapy involves squeezing a thick layer of honey onto a wound after all the dead skin and bacteria have been removed.

 The honey kills bacteria because it is acidic and avoids the complication of bacterial resistance found with standard antibiotics, Jennifer Eddy, a professor at the University&apos;s School of Medicine and Public Health, told AFP.

&quot;This is a tremendously important issue for world health,&quot; Eddy said.

She tried honey therapy as a last resort six years ago with a 79-year-old diabetic patient who had developed foot wounds resistant to standard treatments.

&quot;I tried it only after everything else had failed and... we had essentially sent him home to die,&quot; she said. &quot;All antibiotics were stopped when we started honey, and his wounds rapidly healed.&quot;
 
Last summer, I noted how honey heals wounds faster than antibiotics and recommended you tuck away jar of honey in your emergency supplies kit.

&quot;Nothing, it&apos;s too late.&quot;

Ronni Bennett delivers unwelcome news and a whole lot of numbers from as well as a good exegesis of Atul Gawade&apos;s piece in The New Yorker on The Way We Age Now 

There will not be enough doctors trained in geriatrics to deal with us aging boomers.  There&apos;s not enough now. 

Seems as if the number of geriatricians is declining while the number of plastic surgeons is rising.  Doctors just don&apos;t want to deal with &quot;Old Crocks&quot; which is what we all will be given enough time.

Even if we stop obsessing on how well we look, and start focusing on how well we are, we&apos;re out of luck and on our own. When asked whether enough geriatricians could be trained to serve the booming elder population, Chad Boult, professor at John Hopkins said,
 
&quot;Nothing, it&apos;s too late.&quot; 

Read Ronni&apos;s post  but don&apos;t miss the Gawade piece to get the full flavor of what we individually and as a society are avoiding, the certainty of our decrepitude and the words of a wonderful writer.

 Even as our bones and teeth soften, the rest of our body hardens. Blood vessels, joints, the muscle and valves of the heart, and even the lungs pick up substantial deposits of calcium and turn stiff. Under a microscope, the vessels and soft tissues display the same form of calcium that you find in bone. When you reach inside an elderly patient during surgery, the aorta and other major vessels often feel crunchy under your fingers. A recent study has found that loss of bone density may be an even better predictor of death from atherosclerotic disease than cholesterol levels. As we age, it’s as if the calcium flows out of our skeletons and into our tissues.
 ---
 Decline remains our fate; death wil come. But, until that last backup system inside each of us fails, decline can occur in two ways. One is early an precipitately, with an old age of enfeeblement and dependence, sustained primarily by nursing homes and hospitals. Th other way is more gradual, preserving, for as long as possible, your ability to control your own life
 

Is it hopeless? Are we all doomed? Not if Chad Boult can get geriatricians to train primary care doctors to treat the very old. But that&apos;s a tall order given that today, 97% of medical students take no course in geriatrics, 97%!

Frankly, I have a lot more hope in Gould&apos;s backup plan called &quot;Guided Care&quot; which calls for nurses to be given a highly compressed, three-week course in making geriatric care plans for individual patients and working with patients, families and doctors to implement the plans.

I count myself very lucky that my sister Colleen, a nurse, plans to become a certified nurse practitioner to work with us future &quot;old crocks.&quot;

A pill for thinner, sexier women

I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t note the hope for a sex-boost slimming pill that made news this week.

So far only monkeys and shrews have benefited from the hormone-reducing pill that promises to boost a woman&apos;s libido while reducing her appetite, 

While it probably won&apos;t be on the market in less than 10 years, whatever drug company invests the millions to bring the pill to market not only stands to make many more, but will garner the appreciation of men around the world.

Sexual parity however will not be achieved until they make a pill for men that reduces beer bellies while increasing their desire to help around the house.

Learn More Breathe Better

It&apos;s the 4th leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease, cancer and stroke, yet you probably never heard of COPD.

COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, affects 24 million Americans, half of them undiagnosed.

 

 Shining a Light on a Deadly Lung Disorder in the Wall St. Journal.

 COPD is an umbrella term for lung diseases that inflame airways, obstruct breathing and trap bad air in the lungs, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It&apos;s hardly a new disease, but its prevalence has been rising steadily, while other major causes of death have been decreasing. The increase is due largely to the fact that people are living longer and developing the disease as they age. But it is also rising in younger people and women, who are experiencing the long-term ravages of smoking even years after they quit, as well as exposure to second-hand smoke and other pollutants.
 
A new campaign is underway to raise awareness of COPD by encouraging people over 45 who may be at risk to get a simple breathing test.  The spirometry test determines your lung functioning by measuring the air a person can breathe out and the time it takes to do so.

The Accidental Binge Drinker

Are you drinking too much and don&apos;t even know it ?

 The Accidental Binge Drinker : How Much We Really Pour

 Chances are you&apos;re drinking far more alcohol than you think.

&quot;Often my clients think they are just having one or two drinks, when really they&apos;re having more like three or four,&quot; says Lisa R. Young, a New York University nutritionist.

Try this experiment at home. Take your favorite wine or beer glass and use water to estimate drink size. Pour the contents into a measuring cup to see how close you come to the standard 5-ounce wine portion or 12-ounce beer portion.

I did this myself, and was stunned by the result. I filled my favorite wine glass just half full. But I still ended up with 300 milliliters or 10.14 ounces -- double the standard serving size.

Dr. Young says that a solution is for drinkers at restaurants to count each glass of wine, beer or spirits as two servings.

Yoga for an immune boost

Yoga has now been shown to give an immune boost to breast cancer survivors even as it promotes psychological well-being and delivering the physical output equivalent to a moderate-intensity exercise.

 Yoga gives immune boost to breast cancer survivors 

I&apos;ve been practicing yoga for over 15 years now, albeit only in classes. Apart from walking, yoga is my principal form of exercise. I&apos;m lucky to have a teacher who understands middle-aged bodies so we&apos;re not endlessly doing upside down dog and sun salutations.  Instead he aims to get us to a state of energized relaxation and often incorporates elements of qi gong.
 

 

For those who have never tried yoga or for beginners, here are some of the physiological and psychological health benefits of yoga.  For the middle-aged, I believe yoga is better than most other forms of exercise because of the low risk of injury, the focus on the breath and the relaxed nature of the &quot;asanas&quot; or postures that build strength and balance. 

According to medical scientists, yoga therapy is successful because of the balance created in the nervous and endocrine systems which directly influences all the other systems and organs of the body.

&quot;Start Your Revolution&quot; Health

He brought you AOL back in the times when email was the latest thing and an email address with your name as part of it was really cool. After making AOL an online behemoth, Case merged it with the mass media giant Time-Warner in 2001, just in time for the dot-com recession. This merger of online and mass media never quite worked but not for lack of vision. Since resigning from the board in 2005, Case has been looking at health care

His new venture is Revolution Health . In a video on the site, he tells us his vision and why he started it.

 

From the Press Release &quot;Manifesto&quot;

- After three months in preview mode, Revolution Health today formally launched RevolutionHealth.com, a comprehensive health and medical information site, specially designed with the family&apos;s Chief Health Officer - busy moms and other caregivers - in mind. Revolution Health also announced the acquisition of TLContact, Inc., the company that provides CarePages, the leading Internet service for building online communities that support communication among family and friends when someone is receiving care. 
 

There is a lot of great health information and tools on the Internet, but nobody has assembled them in a way that is compelling and useful for consumers who want to take more control of their family&apos;s health. We&apos;ve scoured the landscape to find the very best health tools and content, and we&apos;ve put them together all in one place - and made them all free. We will continue to work to build - in partnership with dozens of organizations and millions of people - the Internet&apos;s leading health site.&quot;

I&apos;ve been impressed with CarePages , a service that helps keep family and friends updated and last year wrote a post about them. Today, more than 500 hospitals offer CarePages to their patients, though anyone can create one free of charge.

 Case writes a blog on CarePages chronicling Revolution Health.

The website itself is quite good, with as much attention to healthy living as to getting good information and support if sick. You can know your risk , build your own health page in beta, find out what&apos;s bothering you with symptom-checker , find a doctor and rate yours, find drugs and treatment and rate yours, assess and track your health with 150 tools, even organize your health records. 

With videos about common medical procedures and meditation, with expert medical bloggers and ratings by other people just like you, I&apos;m betting that Revolution Health will help you get to a healthier place.

Migraines: Good for Your Brain?

I suffered with migraines for years and years.  They ended after a 5 day juice fast at a funky spa in Key West where I gave up smoking and the medications I was taking for the headaches. So I was pleased to read this.

 Headaches may be good for your brain 

 Is it possible that suffering through years of migraine headaches actually might have a beneficial effect on the brain?

A provocative new study has raised that improbable prospect after finding that longtime, middle-aged migraine sufferers showed less cognitive decline and memory loss over a period of 12 years than a group of migraine-free adults.

Researchers can&apos;t explain what could be a silver lining in the agonizing cloud that is migraine, but it&apos;s possible that the physiological changes that accompany the headaches might protect brain cells over the long haul.

Beyond offering a modicum of solace to the 30 million migraine sufferers in the United States, the strange finding, if verified, could offer researchers new leads into ways to preserve memory in aging brains.

&quot;This is really a surprise,&quot; said Bhupendra Khatri, director of the Center for Neurological Disorders at Aurora St. Luke&apos;s Medical Center. &quot;This is going to stimulate a lot of research.&quot;

Stop Taking Hormones

If you are menopausal, stop taking hormones.

 Sharp drop in breast cancer victims tied to reduced hormone use. 

 
&quot;At first I didn&apos;t believe it—it was so astounding,&quot; said Donald Berry of the University of Texas, who led the analysis published in The New England Journal of Medicine. &quot;But it really looks like it&apos;s a story that holds together.&quot;
--

&quot;An awful lot of breast cancer was caused by doctors&apos; prescriptions,&quot; said Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

Researchers said the findings should encourage more women to discontinue hormone use or take them at the lowest dose for the shortest time necessary.

&quot;These data add to the message that we really should be discouraging women from initiating menopausal hormones,&quot; said Marcia Stefanick of Stanford University. &quot;We need to stop underplaying those risks. They are very real.&quot;

Coffee, Cigarettes and Parkinson&apos;s

From the New Scientist, Do coffee and cigarettes protect against Parkinson&apos;s?
 
 People with Parkinson&apos;s disease are less likely to be smokers and coffee drinkers than their healthy siblings, according to a study of family members. The finding adds to a growing body of evidence that some substance in tobacco might protect the brain against this devastating neurological disorder and sheds new light on coffee&apos;s effects on the disease.
---

One possible mechanism involves a signalling chemical in the brain called dopamine. The death of dopamine-producing cells in the brain appears to drive the progression of Parkinson&apos;s disease, and both smoking and drinking coffee can raise levels of the chemical.
--

Scott emphasises that the results of his study should not give anyone an excuse to start smoking. He says that the well-established risks of smoking–such as developing lung cancer or having a heart attack–&quot;absolutely&quot; outweigh any potential protection it might offer against Parkinson&apos;s.

&quot;And relative to lung disease and heart disease, Parkinson&apos;s disease is far less common,&quot; he adds.

Could Bacteria Lessen Depression?

Good bacteria and bad bacteria in An unexpected explanation for the rise of depression. 

 BACTERIA cause disease. The idea that they might also prevent disease is counterintuitive. Yet that is the hypothesis Chris Lowry, of Bristol University, and his colleagues are putting forward in Neuroscience. They think a particular sort of bacterium might alleviate clinical depression.

 And it all began with a chance observation an oncologist had while using an experimental treatment for lung cancer.
 
To find out what was going on, Dr Lowry turned to mice. His hypothesis was that the immune response to M. vaccae induces the brain to produce serotonin. This molecule is a neurotransmitter (a chemical messenger between nerve cells) and one symptom of depression is low levels of it.
 
So we have a study &quot;intriguing for two reasons.&quot;
1. the possibility of a vaccination against depression.
2. a new line of inquiry as to why depression is becoming more common.
 
One explanation for the rise of these two conditions is the hygiene hypothesis. This suggests a lack of childhood exposure to harmless bugs is leading to improperly primed immune systems, which then go on to look for trouble where none exists.

Stop Dieting

Those of you who have never dieted or have given up dieting will take cheer in the new study that shows diets damage health 

 The analysis, published in the journal American Psychologist, concluded dieters may actually be damaging their health.

Research has shown the repeated rapid weight gain and loss associated with dieting can double the risk of death from heart disease, including heart attacks, and the risk of premature death in general.

Such yo-yo weight loss has also been linked to stroke and diabetes and shown to suppress the immune system, making the body more vulnerable to infection.

Dr Mann said: &quot;We decided to dig up and analyse every study that followed people on diets for two to five years. We concluded most of them would have been better off not going on the diet at all.

&quot;Their weight would have been pretty much the same, and their bodies would not suffer the wear and tear from losing weight and gaining it all back.

&quot;The benefits of dieting are simply too small and the potential harms of dieting are too large for it to be recommended as a safe and effective treatment for obesity.&quot;
 

People who want to lose weight just have to change into eating a healthy balanced diet and exercise.

Ignoring Lessons Learned from Heart Disease

 A serious heart attack is as much of an emergency as being shot. 

 “We deal with it as if it is a gunshot wound to the heart,”Dr. Antman said.

Cardiologists call it the golden hour, that window of time when they have a chance to save most of the heart muscle when an artery is blocked.
 
Don&apos;t think of a clutching your heart pain like you see in the movies.  Consider pressure, a feeling of heaviness, shortness of breath.
 

 Most patients describe something like Mr. Orr’s symptoms—discomfort in the chest that may, or may not, radiate into the arms or neck, the back, the jaw, or the stomach. Many also have nausea or shortness of breath. Or they break out in a cold sweat, or have a feeling of anxiety or impending doom, or have blue lips or hands or feet, or feel a sudden exhaustion.

But symptoms often are less distinctive in elderly patients, especially women. Their only sign may be a sudden feeling of exhaustion just walking across a room. Some say they broke out in a sweat. Afterward, they may recall a feeling of pressure in their chest or pain radiating from their chest but at the time, they say, they paid little attention.
 

The time in getting to an emergency room in time for treatment hasn&apos;t changed in 10 years - it&apos;s still 110 minutes, one hour and 50 minutes.

People drive themselves to the ER or get a friend to do so. And then they wait to get triaged. They don&apos;t come in with sirens blazing, treatment already started, and jump to the head of the line.
 
 They don&apos;t call 911 because of embarrassment.  Said Dr. Skopp
“But it is better to be checked out and find out it’s not a problem than to have a problem and not have the therapy,”he said.
 
The ideal treatment you want is angioplasty, the ideal treatment.

Second best is a clot-dissolving drug like tPA even though it opens up only 60-70% of blocked arteries and kills 1 out of 200 patients with a stroke to the brain.

 Dr. Antman has a message for patients: With a disease as serious as heart disease, those who take responsibility are often the ones who survive.
 
Having a heart attack, even if it turns out well, as his did, is a life-altering experience, Mr. Orr said.
 
The New York Times follows Keith Orr, 44, who thought he was doing great, what with his improved diet and exercise and all, so he stopped taking his medications. Luckily, he was in Boston.  Lessons of Heart Disease, Learned and Ignored.

Flu, Guns and Swimming Pools.

John Stossel calls the media, part of the Fear Industrial Complex, because they profit from scaring us to death. 

Of course, they feature abducted children, shark attacks, nightmare scenarios about global warming because they are good stories and ratings soar.  Reporters and writers were likely English majors, not math majors and they are clueless when it comes to statistics assessing risk.. He calls them &quot;statistically illiterate.&quot;

 We should Worry About the Right Things , Stossel says.

Ordinary flu kills 36,000 people a year in the USA
Bird flu has killed 0.

Swimming pools are more dangerous to children than guns.
A child is 100 times more likely to die in a swimming pool than in a gun accident.

Cars are the most dangerous things around. About 36,500 were killed in car accidents last year, about 100/day.

 
So take our reporting with heavy skepticism. Ignore us when we hyperventilate about mad cow disease and the danger of asbestos hidden behind a wall.

Instead, worry about what&apos;s worth worrying about: driving, acting reckless, smoking cigarettes, drinking too much, and eating too much.

Tony Snow&apos;s Advice

When we learned that Tony Snow&apos;s cancer returned, those of us who liked him were saddened. None perhaps more than cancer survivors who took much inspiration from him.

G.M.Roper who announced he had cancer in 2006, published a note Tony had sent him which should be sent to everyone who&apos;s just learned about their cancer. 

 First, enlist as much love and support from friends as you can, and don&apos;t be shy. One of the great distinguishing characteristic of Americans is that they always want a chance to do something good. ... most will rally in wondrous and suprising ways. Give them a chance to help. They&apos;ll come through for you.

Second, talk to other cancer patients. They have street cred others don&apos;t.
--
Third, learn as much as you can -- ignorance is your enemy -- but don&apos;t get too hooked on internet sites. Many of them are idiotic...
---
Fourth, keep the fighting attitude...Once the game is on, you don&apos;t have any choice. You have to play. So play to win.
--
Fifth: Realize that fear is a complete waste of time, even though it will creep up on you from time to time.
---
Sixth, relish and embrace your faith...Prayer is an amazing thing, and the healing power of prayer -- something I always suspected before getting cancer -- is palpable and real. 

 

With prayers and hopes for his second recovery

On Elizabeth Edwards and the return of her cancer

The breast cancer of Elizabeth Edwards has returned in an advanced form and has spread beyond the breast to the bone. While the doctors say it is incurable, it is treatable. Her husband John Edwards offered to pull out of the presidential race to stay by her side, but she insisted he stay in and he will.

My feelings are confused. I feel bad for them both and then heartened by their courage and puzzled by their decision. Who would put themselves through the rigors of a campaign when the days may be short?

But then again, who knows?

Dean Barnett, who had his own body blow of a sudden diagnosis 11 years ago has some understanding of what they are going through.
 
 I think I have some understanding and I know I have some sympathy. They’re working through all of this. Their first instinct is not to surrender. That’s good, and it’s what you would have expected. People who seek the presidency aren’t the types who give up or even compromise easily.

THROUGH THE YEARS, I’VE COME TO VIEW SERIOUS and progressive illness as an ever constricting circle with oneself at the center. The interior of the circle represents the contents of one’s life. As the circle gets smaller, things that were inside get forced out. Some of these things are dearly missed; other items that were once thought precious get forced to the exterior and turn out to go surprisingly unlamented.
-
The Edwards have begun their own journey of that sort. Whether they still find presidential politics at the center of their lives a few months from now is an open question. Regardless, the journey is theirs, and one would have a heart of stone to wish them anything other than good luck and Godspeed.

 

He&apos;s right. Best wishes and good luck to them both.

Umbilical Blood Banks

Are Umbilical Blood Banks &quot;Taking Advantage&quot; of Parents? 

You could spend thousands of dollars ($1700-$2500) to collect plus the doctor&apos;s fee and your insurer won&apos;t cover the cost. Add that to the annual fee of $175-$200 that you know will go up, and you&apos;re talking real money without understanding the limited benefits.
 
Earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics said parents should only bank if they have an older child with a condition that could benefit.

Because genetic diseases are already present in umbilical cord blood, the cells cannot help children who later develop that type of disease, although they could help family members.
 
You might want to consider donation to public banks that store blood for treatment and research.

 &quot;You also don&apos;t know what can happen. A lot of diseases, most diseases are not genetically based,&quot; he said, citing anemia and brain injuries.

&quot;It&apos;s like an expensive insurance policy, but right now I can&apos;t tell you what my insurance is against,

A Computer as Your Health Proxy? The 1% rule

With a health proxy, also known as advance medical directives, people can empower surrogates to make medical decisions for them when they can&apos;t.

How well do these surrogates do in predicting the wishes of their patients?

New Scientist reports Can computers make life-or-death decisions? 

 A review of 16 studies found that surrogates got it right only 68% of the time.

Bioethicist David Wendler of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, US and colleagues wondered whether a formula could be used to better predict a patient’s wishes.

 The data suggested that most people want life-saving treatment if there is at least a 1% chance that following the intervention they would have the ability to reason, remember and communicate. If there is less than a 1% chance, people generally say they would choose not to have the treatment.

“The difference between zero and 1% is all the difference in the world for someone,”says Wendler. 
--
Wendler says he was surprised at the formula’s accuracy.“I think it’s fascinating. At first when you hear it you think‘That just can’t be right,’”he says.

He imagines a situation in which a surrogate is told there is only a 5% chance that an incapacitated loved one will survive a life-saving surgery following an auto accident. He says that the relative might predict that the patient would not want the intervention while the formula would predict that they did.

Wendler now wants to collect medical care preferences from people of various ethnic, religious and gender groups, which will help his team refine the formula. He believes that a computer program might one day predict patient’s wishes to an accuracy of 90%.

And the tool could take some of the pressure off of relatives who sometimes have to decide whether or not to switch off a patient’s life support machine.

Getting Older Sooner

 Americans in their early to mid-50s today report poorer health, more pain and more trouble doing everyday physical tasks than their older peers reported at the same age in years past, a recent analysis has shown.
 
The survey of 20,000 Americans over 50 began in 1992 with research by the National Bureau of Economic Research supported by the National Institute on Aging, part of the NIH.

Researchers took 3 age groups: those born in 1936-41 (now ages 66 to 71), 1942-47 (now ages 60 to 65) and 1948-53 (now ages 54 to 59). They compared the self-reported health at ages 51-56.

 The youngest group reported having more pain, chronic health conditions, and drinking and psychiatric problems than people who were the same age 12 years earlier.

 Seems to coincide pretty closely with TV adoption and more sedentary life-styles, the wider availability of junk food and increased stress of all sorts, the dry rot I wrote about yesterday.

Would You Want to Know?

Katherine Moser faced her genetic destiny early when she learned that she, like others in her family, carried the gene for Huntington&apos;s Disease.

The decision to take the genetic test was hers and now she is Facing Life with a Lethal Gene.
 
 Ms. Moser is part of a vanguard of people at risk for Huntington’s who are choosing to learn early what their future holds. Facing their genetic heritage, they say, will help them decide how to live their lives.
---
She never, she said, regretted being tested. But at night, crying herself to sleep in the dark of her lavender bedroom, she would go over and over it. She was the same, but she was also different. And there was nothing she could do.
--
Like many families affected by Huntington’s, Ms. Moser’s regarded the disease as a curse, not to be mentioned even as it dominated their lives in the form of her grandfather’s writhing body and unpredictable rages.
--
Ms. Moser is still part of a distinct minority. But some researchers say her attitude is increasingly common among young people who know they may develop Huntington’s.

More informed about the genetics of the disease than any previous generation, they are convinced that they would rather know how many healthy years they have left than wake up one day to find the illness upon them.
--
More than anything now, Ms. Moser said, she is filled with a sense of urgency.

“I have a lot to do,”she said.“And I don’t have a lot of time.”

Growing Your Body Better

Here&apos;s a most interesting summation of recent scientific findings concerning &quot;Normal&quot; Aging  by Dr. Henry Lodge, Columbia University

You replace about 1% of your cells every day. That means 1% of your body is brand-new today, and you will get another 1% tomorrow. Think of it as getting a whole new body every three months. It’s not entirely accurate, but it’s pretty close.
--
You choose whether those new cells come in stronger or weaker. You choose whether they grow or decay each day from then on. Your cells don’t care which choice you make. They just follow the directions you send. Exercise, and your cells get stronger; sit down, and they decay.

This whole system evolved over billions of years out in nature, where all animals face two great cellular challenges: The first is to grow strong, fast and fit in the spring, when food abounds and there are calories to fuel hungry muscles, bones and brains. The second is to decay as fast as possible in the winter, when calories disappear and surviving starvation is the key to life. You would think that food is the controlling signal for this, but it’s not. Motion controls your system.
--

The other master signal to our cells—equal and, in some respects, even more important than exercise—is emotion. One of the most fascinating revelations of the last decade is that emotions change our cells through the same molecular pathways as exercise. Anger, stress and loneliness are signals for“starvation”and chronic danger. They“melt”our bodies as surely as sedentary living. Optimism, love and community trigger the process of growth, building our bodies, hearts and minds.

--
 Most aging is just the dry rot we program into our cells by sedentary living, junk food and stress.

Why Exercise Boosts Brainpower

Using MRI - magnetic resonance imaging scans - researchers found that exercise boosts brainpower by building new brain cells in a brain region linked with memory and memory loss

 &quot;No previous research has systematically examined the different regions of the hippocampus and identified which region is most affected by exercise,&quot; Dr. Scott Small, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who led the study, said in a statement.
 
 Study shows why exercise boosts brainpower. 

It won&apos;t be long before doctors will be prescribing specific exercise to improve your memory.

We&apos;ve known the connection before, we just haven&apos;t understood why. 

 3 Hours of Exercise a week bolsters Memory, Intellect by boosting brain volume, increasing connections between cells.

Exercise can significantly cut a person&apos;s risk for dementia by increasing blood flow and oxygen .

 Exercise releases a feel-good chemical - phenylethylamine - which works as an anti-depressant.

More exercise along with less junk food and more fish can prevent 80% of coronary heart disease and 90% of type 2 diabetes .

Patient Advocates - Your Attorneys in the Court of Medicine

Dr. Jonathan Fine is organizing some of his retired colleagues in a new venture called Bedside Advocates to provide one-on-one support and comfort to people in hospitals, an educated ombudsman as it were.

 From retired caregivers, a spoonful of compassion. 
 The volunteers with Bedside Advocates will not practice medicine. Instead, they aim to provide comfort and compassion while helping fragile and elderly patients navigate the increasingly complex medical system by accompanying them to the doctor&apos;s office, the hospital, and the nursing home. They hope to help patients get better care by empowering them to ask questions, follow their medication regimes, and get prompt attention to problems.

And most of all, they plan to be there when no one else is, providing relief for tired caregivers and support for patients without families, according to Dr. Jonathan Fine, who is leading the effort.
--

Fine, 75, of Cambridge, envisions a cadre of retired doctors, nurses, physician&apos;s assistants, and trained lay people who would provide one-on-one support to thousands of patients, seeking to humanize healthcare while reducing medical errors, complications, and hospitalizations. He has already recruited about 20 doctors and secured some start-up funding from the Legislature, and he plans to launch the program in a pilot phase this spring. The organization expects to find needy patients through practicing doctors, senior centers, and people who call asking for help.

 

Said one man whom Dr. Fine helped deal with a &quot;litany of specialists&quot;.

 It&apos;s like having your own attorney in the court of medicine. A man like Jonathan, the US needs millions like him.&quot;

 If it works, it could be a national model. It&apos;s how I envision solving the health care crisis of boomers getting older - boomers helping each other.

Killer Vitamins

If you&apos;re taking vitamins A, E or beta-carotene pills, you might want to reconsider after this report by the Copenhagen University that suggests such vitamins appear to raise, not lower, the risk of death.

 Vitamins &apos;could shorten lifespan&apos;
 
 The Copenhagen team reviewed more than 815 clinical trials into the benefits of vitamins A, E, and C, alongside beta-carotene and selenium - all commonly-used supplements.

They selected 68 whose methods were more likely to produce an accurate picture of vitamin benefits, then added their results together to form one, large-scale study.
---
&quot;Considering that 10% to 20% of the adult population in Europe and North America may consume the supplements, the public health consequences may be substantial.&quot;

They said there were several different explanations for this increase in risk - and suggested that knocking out &apos;free radicals&apos; might actually interfere with a natural defence mechanism within the body.

 

Eating more fruits and vegetables, a more balanced diet in other words, is a lot safer. Drinking coffee and eating dark chocolate will also add anti-oxidants naturally.

Research for Down Syndrome

This looks like a very promising line of research for children afflicted with Down syndrome.
 
 Lab mice with the mental retardation of Down syndrome got smarter after being fed a drug that strengthened brain circuits involved in learning and memory, researchers reported Sunday.

After receiving once-daily doses of pentylenetetrazole, or PTZ, for 17 days, the mice could recognize objects and navigate mazes as well as normal mice did, researchers said. The improvements lasted up to two months after the drug was discontinued, according to the report in the journal Nature Neuroscience.
--

Patricia A. O&apos;Brien White, ... said medical advances since the 1980s had more than doubled the life span of people with Down syndrome, to 56, increasing the likelihood that they would outlive the parents who cared for them. A small gain in cognition would allow a significant number of people with Down syndrome to hold jobs and live independently, she said.

&quot;Typically the message that parents receive when the child is born is that nothing can be done,&quot; White said. &quot;I think this study offers a different perspective.&quot;

Pithy eating advice

Michael Pollan, author of the Omnivore&apos;s Dilemma , wrote Unhappy Meals in the New York Times Magazine that begins with the shortest, pithiest and best advice on eating you will ever get.

 Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.    

He expands on this advice for 3000 words

More tidbits:
 And you’re much better off eating whole fresh foods than processed food products. ....Don’t eat anything your great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.

if you’re concerned about your health, you should probably avoid food products that make health claims. Why? Because a health claim on a food product is a good indication that it’s not really food, and food is what you want to eat.
 

Nuturionism is not nutrition, it&apos;s a religion.

No one likes to admit that his or her best efforts at understanding and solving a problem have actually made the problem worse, but that’s exactly what has happened in the case of nutritionism. Scientists operating with the best of intentions, using the best tools at their disposal, have taught us to look at food in a way that has diminished our pleasure in eating it while doing little or nothing to improve our health.

Male Yoga

The Real Live Preacher makes a good case that male yoga is nothing more than playing catch 

Right in the middle of the conversation, I asked Cristopher,“When was the last time you played catch?”

“Just catch?”

“Yeah, just got out with a friend and threw the ball back and forth.”

“I don’t know,”he said.“Years, I guess.”

“So why did we stop doing that? I mean, I LOVE playing catch. I wish I could play catch right now!”
And so was born a new kind of lectionary study group. I pulled my old glove out of the closet–the one I’ve had since I was 12. I had to re-lace parts of it, but it still feels perfect on my hand. Cristopher and I get together once a week or so. We throw the ball around while talking about the passages in the lectionary for the coming Sunday. Sometimes we just play catch and say nothing. Or we might stop, sit down and talk more seriously. We do whatever we want to do.

I was scared the first time we met, wondering how long it would take before I regained my instinctive feel for my arm and my release. The baseball felt very small in my hand, and I was pretty wild. And man, was I ever sore the next day. We’ve gotten together three times now, and my arm has loosened up considerably. It’s starting to feel natural for me to throw a baseball. I don’t worry about it. I just let it loose and feel the power of my arm. My whole body moves in the follow-through, and when our &quot;study session&quot; is done, I feel loose and warm all over.

It’s like the ultimate male yoga.

Forgetting the Urge

Can you forget the urge to smoke? Smokers and former smokers say never, but a recent study says differently.

 In Clue to Addiction, a Brain Injury Halts Smoking 

 Scientists studying stroke patients are reporting today that an injury to a specific part of the brain, near the ear, can instantly and permanently break a smoking habit. People with the injury who stopped smoking found that their bodies, as one man put it,“forgot the urge to smoke.”
 
I can attest to this. I don&apos;t have the brain injury, my sister Deborah does. About 15 years ago, Debby, who also suffers from multiple sclerosis, got encephalitis, probably after being bit by a mosquito.  She had seizures for several hours. When she awoke, she completely forgot she had been a smoker. She also forgot about chocolate, a far more grievous memory loss. &quot;Chocolate?, what&apos;s chocolate.&quot; she said.

Her brothers and sisters soon took great pleasure in reintroducing her to wonders of chocolate. Cigarettes, we never mentioned.

 This is the first time we’ve shown anything like this, that damage to a specific brain area could remove the problem of addiction entirely,”said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which financed the study, along with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.“It’s absolutely mind-boggling.”

Asperger&apos;s - Stupid and Smart at Same Time

&quot;The problem with Asperger&apos;s,&quot; she says, &quot;is you&apos;re stupid and smart at the same time.&quot;

 
&quot;I feel people&apos;s eyes are always saying something,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s very intense for one thing, so it&apos;s overwhelming. The other thing is I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re saying.&quot; 

Nomi Kaim tells the Boston Globe that living with Asperger&apos;s syndrome means taking everything one step at a time.
 
&apos;I didn&apos;t know where people like me were&apos; 

 
Kaim&apos;s brain is wired differently from most people&apos;s. She has Asperger&apos;s syndrome, a mild autism recognized as a disorder only since 1994. Those with Asperger&apos;s are verbal and as intelligent or more intelligent than average individuals . They have problems processing the myriad cues around them -- trouble understanding social situations and communicating in social settings, trouble distinguishing what&apos;s important from what&apos;s not, trouble with sensory overload or understimulation, trouble organizing their lives, trouble, as the saying goes, seeing the forest for the trees.
---
Kaim is 23, fast-talking and slow-walking, smart and curious, serious and self-absorbed, bad at multi-tasking and good at pouring herself into whatever she does.

From eMedicine
 Individuals with Asperger disorder have normal or even superior intelligence, and they may make great intellectual contributions, while demonstrating social insensitivity or even apparent indifference toward loved ones. Published case reports of men with Asperger disorder suggest an association with the capacity to accomplish cutting-edge research in computer science, mathematics, and physics. .... Persons with Asperger disorder have exhibited outstanding skills in mathematics, music, and computer sciences. Many are highly creative, and many prominent individuals demonstrate traits suggesting Asperger syndrome.

In Your New Masters Will Have Asperger&apos;s , AVI writes about the rigid and childish assumptions exhibited by Ray Kurzwei and others like him that all new technology will be good, bringing us a Heaven on earth. But such men lack the width and breadth of human experience or apparently recourse to any religious or philosophical thought and so they have trouble understanding the implications for society as a whole.

&quot;It&apos;s the Nutrition, Stupid&quot;

It&apos;s not the medical care, but early nutrition that gives us longer, healthier lives concludes the Assistant Village Idiot.

He reviews Robert Fogel&apos;s T he Escape from Hunger and Premature Death 1700-2100.
 
 All of this is not very new information, though it has yet to penetrate the popular imagination as much as it should. Fogel&apos;s contribution to all this is to insist that it is the consistent nutrition, not improved medical care, that has extended life expectancy. Early or even prenatal &quot;nutritional trauma&quot; is strongly implicated in late-life medical difficulties. Diabetes, respiratory illness, cardiac conditions, genitourinary conditions - all these are cause more by early malnutrition than medical care throughout life.

Among the more dramatic statistics: Males after age 50 today have on average slightly more than one serious medical condition, such as hypertension, COPD, diabetes. In 1910, males after age 50 had six of these, on average. Those who reached 50 could often expect to reach 63-66, but they were uncomfortable, painful, inactive years.

Taking small steps

Here are small steps for healthier living from Tara Parker Pope in the WSJ. 

 1. Eat at the table . Numerous studies show that meals consumed at the dinner table are more likely to be healthful and contain fewer calories than meals eaten elsewhere in the house or on the run.

 2. Play with your kids . Whether it&apos;s ice-skating or soccer, playing with your kids is exercise.

 3. Downsize favorite foods . Switching from a grande to a tall latte saves calories and money. 

 4. Eat more soup . You feel fuller on few calories.

 5. Use the kitchen . Cook at home more often and you&apos;ll lose weight.

 6. Schedule a birthday checkup . As your birthday rolls around, let it be a reminder to schedule all the annual tests you need. That way you&apos;ll remembe.r

Housework wards off breast cancer

Who knew that keeping your house neat and tidy did more to protect against breast cancer than any other type of exercise like going to the gym?

 Housework wards off breast cancer

 The researchers analysed data on work, leisure and housework activity levels among 218,169 women aged 20 to 80 from nine European countries including the UK
 ---
 Writing in the January edition of the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention, Dr Petra Lahmann of the Medical Research Council&apos;s Human Nutrition Research unit in Cambridge, said: &quot;Increased non-occupational physical activity and, in particular, increased household activity, were significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk, independent of other potential risk factors.

&quot;Our results . . . provide additional evidence that moderate forms of physical activity, such as household activity, may be more important than less frequent but more intense recreational physical activity in reducing breast cancer risk.&quot;

Brain Gyms

 Brain gyms for the elderly 

If you’re worried that your mental powers will decline as you age, a new study offers hope that a relatively brief flurry of brain exercises can slow the mind’s deterioration.

The study, whose findings were published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 2,800 men and women in six American cities. All were healthy, 65 and older, and living independently. Most participants were given 10 sessions of training to improve a particular mental skill. A memory group learned strategies for remembering word lists and textual material. A reasoning group learned how to find the pattern in a letter or word series. And a third group was trained to identify an object on a computer screen at increasingly brief exposures.

 When tested five years later, these participants had less of a decline in the skill they were trained in than did a control group that received no cognitive training. The payoff from mental exercise seemed far greater than we are accustomed to getting for physical exercise—as if 10 workouts at the gym were enough to keep you fit five years later.

Parasite explains a lot

 Parasite makes men dumb, women sexy 

 About 40 per cent of the world&apos;s population is infected with Toxoplasma gondii....

Human infection generally occurs when people eat raw or undercooked meat that has cysts containing the parasite, or accidentally ingest some of the parasite&apos;s eggs excreted by an infected cat.

The parasite is known to be dangerous to pregnant women as it can cause disability or abortion of the unborn child, and can also kill people whose immune systems are weakened.

Unprotected

In the Wall Street Journal, Danielle Crittenden reviews  &quot;Unprotected&quot; by a doctor who remains anonymous, fearing that she would be punished personally and professionally if her employer or colleagues knew what she really thought.

Hard to believe isn&apos;t it in this day and age? What is it that she says that&apos;s so shocking?

 &quot;My patients were hurting, they looked to me and what could I do?&quot; So confesses an anonymous campus physician in the beginning of her startling memoir. Over the course of 200 pages, she tells story after story about suffering young women. If these women were ailing from eating disorders, or substance abuse, or almost any other medical or psychological problem, their university health departments would spring to their aid. &quot;Cardiologists hound patients about fatty diets and insufficient exercise. Pediatricians encourage healthy snacks, helmets and discussion of drugs and alcohol. Everyone condemns smoking and tanning beds.&quot;

Unfortunately, the young women described in &quot;Unprotected&quot; have fallen victim to one of the few personal troubles that our caring professions refuse to treat or even acknowledge: They have been made miserable by their &quot;sexual choices.&quot; And on that subject, few modern doctors dare express a word of judgment.
 

Young women are rarely told that there are physical, emotional, psychological, moral and spiritual consequences to their behavior.

Apparently, &apos;being judgmental&quot; trumps everything, even common sense.

Viagra, Cutting through the fog to fight cancer

 Viagra might help the body fight cancer. 

 VIAGRA and other impotence drugs help switch on the immune system to attack a range of cancers, a study has found.

The disease usually manages to avoid destruction partly because tumours produce a fog of chemicals that hide it from white blood cells.

But Viagra, a brand name for sildenafil, and other such drugs were found to reduce the amount of these chemicals, enabling the immune system to target the cancer more effectively.

Tests at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Centre in the United States found the drug reduced the size of colon and breast tumours in mice threefold.
-- -
 
The study, reported in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, was the latest to show other uses for sildenafil beyond the most common one.

It was developed as a drug to treat hypertension by dilating blood vessels and lowering blood pressure.

Subsequent research suggested it could reduce the thickness of the heart wall and have other benefits relating to cancer.

Viagra suppresses levels of nitric oxide, one component of the fog which protects tumours from the immune system, and this is a critical compound involved in a variety of &quot;signalling pathways&quot; used in the body.

Organic Chicken a Waste of Money

When organic and free range chicken can cost as much as three times as much as supermarket chicken, you certainly expect it to taste better and be more nutritious.

Sorry, but it&apos;s not. 

 From a report of a study published in the International Journal of Food Sciences.

 organic poultry is actually less nutritious, contains more fat and tastes worse than its mass-produced equivalent, research has shown.

Tests on supermarket chicken breasts showed that organic versions contained lower levels of health-boosting omega 3 fatty acids than other varieties, including non-organic free-range poultry.

The compounds, present in high levels in oily fish, are thought to be responsible for a host of health benefits, from combating heart disease to boosting intelligence.

Lack of Oxygen

The underlying cause of Alzheimer&apos;s may be lack of oxygen. 
 
Previous studies have shown that diabetes, stroke, clogged arteries and ageing all increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Only 5% of cases appear to have been strongly influenced by genetic factors. Now evidence has emerged that lack of oxygen may be the ultimate cause.
---
So getting enough oxygen to the brain may help stave off Alzheimer’s in people with known risk factors...

 

One of the best ways to get oxygen to the brain is by increasing blood flow. What better way than exercise. 

Regular exercise reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&apos;s disease up to 40%.

For those who have already developed early symptoms, exercise delays progression.

Live longer and be loved by a dog

 Dogs may hold the secret to a long life. 

 DOGS may be the secret to health and happiness because they encouraged their owners to walk them daily whatever their mood or circumstances, British researchers said today.

Researchers at the University of Portsmouth found that dog owners felt obliged to walk their dogs despite bad weather or low moods, keeping them fit and making them feel better once they were out.
--

Ms Knight said that many participants in the study were retired people, including those who had been widowed or otherwise lived alone, or were recovering from illness or operations.

She said that they discussed occasions when they had felt lonely, isolated or depressed, and reported that their dogs helped them stay physically fitter and helped maintain social contacts.
 
Besides, what other creature gives so much unconditional love and affection?

 Dogs have given us their absolute all. We are the center of their universe. We are the focus of their love and faith and trust. They serve us in return for scraps.

The French paradox

The best news of the day, maybe the month.

Red wine may offset the bad effects of a high-calorie diet and extend your life as well. It&apos;s the resveratrol, a natural substance in the wine.

At least it works for mice.

The New York Times reports Substance in Red Wine Extends Life of Mice
 
Can you have your cake and eat it? Is there a free lunch after all, red wine included? Researchers at the Harvard Medical School and the National Institute on Aging report that a natural substance found in red wine, known as resveratrol, offsets the bad effects of a high-calorie diet in mice and significantly extends their lifespan.
 

Their report, published electronically today in Nature, implies that very large daily doses of resveratrol could offset the unhealthy, high-calorie diet thought to underlie the rising toll of obesity in the United States and elsewhere, should people respond to the drug as mice do.

Resveratrol is found in the skin of grapes and in red wine and is conjectured to be a partial explanation for the French paradox, the puzzling fact that people in France tend to enjoy a high-fat diet yet suffer less heart disease than Americans.

Arthritis and DNA

 Is arthritis caused by a build-up of surplus DNA? 

 Mice that cannot degrade surplus DNA develop arthritis, according to a new study. If the same occurs in humans, the discovery may suggest new treatments for the inflammatory disorder, researchers say.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an often-crippling inflammation of the joints that afflicts two million people in the US alone. Now, Japanese scientists have discovered that mice which cannot degrade &quot;garbage&quot; DNA develop a condition very similar to human arthritis.

We dump a lot of DNA. Between the newly-made red blood cells that eject their nuclei before joining the circulation, and the many cells that die normally, we dispose of 10 to the 18th–a billion billion–genomes’worth every day. This garbage DNA is normally engulfed by scavenging white blood cells, called macrophages, which then degrade it using an enzyme called DNase II.
--

The researchers conclude that macrophages gorged with DNA they cannot digest turn on TNF-alpha production, which leads to chronic inflammation in the joint, causing arthritis.

 That research…made me believe that Embryonic stem cells are like uncut heroin…waaaay, way to powerful to use - they are part of begotten life in its purest form (perhaps still too near to God for our fooling with) - and they are so maleable as to be (so far in research) unpredictable and unusable. And that’s not even getting into the moral and ethical questions of whether or not a human embryo should be exploited in such a way, particularly when Adult Stem Cells are showing remarkable results in everything from helping sufferers of Sickle Cell Anemia and Thallassemias Major and Minor, to spinal injuries, skin regeneration and more.

Television and Autism

Could TV be the cause of the increasing rates of autism? 

Gregg Easterbrook discusses the findings from a recent Cornell study on Slate in TV Really Might Cause Autism.  
 
 Last month, I speculated in Slate that the mounting incidence of childhood autism may be related to increased television viewing among the very young. The autism rise began around 1980, about the same time cable television and VCRs became common, allowing children to watch television aimed at them any time. Since the brain is organizing during the first years of life and since human beings evolved responding to three-dimensional stimuli, I wondered if exposing toddlers to lots of colorful two-dimensional stimulation could be harmful to brain development. This was sheer speculation, since I knew of no researchers pursuing the question.


Today, Cornell University researchers are reporting what appears to be a statistically significant relationship between autism rates and television watching by children under the age of 3.
---
Everyone complains about television in a general way. But if it turns out television has specific harmful medical effects—in addition to these new findings about autism, some studies have linked television viewing by children younger than 3 to the onset of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder—parents may urgently need to know to keep toddlers away from the TV.
---
If screen images cause harm to brain development in the young, the proliferation of these TV-like devices may bode ill for the future. The aggressive marketing of Teletubbies, Baby Einstein videos, and similar products intended to encourage television watching by toddlers may turn out to have been a nightmarish mistake.


 

If I were the parent of a baby, I&apos;d be very concerned. The relationship between television viewing and autism and ADD seems quite strong.

Get Older, Not Frailer

Why do some people age well and others get frail?

Two reasons:
1. undetected heart disease
2. having positive images of growing older

 Old but Not Frail: A Matter of Heart and Head 

 You’re only as old as you think you are. Rigorous studies are now showing that seeing, or hearing, gloomy nostrums about what it is like to be old can make people walk more slowly, hear and remember less well, and even affect their cardiovascular systems. Positive images of aging have the opposite effects. The constant message that old people are expected to be slow and weak and forgetful is not a reason for the full-blown frailty syndrome.
---

More and more scientists say they have been won over by an accumulating body of evidence.

“I am changing my initially skeptical view,”says Richard Suzman, who is director of the office of behavioral and social research programs at the National Institute on Aging.“There is growing evidence that these subjective experiences might be more important than we thought.”
--
Dr. Levy wondered, were there long-term effects of believing the stereotypes of aging? She found a study that could provide answers, the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement. The two-decade-long study included 1,157 people, nearly every resident of Oxford, Ohio, who was 50 or older and was not suffering from dementia. And it had questions about beliefs about aging.

It turned out that people who had more positive views about aging were healthier over time. They lived an average of 7.6 years longer than those of a similar age who did not hold such views, and even had less hearing loss when their hearing was tested three years after the study began

 Marijuana may stave off Alzheimer&apos;s 

 New research shows that the active ingredient in marijuana may prevent the progression of the disease by preserving levels of an important neurotransmitter that allows the brain to function.

Researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in California found that marijuana&apos;s active ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, can prevent the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from breaking down more effectively than commercially marketed drugs.

THC is also more effective at blocking clumps of protein that can inhibit memory and cognition in Alzheimer&apos;s patients, the researchers reported in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics.

Fish Oil After Heart Attacks Works

In Italy, it would be malpractice NOT to go home after a heart attack without a prescription for fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids.

Prescription fish oil has not been approved by the FDA

 In Europe it&apos;s fish oil after heart attacks. 

“Most cardiologists here are not giving omega-3’s even though the data supports it—there’s a real disconnect,”said Dr. Terry Jacobson, a preventive cardiologist at Emory University in Atlanta.“They have been very slow to incorporate the therapy.”
---
Because prescription fish oil is not licensed to prevent heart disease in the United States, drug companies may not legally promote it for that purpose at conferences, in doctors’offices, to patients or even on the Internet.

“If people paid more attention to guidelines, more people would be on the drug,”Dr. Jacobson said.“But pharmaceutical companies can’t drive this change. The fact that it’s not licensed for this has definitely kept doctors away.”

Reborn Indeed

This is extraordinary, wonderful news. A sleeping pill can temporarily revive people in a permanent vegetative state to the point where they can have conversations.

The Guardian report, Reborn
 We have always been told there is no recovery from persistent vegetative state - doctors can only make a sufferer&apos;s last days as painless as possible. But is that really the truth? Across three continents, severely brain-damaged patients are awake and talking after taking ... a sleeping pill. And no one is more baffled than the GP who made the breakthrough. Steve Boggan witnesses these &apos;strange and wonderful&apos; rebirths


For three years, Riaan Bolton has lain motionless, his eyes open but unseeing. After a devastating car crash doctors said he would never again see or speak or hear. Now his mother, Johanna, dissolves a pill in a little water on a teaspoon and forces it gently into his mouth. Within half an hour, as if a switch has been flicked in his brain, Riaan looks around his home in the South African town of Kimberley and says, &quot;Hello.&quot; Shortly after his accident, Johanna had turned down the option of letting him die.


Three hundred miles away, Louis Viljoen, a young man who had once been cruelly described by a doctor as &quot;a cabbage&quot;, greets me with a mischievous smile and a streetwise four-move handshake. Until he took the pill, he too was supposed to be in what doctors call a persistent vegetative state.
 
 BBC report. 

Update: Jamias Cascio at Open the Future poses some ethical and legal questions
 But what about people who have &quot;pulled the plug&quot; on loved ones in persistent vegetative states in recent years? Do they read this news with the horrible realization that the now-dead partner or relative might have been saved with a $5 pill? What are the legal implications? The first use of zolpidem as an anti-PVS treatment was seven years ago, and has been replicated now dozens if not hundreds of times. Could a lawyer for family members opposed to the termination of care for a PVS patient sue the family members who chose to do so, and win?

While there are no hard data on the trend, doctors and patients say it has been increasing for several years and that the drugs are being used by Americans -- especially women -- of all sizes, from obese people to anorexics.

&quot;People are looking for a quick fix,&quot; says Christine Gerbstadt, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. &quot;Taking a pill is so much easier than going to the gym or cutting back on portions.&quot;

 

It&apos;s risky though. Adderall carries a black box warning against misuse which could cause sudden death or serious cardiovascular problems.

Tea healthier drink than water

Forget that old myth that tea is dehydrating. A cuppa is far better for you than water.  

Water doesn&apos;t have flavonoids, those antioxidants that help prevent cell damage. Tea does.

Drinking three or four cups of tea a day protects against heart disease, maybe cancer too, and strengthens your bones and helps prevent tooth plaque.

 Tea healthier than water 

 &quot;Drinking tea is actually better for you than drinking water. Water is essentially replacing fluid. Tea replaces fluids and contains antioxidants so its got two things going for it.&quot;
 
I sure hope that brewed than iced tea counts because that&apos;s all I drink during the day.

Reversing a dread disease

Just a month before the traditional Jerry Lewis Labor Day telethon for Muscular Dystrophy - 38 years and still going - comes great news.

 Muscular dystrophy reversal clue 

 US scientists have found a way to reverse muscular dystrophy (MD) in mice, offering hope of a cure for humans with muscle-wasting diseases.

The animals in the Nature Genetics study had myotonic dystrophy - the most common form of MD in adults.

The therapy targets a particular kind of toxic molecule to &quot;silence&quot; its presence in the diseased muscle.

The University of Virginia team showed the treatment fully restored heart and skeletal muscle function in mice.

In myotonic dystrophy, like the other types of MD, faulty DNA is to blame for the abnormalities that occur.

Stem Cells + Cancer

Scientific American asks whether Stem Cells are the Real Culprits in Cancer. 
 
 A dark side of stem cells--their potential to turn malignant--is at the root of a handful of cancers and may be the cause of many more. Eliminating the disease could depend on tracking down and destroying these elusive killer cells.
 

A malignant transformation turns them rogue.

 Many such similarities between stem cells and cancer cells have been noted. The classical definition of malignancy itself includes cancer cells&apos; apparent capacity to survive and multiply indefinitely, their ability to invade neighboring tissues and to migrate (metastasize) to distant sites in the body. In effect, the usual constraints that tightly control cellular proliferation and identity seem to have been lifted from cancer cells.

Normal stem cells&apos; power to self-renew already exempts them from the rules limiting life span and proliferation for most cells. ......
In healthy stem cells, strict genetic regulation keeps their potential for unlimited growth and diversification in check. Remove those control mechanisms, and the result would be some-thing that sounds very much like malignancy.

Butter and Avacado

Butter&apos;s good! It&apos;s butter that will make vegetables more nutritious. Butter and avocado and olive oil.

 Want Fat with That? A Surprising Way to Make Vegetables More Nutritous . From the Wall St Journal, subscribers only.

 It turns out that some of the best stuff in fruits and vegetables -- certain vitamins and cancer-fighting compounds -- are &quot;fat-soluble.&quot; That means some fat needs to be present for the body to adequately absorb the nutrients. But studies are now showing that people who opt for no-fat dressing or who skip adding foods like avocado or cheese to a dish to avoid fat calories, are getting far less out of their salads and other veggies.

&quot;What we&apos;re finding is that if you don&apos;t have some fat in the meal, all these wonderful&quot; compounds are missed, says Steven Clinton, program leader for molecular carcinogenesis and chemoprevention and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus. &quot;If the nutrients don&apos;t get into your system, then what good are they?&quot;
--

With the salad test, the impact of adding avocado was even greater. The first salad included romaine lettuce, baby spinach, shredded carrots and a no-fat dressing, resulting in a fat content of about 2%. After avocado was added, the fat content jumped to 42%. When the salad was consumed with the avocado, the 11 test subjects absorbed seven times the lutein and nearly 18 times the beta carotene. Lutein is a carotenoid found in many green vegetables and is linked with improved eye and heart health.
--
Study researchers say they were not only surprised by how much more absorption occurred with the avocado added to the meal, but they were taken aback at how little the body absorbed when no fats were present. &quot;The fact that so little was absorbed when no fat was there was just amazing to me,&quot; says Dr. Clinton

Umpteenth Reason to Take Fish Oil

 Overweight people lose more weight faster if they do light exercise and take fish oil, rich in Omega 3 fatty acids. 
 

 Fishy answer to weight loss 
 
We were very surprised to see it was so effective, especially since these people were still eating whatever they wanted,&quot; said researcher Alison Hill. 
 
&quot;It&apos;s pretty exciting because this implies the results would be even better if you did control diet and exercised more heavily.&quot; 
 
Scientists are still unsure exactly how Omega 3 works but they believe it may improve a person&apos;s ability to burn fat. 

Splendid salmon or fish oil rich in Omega 3 fatty acids may fight breast cancer,  helps prevent airway constriction in asthma and wards off dementia and helps with dry eye syndrome . Omega 3 fatty acids are good for your heart, your brain and your skin and make you more agreeable.  Some researchers suspect Omega 3 fatty acids can even can lower the murder rate. 

 One doctor gives a partial list of diseases that may be prevented or ameliorated with Omega 3 fatty acids:

 Coronary heart disease and stroke; Essential fatty acid deficiency in infancy (retinal and brain development); Autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus and nephropathy); Crohn disease; Cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate; Mild hypertension; and Rheumatoid arthritis. 

I think I need a whole new category on Omega 3.

Fatal Overdoses

There are more fatal overdoses on prescription pain killers than either cocaine or heroin.
 
Drugs called &quot;opioids&quot; are frequently prescribed to relieve pain, but if abused they can kill. Over the past 15 years, sales of opioid pain killers, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone and fentanyl, have increased, and deaths from these drugs have increased in parallel.

In 2002, over 16,000 people died in the USA as a result of drug overdoses, with most deaths related to opioids, heroin, and cocaine. Opioids surpassed both cocaine and heroin in extent of involvement in these drug overdoses between 1999 and 2002.

Addiction Transfer

A lot of people over the past five years have undergone weight-loss surgery. What researchers are starting to notice is that many are acquiring new compulsive disorders like alcoholism, gambling addiction or compulsive shopping.

 The New Science of Addiction (WSJ subscriber firewall)
 

The behavior has long been explained as a psychological phenomenon as patients seek new strategies for filling an inner void. But as substance-abuse experts learn to decode the brain&apos;s addiction pathways, some researchers are coming to believe that swapping behaviors may have a neurological basis.
 
So now the growing focus at the National Institute on Drug Abuse is to find new drugs that could treat craving and addictive behavior,

 
Bupropian, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as the antidepressant Wellbutrin and the smoking-cessation drug Zyban, is currently being studied as a treatment for gambling, obesity, nicotine dependence and alcoholism. And Rimonabant, made by Sanofi-Aventis is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for obesity and associated health problems, but it is also being studied as a treatment for alcoholism.

Salt Water and Cystic Fibrosis

Soxblog who suffers from cystic fibrosis has received amazing results from inhaling salt water.

 Salt Water and Other Miracles

 From my perspective, this seems like if not a miracle, something damn close to it. For years good people, the world’s best, have been pouring their hearts, souls and money into finding effective treatments for CF and generally coming up with very little. And all of a sudden, a super-promising new treatment comes along. And it’s salt water!
--
There’s also the additional minor miracle that being just salt water, the treatment didn’t have to spend the better part of a decade navigating the FDA approval maze before reaching the general CF public that so desperately needs it. If a similarly effective treatment had been a medicine hatched in the labs of Genzyme, the FDA would have kept it out of the hands of the seriously ill people (who would eagerly roll the dice on an experimental treatment) until those seriously ill people had become seriously dead.

The situation would be analogous to a 70 year old in declining health going to the doctor and finding out that not only might he make it to 80, his 70’s will be a lot better health-wise than his 60’s were.

The Brain is always giving birth unless stressed or depressed

It used to be the accepted scientific wisdom that we are born with all the brain cells we will ever have or need. Elizabeth Gould is the scientist who started a new field - neurogenesis - by proving that human brains continually create new brain cells.

Her research is explored in a well-written, accessible article in Seed magazine by Jonah Lehrer called The Reinvention of the Self. 

 The brain, Elizabeth Gould had now firmly established, is always giving birth. The self is continually reinventing itself.
 ---
 Put a primate under stressful conditions, and its brain begins to starve. It stops creating new cells. The cells it already has retreat inwards. The mind is disfigured.

The social implications of this research are staggering. If boring environments, stressful noises, and the primate’s particular slot in the dominance hierarchy all shape the architecture of the brain—and Gould’s team has shown that they do—then the playing field isn’t level. Poverty and stress aren’t just an idea: they are an anatomy. Some brains never even have a chance.
 ---
 Chronic stress, predictably enough, decreases neurogenesis. As Christian Mirescu, one of Gould’s post-docs, put it,“When a brain is worried, it’s just thinking about survival. It isn’t interested in investing in new cells for the future.”

On the other hand, enriched animal environments—enclosures that simulate the complexity of a natural habitat—lead to dramatic increases in both neurogenesis and the density of neuronal dendrites, the branches that connect one neuron to another. Complex surroundings create a complex brain. 

I would never have stumbled across it had it not been for Ambivablog and her post Stress and Depression Make You Stupid. 

 But it isn&apos;t just drugs that can reverse the long-term brain-stunting effects of deprivation and stress. An enriched and stimulating environment can coax the brain to begin to flourish and recreate itself again. &quot;On a cellular level, the scars of stress can literally be healed by learning new things.&quot;
 
(T.H. White, in The Once and Future King, wrote, &quot;The best thing for being sad is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails.&quot;)

Well, a new study shows that eating eggs may protect AGAINST heart disease, cancer and eye problems.

The incredible, edible egg is right.

 

Some trivia from the American Egg Board 

•The egg shell may have as many as 17,000 tiny pores over its surface. Through them, the egg can absorb flavors and odors. Storing them in their cartons helps keep them fresh.

•Eggs age more in one day at room temperature than in one week in the refrigerator.

•White shelled eggs are produced by hens with white feathers and ear lobes. Brown shelled eggs are produced by hens with red feathers and red ear lobes.

•A hen requires 24 to 26 hours to produce an egg. Thirty minutes later, she starts all over again.

Zapper

I used to suffer terribly from migraine headaches. I had cat scans and took medications for years. Then I went to a funky spa in Key West about 15 years ago to stop smoking.
I stopped taking my medication and went on a liquid fast for four days. We walked a lot, did yoga and soaked in the pool.

By the end, I had a great sense of well-being and I never got migraines again. Go figure.

But if I still had them, I would get me one of these Zappers . It&apos;s a new device that uses a magnetic pulse to disrupt and stave off headaches. It seems to prevent the initial electrical storm in the brain from developing into a full-blown migraine.

 
Describing the findings as very positive, Yousef Mohammad, a neurologist at Ohio, said that after treatment the patients studied reported a significant reduction in nausea, noise and light sensitivity.

“Perhaps the most significant effect of using the TMS device was on the two-hour symptom assessment, with 84 per cent of the episodes in patients using the TMS occurring without noise sensitivity.

“Work functioning also improved, and there were no side effects reported,”he said.“The device’s pulses are painless. The patients have felt a little pressure, but that’s all. These are very encouraging results.”

What&apos;s an acceptable risk?

If the old &quot;father knows best&quot; model for doctors doesn&apos;t work, neither does the neutral model of only the facts and it&apos;s your decision.

 What&apos;s an acceptable risk? How do you decide for yourself, for others?

 &quot;People hate the risk of bringing bad things on themselves,&quot; Dr. Ubel said, &quot;but a sense of responsibility makes them overcome these instincts to think about what&apos;s best for others.&quot; 

How the doctor frames the question makes a big difference.
 
&quot;Physicians who place emphasis on informed consent have mistakenly come to see this as a process in which they play only a neutral role,&quot; Dr. Appelbaum said, &quot;and not the role of someone who gives advice as well. Yet patients who value the information often value the advice, too, and that seems to me a very proper role for a physician to play.&quot; 

It only makes sense that we rely on our doctors for information and advice. Giving us only information about risks and telling us to decide for ourselves is a cop-out.

If your doctor doesn&apos;t tell you what he or she thinks is their best advice, given the facts, look for another one.

Sick blogs

 Sick blogs help afflicted share news and seek comfort .

 Last week, two Web sites, carepages .com and caringbridge.org, which host more formal &quot;patient pages&quot; through hospitals, reported a combined increase from 46,000 personal sites to 95,000 in the past year.
---

In the late 1990s, just as the Internet reached mainstream usage, sociologist Frank was one of the first to predict that a &quot;new patient&quot; would emerge from the era, one who researched his or her ailments in the comfort of home, then challenged a doctor with the newly acquired knowledge. Sick blogs and patient pages are evidence that that moment has arrived, Frank said, a sign that the new patient has gained an unprecedented sense of empowerment from his online community. In turn, he said, it also has created a new tension between patients and physicians.

&quot;What doctor likes being confronted by a patient who&apos;s been up all night canvassing the Internet?&quot; Frank asked.
--

&quot;You could call it a new grief ritual,&quot; said Victoria Pitts, an assistant sociology professor at City University of New York, who authored a 2004 study about breast cancer patients inspired to start personal Web sites. &quot;These people have created a new personal narrative to their illness, which goes beyond the health protocols they might have found on WebMD. .. . But whether it&apos;s helping their recovery is still speculative. It&apos;s certainly transformed it.&quot;

That transformation is being experienced by bloggers such as Jeannette Vagnozzi, a 41-year-old resident of La Verne (Los Angeles County), who writes about her breast cancer on 2hands.blogspot .com. 

 

Transcending time and space, the internet connects people who want to be connected and puts up a little flag at each sick blog inviting people in.

For anyone newly diagnosed with an illness, sick blogs are the way to learn what they can expect as they go forward and leave a record for others.

Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert confirms in his new book Stumbling on Happiness that the best way to imagine the future is to look to other people who are going through or been through what we now are contemplating.

An Open Mind on Coffee

 Drinking coffee makes you more open-minded 

 The coffee you drink as a pick-me-up in the morning could also make you more open to persuasion, researchers say. Evidence from a new study suggests that this happens because caffeine revs up the brain, not because it generally boosts mood.

Previous studies have show that consuming caffeine can improve one’s attention and enhance cognitive performance, with 200 milligrams (equivalent to two cups of coffee) being the optimal dose.

Moderate doses of caffeine can also make you more easily convinced by arguments that go against your beliefs, say Pearl Martin of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, and her colleagues.

Sleeping pill wakes men from coma

From the Guardian, Sleeping pill wakes men in vegetative state .

 A drug commonly used as a sleeping pill appears to have had a miraculous effect on brain-damaged patients who have been in a permanent vegetative state for years, arousing them to the point where some are able to speak to their families, scientists report today.

The dramatic improvement occurs within 20 minutes of taking the drug, Zolpidem, and wears off after around four hours - at which point the patients return to their permanent vegetative state, according to a paper published in the medical journal NeuroRehabilitation.

Botox May Ease Depression.

Bookofjoe calls it a &quot;provocative study&quot; in this month&apos;s Dermatologic Surgery. BehindTheMedspeak: Can Botox Cure Depression? 

Provocative indeed.

In removing those frown lines, Botox looks as though it&apos;s also relieving depression.

The Washington Post reported Botox Appears to Ease Depression 

 Alastair Carruthers, president-elect of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, agreed that Finzi&apos;s study provides new insight into a phenomenon clinicians have noticed.

&quot;Anyone who has injected much Botox into the frown area has had people come in and say they can&apos;t believe how they feel better as a result,&quot; said Carruthers, clinical professor in dermatology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, in an interview. &quot;We&apos;ve not really been able to put our fingers on why. . . . We have been doing research based on appearance, but it may be due to some mood-altering effect of Botox that we don&apos;t understand.&quot;
-----
Of the 10 depressed patients in the Washington area whom Finzi studied, nine recovered from their depressive symptoms, and one -- who turned out to have bipolar disorder, or manic depression -- showed an improvement in mood.
--

Finzi, who practices dermatology in Greenbelt and Chevy Chase, said his hunch was that Delano&apos;s facial muscles provided feedback to her brain.

&quot;My theory on why this works is there is a feedback between the muscles of facial expression and the brain,&quot; said Finzi, who has applied for a patent on using Botox for depression. &quot;With yoga, you focus on your breathing, and it has an effect on your mind. My hypothesis is the facial muscles . . . have an effect on depression.&quot;

 

Hey, what would smiling do?

Even if you&apos;re faking a smile, it releases endorphrins that make feel better.

 Smile
Lyle Lovett

Smile, though your heart is aching.
Smile, even though it&apos;s breaking.
Though there are clouds in the sky,
You get by...

If you smile through your fears and sorrows.
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You&apos;ll see the sun come shining through.

If you just light up your face with gladness,
Hide every trace of sadness.
Although a tear may be ever, ever so near.

That&apos;s the time you must keep on trying.
Smile, what&apos;s the use of crying?
You&apos;ll find life is worthwhile
If you&apos;ll just smile, come on and smile.

If you just smile.

Mobile Addiction and Phantom Phone Rings

The science is catching up to our cell phone use.

 One study in Australia found that mobiles can be addictive as smoking with users displaying the typical signs of withdrawal - anxiety, restlessness, even panic - when parted from their phones.

The Queensland study analysed people under 45 to establish the emotional, psychological, financial and social impact of their use of mobiles. It found some suffered low self-esteem if they were not free to receive calls and text messages and the phone appeared to be a kind of &quot;security blanket&quot; which improved feelings of self-worth. Other users appeared &quot;obsessive&quot; in their need to be near a mobile phone and became deeply agitated when parted from it.

Meanwhile there&apos;s the audio illusion of &quot;phantom phone&quot; rings. The ubiquity of mobile phones means people live in a constant state of &quot;phone vigilance.&quot;

Reports the New York Times in I Hear Ringing and There&apos;s No One There, people are particularly sensitive to sounds of 1000 to 6000 hertz

&quot;Your brain is conditioned to respond to a phone ring just as it is to a baby crying,&quot;

Some sound experts think the high-pitched tones are being used in ads to manipulate our emotions to get our attention and make us call that 800 number right now.

It seems that technology designed to improve our lives is also creating greater stress.

Americans far sicker than English

At first the results were so implausible, the researchers didn&apos;t believe them.

Middle-aged Americans are in much worse health than their British counterparts with diabetes twice as common, cancer 70% more prevalent and heart disease 50% more widespread.

 Americans far sicker than English 
 
People in the healthiest, high-income and education bracket in the United States have comparable rates of heart disease and diabetes as those in the sickest, low-income group in England, the study shows.
---
The explanation doesn&apos;t seem to be down to the facts that Americans are fatter or that the British drink more alcohol, the researchers say. When they ran their health data through a model to make both groups have equivalent levels of obesity, smoking and drinking, the health differences only lessened slightly.

 It&apos;s either poor childhood health or adult stress.

I&apos;m betting on the stress.

Rally with Sally

It&apos;s not just be lack of estrogen that leads to osteoporosis in post menopausal women, the pituitary gland may play a big role.

 Pituitary Hormone May Be Linked to Osteoporosis 

 A hormone produced by the pituitary gland may play a role in bone loss in postmenopausal women, challenging the notion that declining estrogen levels are solely responsible for the problem.

High levels of the hormone, pituitary-derived follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), caused an increase in bone loss in mice. And mice who lacked either the FSH hormone or its receptor became resistant to bone loss, even if they showed evidence of estrogen deficiency.

The findings open up the possibility that therapies other than estrogen to treat or prevent bone loss may one day be possible. Estrogen-replacement therapy is not an ideal solution because it has been linked to a heightened risk of breast cancer, especially when administered in combination with the hormone progestin.

 Sally Field who has been diagnosed with osteoporosis may want to look into this. She&apos;s become a new spokesman raising awareness about the disease. 

 She announced Thursday she is partnering with drug manufacturers F. Hoffmann-La Roche and GlaxoSmithKline to launch the &quot;Rally with Sally For Bone Health&quot; campaign.

The two companies are the co-marketers of Boniva (ibandronate sodium), an osteoporosis medication.

Through a website (www.bonehealth.com) and a toll-free number (877-BoneHealth), the project is asking at-risk women to join Field in a signed pledge to improve their bone health. The pledge involves five steps: taking sufficient calcium and vitamin D; choosing and maintaining an osteoporosis drug regimen; exercising regularly; visiting a physician regularly, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol. 

As for that recent study that cast doubts on the benefits of calcium, Tara
Parker-Pope clears up some of the confusion in today&apos;s Wall St Journal. She concludes calcium works, but only if you take it regularly. If you do take your calcium regularly, there is a 34% reduction in overall fracture risk.

More Salmon, Less Murder?

 Omega 3 fats feed the human brain and may improve psychiatric conditions as well as visual function

Never though, did I think to tout eating salmon to lower the murder rate as the New York Times did this past week in Idea Lab.

Is violent aggression largely a product of poor nutrition?

researchers are studying whether inmates become less violent when put on a diet rich in vitamins and in the fatty acids found in seafood.
---
In 2001, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a senior clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, published a study, provocatively titled &quot;Seafood Consumption and Homicide Mortality,&quot; that found a correlation between a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids (most often obtained from fish) and lower murder rates.
--
Consider, for example, a study conducted by researchers in Finland. They tested prisoners convicted of violent crimes and found that they had lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids than ordinary, healthy subjects. Why? Omega-3&apos;s foster the growth of neurons in the brain&apos;s frontal cortex, the bit of gray matter that controls impulsive behavior. Having enough of these fatty acids may keep violent impulses in check.

Medical Study on Prayer

Results of the long-awaited study on prayer have been released.

Taking almost 10 years, following some 1800 patients and costing more than $2.4 million, the study show that prayers offered by strangers had no effect on the recovery of people who were undergoing heart surgery. 

The study said nothing about the power of personal prayer or about prayers for family members and friends.

Designed to cure problems with earlier studies that had conflicting results, the study may have created another.

 Patients who knew they were being prayed for had a higher rate of post-operative complications like abnormal heart rhythms, perhaps because of the expectations the prayers created, the researchers suggested.
--

In a hurriedly convened news conference, the study&apos;s authors, led by Dr. Herbert Benson, a cardiologist and director of the Mind/Body Medical Institute near Boston, said that the findings were not the last word on the effects of so-called intercessory prayer. But the results, they said, raised questions about how and whether patients should be told that prayers were being offered for them.

Whorls and Tangles in Nuns

The best control group to study Alzheimer&apos;s appears to be nuns. And let&apos;s not forget Sister Josita.
 
 That is the extraordinary discovery made by Professor David Bennett, an American neuropathologist investigating Alzheimer&apos;s disease...
--
Then, within hours of a nun dying in the concrete tower-block nunnery, her body is hurried the few miles to the Rush University Medical Centre, where her brain is removed and sliced into discs, and stored alongside the 1,000 other brains in Prof Bennett&apos;s research programme.

The brain slices are examined for evidence of neuritic plaques - abnormal whorls of brain tissue - and neurofibrillary tangles, which are mixed-up bundles of nerve fibres. These were the symptoms first spotted by Aloiz Alzheimer in 1906 in a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness.
---

&quot;I&apos;m very happy to give away my brain,&quot; says Sister Michele Elfering, 76, who has been with the order since she was 18, and has taught maths and reading in Chicago schools, rising to become a headmistress, &quot;I&apos;d do anything I can do to help with Alzheimer&apos;s.

They&apos;ll go for a glass of water and start looking in the condiments drawer. You can see it happening. You&apos;re very aware of it, though it&apos;s very slow.

NHS horror stories

Everyone has an opinion on the state of health care in this country. Concerns about insurance and access and the cost involved should a catastrophe befall us or the ones we love are on everyone&apos;s mind.

I grant that it&apos;s a tangled mess with complicated issues too difficult for me to sort out.

Many point to the National health services of Canada and Great Britain as models the US should seek to emulate. For years I did so. But I&apos;ve read so many stories of care denied that I now have grave doubts about putting the government in charge of something so personal, so important.

Dr Crippen, a pseudonym I presume, is a NHS doctor in England who&apos;s now blogging at NHSblogdoc . It&apos;s an up close and personal view of what government medical care in England is like. To read just one day is to recoil in horror.
 

 The hospital sent him home. They sent him home on a Friday evening. Home in a worse state that he went in. They sent him home to his eighty year old wife with one of the worst pressure sores I have seen in years. He has now developed intractable diarrhoea, and it coats the pressure sore. He needs round the clock intensive nursing therapy, including being turned regularly. We cannot do this at home. They cannot do it in hospital it seems either. The nurses are too busy eating pizza or pretending to be doctors.

I have no alternative but to send him back in. He bursts into tears. I am getting very stressed about all this. I cannot do my job. I advise the family to see a lawyer and I take a copy of the photo.

A Generous Adventure

Sally Satel wrote about her search for a new kidney 

 Nowadays, because of dialysis, renal failure is rarely a death sentence, at least early in its course. Instead, it is a jail sentence, in my dark view, anyway. Depending on the technique, the patient spends several afternoons a week in a clinic or undergoes a procedure at home that lasts all night, every night. Dialysis makes all those things you take for granted--the freedom to plan your day, a late night out or a weekend away--forbidding, if not impossible.

A transplant means a good chance of a normal life. My goal was to find a live donor, ideally before dialysis became necessary. A donor can easily manage for a lifetime with one healthy kidney, and live donor organs function somewhat better, and last longer, than organs donated from the bodies of people who have recently died.
 
In a remarkable act of generosity, Virginia Postrel has donated one of her kidneys to her friend Sally Satel.

 As surgeries go, the procedure is safe and straightforward--far more so than people think. A donor can live a completely normal life with one kidney. The recipient is not so lucky, since a foreign organ requires a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs. But that&apos;s a lot better than the alternative.

 

She blogs about the operation here. 

That&apos;s true friendship. May many be inspired to do the same.

Taking Care of Nurses

If you&apos;re a nurse, you never have to worry about losing a job or finding a job. You can go to a brand new city where you know no one and if you&apos;re a registered nurse, you can get a job in week. Everyone wants you. And for good reason. Nurses make all the difference when it comes to caring for patients.

Yet there are not enough of them.

My mother is a nurse. She stopped working when she was about 78. She still gets calls EVERY WEEK from some recruiter who tries to lure her back at 84!

The American Hospital Association says we will need 1 million replacement nurses by 2012, just six years away; yet, nursing schools turned away 32,000 interested students because there was not enough faculty to teach them. Nurses ache for aid. 

 U.S. hospitals could avoid as many as 6,700 patient deaths, 70,400 complications and 4 million days of hospital care if they hired more registered nurses and increased the hours of nursing care per patient, according to a new study in the January issue of Health Affairs.

 

The problem is too few nurses makes hospitals work the remaining nurses too long with too many patients until they finally burn out resulting in too few nurses.

Guilt-free ice cream

Good news for middle-aged and older women. Butter your toast, eat your ice cream, you don&apos;t have to deny yourselves some of the little pleasures in life to stay healthy.

 Study finds no major benefits of low-fat diet. 
 A low-fat diet did not reduce older women&apos;s risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or heart disease, according to a long-awaited $415 million government-funded study that creates uncertainty about exactly what Americans should eat to prevent disease.
 

From the Washington Post 
 &quot;Based on our findings, we cannot recommend that most women should follow a low-fat diet,&quot; said Jacques Rossouw of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the $415 million study.

Although the study involved only women, the findings probably apply to men as well, he said.

Several experts cautioned, however, that the study hints that there still may be some benefits to reducing the total amount of fat in the diet, especially for breast cancer. In addition, there is clear evidence from this and other studies that particular fats -- saturated fats from meat and trans fats from processed foods -- are unhealthful and should be avoided.

The Hearts of Women

Heart Disease is still the number one killer of women yet only 55% of women know tha t which is more than in the past but still not enough.

Worse still, the standard test misses heart disease signs in women because angiograms don&apos;t find the blockages in smaller vessels that women tend to have.

The Washington Post reports in A Gender Difference in Heart Disease 

 Instead of developing obvious blockages in the arteries supplying blood to the heart, these women accumulate plaque more evenly inside the major arteries and in smaller blood vessels, the researchers found. In other cases, their arteries fail to expand properly or go into spasm, often at times of physical or emotional stress.

 As many as 3 million U.S. women may suffer from the condition , they said.

&quot;We&apos;re realizing that this may be fairly common among women,&quot; said George Sopko of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which is funding the research. &quot;This is a big deal. This is changing our thinking about heart disease in many women.&quot;
--
The study has also begun to identify new ways to identify women with the condition. A relatively simple questionnaire that gauges their ability to perform daily activities, for example, appears highly useful for identifying women with the condition who are at risk for suffering a heart attack or death, the researchers reported.

While it remains unclear how best to treat the condition, research suggests that certain drugs, such as those that reduce inflammation, may be useful.

Medical research shows that casino visitors whose hearts suddenly stop survive at higher rates even than people who happen to go into cardiac arrest while visiting a hospital. &quot;The safest place in America to suffer sudden cardiac arrest is a casino,&quot; says Bryan Bledsoe, a George Washington University emergency-medicine doctor and co-author of textbooks for paramedics.

The large casinos have automatic external defibrillators and well trained security officers who have restored the heartbeats of about 1800 gamblers and employees in the past nine years.

About 53% of people suffering a sudden cardiac arrest in a casino survive. Elsewhere the survival rate is under 10%.

Everyone who survived can thank one paramedic Richard Hardman who, upset at coming in too late to save people, worked hard to get defibrillators inside casinos and security officers trained in their use.

Mr. Hardman, still a fire-department paramedic, also now does some consulting for casino industry, which he says earns him less than $10,000 a year. He says he no longer feels haunted by his failure to become a doctor. He was listed as an author on the New England Journal of Medicine study, and doubts that as a physician he could have been involved in anything more important. &quot;To be thanked by people who say you saved their lives -- that&apos;s extremely gratifying,&quot; he says.

Hot sex treats the common cold

Health roundup

It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been through my inbox of medical stories. Here&apos;s a selection on carrots, tomato juice, vit D, yoga, overdosing on Tylenol and, of course, my perennial fish oil.

Tomato juice prevented emphysema in mice exposed to cigarette smoke. Will it work to protect human lungs? Wouldn&apos;t hurt to try since we know one serving a day of tomato-based foods can reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 30%.

 Memantine (Namenda) , a drug already approved by the FDA, appears to slow progression of Alzheimers by nearly 50% for up to a year.

 Fish oil supplements can prevent airway constriction in asthma.

 Moms who take extra vitamin D while pregnant could protect their children from osteoporosis later in life.

Vitamin D may also help you fend off colon, breast and ovarian cancer by as much as 50%. The older you get, the more you need vitamin D so take a supplement if you&apos;re over 50.

Eating carrots really does preserve your vision. Antioxidant-rich foods significantly reduces the risk of macular degeneration.

I always had low back pain until I began practicing yoga when it completely disappeared. Now a study finds that yoga is better t han exercise or self-help books.

 Overdosing on acetaminophen , the active ingredient in Tylenol, is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Half of those failures are unintentional because people don&apos;t realize that acetaminophen is found in more than 100 over-the-counter products. Tylenol is potentially a dangerous drug. 80% of people who develop acute liver failure die of it.

Don&apos;t read this if you have a cough

Who knows the placebo effect just may work for you. In which case, you don&apos;t want to know that there is no evidence that cough syrups work. In fact, they do little good and may harm children said a panel of experts in new guidelines released on Monday.

They say that adults are better off using the older antihistamines that make you drowsy and decongestants to stop the flow of mucus that causes the cough.

For children nothing beats chicken soup.

Is a protein responsible for depression?

I must admit I haven&apos;t gotten back into daily posting yet, but hold on, I will soon.

Meanwhile on the health front, some very good news from the Wall St Journal which reports that the discovery of a new protein could play a crucial role in treating depression. ( Link for WSJ subscribers only.)

The newly found protein, named p11, appears to regulate how brain cells respond to serotonin, researchers from Rockefeller University and Sweden&apos;s Karolinska Institute report Friday in the journal Science.

Such a finding will lead to new treatments and a better understanding why depression happens.

Arguments dramatically slow wound healing

The stress a married couple experiences during a 30-minute argument can delay their bodies’ability to heal a wound by at least a day, according to a new study.

And if the couples’relationship endures routine hostility, the delay can be even longer. There could be important implications for people suffering from chronic wounds, such as skin ulcers.

“We knew that chronic stress causes reduced immunity, but to find that an argument of just half an hour has such a profound effect on wound healing is quite shocking,”says Patricia Price at the Wound Healing Research Unit at Cardiff University, Wales, who was not involved in the study.

Key to My Heart

By now, you&apos;ve probably heard of the love molecule. Italian researchers say the molecule known as the nerve growth factor (NGF) makes your heart beat faster, gives you those butterflies in the stomach and the sense of euphoria when you fall in love. They say it only lasts about a year.

Ambivablog has read further and finds that NGF and Love Makes All Things New .

Could it be the Love itself along with the NGF has the power to renew and remake us all the way through life up to the gate of death? Can any new passionate attraction or friendship that we love do the same?

Some Stanford researchers have discovered a new type of lock-and-key mechanism that provides a critical step in reproducing nerve growth factor.

 NGF and its family members called neurotrophins not only control the development of the nervous system in the embryo but also the maintenance of nervous tissue and neural transmission in the adult.
 NGF plays a role in many nervous system problems such as neural degeneration in aging, Alzheimer&apos;s disease and neural regeneration in spinal cord injuries and other damage to neural tissue. It also may factor into mood and other psychological disorders. 
 It&apos;s the key to my or to anyone&apos;s heart that opens to Love.

Healthy Links

Just links to health articles this past week that caught my eye.

Too much junk in the trunk. Obese buttocks leave drug therapy behind . Medicine injected into large posteriors isn&apos;t reaching the bloodstream.

 New and simpler CPR guidelines. 30 compressions on the chest for every two rescue breaths. &quot;The more times someone pushes on the chest, the better off the patient is, the more blood flows to the heart and other vital organs.

 Simple test gauges childhood asthma control. Seven question quiz helps patients and doctors improve treatment.

This is surprising. Parkinson&apos;s Tied to the Well-Schooled. Study says the more education you have, the greater the risk, especially for doctors.

This is not. Doctors Lack Training for End-of-Life Care. Dying patients pay the price.

This is good news. Breast-feeding may lower Mom&apos;s risk of diabetes. We know it&apos;s good for babies, we didn&apos;t know how good it was for Mom.

Breast-feeding helps a mother&apos;s body return to normal faster after pregnancy, according to the FDA. Some studies have suggested that women who breast-feed for long periods of time may have lower rates of breast and ovarian cancer.

 Daily Aspirin a smart move after menopause. It significantly reduces death rates for post-menopausal women with cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the largest killer of women and women lag far behind men in getting important tests to diagnose the disease.

 Long-term study proves tamoxifen helps prevent breast cancer. It helps prevent the malignancy in healthy women at high risk for the disease.

Being Irish, I&apos;m not surprised that a Gene May Be Tied to Alcoholism. Apparently this gene contributes to a low level of response to alcohol and probably to overdrinking so that a person can feel high.

It&apos;s up to you. Better habits - less junk food, more fish, more exercise - can prevent 80% of coronary heart disease and 90% of type 2 diabetes. Heart Disease, Diabetes Are Preventable. 

Another expert says Exercise is the real Fountain of Youth, reducing risk of heart disease and dementia, all part of the Healthy Aging Campaign.

Surviving Cancer Needs a Plan

The ten million cancer survivors in the U.S. need a survivorship plan to guide their future health care says the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, reports the Wall St Journal. 

When active treatment ends, these people&apos;s special needs may be just beginning, said the study, released Monday. Yet, the legacy of physical, psychological and social consequences has largely been ignored by doctors, researchers, even patient-advocacy groups, leaving survivors too often unaware of simmering health risks or struggling to manage them on their own, said the report by the Institute of Medicine.

&quot;Successful cancer care doesn&apos;t end when patients walk out the door after completion of their initial treatments,&quot; said Sheldon Greenfield of the University of California, Irvine, who led the study for the institute, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.

Yet, &quot;you fall off a cliff when your treatment ends,&quot; said report co-author Ellen Stovall, president of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, who speaks from personal experience as a two-time survivor.

Donate Life

John Scripter was on his death bed with only days left to live when he consulted with his wife and then agreed to become the first heart transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was really, really scared. The doctors thought, maybe they could give him another 7, maybe 10, years of life with the transplant.

Now, a folk hero, Scripter returned to MGH for a 20th anniversary celebration of his transplant. Doctors now expect him to live another 15 to 20 years.

He faced his fear and won maybe as much as an additional 40 years of life. Since more than 200 people have gotten transplants at MGH and won whole new lives. Families have remained intact, children are not orphans.

This is why people should make out organ donation cards. If you are in an accident and your heart or liver can be saved, wouldn&apos;t you want to give a perfect stranger another 40 years of life?
 
Donate Life. 

 

Here&apos;s a Donor Card , free and printable.

There are also some wonderful stories

Gloria has told Suzi of her grief for Suzi&apos;s loss and her intention to be sure she is deserving of Bobby&apos;s gift. Suzi says that her grief &quot;turned to joy when I discovered that my husband&apos;s death was not final but had given five people a chance to live.&quot; Melissa, who wrote in that first letter to Gloria that she hoped a child had received one of her dad&apos;s organs and could live to grow up, understands now that the gift that saved Gloria&apos;s life also &quot;saved&quot; the lives of her son Arylon and daughter Aquia, who came so close to becoming motherless at ages 9 and 6. Gloria and family, who attended Melissa&apos;s wedding, now are celebrating with Suzi the birth of Melissa&apos;s little boy, Robert.

Chinese activist protesting brutality of forced abortion is kidnapped

Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life or somewhere in between, I can&apos;t believe that any American woman or man supports the forced abortions that are going on in China.

In the last few months, some 7000, maybe many tens of thousands, forced abortions have been performed in Shandong province, outside Shanghai. One blind activist, Chen Guangcheng, traveled to Beijing to complain to the central government, journalists and other activists of the &quot;bizarre&quot; brutality of the forced abortion campaign by local government officials in Shandong. According to the San Francisco Chronicle,
 

Chen was ambushed on the street by plainclothes security officers from Shandong who bundled him into a car and took him back to Linyi. There, Chen found himself under de facto house arrest, where he remains.

It&apos;s a horror story of kidnappings, ransoms and brutality against women by local officials that may have widespread consequences to the stability of China. Public protests against corrupt local officials numbered 74,000 last year, up 50% from two years ago. Some of the terrible stories is in the extended entry.

A former employee in the Linyi family planning department, who asked that he be identified only as Cao, said such astonishingly cruel measures were usually carried out by &quot;overzealous&quot; local officials.
___
Zhu Hongying, 40, and her husband, Xia Jiandong, 40, who are farmers in Zhai Tian Zhuang village near Linyi, and who already have one son, said they had first heard of the forced abortions in March, when Zhu was five months pregnant.

&quot;We panicked and ran into (Linyi) to hide,&quot; Zhu said during an interview that was conducted by telephone because local police had sealed off her area in the wake of Chen&apos;s detention. &quot;But to get to us, about a month after we left, they arrested three of my sisters-in-law. So we felt very guilty and went home.&quot;

What happened next went beyond her deepest fears, Zhu said: &quot;The people from the family planning department were waiting for us. They demanded 700 RMB (about $90, two months&apos; wages for Zhu) to release my sisters-in-law, and then they pushed me into a van and took me to a local family planning clinic.&quot;

There, a group of eight people surrounded her and harangued her to have an abortion.

What they were doing was illegal. By law, only financial and other penalties can be levied against parents who break China&apos;s one-child policy. But Zhu said there was no way for her to protest.

&quot;I just kept sobbing and begging, but no one listened,&quot; she said. &quot;Finally, I was so weak, I just said &apos;yes.&apos; Then a doctor came in and gave me an injection in the stomach. After I took the shot, the whole day I didn&apos;t feel anything. The second day in the early morning blood and water all flowed out of me. Then the baby came out, but it was dead. It was a boy.&quot;

Zhu said gazing at her dead son was the most heartbreaking moment of her life.

After she aborted, her husband said, a nurse came into the room and dumped the baby&apos;s body into a black plastic bag, along with all the other discharge.

&quot;She told me to go throw it into a truck, which had a large container kind of thing at the back,&quot; said Xia, his voice quavering. &quot;When I opened the door and looked in, it was full of black bags and blood.&quot;

The Upside of Cancer

Cathy Siepp, a wonderful, smart and funny writer, reveals she has lung cancer.
 

 Because sure, breast cancer is no fun; I’ve had friends who’ve died of it. But it also has a survival rate of around 85%. That’s the unsurvival rate of lung cancer, which is what I have. I’m actually lucky still to be alive, given that I was diagnosed almost three and a half years ago, after a cough that wouldn’t go away, and most lung cancer patients don’t make it past two years. Except that, since I never smoked even one cigarette, never lived or worked with smokers, and in fact have zero family history and no other risk factors at all (unusual even in people who don’t get cancer), the bald truth is I’m pretty unlucky to have this in the first place.
 
The upside of cancer?
 One is that you can put the fear of God into people with hardly any effort at all, 
and
 The other advantage is people reveal themselves to you as they really are–it’s almost like a solution for invisible ink

 I wish her the fullest of life along with my fond hopes she writes for a long time.

Music and Art Engage Minds Thought Lost to Dementia

Minds damaged by dementia can be engaged by art. No one knows why. The New York Times explores The Pablo Picasso Alzheimer&apos;s Therapy.
 

Why did Willem de Kooning become more productive, almost maniacally so, as he descended into Alzheimer&apos;s? Why does frontotemporal dementia, a relatively rare form of non-Alzheimer&apos;s brain disease, cause some people who had no previous interest or aptitude for art to develop remarkable artistic talent and drive?

&quot;Certainly it&apos;s not just a visual experience - it&apos;s an emotional one,&quot; said Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and writer. &quot;In an informal way I have often seen quite demented patients recognize and respond vividly to paintings and delight in painting at a time when they are scarcely responsive to words and disoriented and out of it. I think that recognition of visual art can be very deep.&quot;
---
Besides improving patients&apos; moods for hours and even days, the tours seem to demonstrate that the disease, while diminishing sufferers&apos; abilities in so many ways, can also sometimes spark interpretive and expressive powers that had previously lay hidden.....If you met these people back where they lived on an ordinary day, you simply would not see them being this articulate and this assured,&quot; said John Zeisel, the president of Hearthstone, who conceived the program with Francesca Rosenberg, the Modern&apos;s director of community and access programs.
--
More than four million Americans suffer from Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and the number is expected to rise as the nation&apos;s overall population ages. With no cure on the horizon, caregivers are increasingly exploring art as a way to help manage the disease, and they take encouragement from the results with music. Dr. Sacks noted that exposure to music can even result in lowered dosages for patients being medicated for cognitive and emotional disorders.
One avenue of thinking about both music and art, he said, is that it engages parts of the brain that remain intact long after the onset of dementia....

Museum and Alzheimer&apos;s care officials say that at the very least, they see temporary but palpable, and moving, improvement in the small group of people who have participated in the tours. Hannah Goodwin, the manager of accessibility at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, recounted watching an elderly man react to a Stuart Davis painting. &quot;Very spontaneously, he just starting talking about the painting and about the time period in New York,&quot; she said. &quot;He was talking about jazz and improvisation and everything. It was very beautiful and unexpected. There was this absolute clarity and connection that I think was really sparked by the painting.&quot;

Pressuring Workers to live healthier lives

From the Wall St. Journal&apos;s &quot;Fiscally Fit&quot; column by Terri Cullen. How companies are fighting rising health care costs.

 More Firms Pressure Workers to Adopt Healthier Lifestyles. 

 Last month, Stephanie Sobel joined thousands of her colleagues at drug giant AstraZeneca PLC in taking a free online health-risk assessment test.

Ms. Sobel says that she&apos;d long planned to use the tool but never got around to it. This year, however, she had an additional incentive: In September, AstraZeneca began penalizing workers who fail to fill out the online assessment tool by boosting their health-insurance premiums by $50 a month until they complete the questionnaire.

The assessment tool asked questions about the 32-year-old sales and safety manager&apos;s lifestyle, querying her on everything from nutrition to her past medical history. After plugging in all her information, Ms. Sobel received an evaluation of her health and detailed recommendations on ways to adjust her lifestyle to improve her well-being. The result: Her health isn&apos;t too shabby but she could stand to take a daily dose of vitamins.

&quot;I like how it divided up into two sections what my health issues are, but also highlighted what my strengths are,&quot; she says, &quot;It made me feel good and encouraged me to keep at it.&quot;

Frustrated with efforts to contain health-care costs, companies are stepping up the pressure on workers to use diagnostic tools and take better care of themselves–or be penalized when they don&apos;t.

&quot;We didn&apos;t want to go down the path of cost shifting for all our employees so we decided to head in the other direction, encouraging workers to use the tools available to help them contain health-care costs by making healthier choices,&quot; says Penny Stoker, vice president, human resources at AstraZeneca in Wilmington, Del. The incentive appears to be working: roughly 10,000 of the company&apos;s work force of 12,000 have signed up to use the tool.

Echoes of Eugenics

Many people don&apos;t know about the eugenics movement of the 20th century. Adolf Hitler wanted to create a master race by killing all those he thought inferior - Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, and retarded children

Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, said, &quot;eugenic sterilization is an urgent need ...we must prevent multiplication of this bad stock.&quot;

Many states allowed forced sterilization of those with &quot;insanity, idiocy, imbecility, feeble-mindedness or epilepsy.&quot; In 2003, the Governor of South Carolina apologized for decades of forced sterilizations.

The San Francisco Chronicle examines the history of eugenics in California, a key backer of whom was Charles Goethe, a wealthy conservationist and benefactor of what would become California State University&apos;s Sacramento campus in Echoes of Eugenics Movement in Stem Cell Debate. 

 Goethe, who backed preserving redwood stands as a way to enhance California&apos;s natural environment, also wanted to apply animal breeding concepts to the betterment of humanity -- apparently to exclude most everyone who wasn&apos;t white and European.
--
Chloe Burke, a Cal State Sacramento historian and organizer of a daylong conference held Friday and billed as the first of its kind, called &quot;From Eugenics to Designer Babies: Engineering the California Dream.&quot; says, &quot;Both are linked to a conviction that tampering with heredity or our genetic makeup can lead to solutions for a broad number of problems, both individual and social,&quot; she said.
Behind the advocacy of stem cells, she said, &quot;is this dream of living in a disease-free future,&quot; one of the early threads that made up Goethe&apos;s own worldview.

Adult stem cells

Why is there not coverage in the general media about these fabulous breakthroughs using adult stem cells?

Michael Fumento who writes frequently &quot;on the gulf between the promise of embryonic stem cells and the reality of therapy using adult stem cells,&quot; asks the question in Raise a Glass to Adult Stem Cells. 

Adult stem cells are now rebuilding human livers.

Out of Sight, Out of Mind

You didn&apos;t need a study to tell you that Candy Out of Sight is Out of Mind. 

 Secretaries who were given Hershey kisses for Secretary&apos;s Week ate more of them when the jars were clear or on their desks than when the chocolates were in opaque containers or placed a short distance away.

&quot;It should make us think about what we&apos;re doing&quot; to undermine people&apos;s willpower, said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the weight control program at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and president of the Obesity Society, which held a conference where the research was presented.
------
 

&quot;Here&apos;s the golden lining: If we move food away from us, even 6 feet, we eat less and we overestimate how much we have eaten,&quot; the researchers concluded. &quot;It may also work for healthier foods, such as raw fruits or vegetables. What makes the candy dish nutritionally dangerous might bring the fruit bowl back in vogue.&quot;

Cheating Death

If you want to learn all about Aubrey de Grey, the English biogerontologist who claims we can live to be 1000, who has won the respect of some scientists and the scorn of others, you must read The Man Who Would Murder Death.
 
Whether it&apos;s above, beyond or beneath me, I find the idea of living to 1000 years exhausting even to think about. All this focus on the survival of the physical body alone seems creepy.

Cyber Catharsis

Last month, I wrote about the AOL survey that showed that nearly half of bloggers blog as a form of therapy. The Washington Post calls it Cyber-Catharsis and explores the phenomenon.

Seems as if even hospitals are seeing the blogging light.

One hospital in High Point, N.C., started devoting space to patients&apos; blogs on its Web site....The project has been so successful -- both as a marketing tool for the hospital and a form of group therapy for patients who get feedback from their readers -- that High Point is considering adding video blogs, said Eric Fletcher, a spokesman for the hospital.
--
said Bill Schreiner, vice president for AOL&apos;s community programming. &quot;It&apos;s like they&apos;re writing the novel of their lives, and [public] participation adds truth to their story.&quot;

Blogging combines two recommended techniques for people to work through problems: writing in a journal and using a computer to type out thoughts. Some bloggers say the extra dimension of posting thoughts on the Web enables them to broach difficult subjects with loved ones, as well as reap support from a virtual community of people they don&apos;t know.

Exercise good for the brain

Exercise for a half an hour twice a week during midlife can significantly cut a person&apos;s risk for dementia later, say researchers.

Health Links Round-Up

Blogging is lighter than usual as I&apos;m in the last throughs of finishing my book. Here are some interesting healthy links I&apos;ve come across in the past week.

Everyone knows that depression is common but who would think it was hitting Baby Boomers in the prime of their lives particularly hard? 

Beauty is bone-deep. Bones are to blame for an aging face . They shrink as the years go by and the process is faster in women. Got milk?

If you&apos;re a senior, depression may be as much a risk factor for death as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

 Unexplained weight loss may herald Alzheimer&apos;s. The brain&apos;s weight centers might be affected before memory.

This is not good for babies to come. Fewer women, only 33%, are taking folic acid supplements to prevent serious birth defects of the brain and spine.

 Pathological liars have different brains. 

First things first. When the Red Sox are hot, ER visits cool. 

 Compulsive shopping is linked to insecurity and it&apos;s on the rise.

Personally customized medical treatment is beginning as researchers find that gene profiling may improve breast cancer care. At least patients won&apos;t have to endure painful and unsuccessful therapies.

A new Diet Site leveraging social networking launches today called PEERtrainer . Users can connect with each other and offer support, encouragement and criticism. Buddy up and slim down.

 To find the best match if you&apos;re changing doctors because you&apos;ve moved or are changing insurance carriers, first check their credentials then, on your first visit, be prepared to talk about your medical history, your family history, your lifestyle and the medications you&apos;re on.

My Three Requirements for Men

It&apos;s been a long time, but I figure I&apos;m just about ready to start dating again. Well actually, in about two months after I finish my book and the prototype for ESOL.

So, from time to time, I thought about what I am looking for in a man.
I&apos;ve reduced it to three essential and non-negotiable requirements.

 CLEAN - - KIND - - FUNNY 

That&apos;s that simple. I don&apos;t care about where they went to school or what they do, how much they have, how tall or short they are, how old they are or whether they have hair.

You wouldn&apos;t think those three requirements would be an effective screen. But, boy is it ever. Think about it.

Take just CLEAN. That rules out 25% of U.S. men.

 Scientists have learned that one-quarter of men left public restrooms without washing their hands.

YEECH.

Fear is a waste of time

Tony Snow says Fear is a waste of time. After being diagnosed with cancer, Snow experienced panic until he received a visit from a friend who had survived cancers of the breast, lungs and lymph nodes.
 
Here is the most important thing she said: &quot;When I was sick, my husband and I would sit in a group with other women who had the same thing. We sat in a circle, the same people each week.
 
&quot;Some looked strong and vigorous; others were pale and weak. But none of that mattered. We discovered that we could figure out who was going to live and who would die just by looking into their eyes. The ones who were afraid didn&apos;t make it. The ones who were pessimistic didn&apos;t make it. The women who made it were the ones who wanted to live, and were ready to fight. Some of the big, strong women weren&apos;t ready to fight.&quot;

Silence, Movement, Joy

Now we know that the iPod trend brings a spike in noise-induced hearing loss. People set the volumes on their portable music players too high and they wear them too much.

At the same time we learn that visceral fat, fat around internal organs, shows strong links to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and other metabolic problems.

It&apos;s not just couch potatoes with visceral fat, but those who spend too much time in front of a computer and don&apos;t get any exercise.

So get outside and walk everyday WITHOUT your iPod. Movement in silence is what we need more of.

There&apos;s a joy in movement and a joy in silence you shouldn&apos;t be without for even one day.

Body Maintenance - 10 top tips

From the 100th issue of Body&amp;Soul, the London Times weekly supplement, comes 100 top tips for living. 
 
Here&apos;s Simon Cromption on Body Maintenance. 

 
 1 Get married and live happily ever after —statistics show that single men in particular are at significantly greater risk of death than men in a permanent relationship.
  2 Take good quality omega oil (cod liver, flax seed, etc) capsules every day —there’s evidence it improves your brain power, reduces rates of heart and stroke, and possibly helps prevent Alzheimer’s.
  3 Yes, it’s boring, but don’t smoke. It’s the single most avoidable cause of illness and death so it’s pretty pointless worrying about your health if you’re still puffing away.
  4 Get to understand food labels —the more you know about what goes into food and what it does to you, the more manufacturers will have to ensure that it is healthy.
  5 Exercise regularly, but don’t go mad —remember that as you get older the cartilage in your joints becomes more brittle. The last thing you want is to be laid up for months on end.
  6 Believe in something —there is increasing evidence that those who attend church tend to have lower blood pressure and live longer.
  7 Be aware of your body —what’s normal and what’s not. Doctors believe that people benefit more from being aware of sudden changes, or anything that is not normal, than having regular health screens. Go to the doctor if something does seem unusual.
  8 Do what your doctor says . Up to half of those who are prescribed medicines don’t take them properly. Research indicates thousands remain ill or die as a result.
  9 Look after your teeth . Not only does toothache destroy your quality of life but recent studies have shown that those who neglect their dental health tend to die earlier.
  10 Remember moderation in all things . If you’re eating three cream cakes every day you know that there’s going to be payback. The same applies to taking handfuls of supplements.

Skin Cells Converted to Stem Cells

In what may be an end run around the current debate on embryonic stem cell research, a Harvard research team announced that they have turned ordinary skin cells into what appears to be embryonic stem cells.

Apart from avoiding the ethical quagmire, these new skin cells match EXACTLY the DNA of the donor. Until now, the only way to offer an exact replica was therapeutic cloning, creating an embryo than killing it to harvest its stem cells.

When Did They Know It?

Were the dangers of long term hormone replacement therapy known for years?

Was it a conspiracy against women ?

 Together, the pharmaceutical companies, physicians and researchers effectively colluded to promote the view that menopause is a &apos;deficiency disease,&apos; and that women needed long-term treatment with HRT to prevent illness, loss of sexuality and ugly aging 

This from the Harvard authors of a paper appearing in the August issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

 Other experts, however, fault the tone of the article, saying scientists can&apos;t view the events of four decades ago with knowledge and experience only recently acquired.

----
 

The authors pinned their paper around this question: &quot;Why, for four decades, since the mid-1960s, were millions of women prescribed powerful pharmacological agents already shown, three decades earlier, to be carcinogenic?&quot;
The complicated answer, as the authors see it, includes an industry that is not tightly regulated; the ascendancy of individual as opposed to collective risk; and the &quot;gendering&quot; of hormones involving longstanding beliefs that sex hormones explain women&apos;s and men&apos;s behavior and biology.
Socially responsible research, they conclude, needs to include greater transparency of funding; a public registry for all drug trials; and a re-weighing of current prevention vs. future risk.

The Promise of Placentas

Placentas may offer an alternative source of stem cells . 

They described primitive cells found in a part of the placenta called the amnion, which they coaxed into forming a variety of cell types and which look very similar to sought-after embryonic stem cells.

With 4 million children born in the United States each year, placentas could provide a ready source of the cells, the team at the University of Pittsburgh said.

It is not yet certain that the cells they found are true stem cells, said Stephen Strom, who worked on the study. But they carry two important genes, called Oct 4 and nanog, which so far have only been seen on embryonic stem cells.

&quot;We were just blown away when we found those two genes expressed in those cells,&quot; Strom said in a telephone interview.

&quot;The presence of these two genes suggests these cells are pluripotent, which means they should be able to form any cell type in the body.&quot;

Stem cells are the body&apos;s master cells. So-called adult stem cells are found in the tissue and blood are a source for renewing cells.
-----
The university has licensed the technology to a company called Stemnion, LLC, and the researchers are shareholders and will receive license fees as part of the agreement.

If so, we may be lucky enough to side step the moral controversy of embryonic stem cells. That would be great. All the benefits of embryonic stem cells and none of the moral reservations.

Medpundit says: 

 Embryonic stem cells have something else going for them that keeps them ever young, an enzyme called telomerase , which repairs a cell&apos;s chromosomes as it divides into new cells. Ominously, telomerase, although absent in most adult cells, is also present in cancer cells. It may, in fact, be the key to what turns a normal cell into a cancer cell and sends it into an out of control cycle of propagation, growing and spreading throughout the body. Thus the concern that embryonic stem cells will have the unwanted complication of causing cancer. Amniotic epithelial cells, to their credit, do not have telomerase. They would thus appear to have the best of both worlds - the genes that allow embryonic cells to differentiate into different types of tissue cells, but no association with cancer.

 

She links to a doctor in the Philippines who writes about the Caul - the transparent placental membrane that sometimes covers the head of a baby when it is born.

 In the Philippines, this is the prevailing belief: Babies born with a caul will manifest supernatural abilities and an open third eye (the ability to see ghosts). 

Many other cultures have attributed strange powers to this membrane since time immemorial. As the link shows, some seers practiced a form of divination with it, called Amniomancy. It was said that a caul could prevent anyone from dying by drowning, so they were prized by sailors all over the world. That cauls are considered lucky even among some superstition-scorning Christians is explained by the legend that even Jesus was born with one.

Health news round-up

Here&apos;s a round-up of health news that caught my eye this past week, that is, apart from the staggering news that the World Health Organization has declared that oral combined contraceptives and hormonal therapy are carcinogenic to humans .

 Kidney stones are most active in the summer probably because people become dehydrated in hot, humid weather. But too much water during exercise can kill. 

It may be a genetic trait that some people benefit more from exercise than others according to a recent study, but the researchers insist, everyone benefits from exercise.

The heart drugs known as beta blockers may ease traumatic memories, reducing the fear but not the memory, through their effects on the hormones linked to fear and arousal.

 Fructose may increase obesity not just by its added calories but also because of its effect on metabolism.

A drug used for Parkinson&apos;s eases fibromyalgia pain .

 If your knee hurts , probably another joints hurt as well, and that effects the emotional quality of your life, especially if you are over 50.

Scientists are developing an &quot;in-body bone factory&quot; that may be available in just a few years.

People with Alzheimer&apos;s may be even more isolated because they are not getting their vision corrected so they can see clearly.

Contraceptives classified as Highly Carcinogenic by WHO

As if you didn&apos;t have enough to worry about, both the pill and hormone treatment for the menopause can make you more susceptible to cancer.

This is not a report based on the studies on rats that theoretically could affect humans in the same way. This report is based on a thorough review of the published scientific evidence by a working group of 21 scientists from 8 countries, part of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, itself part of the World Health Organization.

This information is of major public health importance to millions of women and those that love them.

Cancer consultants , an oncology resource center. reports on the press release.

 Estrogen Plus Progestin Classified as“Carcinogenic to Humans&quot; 
 
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, issued a press release on July 29, 2005 stating that combined estrogen plus progestin postmenopausal hormone therapy and oral contraceptives are carcinogenic (cancer-causing) to humans .

The announcement, which followed a review of the published scientific evidence, came from an IARC working group comprised of 21 scientists from eight countries. Dr. Peter Boyle, Director of IARC, stressed the importance of the topic by noting that millions of women worldwide take combined oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone therapy.

Oral contraceptives containing estrogen plus progestin were found to increase the risk of breast, cervical and liver cancer, while decreasing the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. 

 Press release from the IARC and the WHO. 

 If you are one of the 100 million women using combined hormonal contraceptives or one of the 20 million women under hormonal menopausal therapy, talk to your doctor and find something less harmful to use instead.

Our parents will become our children

 What Are We Going to Do with Dad by Jerald Winakur in the Washington Post. A sobering piece.

 My only sibling, an architect, asks me every time we are together.....&quot;What are we going to do with Dad?&quot; As if there must be a definitive answer, some fix -- say, putting a grab bar in the bathroom or increasing the width of the doorways.

He asks me this question not just out of fear and frustration, but because he figures that his older brother, the physician, should know the answer. I do not know the answer. I do not have a pat solution for my father or yours -- neither as a son, a man past middle age with grown children of his own, nor as a specialist in geriatrics who is also a credentialed long-term care medical director.

In the United States today there are 35 million geriatric patients -- defined as over the age of 65 . Of these, 4.5 million are older than 85, now characterized as the &quot;old old.&quot; Yet the American Medical Directors Association, which credentials physicians in long-term care, has certified only 1,900 such doctors in the entire country; only 2 percent of physicians in training say they want to go into geriatric care. As we baby boomers go about our lives, frozen into our routines of work and family responsibilities, a vast inland sea of elders is building. By 2020 there will be an estimated 53 million Americans older than 65, 6.5 million of whom will be &quot;old old.&quot; Many of you will be among them. America will be inundated with old folks, each with a unique set of circumstances, medical and financial .
--- 

It&apos;s rarely talked about, but hospitalizations are the most dangerous times for the elderly. Even if they have never manifested any signs of disorientation, it is in the hospital -- in a strange and threatening environment, under the influence of anesthetics, pain pills, anti-emetics and soporifics -- that many elderly will meet their match. Add to this the treatment mishaps (caused by the &quot;normally expected&quot; side effects and complications of standard medical procedures) and the human errors (mistakes in drug dosing, the right medication given to the wrong patient), now multiplying in our modern hospitals like germs in a Petri dish, and it is almost a miracle that any elderly patient gets out relatively unscathed.

Every night, I slept in the reclining chair by my father&apos;s bed. I got up when he did; ran interference with bedrails, side tables and IV poles; guarded his every move to the bathroom; looked at every medication and every fluid-filled bag plugged into his arm. Yet each day, my father descended deeper into paranoid confusion. He was restless, and intermittently unsure of who I was. At first I could calm him with my voice, talking about the old days, reminding him of our fishing trips on the Chesapeake Bay when I was young. Then he needed the physical reassurance of my hand on his arm or shoulder at all times. Finally, so that he could get some rest, I got in the bed and held him, comforting him as he once -- in a long-ago life -- did me.
---
At first, my mother didn&apos;t believe that my father was demented. Most of us do not recognize the reduction in the mental capacities of our spouses or parents unless something unexpected happens. My mother continued to see his stubbornness and withdrawal as purposeful acts of belligerence against her -- until the day she realized he could no longer figure out how to unlock the front door by himself..

From my years as a geriatrician and now as the son of an &quot;old old&quot; man, I recognize that there is one inescapable truth: Our parents will become our children if they live long enough. Perhaps if we looked on our elderly in this way, we would be kinder to them.

Drinking improves thinking

 The Australians began a 20 year study in 1999 to examine the changes in people&apos;s thinking and mood as they age.

Preliminary results are in.

It is guaranteed to raise a cheer among those who enjoy a tipple: moderate drinkers are better thinkers than teetotallers or those who overindulge.

Research by the Australian National University in Canberra suggests drinking in moderation boost your brainpower. But none at all, or too much, can make you a dullard.

A study of 7,000 people in their early 20s, 40s and 60s found that those who drank within safe limits had better verbal skills, memory and speed of thinking than those at the extremes of the drinking spectrum. The safe consumption level was considered to be 14 to 28 standard drinks a week for a man and seven to 14 for a woman.
-----

The results may reflect the fact that alcohol can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and increase blood flow to the brain - factors linked to improved mental function. They also support research that suggests moderate alcohol intake can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by improving circulation.

Vaccine protects against tetanus but you need a booster every 10 years or you lose protection.

Older adults account for some 70% of the reported cases of tetanus infection according to DB.

A True Champion

What a true champion Lance Armstrong is with his 7th victory in the Tour de France. 

 

He praises the tour itself, his competitors and then turns to the journalists.
 

Then, in a pointed message to the journalists who have worked overtime to prove that he has won his races by using drugs, he also had a direct message: &quot;To the cynics and sceptics, I say I am sorry that they can&apos;t live a dream, or believe in miracles, as there are no secrets to my success. Vive le Tour.&quot;

He&apos;s humble.

 Sheryl Crow shed a tear . Cancer survivors praised his inspirational tale. Rivals and fans fondly bade farewell to a cycling great.
On the day of his last ride in the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong absorbed all of the accolades with a calm smile.
The seven-time champion began the final stage in humble fashion, posing for photographs in front of a chalkboard scribbled with &quot;merci et au revoir&quot;—thanks and goodbye.
 

He donates his share of the prize money to his team.

Did I say his girlfriend is Sheryl Crow?

 

No wonder cancer patients around the world look to him as their model of how you can Live Strong.

r 

 &quot;It&apos;s Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life&quot; (Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins) 

The Lance Armstrong Foundation believes that in the battle with cancer, unity is strength, knowledge is power and attitude is everything. A great place to go when first diagnosed, its website provides practical information and the tools need to LIVE STRONG. 
Knowledge is Power.
 
Of course there&apos;s his remarkable story of recovering from testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and his brain. 

Cancer revealed his great strengths and purpose in life.
 Cancer left him scarred physically and emotionally, but he now maintains it was &quot;…the best thing that ever happened to me,&quot; This new perspective allowed him to think beyond cycling and focus on his debt to the cancer community. He formed the Lance Armstrong Foundation within months of his diagnosis to help others with their cancer struggles.

 

His story, his inspiring example and his foundation is his Great Legacy to all of us.
 
He knows &quot;that every day is precious and that every step matters.&quot;

Belly Fat and Chronic Stress

It could be that belly fat is your body&apos;s way of coping with stress Tara Pope reports today in the Wall St Journal (subscription only)

This month, a report in the medical journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity looked at the link between stress and the consumption of comfort foods, finding that there may be a physiological reason people tend to binge on fatty and sugar-laden foods during times of stress. In a series of rat studies, researchers at University of California-San Francisco fed two groups of rats a diet of rat chow and sugar water. But one group of rats lived more stressful lives, spending short periods of time during the day in a confined space. Stress hormone levels were higher in the confined rats, and the stressed rats started to eat less healthy chow and gulp down more sugar water.
But what happened next was surprising. As the stressed-out rats started to accumulate more belly fat, their stress hormones went back down. The higher the belly fat, the lower the animal&apos;s stress hormones. That suggests that gaining belly fat may be the body&apos;s coping mechanism for turning off the stress response. In addition, the theory is that stress hormones may somehow turn on the brain&apos;s reward center, and the result is that during times of stress, certain foods actually taste better, making you eat more of them.
&quot;It&apos;s why comfort food may reduce stress,&quot; says Mary Dallman, UCSF physiology professor and lead author of the rat studies. &quot;It may be that you feel better if you put on belly fat if you&apos;re under conditions of chronic stress.&quot;

Paralyzed and not depressed

If you were to name diseases that seem terrifying to just about everyone, Lou Gehrig&apos;s disease would be at the top of the list.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is incurable. It destroys the brain&apos;s ability to control muscles through neurons, gradually causing physical decline until the patient is unable to breathe. Some 30,000 Americans live with ALS and about 5600 are newly diagnosed each year.

Yet, remarkably, ALS patients with advanced ALS who have trouble breathing and probably only six months to live are not greatly depressed even though death is very much on their minds.

Steven Albert, associate professor at Columbia University and co-author of a study published in the July 12 issue of Neurology says,

 &quot;The broader message is that even when people are dying, they can have satisfying lives and appreciate a lot of things.&quot; 
Death was on the minds of many of the patients, however. Of the 53 who died during the study period, 23 reported thinking about ending their lives. Three asked caregivers for relief from pain even if it hastened their deaths.
&quot;For those people who are able to exercise this control over dying and report very high levels of suffering, their mood improves when they realize they could work out an arrangement and control the time of death,&quot; Albert said.
Dr. Catherine Lomen-Hoerth, director of the University of California at San Francisco&apos;s ALS Center, said the findings reflect what she sees on the job. &quot;Most patients are quite comfortable with death,&quot; said Lomen-Hoerth, who wrote a commentary accompanying the two new studies. &quot;It comes with having a lot of time to prepare, and from clinics and hospice professionals addressing the issue with patients and families.&quot;

Chocolate covered fruit

The news just keeps getting better and better about chocolate. 

We know that dark chocolate, rich in flavonoids, offers benefits to your heart much like red wine, fruits and vegetables.

Now dark chocolate seems to help lower blood pressure as well . 

So forget your milk chocolate and white chocolate and head on out to Trader Joe&apos;s. They have the most delicious dark chocolate wrapped dried blueberries, cherries and cranberries.  Fruits and chocolate.

Scientific Process at Work

If you&apos;re skeptical about the latest medical study, you&apos;ve good reason.

A recent review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that one out of every three highly cited studies is either refuted or seriously weakened by subsequent research.

Dr. John Ioannis, author of the review says,

 This is largely the scientific process at work,&quot; said Ioannidis, an associate professor of medicine at the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts-New England Medical Center, in Boston. &quot;There is nothing wrong with publishing promising evidence.&quot; 
 

Examples.  
 

the initial finding that hormone-replacement therapy reduced older women&apos;s heart disease risk (a larger trial later found that HRT actually raised cardiovascular and cancer risk); the promise of vitamin E in preventing heart attack (it doesn&apos;t); and the news that vitamin A supplements cut breast cancer risk (again, a larger, randomized trial showed no effect).

Unexpected Side Effects

 Some Parkinson&apos;s Drugs May Trigger Compulsive Gambling. 

 Researchers say that the findings could offer insights into addictive behaviors.
 
 The 11 case studies presented in the new study were startling, not just for the dramatic onset of a dangerous compulsion, but because the reduction or discontinuation of the drug resulted in an equally dramatic cessation of the habit.

One 52-year-old married man started gambling &quot;uncontrollably&quot; after raising the dose of his dopamine agonist. His wife phoned the neurologist to report that her husband had lost more than $100,000, was eating compulsively -- he gained 50 pounds -- and had an obsession with sex that resulted in him carrying on an extramarital affair. The man lost his excessive interest in gambling and sex when the medication was tapered off, according to the report.

Another man with no history of gambling started frequenting casinos for days at a time, exhibited an increased sex drive, drank more alcohol and ate excessively. When his medications were stopped, he reverted to having sex once weekly instead of four times a day.

And one 68-year-old man lost more than $200,000 gambling in six months and left town for days at a time without telling anyone where he was.

Curry kills melanoma cancer cells

 Curry spice shuts down melanoma.  In the lab, high doses of curcumin -the ingredient that gives curry its yellow hue - killed melanoma tumor cells.

(To be proven effective though, the spice must be tested first on animals then humans.)

Still in all, curry take away is probably doing those pale-skinned and freckled celts and anglo-saxons in England, Ireland and Australia a lot of good.

Working Together on Borrowed Time

I learned last week a new word – PIETAS . 

Pietas is an ancient and noble Roman virtue that teaches reverence and gratitude for those on whose shoulders we stand. I want to to applaud today not the famous people in American history, but all those Americans on whose shoulders we stand because of the way they worked together. 

Alexis de Tocqueville, that famous French observer of Democracy in America, observed how uniquely American was the characteristic to working together IN ASSOCIATION to achieve common goals. Political factions and religious groups are the most obvious associations but de Tocqueville found Americans coming together in associations to plan fetes, raise churches, build inns and distribute books. 

In 1831, he remarked that at the head of a new undertaking, you would find the government in France, a great lord in England, and an association in the United States.

When we want to get something done, we find people of like minds and we do it together. We connect and we share alike in a common endeavor. Toastmasters is a wonderful example. Each of us wants to become more comfortable speaking in public. Together, we all help each other do precisely that. Another great example is Alcoholics Anonymous. Without a doubt the most successful way to deal with addiction, AA exists only to help each member get and stay sober with the help of every other member.

Apart from the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, my most treasured American possession is the free public library. In 1833, not far from here in Peterborough NH, the first public library was spontaneously organized by ordinary people like you and me who wanted knowledge to be available to anyone who wanted to educate themselves.  

One can say that the World Wide Web is an example of an association or a network that exists only in its links and connections. No one is in charge, no one runs it. We are &quot;small pieces loosely joined&quot; in the words of Dave Weinberger which is also a wonderful book .

This self-organization of people into associations and networks can only happen in an open society where everyone is free to do whatever they want. Even free to disobey authority.

Engineers who have studied the collapse of the World Trade Towers for the past 4 years learned something remarkable. In a connected world, ordinary people have better information than officials and disobeying authority may be the best thing to do. By ignoring official advice not to use the elevators and to stay put in their offices, some additional 2500 lives were saved on September 11.

Living in America, I am an optimist, confident that the good sense of the American people will prevail whatever happens or we will at least muddle through. But I wouldn’t be so confident if I didn’t believe in the constructive use of pessimism to anticipate what could go wrong and how to prepare against it. I was trained as a lawyer after all.

That’s why I’m such an advocate for preparedness. Being prepared for just about anything gives you not only peace of mind but the confidence to prevail whatever happens. With such confidence comes courage. Courage is action in the face of fear. Action itself dispells fear which I liken to a cloud of unknowing.

You will need that confidence and that courage as well as the American talent for association to prevail and survive if what appears likely to happen, happens.

A global pandemic of avian flu is likely this year or next or the year after that that could kill tens of millions worldwide. Avian flu, in particular, the H5N1 virus has been evolving, crossed the species barrier, infected and caused the death of 54 people. The World Health Organization openly admits that everyone is unprepared and says we are living on borrowed time. We don’t yet have a national plan or vaccines for more than 1% of the population. Our public health response is in no way prepared. Given television and the Internet, the potential for panic is huge.

A medium level pandemic in the United States would cause half a million deaths, more than two million hospitalized, sicken a third of the population or some sixty seven million of us and cost $166 billion in direct medical costs. 

If such a pandemic were to break out today, the US Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy said,“We’re screwed.”

As I wrote earlier in On Borrowed Time 
 
If there is a pandemic, it will be everywhere.
The scene of the disaster will be everywhere.
Everywhere is local. 
All the battles will be fought on the local level.
 
That’s where I’m counting on the American genius for self-organizing associations to prevail.

Here are some useful links where you can learn a lot more.

Body Language

Does your urine smell like maple syrup? Do you get muscle cramps? Excess dandruff? Carpal tunnel syndrome? Do you sneeze in bright sunlight? Or have chicken skin on your upper arms?

Is your body telling you something? A new website,  Bodylanguage helps you identify what deficiency you may be suffering from and steps you can take to get rid of the symptoms.

Co-creators, Jim Campbell is a forensic scientist and Graham Cope is a biochemist who says, 

Body Language empowers the general public to have greater control over their own health and puts the emphasis on prevention rather than cure,

We have developed the Body Language concept so that people can identify deficiencies and replenish them with healthy foodstuffs,

A note on the site says

Body Language is a collection of &apos;classic&apos; signs and symptoms that the authors have painstakingly collected, researched and expanded. Most of them are grounded on valid science, a few are &apos;old wives tales&apos; that nevertheless have sound scientific validity, a few are anecdotal. many of them are fascinating in their own right.

A wash of love

A wash of love is how one woman describes how she feels when she&apos;s breast feeding her baby. That&apos;s oxytocin at work. 

Testosterone is the hormone that causes the &quot;fight or flight&quot; reaction. A predominately male hormone, it&apos;s released during times of stress and manifested as aggression or withdrawal.

Oxytocin is the hormone that causes females to &quot;tend and befriend&quot; other women. Women are much more social in the way they cope with stress. They depend on friends to get them through tough times.

Shelley Taylor, author of &quot;The Tending Instinct&quot; and a social neuroscientist at the University of California, says, &quot;That difference alone contributes to the gender difference in longevity.&quot;

Preventing Alzheimer&apos;s

The first Alzheimer&apos;s Association International Conference on the Prevention of Dementia is being held in Washington, D.C.

There being highlighted is a &quot;stream of studies&quot; that show how simple lifestyle changes such as being socially engaged and watching how you eat, drink and exercise may have a preventative effect against developing Alzheimer&apos;s disease and dementia.

 Future treatments for Alzheimer&apos;s disease may run the gamut from calisthenics combined with singing, Chinese herbs, immune-boosting therapies and insulin delivered to the brain via the nose.
----Several of the proposed treatment methods target beta-amyloid, the abnormal brain protein that is thought to be the culprit behind Alzheimer&apos;s disease.

What&apos;s so funny?

Via Medpundit and the Journal of the American Medical Association

 At 4 PM on a March day, a 32-year-old, previously healthy barber was standing and cutting a client’s hair. The client related a funny story, upon which the barber broke out into a very strong, sustained, loud, and unrestrained laughing fit during which, according to observers, he &quot;blacked out&quot; and fell to the floor. Although he sustained interscapular bruising and minor trauma to the right shoulder, he exhibited no seizure activity and no bladder or bowel incontinence. He regained consciousness within a few seconds, was completely oriented, had no apparent neurological deficit, and immediately resumed his work. He had been working on his feet throughout the day, but this was customary for him and he had never had a syncopal or near-syncopal episode before. The temperature at the time had been mild. The timing of his most recent meal was not recorded. The patient did not reveal the content of the story.

Early returns on HSAs

Some 4 million Americans now have HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) and they have mixed feelings says a report this week in the Wall St Journal. (subscription only)  

 The early picture -- based on the experience of companies that offer the plans, and research by consultants and plan providers -- suggests that participants aren&apos;t skimping on health care as some critics had feared. They are, however, frustrated by having to be health-care consumers because medical price and quality information still is so hard to come by.

Consumer-driven health plans -- arguably the biggest shift in health-care coverage since health maintenance organizations -- typically combine a high-deductible insurance plan with some sort of savings account that participants can use to pay for care until they meet the deductible.
 

A survey of 2500 consumers by McKinsey&amp;Co found that those with health savings account were 50% more likely to ask providers about cost and 20% more likely to follow treatment regimens. 80% said they didn&apos;t have enough information on the prices doctors charge.

Helping with Medical Choices

There&apos;s a new and free website patientINFORM.org set up by a consortium of medical-journal publishers and patient-advocacy groups to help people navigate the world of health care research reports the Wall St Journal.   (subscription only) 

The American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association have joined together to offer access to

 selected medical-journal articles, and provide plain-language explanations of what the studies mean, how they compare with what&apos;s already known, and how patients should weigh them in making treatment decisions.
 
By putting research in context, the site will help patients make better choices. 

One example on the American Cancer Society site explains why two recent studies on prostate-cancer treatment in major medical journals that seemed to contradict each other are actually complementary (one found that those who opt for surgery are less likely to die while another suggested that some men can safely skip treatment). The former compared two treatment options while the latter looked at how men fared once they had already chosen a strategy of putting off treatment, known as &quot;watchful waiting.&quot;

&quot;For years, patients have been telling us they wish someone would explain to them what a study really means in practical terms,&quot; says J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society&apos;s deputy chief medical officer.

As Martha Stewart would say, &quot;That&apos;s a good thing.&quot;  It&apos;s helping people with the Business of their Lives.

Bodymedia

&quot;Your body is spewing off millions of data points a second,&quot; says Eric Teller whose company Bodymedia is featured in Forbes magazine, Future Teller . 

BodyMedia has sold 7,500 armband monitors, 2.9-ounce pods packed with six sensors absorbing physiological data 32 times a second. Wearers dump their data wirelessly to a PC, which sends them to BodyMedia&apos;s computer servers to be analyzed by 1,300 algorithms that figure out what that body is doing.

Will constant body feedback inspire people to make healthier choices? Will insurance companies require them as a way to incentivize healthy behavior? Will health care become a meritocracy with the best care going to those who did what they could to avoid getting sick?

In ways we can&apos;t even imagine, technology will change our lives, mostly for the better. What I wonder is whether we can deal with the ethical dilemmas such new technologies raise?

UPDATE: The Boston Globe has a piece today on a new experiment on depressed patients. Getting wired could help predict emotions.

 

 In a groundbreaking experiment at Massachusetts General Hospital, a handful of patients battling depression have agreed in recent weeks to be wired up for 24-hour-a-day, mobile monitoring of their palm sweat, heart rate, voice dynamics, movements, and location.

The study aims to show that such measures can reliably reflect a patient&apos;s state of mind as treatment progresses, researchers say. But more broadly, it seeks to prove that technology has reached the point where it can monitor a person&apos;s basic emotional tenor through ordinary days. 

While the patients in the study are using LiveNet (a fanny pack), the piece discusses using LifeShirts (already FDA approved).

The Body&apos;s Janitors

Do you know what &quot;microphages&quot; are? 

 &quot;Macrophages are the janitors of the innate immune system, gobbling up waste products in the brain and throughout the body,&quot; says Dr. Milan Fiala.
 
In healthy people, innate immune system cells called macrophages easily cleared amyloid-beta in a test tube. In contrast, Alzheimer&apos;s patients&apos; macrophages couldn&apos;t adequately perform this task. 

So improving the health of the body&apos;s own janitors, those microphages, could lead to a treatment for Alzheimer&apos;s according to a new study authored by Dr. Milan Fiala, at the University of California, Los Angeles, and published in the June 10 Journal of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease.

Mentally Ill

Every decade, the National Institutes of Health take a snapshot of the nation&apos;s mental health. The Wall St. Journal reports on the latest  (subscription only) and it doesn&apos;t look good. 

That is unless you&apos;re a drug company selling antidepressants and anti-psychotic medications to the tune of about $20 billion a year. While such medications help many millions of people, they haven&apos;t had an effect on the overall numbers.

 More Americans are seeking treatment for mental illnesses than ever before, but most of them fail to get adequate care. ...

In the once-a-decade report funded by the National Institutes of Health, researchers found that one-quarter of Americans had a psychiatric disorder in the year prior to the survey , and 40% of them sought treatment, up from just 25% who sought treatment in the previous report a decade ago.
----
Only one-third of affected people received even &quot;minimally adequate&quot; care -- which was defined by the researchers as getting at least two months of appropriate medication and seeing a doctor at least four times, or undergoing at least eight psychotherapy sessions of 30 minutes or more.
......
 Some 60% of people identified as having a mental disorder didn&apos;t seek treatment . And among those who did seek help, many opted out of conventional medical psychiatry altogether; a third of all mental-health visits were for unproven alternative therapies like acupuncture and dietary supplements.
 

Results of the study, known as the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, are being published in the June issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry.



It seems that about half of the chronic cases begin before age 14. Three-quarters by age 24.  Mental illness begins in youth 

 This new study demonstrates clearly these really are chronic disorders of young people in this country,&quot; said Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which funded the study. &quot;These disorders cause a high degree of disability, with nearly 6 percent of the population showing serious disability. That is really extraordinary. Those are the kinds of numbers we didn&apos;t have before.&quot;
 

The New York Times reports some doctors think the numbers are inflated.
 

 &quot;Fifty percent of Americans mentally impaired - are you kidding me?&quot; said Dr. Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. While the new survey was carefully done, Dr. McHugh said, &quot;the problem is that the diagnostic manual we are using in psychiatry is like a field guide and it just keeps expanding and expanding.&quot;

Personalized Medicine

Personalized medicine based on your genetic make-up just got a lot closer according to a Boston Globe story by Raja Mishra .
Remember this field of &quot;pharmacogenetics&quot; - you&apos;ll be hearing a lot more about it.

 Researchers last week announced that they had successfully used patients&apos; genes to determine how much of a potentially dangerous blood-thinning medication they should get -- bringing the era of personalized medicine a giant step closer.

&apos;&apos;To me, it&apos;s really remarkable that five years after the sequencing of the human genome we&apos;re starting to see direct applications for clinical medicine,&quot; said Dr. Scott Weiss of Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital who conducts research into personalized asthma treatments. &apos;&apos;The major areas are going to be in prediction -- of who gets disease, and for those who have it, predicting the course of their disease, and predicting who&apos;s going to respond to medication.&quot;

The blood-thinning drug warfarin (sold under the prescription Coumadin) is notoriously hard to prescribe, with many patients, given just a bit too much, bleeding internally, and others, given too little, left at risk for blood clots. The researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Washington University in St. Louis said they had found a way to use the patients&apos; genes to determine whether to start them on a high, medium or low dose of the drug that is now used by millions of Americans at risk for blood clots or heart attacks.
---------------
Rochelle Long can see the progress from her perch as program director for NIH&apos;s Pharmacogenetic Research Network, the nation&apos;s chief funder of personalized medicine research, which has spent more than $100 million in the last five years on the work.

&apos;&apos;There are people looking at cardiovascular drugs, anticancer drugs, antidepression drugs,&quot; she said of studies funded by her agency. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s exciting; there&apos;s a lot of research going on.&quot;

And Long still believes in the future of pharmacogenetics: &apos;&apos; The promise is ultimately getting a genetic test just once, and knowing how you will interact with most drugs for the rest of your life.&quot;

All in the Genes

Is this great news or small consolation? 

Women who fail to orgasm during sex may be genetically programmed to weed out unreliable men who are a flop between the sheets, according to new research.
......
The findings suggest the failure of some women to orgasm regularly is not a dysfunction, but a sophisticated mate-selection strategy that evolved during prehistoric times.

Ann Althouse calls it the basis of human civilization 

It looks as if all the achievements of human civilization ought to be attributed to how hard it is to satisfy us women. Men did plenty of the work over the millennia, but they wouldn&apos;t have bothered if we women hadn&apos;t needed something more than sex to impress us.

What&apos;s a Guy to Do?

 My father&apos;s death was the envy of all his friends.

He hit a perfect drive off the eighth tee one spring morning and fell over dead of a heart attack. He was 73 and had never spent a day in the hospital. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of so-called procedures he ever had to endure.

Of course, given the outcome, we all might have been better off if he had submitted to a few more of them after that day of nausea a few months before his death. Dad&apos;s doctor decided it had been a teeny-tiny heart attack.

I might give the same advice to myself. 

Dennis Overbye writes  Anti-Doctor and Anti-Death - What&apos;s a Guy to Do.  

If you&apos;re one of those guys - and you know who you are, avoiding doctors - or married to one, this is a funny must-read piece.

Better Living through Chemistry, NOT

As if you needed something else to worry about.  

 A new alert has been issued over chemicals used in make-up, shampoo and toys that&apos;s taking the boy out of boys.

Experts say products containing the chemicals - called phthalates - could cause women to give birth to boys with female characteristics. Their research found shrunken genitals and less masculine behaviour in babies.

Phthalates help to give cosmetics colour and bond perfume molecules. They are also used in pliable plastics such as clingfilm, kidney dialysis tubes, blood bags and even children&apos;s toys.

&quot;This is a very big problem,&quot; said study leader Professor Shanna Swan, of the University of Rochester. The research, to be published-next month in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, found 90 per cent of babies exposed to high levels of the chemicals in the womb exhibited &quot;more female physical traits&quot;.
-----------
Andreas Kortenkamp, an expert in environmental pollutants at the London School of Pharmacy, said: &quot;If it&apos;s true, it&apos;s sensational. This is the first time anyone&apos;s shown this effect in humans.&quot;

He added: &quot;These are mass chemicals. They are used in any plastic that is pliable. Sorting this out is going to be an interesting challenge for industry as well as society.&quot;

The Pill Kills Libido?

Taking the pill for as little as six months could destroy a woman&apos;s sex drive forever, say scientists. 

The oral contraceptive dramatically reduces the levels of a hormone responsible for desire and simply stopping taking it fails to reverse the effect, it is feared.

A survey produced such dramatic results that lead researcher Dr Irwin Goldstein advised any woman on the Pill who has sexual problems to stop taking it and try another method of birth control.

&quot;There is a possibility it is imprinting a woman for the rest of her life,&quot; he said.

The research, presented at the American Association of Clinical Endrocrinologists last week in Washington, D.C, is summarized in the current issue of New Scientist .

HSA and health care costs

Medical costs for an average family of four will exceed $12,200 this year, up from just $8,400 in 2001. That assumes health care insurance paid for by the employer, so out of pocket costs are about $2035, roughly 17% of the total, about the same percentage as 2001.

 The story in the Wall St Journal is from the Milliman report based on the Milliman Medical Index, compiled from its data base of more than 15 million people. (Both the WSJ report and the Milliman report are behind paid subscription walls).

As to just what effect more consumer driven health care will have on overall health care costs, who knows. 

But I bet once people understand they could shelter up to $4500 each year with a combined high deductible -health savings account (HSA) those accounts could be huge and their impact on overall health care costs even bigger. 

It may be the way, healthy aging boomers can sock away more money for their retirement.

 They have the potential to become the dominant kind of health care financing in the next five to 10 years,&quot; says Greg Scandlen, a health care expert at the Galen Institute, a Washington think tank in a USA Today story. 

Of course, you have to pay a lot more out of pocket with a high deductible, but the tax free withdrawals from your companion health savings account cover a very broad range.
(See the chart accompanying t he USA story).

I&apos;m looking forward to them.

Medical Errors

Turns out that computer systems aren&apos;t reducing medical errors as once was hoped. Despite in-hospital computerized medication entry systems, medication errors are continuing at an alarming rate. 

As reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine, May 23, the most common errors involved a failure on the part of staff to anticipate adverse drug reactions.

You are your own best advocate, so here are 20 tips to help prevent medical errors .

And don&apos;t forget keeping your list of medications on your wallet card .

Worshiping &quot;Ana&quot;, Discouraging Recovery

Watch out for those eating disorder, anorexia sites. They don&apos;t really help by suggesting that anorexia or bulimia is a &quot;lifestyle&quot; choice and not an illness. 

In too many cases, they glorify these often offer fatal disorders with glamorous shots of too thin models and bad advice. Often, they sell jewelry -thin red &quot;ana&quot; (anorexia) or thin purple &quot;mia&quot; (bulimia) bracelets - as a badge of identity as well as status symbol.

 Nearly two-thirds of visitors to those sites used new weight loss or purging techniques they learned on the site according to researchers at Stanford University who presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies this week. Glorification of these often fatal eating disorders is flourishing they say, and some of those sites discourage recovery.
 
Here&apos;s a good one: National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.

Some Sunshine May Prevent Cancer

 Scientists Say Sunshine May Prevent Cancer 

 In the last three months alone, four separate studies found it helped protect against lymphoma and cancers of the prostate, lung and, ironically, the skin. The strongest evidence is for colon cancer.

Many people aren&apos;t getting enough vitamin D. It&apos;s hard to do from food and fortified milk alone, and supplements are problematic.

So the thinking is this: Even if too much sun leads to skin cancer, which is rarely deadly, too little sun may be worse.

No one is suggesting that people fry on a beach. But many scientists believe that &quot;safe sun&quot; - 15 minutes or so a few times a week without sunscreen - is not only possible but helpful to health.

Other virtual health benefits? Blogging in the early stages of Alzheimer&apos;s really improves the quality of life. As reported by Wired News in  Blog to Cope with Alzheimer&apos;s Fog , blogging helps Alzheimer&apos;s sufferers to &quot;recall tasks completed and milestones passed,&quot; to categorize and store memories online and to reach out to others experiencing memory loss.

Stories of other people who have been through what you&apos;re going through are tremendously helpful. Going virtual means a single story can help people around the world - like this story in a  A Year to Remember  by woman who published her journals about caring for her mother with Alzheimer&apos;s just so others could take solace.

Bad Medicine-Episiotomies

Over a million are performed each year on women, yet the evidence is overwhelming against this unnecessary and damaging procedure, episiotomies. 

According to an analysis by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality, at the behest of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, episiotomies performed on women have no benefit whatsoever.
 

In fact, an episiotomy -- a preemptory incision, theoretically intended to prevent pregnant women from experiencing torn tissue during labor -- probably makes such complications more likely and causes more pain and worse side effects as well.



Did I mention there are over one million performed each year on American women?

Meditate, Live Longer

It may be that if you practice meditation regularly, you will live longer, a recent study suggests .

Attending religious services weekly may benefit your health in many ways according to the WSJ&apos;s Health Journal yesterday: there&apos;s a social network, meditation and a set of values that discourages unhealthy behaviors. 

Most important may be the practice of turning to prayer or meditation in times of anger and distress and thus diminishing the harmful effects of negative emotions.

Round-up of Medical Studies

A quick round-up of some medical studies

Why napping is more important than ever, especially if, like me, you stay up late and get up early.  Too little sleep could cause diabetes.  

Sustaining a gaze can make you more attractive. Sizing Up That Look of Love . It used to be called a gleek, one of my favorite words, as in Gleeks for Geeks. Or as Sophia Loren said, &quot;Sex appeal is fifty percent what you&apos;ve got and fifty percent what people think you&apos;ve got.&quot;

Another reason for splendid salmon.  Mom&apos;s Diet May Reduce Breast Cancer Risk in Daughters .

Mothers who eat fish and other foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and while nursing may reduce the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by as much as 40 percent, a new study of mice found.

Attention smokers:  Daily Aspirin, Ibuprofen cut chances for developing oral cancer by 50% . If you&apos;re unlucky enough to have already developed lung cancer, and 170,000 do each year, plan your surgery for the summer, according to a Harvard study.
 

 Those who had surgery in very sunny months and had a high intake of vitamin D were more than twice as likely to surpass the five-year survival mark as people who had winter surgeries and a low intake of vitamin D, the study found.

Unhealthy lifestyles

Only 3% of Americans live a healthy lifestyle reports the Wall St. Journal today on a study published today by the Archives of Internal Medicine.

The study measured four factors considered indicators of a healthy lifestyle.
 non-smokers....................................... 76%
healthy weight.................................... 40%
eat 5 or more fruits and vegetables.. 23%
exercise 30 min, 5 times/week......... 22% 

 2 out of 4...........34%
3 out of 4...........14%
4 out of 4............ 3% 

Lead researcher and epidemiologist Mathew Reeves was &quot;shocked&quot; at the results, compiled using survey data of more than 150,000 Americans by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &quot;We aren&apos;t asking anyone to climb Mt. Everest here.&quot;

Those over 65 did the best with an overall 4%
Those 35 to 44 did the worst with an overall 2.5%

Harmful Air Cleaners

 Consumer Reports that ionizing air cleaners often create significant levels of potentially harmful indoor ozone. 
 

 People with asthma or respiratory allergies are especially sensitive to indoor ozone, an irritant that can worsen asthma, deaden sense of smell, raise sensitivity to pollen and mold, and may cause permanent lung damage 

These are the cleaners that failed safety standard tests and should be returned for a refund.
 Brookstone Pure-Ion V2; Sharper Image Professional Series Ionic Breeze Quadra S1737 SNX; Ionic Pro CL-369; IonizAir P4620; and Surround Air XJ-2000.

 Top performers that passed the tests were: 
 

 The top-performing Friedrich C-90A, an ionizing electrostatic precipitator model, is very effective and emits little ozone. Another fine performer that emits little ozone is the Whirlpool 45030, which is a HEPA-filter model.

Redesigned Pill Bottle

The drugstore prescription bottle can be outright dangerous. According to a study by Target, some 60% of prescription drug users have at some point taken their medications incorrectly.

Deborah Adler&apos;s grandmother took her husband&apos;s medication by mistake. So, Deborah, a graduate student at the School for Visual Arts, decided to revamp the standard bottle as her thesis project, called Safe Rx.  The Perfect Prescription details how Deborah dealt with the problems of inconsistent labeling, poor color combinations, confusing numbers, the tiny type, and the curved shape. 

  click to enlarge.

The redesigned pill bottle has an easy ID, an information hierarchy, it&apos;s upside down to save paper, color-coded rings for different family members, an info card that&apos;s hard to use, and clear warnings.

The new design for prescription drug bottles set to debut at Target on May 1. How many people will switch their prescriptions to Target just because of the better, more elegant, more readable design? Peter Davidson at Thinking will.  The redesigned pill bottle is an outstanding example of how good design adds value to customers, just what Virginia Postrel writes about in The Substance of Style.

Spirituality May Slow Alzheimer&apos;s

 Research suggesting that a rewarding spiritual life may help slow the devastation of Alzheimer&apos;s disease was presented to the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.

This is the first study to actually attempt to look into a relationship between spirituality and religiosity and Alzheimer&apos;s disease,&quot; Kaufman said. &quot;We did not specifically look into the mechanisms, and we certainly need to replicate these results and do a larger study.&quot;

Vincent Corso, a former priest who is now manager of spiritual care and bereavement services for Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Care in New York City, said he was not surprised by the findings, however preliminary.

People who are connected with a spiritual presence in their life, whether it takes the shape of a family member, close friend, support network, meditation or yoga, have a sense of peace and probably, by extrapolation, longevity,&quot; he said. &quot;What&apos;s important to people is how much they&apos;re able to connect with the people around them. If that creates a feeling of well-being, then that aids in the healing process.



Meanwhile, experts had hoped that Vitamin E or Aricept might slow the progression of Alzheimer&apos;s but neither showed any benefit according to a trial, the results of which are also being presented to the American Academy of Neurology

Breast Cancer: Good News

Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health wonders why there is so little reporting of an already-existing drug which, if taken daily, might dramatically reduce the risk of breast cancer.

Dr. Peter Goss from Harvard is leading a group of US and Canadian scientists to recruit thousands of women at high risk of breast cancer to participate in a study of aromatase inhibitors.
 this class of drugs—which includes Astra Zeneca&apos;s Arimidex and Pfizer&apos;s Aromasin—has already been shown, as Dr. Goss puts it, to &quot;profoundly&quot; reduce the risk of recurrence in women who have already been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer—and to do so with fewer side effects than an earlier drug, Tamoxifen. Arimidex decreases the chance of cancer developing in the other breast by almost 80 percent.

Bush and the Queen at London Heathrow, a 300-foot long red carpet is stretched out to Air Force One and Mr. Bush strides to a warm but dignified handshake from Queen Elizabeth II.

They ride in a silver 1934 Bentley limousine to the edge of central London where they board an open 17th century coach hitched to six magnificent white matching horses.

As they ride toward Buckingham Palace, each looking sideways and waving to the thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, all is going well.

But suddenly the right rear horse lets fly with the most horrendous, earth-rending, eye-smarting blast of gastronomic flatulence ever heard in the British Empire, including Bermuda, Tortola and other islands.

It shakes the coach.

Uncomfortable, but under control, the two dignitaries of state do their best to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decides that&apos;s ridiculous.

She turns to Mr. Bush and explains, &quot;Mr. President, please accept myregrets. I&apos;m sure you understand that there are some things that even a Queen cannot control.&quot;

Vast Insurance Fraud

It&apos;s often easy to people to pile on insurance companies. Today though there&apos;s every reason to cheer a law suit brought by 12 Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance plans who are suing a group of health clinics and doctors who paid thousands of people across the U.S. to undergo unnecessary surgery so they could defraud the insurers out of tens of millions of dollars.  Vast Insurance Fraud involves nine surgery clinics, seven medical management companies and 34 individuals.
 The scope of the alleged fraud is vast. The insurers claim the clinics paid recruiters to enlist patients in 47 states, then transported the people to California where they underwent unnecessary and sometimes dangerous outpatient procedures.
.....
The investigators said that from August 2002 to April 2003, the defendants recruited more than 5,000 patients nationwide to undergo unnecessary procedures at one clinic and billed almost $97 million to insurers. The clinics also coached the patients how to lie to investigators if they were questioned, the suit claims. Patients were offered credits toward future cosmetic surgery procedures in lieu of cash, the lawsuit alleges. ...
......
Officials said the scope of the scheme is even larger than alleged in the lawsuit. The FBI has determined that $1.3 billion has been billed as a result of the alleged fraud for a loss of $345 million. The FBI has 21 field offices investigating the case and has already disrupted six operations and indicted three people and one corporation, according to Dan Martino of the FBI.

Medical Maggots

This is gruesome and fascinating - Maggots Make Move to Mainstream Medicine.

 
 Since federal officials approved the use of &quot;medical maggots&quot; last year, orders for the critters have skyrocketed as doctors use them as alternative treatments for patients with stubborn, slow-healing leg and foot wounds......

In living people, maggots clean wounds by eating dead and infected tissue. In addition, they disinfect the wounds and stimulate the growth of healthy tissue, said Dr. Ronald Sherman, an assistant professor of medicine and pathology at the University of California, Irvine. &quot;There is no single other product on the market that can do all those actions simultaneously.....

&quot;It still takes a certain patient to accept these. I&apos;ve had just as many people turn me down as accept it,&quot; Handler said. &quot;And then there&apos;s always the issue of the nursing staff whenever you&apos;re talking about maggots and leeches. Thirty percent of the staff is gung-ho and excited, 30 percent could care less but are good sports, and 30 percent really don&apos;t want to have anything to do with it.&quot;

Even so, maggot therapy may have a bright future. According to Handler, they&apos;re cheap, they don&apos;t become ineffective over time like some antibiotics, and they work. &quot;Especially as doctors are getting stretched thinner and thinner,&quot; he said, &quot;it will be helpful for them to conserve their resources and use maggots.&quot; Posted by Jill Fallon at 6:02 PM | Permalink

Paul Raeburn, was once a senior writer and editor at BusinessWeek where he covered science and medicine for seven years and has written a harrowing book Acquainted with The Night about the mental illness of two of his children. One suffered from bipolar disorder and the other from depression and the quest to find them proper treatment laid waste his marriage and his sense of himself. One Amazon reader called it &quot;the best book I&apos;ve ever read about mental illness.&quot;

You don&apos;t get through life without suffering and often, it&apos;s the only way you grow up, but the suffering of one&apos;s children seems particularly hard. Children with mental illness seem to suffer especially from our health system and very few get good counseling or therapy. That is not how we should be treating our future which children are.

This book was non-put-downable because Raeburn is such a marvelous and honest writer, even when it comes to his own many faults. Still, because of his relentless love and advocacy, I&apos;m happy to say both children survived, got through some very bad patches and seem to be living decent lives. The unsettling message: If you have a child with a mental illness, no one will really know what&apos;s wrong or how to treat it. You do the best you can and hope they outgrow it like Raeburn&apos;s children.

Migraines, wine and diabetes

While researchers are reluctant to say there is a cause-and-effect, migraine sufferers seems to have higher heart disease risks, especially if they experience auras. 

 Women with diabetes definitely have a higher heart risk disease

If you&apos;ve had a heart attack or heart surgery, and you&apos;re a woman, you&apos;re far better off drinking wine that beer or spirits to keep your heart on a healthy beat.

Status of Currrent Stem Cell Research

If you&apos;re confused over the debate on stem cell research, you&apos;re not alone. The pace of discoveries and reports is breakneck. Too few make the distinction between the use of embryonic stem cells and the use of other stem cells, yet such a distinction is crucial in both ethical policy decisions on where to spend scarce resource dollars.   Joel has summarized the recent research as reported from the Stem Cell Research Foundation and put it into a stunning well-organized and graphically beautiful chart. 

Here&apos;s the tail-end of his chart and synopsis.

&quot;Frank&quot; dead

Here&apos;s a great story via Jeff Brokaw&apos;s Notes&amp;Musings about a brave young boy who named his tumor &quot;Frank&quot;, short for Frankenstein. 

His mother employed the power of the Internet to save her son&apos;s life.

She found a surgeon who used an alternative procedure to the traditional craniotomy, the cutting through her son&apos;s face and skull that in any event would be too risky given the location of &apos;Frank&apos;

She printed up &quot;Frank Must Die&quot; on bumper stickers and sold them on ebay to cover the costs of the surgery.

The tumor was shrunk, then removed through the boy&apos;s nose without cutting his face.

The surgeon did not charge for the procedure.

The mother donated the money raised to a charity to help other children with cancer.

The tumor was no longer cancerous according to the biopsy.

The boy is alive, happy and celebrated his 10th birthday.

Marital Discord and Your Heart

So what effect does marital discord have on your health? 

Well, if you&apos;re a woman, keeping quiet to avoid conflict with your husband and to preserve the relationship means you are four times more likely to die from all causes during the next ten years.

If you&apos;re a man who keep quiet during marital conflict, you will not suffer any health effects

If you&apos;re a man and your wife comes home upset about work, you are twice as likely to develop heart disease.

All this according to a recent study presented at the Second International Conference on Women, Heart Disease and Stroke .

Looks like women should speak up and men pipe down.

Catch Artery Defect Before It Kills

If you are a man, love a man or happen to know one that ever smoked cigarettes and they are between 65-75, they should be screened for aortic aneurysms. 

That&apos;s the recommendation of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) who estimate they will save one life for every 500 men screened. 

 &quot;You can die from an aneurysm in five minutes,&quot; says Dr. Allen Hamdan, a vascular surgeon at Beth Israel Medical Cente r. Each year, 9000 US adults do die from the condition.

 The US Preventive Services Task Force is an independent panel of experts in primary care and prevention that systematically reviews the evidence of effectiveness and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services.

Stressed Out and Sick About It

According to the American Psychological Association, Americans are too stressed out .

 Forty-three percent of all adults suffer adverse health effects from stress. Seventy-five percent to 90 percent of all physician office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints. Stress is linked to the six leading causes of death -- heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide. 
It&apos;s time to meditate, relax and get more sleep. Try yoga or books on tape for a stressful commute. Every little bit helps and saves wear and tear on your immune system. Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:37 PM | Permalink 
Drinker&apos;s Check-Up

In these days where more people are becoming more self reliant when it comes to their health and their wealth, a study reports that the Internet is becoming an &quot;increasingly rich source of effective help for problem drinkers trying to stay sober, according to experts&quot; . This might be important information for someone you know.
 More and more alcoholics, and people concerned about their level of drinking, are turning to online tools modeled on what counselors call &quot;in-person brief motivational interventions&quot; (BMIs), according to reports gathered at a recent symposium of the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Examples of these online interventions include the &quot;Drinker&apos;s Check-Up.&quot;  In a prepared statement, Reid Hester, director of the Research Division at Behavior Therapy Associates in Albuquerque, N.M., described the Drinker&apos;s Check-Up program as &quot;the Internet equivalent of two to three face-to-face sessions with a counselor.&quot;

Other Web-based interventions focus on college-age drinkers concerned about their level of consumption. They include e-CHUG, which helps students gauge whether or not their drinking falls within healthy norms, and MyStudentBody.com, which provides college kids with information and help on a number of health concerns, including problem drinking.

&quot;A number of studies show that people tend to respond best to certain kinds of interventions, those that provide feedback, are empathetic and nonjudgmental, emphasize personal responsibility, and give people several options for how they would like to go about changing their drinking,&quot; symposium organizer Scott Walters, an assistant professor of behavioral sciences at the University of Texas School of Public Health, said in a prepared statement.

&quot;Interventions that have these elements are more likely to reduce drinking,&quot; he added. &quot;In fact, many drinkers seem to prefer this format. It&apos;s a way to save face, and drinkers can begin to look at their drinking in a private and nonjudgmental way.&quot;

Web-based aids also have the advantage of being cheaper and more convenient than most &apos;bricks and mortar&apos; interventions, Hester said. &quot;[They] provide anonymity, convenience -- they can be done anytime, day or night -- and getting feedback that is objective and not influenced by counselor bias.&quot; Posted by Jill Fallon at 10:09 PM | Permalink 
Regenerated Hearts

I became used to news about tax cheats going to jail to start appearing in mid-March, but this is the first year I&apos;ve noticed so many heart-related scientific studies published around Valentine&apos;s Day. Just as we&apos;ve all become experts in the movie biz, noting not just the new movies, but their box office appeal, science publications have noted when they will get the biggest play for their surveys.

Here,  Love Beats Depression for Women, Not Men.  in the American Journal of Psychiatry
 Supportive, loving relationships offer women protection against major depression but don&apos;t seem to play a role in male depression, say researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University. 
It wasn&apos;t that long ago that everyone believed that the brain didn&apos;t generate any new cells after birth. Now we know not only that brain cells can regenerate , but that they probably sprout new cells throughout life. 

Today, there&apos;s the very good news of the discovery that there are heart cells that can create new muscle cells and with it the hope that damaged hearts can regenerate healthy new cells.

Save yourself grief with wallet cards

Would you know what to do if your mom or dad has a medical emergency? What if they were unconscious or delirious, and the emergency room or hospital called you for essential information they need. Would you have their vital information? Would you know the names of their doctors, the medication they are taking, the surgeries they’ve had? 

I suspect the answer is no. Most older parents don&apos;t think to share this information with their adult children. Then there&apos;s an emergency and their adult children don&apos;t have the necessary information. Result: slower treatment and adult children veering between panic, confusion and guilt. 

The more you know about your parents&apos; health, the more quickly they can be treated in an emergency. Not only should you have an emergency card for yourself and your children, you should have one for your parents.  I think if you told your parents you were filling out an emergency wallet card for yourself and your children and you wanted to do the same for them, they would be very happy to give you the information you need. 

Save yourself grief. Be prepared. Have the information you will need when you will need it.
 According to the Mayo Clinic , below, in order of importance, is the most critical information you should know about your parents&apos; health.

1.  Names of doctors. If you don&apos;t know anything else, this is probably the most important piece of information. Why? Chances are good that your parents&apos; doctors can provide much of the rest of the information needed as well as more details about your parents&apos; specific health histories.
2. Birth date. Often medical records and insurance information are cataloged according to birth date. This can improve communication in an emergency or a crisis.
3. List of allergies. This is especially important if one of your parents is allergic to medication—penicillin, for example.
4. Advance directives. An advance directive is a legal document that outlines a person&apos;s decisions about his or her health care, such as whether or not resuscitation efforts should be made and the use of life-support machines.
5. Major medical problems. This includes such diseases as diabetes or heart disease.
6. List of medications. It&apos;s especially important that a doctor know if your parent uses blood thinners.
7.  Religious beliefs. This is particularly important in case blood transfusions are needed.
8. Insurance information. Know the name of your parents&apos; health insurance provider and their policy numbers.
9. Prior surgery. List past medical procedures, such as cardiac bypass surgery.
10. Lifestyle information. Do your parents drink alcohol or use tobacco?

As for those wallet cards, everyone should have one. You should have one for yourself, each of your children and your parents. Each card should have the necessary information for emergency contacts and emergency treatment. The cards should be to duplicate and revise. 

I&apos;ve done a mock-up of what a wallet card should look like. I did it in Microsoft Word. First, I made rectangles the size of a business card. Then I put in the necessary information in small type. I used two rectangles for the front and back. It fits nicely behind my driver&apos;s license. Click on the image for a larger view.

 

The virtue of making such a template is that you can have all the necessary information on one page for yourself and your loved ones, you can easily make revisions, you can print out as many copies as you need.

It&apos;s a good idea to double check the information at least twice a year. I suggest spring and fall when the time changes, the same time you check on the batteries for your smoke detectors. Both wallet cards and smoke detectors can save lives.

Hospital Infections

About two million patients in U.S. hospitals may develop infections that may lead to nearly 90,000 deaths each year - a toll greater than those that die from breast cancer or car crashes according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as reported in today&apos;s Wall St Journal by Rhona Rundle (link requires subscription). 

That&apos;s a lot of may&apos;s but it&apos;s only an estimate because of the complexities involved in determining where infections start or how to count them. The American Journal of Infection Control said, after a 2002 study, that hospital-acquired infections add about $5 billion a year to the cost of health care in the U.S.

There&apos;s a momentum building for hospitals to compile and publish their infection rates and laws have passed in Missouri, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Florida. One man Raymond Wagner Jr is leading this crusade because his 13-year-old son was taken to the hospital for a shattered elbow after a sledding accident. That operation went fine, but the poor little boy had to have six more operations to treat a serious infection that developed in the hospital.

 One thing you can do right now to reduce the risk of hospital infections is to insist that the health care professional treating your loved ones wash their hands. Studies have shown that only about half do so.

Fidget more, lose weight

A nervous fidgeter uses an extra 350 calories a day than a calm, placid person. If you&apos;re one of those, learn to fidget and you could lose 10-30 pounds a year without going to the gym.

Obese people are tremendously efficient and don&apos;t waste energy. Time to learn how to waste energy by fidgeting, standing up instead of sitting down, pacing around a room, jumping up to answer the phone or stretch - all of these small, mundane physical activities add up.
That&apos;s what James Levine of the Mayo Clinic said and he led the research study.  He&apos;s quoted in the New York Times as saying:
 Some may say this is a story of doom and gloom -- that people with obesity have no choice. It&apos;s all over. I would argue exactly the opposite,&quot; Levine said. &quot;There&apos;s a massive beacon of hope here. But it&apos;s going to take a massive, top-down approach to change the environment in which we live to get us up and be lean again.&quot;
Other researchers agreed, saying the new study, while small, provides powerful new evidence that a major cause of the obesity epidemic is the pattern of desk jobs, car pools, suburban sprawl, and other environmental and lifestyle factors that discourage physical activity. And despite generations of parents&apos; admonitions to the contrary, people should be encouraged to be fidgety.

Cascading towards Alzheimer&apos;s

For some reason, people seem to be more afraid of dementia then heart disease. Apparently, losing one&apos;s mind is more like a living death than dealing with heart disease.

Well, it turns out that taking care of your heart will lessen the chances of dementia. Big time. 

Don&apos;t wait. Do it now.

The biggest cardio risk factors if you are middle-aged are:

 high cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes smoking 

Each of these cardiovascular risk factors were associated with a 20% to 40% increased risk according to a report in the January 25 issue of Neurology.  The researchers collected data on 8845 men and women aged 40 to 44 from 1964 to 1973, then looked at their medical records from January 1994 to April 2003. 

The study author Rachel Whitmer said that each of the cardiovascular risk factors were predictive.
 When they looked at a combination of the risk factors , they found the risk for dementia increased from 27 percent for one risk factor to 237 percent for having all four risk factors, compared with having no risk factors.

Dr. Samuel Gandy, vice chairman of the National Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the Alzheimer&apos;s Association said
 We know that Alzheimer&apos;s begins at least 10 or more years before the first clinical signs are evident. It is possible that setting that cascade in motion in midlife may be like a runaway train. It may be difficult to get it back on the track. Posted by Jill Fallon at 11:13 PM | Permalink 
Doctors Report

The stories below are apparently true yet I don&apos;t know their origin. If you do, let me know, so I can properly credit whoever put together this hilarious compilation of medical anecdotes.
 A man comes into the ER and yells,  &quot;My wife&apos;s going to have her baby in the cab!&quot;  I grabbed my stuff, rushed out to the cab, lifted the lady&apos;s dress, and began to take off her underwear.  Suddenly I noticed that there were several cabs, and I was in the wrong one.   -- Dr. Mark MacDonald, San Antonio, TX    At the beginning of my shift I placed a stethoscope on an elderly and slightly deaf female patient&apos;s anterior chest wall.  Big breaths,&quot; I instructed.  Yes, they used to be,&quot; remorsefully replied the patient .   --Dr. Richard Byrnes, Seattle, WA    One day I had to be the bearer of bad news when I told a wife that her husband had died of a massive myocardial infarct. Not more than five minutes later, I heard her reporting to the rest of the family that he had died of a &quot;massive internal fart.&quot;    --Dr. Susan Steinberg, Manitoba, Canada    I was performing a complete physical, including the visual acuity test. I placed the patient twenty feet from the chart and began, &quot;Cover your right eye with your hand.&quot; He read the 20/20 line perfectly.  Now your left.&quot; Again, a flawless read.  Now both,&quot; I requested. There was silence. He couldn&apos;t even read the large E on the top line. I turned and discovered that he had done exactly what I had asked; he was standing there with both his eyes covered. I was laughing too hard to finish the exam.   -- Dr. Matthew Theodropolous, Worcester, MA  
 During a patient&apos;s two week follow-up appointment with his cardiologist, he informed me, his doctor, that he was having trouble with one of his medications.  &quot;Which one?&quot; I asked.  &quot;The patch.  The nurse told me to put on a new one every six hours and now I&apos;m running out of places to put it!&quot;  I had him quickly undress and discovered what I hoped I wouldn&apos;t see. Yes, the man had over fifty patches on his body! Now the instructions include removal of the old patch before applying a new one.    -- Dr. Rebecca St. Clair, Norfolk, VA      While acquainting myself witha new elderly patient, I asked, &quot;How long have you been bed-ridden?&quot; After a look of complete confusion she answered .  Why, not for about twenty years -- when my husband was alive.&quot;    --Dr. Steven Swanson, Corvallis, OR I was caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, So, how&apos;s your breakfast this morning?&quot;  It&apos;s very good, except for the Kentucky Jelly. I can&apos;t seem to get used to the taste,&quot; the patient replied  I then asked to see the jelly and the woman produced a foil packet labeled &quot;KY Jelly.&quot;   --Dr. Leonard Kransdorf, Detroit, MI    And finally. A new, young MD doing his residency in OB was quite embarrassed performing female pelvic exams.  To cover his embarrassment he had unconsciously formed a habit of whistling softly.  The middle aged lady upon whom he was performing this exam suddenly burst out laughing and further embarrassed him.  He looked up from his work and sheepishly said, &quot;I&apos;m sorry. Was I tickling you?&quot;   She replied, &quot;No doctor, but the song you were whistling was &apos;I wish I was an Oscar Meyer Wiener.&quot;  --won&apos;t admit his name Posted by Jill Fallon at 8:50 PM | Permalink

Time to Ride?

 &quot;Enough Dreaming. It&apos;s Time to Ride.&quot; Are you an aging boomer with an unsatisfied lust to take to the open road on your Harley? Well, slow down. The over 40 motorcycle deaths have tripled in the past decade to 1674 in 2003 at the same time deaths of riders under 30 have dropped slightly to 1161.  Safety experts suspect older motorcycle riders with a lot of money to spend are buying more and more powerful machines than their aging bodies can handle.
 &quot;It&apos;s really kind of astonishing. The ages of these fatalities are so high. You would think it would be all of the young kids on those fast bikes, but it&apos;s not,&quot; said Carl Hallman, highway safety coordinator with the Maine Department of Public Safety.

Screening for Distress/ I will survive

One problem that doctors often overlook when treating patients with cancer is the anxiety and depression patients feel.  While distress at a diagnosis of cancer is normal, certain types of distress or undue distress can interfere with treatment. 

As Amy Marcus writes in the Wall St Journal 
 Patients may find it difficult to even get out of bed, much less attend appointments and chemotherapy sessions. Some distraught patients avoid acknowledging their disease and cancel appointments. And distress can cause sleeplessness and confusion that may result in failure to take their medication properly, potentially lowering their chances of a cure. 
The American Cancer Society along with 19 major cancer centers have released guidelines for evaluating a patient&apos;s sense of distress with a simple, rapid screening test.   The guidelines are free and can be found at the National Comprehensive Cancer Network . They are designed to be self-administered, helping patients and their families help themselves.

According to the NCCN, red flags for undue distress include 

 Excessive worries Fear Sadness Confused thinking Despair or loss of hope, Severe family problems (marriage crisis; child having problems in school) Spiritual crisis (loss of faith, feeling life has no meaning) Severe financial problems 

Those who score highly are urged to consider seeing a counselor, joining a support group, trying meditation, exploring spiritual beliefs, keeping a journal, or creating a support group of family and friends. To see how blogs can help create that support network, check out Sandee&apos;s blog Day Without Rain. 

Sandee who has breast cancer writes so well and movingly about her battle that she was a finalist in the Best of Blogs for 2004. Here&apos;s a sample :
 Cancer continues to be such a wild ride,  When they said the word“cancer&quot; back in 1998, within one second, the next word in my head was”death”, the life I knew was instantly gone&amp;where I had a future, I now had a question mark.&quot; So many emotions…I felt like my body failed me because I had cancer. I tried to remove myself from everyone that I loved, because I figured if I did that, I wouldn&apos;t hurt anyone. I was wrong! Cancer has thought me so much ...
 I&apos;ve learned that. ..
 ~If I didn&apos;t have the friends&amp;family I have, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to get through the treatment. ~I need to trust people especially my doctors.
 ~Priorities get crystal clean, you don&apos;t sweat the small stuff&amp;everything is small stuff compared to cancer.
 ~I was able to find hope and strength in the worst of times.
 ~Beauty is in the simplest things.
 ~I came out of it a different person -- stronger, better&amp;not bitter.
 ~Love is what gets you through
 …And I keep learning every single second of the day! So I guess having cancer has changed me for the better, I wish I could have changed a different way, but I&apos;ll take this way if necessary. Cancer is a disease of LIFE, not just a disease of the body. And though others want you back to normal, normal is different now. It’s not about being strong; it’s about being grateful for every second. My only wish is that I am a glimmer of hope to all those that think that cancer means“death”it doesn’t!

What if your medical history is wrong

If you apply for certain kinds of life and health insurance, you most likely have given the insurers permission to send their personal info to a central clearinghouse where other insurers can access it. If you have had cancer treatments or chronic conditions or are a risky driver or skydiver, your info may be in this database and likely to stay there for at least 7 years.

Thanks to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, you can get a free copy of your report once a year if you call 866-692-6901. Some 9000 people saw their records last year and 300-400 of them found errors.

Medical blogs on cancer and diabetes

Two new medical blogs have come to my attention.  The cancer blog covers cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

There I found about that MedicAlert the manufacturer of medical alert bracelets and tags just announced they will sell a USB device with medical information that can contain far more detailed medical information even a complete and organized medical history and images of ECGs at a price of $50-$75.

 The diabetes blog covers diabetes testing, treatment and prevention. Written by Paul Chaney whose wife has diabetes, its other focus is to provide educational resources for people with diabetes and those that care for them. He&apos;s now soliciting stories from those afflicted or concerned with diabetes to share their experiences to help others.

A wonderful way to become more involved and be supported by helping others.

Curry cures Alzheimer&apos;s?

 India has one of the lowest rate of Alzheimer&apos;s in the world. Now scientists think it&apos;s the curry.
 

 
 Curcumin, the yellow pigment in curry spice may be a potential agent to fight against Alzheimer&apos;s, according to researchers at the University of California at Irvine.

The new UCLA-Veterans Affairs study involving genetically altered mice suggests that curcumin, the yellow pigment in curry spice, inhibits the accumulation of destructive beta amyloids in the brains of Alzheimer&apos;s patients and also breaks up existing plaques. 

The research team also determined curcumin is more effective in inhibiting formation of the protein fragments than many other drugs being tested as Alzheimer&apos;s treatments. 

&quot;Curcumin has been used for thousands of years as a safe anti-inflammatory in a variety of ailments as part of Indian traditional medicine,&quot; Gregory Cole, Professor of medicine and neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA said.

The Protein You Don&apos;t Want

When you lose someone you love to melanoma, any sign that this cancer can be beaten is good news. Scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute  in Boston have discovered a protein that plays a critical role in the growth of that terrible deadly skin cancer. Normal cells don&apos;t need the protein CDK2, but malignant melanoma can&apos;t grow without a steady supply.

Early research showed that suppressing the activity of the CDK2 gene which produces CDK2 protein significantly slowed the growth and spread of melanoma cells.  About Melanoma from the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Physicians&apos; Views of Faith, Prayer and Miracles

I found this survey quite astonishing. Holiday Season Survey Reveals Physicians&apos; Views of Faith, Prayer and Miracles. 

 A majority of doctors (55%) said they have seen treatment results in their patients they would consider miraculous. Most physicians pray for their patients as a group (51%). Even more, 59% pray for individual patients. 67% encourage their patients to pray

Healthy Heart, Healthy Brain and Improved Memory

Another reason to pump up your heart. Improving cardiovascular health may slow dementia according to a review published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

I never heard of mixed dementia before - a combination of Alzheimer&apos;s disease and a gradual cognitive decline caused by ministrokes or vascular dementia. But the study authors Doctors Eric Larson and Ken Langa at the University of Michigan say that the distinctions among them aren&apos;t as important as &quot;pushing cardiovascular treatments that could prevent or slow down memory loss and confusion.&quot;

I seem to be focusing a lot on the heart lately. I believe our hearts are the center of our well-being. Anything that improves our hearts from physical exercise to spiritual exercises like meditation and prayer to emotional healing and ever greater expressions of love enlarges, deepens and lengthens our lives.

&quot;The pressure of meeting a work deadline can produce a sixfold increase in the risk of suffering a heart attack over the course of the following day. And competition at work could double the ongoing risk, according to a new study.
Previous research has shown that intense anger, sexual activity and emotional stress can all lead to heart attacks. But this is the first time having an intense work deadline has been singled out as a trigger for heart attack over such a short timescale.
The study questioned nearly 1400 heart attack survivors from the Stockholm area, aged 45 to 70, about the period leading up to their first heart attack. They were compared with a control group of about 1700 people who had not had a heart attack.
 
Maybe it&apos;s time to consider something Worthwhile - work with joy and meaning. Maybe it&apos;s time to embark on a new Occupational Adventure. If fear of the unknown is holding you back, ask yourself if you are creating Hard times that will never happen. Better a leap into the unknown than a heart attack.

The Sound of Your Cells

Your body has about 10 trillion cells, each of them busy growing, reproducing and dying. Just how each of them know what they are supposed to do is an awesome mystery to me.
Now I was never very good at high school science so I accept what scientists say about How Cells Work. 
&quot;At the most basic level, a cell is really a little bag full of chemical reactions that are made possible by enzymes. Enzymes are made from amino acids, and they are proteins. When an enzyme is formed, it is made by stringing together between 100 and 1,000 amino acids in a very specific and unique order. The chain of amino acids then folds into a unique shape. That shape allows the enzyme to carry out specific chemical reactions -- an enzyme acts as a very efficient catalyst for a specific chemical reaction. The enzyme speeds that reaction up tremendously.&quot;
 As I said it&apos;s a awesome mystery to me. But I can accept easily the idea that cells make sounds since I&apos;ve listened to Molecular Music. 

Dr. Linda Long is an award winning biochemist and musician who has translated the three dimensional positions of a protein&apos;s amino acids into note sequences. This sonic way of describing protein structures is another way of perceiving and recognizing patterns in very complex structures. On her site, you can hear MP-3s of medicinal plants like pokeweed, mustard and and parsley in a collection called &quot;Music of the Plants&quot; or you can listen to MP-3 clips of note sequences derived from protein hormones in &quot;Music of the Body&quot; and hear the calcium chimes or the voice of metabolism. What I can&apos;t describe is how wondrously lovely and soothing the music is. It&apos;s unlike anything you&apos;ve ever heard, yet it&apos;s still very appealing. She is now marketing CDs of her music.

For her work, Dr. Long has been awarded an Invention and Innovation award by NESTA, the UK&apos;s National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. She says,
 
It’s about viewing science from a different perspective, so that people who may not be able to look at scientific data in an analytical way can still connect with it and get something from it.
 Because I can easily grasp the idea of the cells of the body working together in a wondrous symphony, I can understand this story in the New York Times, Listening for Cancer by Clive Thompson. 
Three years ago, the nanotechnology expert James Gimzewski realized something startling about human cells: since they have many tiny moving parts, they might be producing tiny vibrations. And since all vibrations produce noise, it would be theoretically possible to listen to the sound of a cell. Gimzewski set about adapting an extremely small device to measure these vibrations and then with another device proceeded to amplify them loud enough for human ears. He discovered that a yeast cell produced about 1,000 vibrations a second. When he amplified the signal, a musical hum filled the room. &apos;&apos;It wasn&apos;t at all what I expected,&apos;&apos; he recalls. &apos;&apos;It sounded beautiful.&apos;&apos;

Beautiful, and also potentially revolutionary. Gimzewski says that his technique could become a unique tool in the war against cancer: to figure out if a cell is malignant, doctors could simply listen to it.

When a cell turns cancerous, its internal machinery alters: it might divide more rapidly, and its walls could take a new shape. Those changes, Gimzewski surmises, would produce distinctive rates of vibration and thus distinctive noises. He has already measured the acoustics of some cells going through death cycles. When he measured an inert yeast cell, its lack of movement produced a dead-sounding hiss. And when he immersed a bunch of yeast in alcohol, the cells emitted a creepy &apos;&apos;screaming&apos;&apos; sound as they suddenly perished. Even minute changes -- like getting warmer -- make the cells sing differently. Gimzewski calls his technique sonocytology, and in August he published the first paper on this field in the journal Science.

Impressive results with worms

I don&apos;t know about you but this sounds kind a creepy - Parasitic worm hope for Chron&apos;s Then again, I don&apos;t suffer from the type of agonizing attacks Chrohn suffers do, during which, they will try anything if it promises relief. 
Parasitic worms may be an effective treatment for the inflammatory bowel disorder Crohn&apos;s disease, research in the US suggests.
University of Iowa team found most of 29 Crohn&apos;s patients who swallowed a type of parasitic worm over a 24-week period showed an improvement.
It is thought that helminths, such as roundworms and threadworms, may prevent Crohn&apos;s in the developing world.
The research is published in the journal Gut.
 
Don&apos;t you love it when the BBC is quoting the prestigious research journal, Gut.

The Nose Knows

 Ten scents prove to be the best predictors for Alzheimer&apos;s Disease which affects 4.5 million Americans and worries many more. They are strawberry, smoke, soap, menthol, clove, pineapple, natural gas, lilac, lemon and leather. 
People with mild cognitive impairment who cannot identify these scents will develop Alzheimer&apos;s disease, according to research from the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.
    Based at Vanderbilt University, the 700-member research group released the findings yesterday during an annual meeting.
    The &quot;10-smell test,&quot; which takes only a few minutes, is as accurate a predictor for the disease as a more complex memory test or an expensive magnetic resonance imaging that measures brain volume, researchers say.
    &quot;Early diagnosis of Alzheimer&apos;s disease is critical for patients and their families to receive the most beneficial treatment and medications,&quot; said study author Dr. D.P. Devanand, professor of psychology and neurology at Columbia University and director of the Memory Disorders Center at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.

From tooth fairy to stem cell bank

In an earlier post, I wrote about baby teeth as a source of stem cells. Here&apos;s a report on baby teeth from the Australian Stem Cell Conference in October
 
&quot;Parents will want to store the stem cells found in the pulp inside these juvenile teeth in liquid nitrogen&quot; says Dr Stan Gronthos, a haematologist at the Hanson Institute in Adelaide, South Australia. &quot;That way they could be used to grow new teeth and perhaps even cure neurological disorders like Parkinson&apos;s disease.&quot;

He predicts they will become effective for growing replacement brain tissue to overcome stroke damage as well as basal cell degradation linked with Parkinson&apos;s.

Grades for Doctors and Hospitals

A not-to-be missed article in the New Yorker by Atul Gawade, The Bell Curve . He asks the question &quot;what happens when patients find out how good their doctors really are&quot; and then examines it in best New Yorker detail by focusing in on the patients and doctors dealing with cystic fibrosis in Cincinnati and Minneapolis. At the same time, he discusses Don Berwick at the Boston Insisture for Healthcare Improvement and his drive to bring transparency to our health care system, which means grades and so a Bell Curve.

 
In December, 1999, at a health-care conference, Berwick gave a forty-minute speech distilling his ideas about the failings of American health care. Five years on, people are still talking about the speech. The video of it circulated like samizdat. (That was how I saw it: on a grainy, overplayed tape, about a year later.) A booklet with the transcript was sent to thousands of doctors around the country. Berwick is middle-aged, soft-spoken, and unprepossessing, and he knows how to use his apparent ordinariness to his advantage. He began his speech with a gripping story about a 1949 Montana forest fire that engulfed a parachute brigade of firefighters. Panicking, they ran, trying to make it up a seventy-six-per-cent grade and over a crest to safety. But their commander, a man named Wag Dodge, saw that it wasn’t going to work. So he stopped, took out some matches, and set the tall dry grass ahead of him on fire. The new blaze caught and rapidly spread up the slope. He stepped into the middle of the burned-out area it left behind, lay down, and called out to his crew to join him. He had invented what came to be called an“escape fire,”and it later became a standard part of Forest Service fire training. His men, however, either thought he was crazy or never heard his calls, and they ran past him. All but two were caught by the inferno and perished. Inside his escape fire, Dodge survived virtually unharmed.

As Berwick explained, the organization had unravelled. The men had lost their ability to think coherently, to act together, to recognize that a lifesaving idea might be possible. This is what happens to all flawed organizations in a disaster, and, he argued, that’s what is happening in modern health care. To fix medicine, Berwick maintained, we need to do two things: measure ourselves and be more open about what we are doing. This meant routinely comparing the performance of doctors and hospitals, looking at everything from complication rates to how often a drug ordered for a patient is delivered correctly and on time. And, he insisted, hospitals should give patients total access to the information.“‘No secrets’is the new rule in my escape fire,”he said. He argued that openness would drive improvement, if simply through embarrassment. It would make it clear that the well-being and convenience of patients, not doctors, were paramount. It would also serve a fundamental moral good, because people should be able to learn about anything that affects their lives.
 

UPDATE: James Frederick Dwight is quite skeptical about this article. He argues that Dr. Gawande&apos;s study is sloppy because he never accounts for the disparity in the patient population. There are about 30,000 Cystic Fibrosis patients and 1000 variations of the disease. 
Regrettably, Dr. Gawande’s article is at best logically weak, at worst perhaps recklessly irresponsible. By handling the data he received from the CF community in a flawed manner, there exists the possibility that Dr. Gawande has done that community a grave and unwarranted disservice. There is a real chance this article will profoundly harm people who don’t currently want for hardships

What is the Shape of the Water Within You

When we were children we learned the impossible fact that no snowflake is alike. What no one thought to do before Masuru Emoto was to freeze water crystals in different conditions, then photograph its crystalline structure. Not a traditional scientist, his college degree from Yokohama University is in International Relations and his graduate degree is in alternative medicine, he began his water research as an original thinker.

What is so startling about his water crystal photographs is that the crystals change depending upon the thoughts, intentions and prayers of the people viewing the water. They appear to show that thoughts and feelings affect physical reality. Since the earth is 70% water and so are we, this has earth-changing implications especially if his work is replicated in more traditional universities. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle formulated by the German scientist Werner Heisenberg states that in the world of subatomic particles, the very act of observing alters the reality being observed. Could Emoto&apos;s photographs be proof that the energy of our thoughts and intentions can alter the molecular structure of water? If so, the implications for our personal health and our environment are extraordinary.

Take a look at these examples. The first comes from a very clear spring in Japan, the second is from the Fujiwara Dam, before offering a prayer, and the third is from Fujiwara Dam, after offering a prayer. Click on any image for a larger view.
 
 
 

I first saw these images in a lecture some two years ago and was so struck by them that I tried to buy the self-published book in Japanese but was unsuccessful. Today, these images are more wide-spread since being featured in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know. You can read more at Masuru Emoto&apos;s website, or in this magazine interview More Messages in Water, or buy the book, The Hidden Messages in Water at Amazon which I have ordered in English.

Confirmation that Stress Speeds Aging

No one who looks at photos of US presidents as they enter office and as they leave can deny that presidents age a great deal during their terms of office. We &quot;know&quot; that the stress of caring of a chronically ill child or loved one can prematurely age the care-giver. Now, scientists have confirmed that stress speeds aging. 
 
Chronic stress appears to hasten the shriveling of the tips of the bundles of genes inside cells, which shortens their life span and speeds the body&apos;s deterioration, according to a small, first-of-its-kind study involving mothers caring for chronically ill children.

If the findings are confirmed, they could provide the first explanation on a cellular level for the well-documented association between psychological stress and increased risk of physical disease, as well as the common perception that unrelenting emotional pressure accelerates the aging process....&quot;This is a real landmark observation,&quot; said Robert M. Sapolsky of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary accompanying the paper in today&apos;s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. &quot;This is a huge interdisciplinary leap . . . a great study.&quot;
 
 Dr Elizabeth Blackburn and Dr. Elissa Epel headed a research project on aging that focused on a piece of DNA, called the telomere. Next they plan to test the effect of meditation, mindfulness training and yoga on both perceived stress and telomere length.

Those old wives tales that told of a severe emotional stress turning a person&apos;s hair grey overnight seem to have a scientific basis.

Inactivity Deadlier Than Smoking

Researchers, looking at records of Hong Kong residents 35 and older who died in 1998, found that a lack of physical activity caused more than 6,400 deaths a year, compared with just over 5,700 from smoking, according to Agence France Presse, citing a report in the South China Morning Post.

The research was done by the University of Hong Kong and the Department of Health. &quot;We calculated that about 20 percent of all deaths in Hong Kong people aged 35 and above could be attributed to a lack of physical activity. This amounted to 6,450 deaths,&quot; the Post quoted Lam Tai-Hing, head of the university&apos;s department of community medicine, as saying. Lam added, &quot;It is fine if you do not smoke. But if you do not exercise, then you are [still] at high risk.&quot;

Using Cancer To Live More Richly

If you know of anyone with prostate cancer, let them know of the Monument Park of other men who fought the cancer and won.

Many met the challenge to live more richly like Fernando Barrueta 
The cancer got him to change his life -- he left a 30 year career in commercial real estate to go to the Hispanic College Fund. He realized that he wanted to do something meaningful, and that time was getting short. He is very happy now, enjoying life to the fullest extent while working very hard, watching his terminally cute grandchildren grow, and playing a lot of soccer

Keeping Faith, Dog Phones 911

If you&apos;re wheelchair bound, consider how a service dog just might save your life. Faith, a Washington State Rottweiler, phoned 911 after her owner fell out of a wheelchair.
 
Faith is trained to summon help by pushing a speed-dial button on the phone with her nose after taking the receiver off the hook, said her owner Leana Beasley, 45, who suffers grand mal seizures.....The dog, whose sensitive nose can detect changes in Beasley&apos;s body chemistry, is trained to alert her owner to impending seizures before they happen.......Faith the service dog phoned 911 when her owner fell out of her wheelchair and barked urgently into the receiver until a dispatcher sent help. Then the 4-year-old Rottweiler unlocked the front door so the responding police officer could come in.

Outsourcing Heart Surgery and the Taj Mahal

It is often said that the lack of market forces in our health care system contributes to its high cost.
An article in today&apos;s Washington Post reveals a significant competitive and disruptive advantage that certain third world countries offered, Surgeries, Side Trips for &apos;Medical Tourists&apos;. Faced with a $100,000 price tag for needed heart surgery, a carpenter from North Carolina with no health insurance chose to outsource his operation.

 
Taking his cue from cost-cutting U.S. businesses, Staab last month flew about 7,500 miles to the Indian capital, where doctors at the Escorts Heart Institute&amp;Research Centre -- a sleek aluminum-colored building across the street from a bicycle-rickshaw stand -- replaced his balky heart valve with one harvested from a pig. Total bill: about $10,000, including round-trip airfare and a planned side trip to the Taj Mahal.....

India offers a growing number of private &quot;centers of excellence&quot; where the quality of care is as good or better than that of big-city hospitals in the United States or Europe, asserted Naresh Trehan, a self-assured cardiovascular surgeon who runs Escorts and performed the operation on Staab.

Trehan said, for example, that the death rate for coronary bypass patients at Escorts is 0.8 percent. By contrast, the 1999 death rate for the same procedure at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where former president Bill Clinton recently underwent bypass surgery, was 2.35 percent, according to a 2002 study by the New York State Health Department.
 

Hmm, wonder what aging boomers would prefer? Especially for operations that might not be covered by insurance. Such as plastic surgery in Brazil and a trip to the Rain Forest, tummy tucks in South Africa and a safari for a tenth the cost.

The Ultimate Genomic Test is a Family History

&quot;Family history may be the single greatest risk factor for disease,&quot; says Dr.Paula Yoon of the Centers for Disease Control. I learned about the CDC&apos;s Family Health Initiative is encouraging consumers to complete a family history and leave a copy with your physician in the cover story, Treatment Tailor-Made For You by Dianne Hales in the September 19th edition of Parade Magazine.

Ironically, what seems old-fashioned, a family history has become even more important in these days of personalized medicine and genomics. &quot;The ultimate genomic test is available now and it&apos;s called a family history. It captures not only shared genes but also shared environment, shared values, shared behavior and shared culture,&quot; says Dr Muin Khoury, director of the Office of Genomics and Disease Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If your family history reveals family susceptibilities to particular diseases a doctor can run specific tests and customize your treatment. If you learned say that a relative has colon cancer, you should start screening for colon cancer 10 years before the norm. By charting your family history, you can set priorities based on your personal health risks.

A family history is something only you can do. It used to be that we would learn how people in the family died or got sick when families would get together over Sunday dinner or for holidays. Nowadays, families are much more dispersed and, unless there is a reason, not many people remember what their grandparents died of. Which is why constructing and memorializing a family history can enable you with your doctor. Thanksgiving could be a good time to create your family history because you&apos;ll be seeing or talking to most of your relatives.

Get the info first.
Information on the CDC&apos;s Family History Initiative is here. 
To create a family history, go to the Mayo Clinic and search for &quot;family history&quot;

One more quote from the article in reference to the power of personalized medicine through genomics,“This is a new era in medicine,”says Dr. Ralph Snyderman of Duke University, which launched a personalized health-care program for its employees last January.“People think that genomics will have an impact in their children’s lifetime, but it is happening now. I urge them to rush to take advantage of it for the sake of living longer, healthier lives.”

More Health Plans Embrace Alternative Medicine

The Wall St Journal (subscription only) today in In Health Plans Embrace Alternatives reports that more employers are offering coverage for alternative care
 About 47% of employees with health benefits had acupuncture coverage in 2004, up from 33% in 2002, according to a 3,000-employer survey released earlier this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust. Chiropractic coverage increased to 87% from 79% of workers with health benefits, the survey showed....
Still, the increases in coverage for acupuncture and chiropractic care are part of a trend over the past decade in which alternative medicine has gone more mainstream while more employers have come to see the option as, at the least, a relatively low-cost addition to benefits packages....
&quot;There are some employers out there who are saying, &apos;No new benefits of any type,&apos; &quot; says George DeVries, chief executive of American Specialty Health Plans Inc., which offers alternative coverage that is added to traditional insurance policies. &quot;But there are many employers who are saying, &apos;Adding a low-cost [benefit] actually helps us in a time when we&apos;re increasing deductibles and co-pays and coinsurance.&apos;

The Pharmacist who says no to Drugs

Does your doctor or your parents&apos; doctor understand the interactions of prescribed drugs better than a consulting pharmacist?

Armon Neel believes that most patients in long term care facilities are over-medicated and he&apos;s on a crusade against it. Neel is one of a few thousand consultant pharmacists nationwide who specialize in &quot;identifying, resolving and preventing medication-related problems that affect and afflict older people. &quot; Go to The American Society of Consultant Pharmacists for information and a list of the 10 most dangerous drug interactions in long-term care.

Neel says the problem is that few doctors who treat the patients in long-term facilities have a specialty in geriatrics. &quot;They&apos;re not up to date with the physiology of the geriatric patients as it relates to the chemistry of the drug. That&apos;s the easiest way to put it,&quot; says Neel in an interview with AARP Bulletin.

Save those Fat Cells

A flamboyant Texas plastic surgeon now encourages every patient to store liposuctioned fact so that adult stem cells can be retrieved for potential medical use. Dr. Robert Ersek also believes that to educate you first have to entertain, will do a quick liposuction on himself to make his point. 

 
Stem cells derived from fatty tissue have shown potential to repair damaged bone and cartilage, said Dr. Gordon Keller, a professor of gene and cell medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. They also are showing promise in research trials as a therapy for damaged nerves and muscles, including the heart
 
This is the ultimate recycling says Elizabeth Scarbrough, vice president of marketing and development at MacroPore Biosurgery Inc., of San Diego, the company that will store Ersek&apos;s stem cells and those of any patients who choose to do so. MacroPore charges $600 to $1,675, depending on how long the cells are to be stored, Scarbrough said. Those spending the least get processing only and would pay another $175 a year to store their stem cells in a liquid nitrogen freezer. The high-end buyers get 10 years of storage and pay $100 a year thereafter, she said. If the cells are never used, patients can donate them for research.

Integral Medicine - the view from 50,000 feet

&quot;Integral medicine promotes an approach using the best in modern healthcare, while equally recognizing the emotional, spiritual&amp;relational dimensions essential in the cultivation of wellness.&quot;
 —Marilyn Schlitz

 Noetic Sciences are explorations into the nature and potentials of consciousness using multiple ways of knowing—including intuition, feeling, reason, and the senses. Noetic sciences explore the &quot;inner cosmos&quot; of the mind (consciousness, soul, spirit) and how it relates to the &quot;outer cosmos&quot; of the physical world. The current issue of its publication Shift: at the Frontiers of Consciousness from the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) features Integral Health and Healing.

In the fall, IONS will be publishing &quot;Consciousness and Healing&quot; with contributions from Contributions by: Larry Dossey, Roger Walsh, Michael Murphy, Ivan Illich, Eugene Taylor, Lawrence LeShan, Caroline Myss, Rachel Naomi Remen, Arthur Deikman, Deepak Chopra, Stanley Krippner, Kenneth Pelletier, Bernie Siegel, Candace Pert, Joan Borysenko, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jack Kornfield, Dean Ornish, Fred Luskin, George Leonard, Richard Tarnas, William Braud, Rupert Sheldrake, Elisabeth Targ, Dean Radin, Stanislav Grof, Kenneth Ring, Willis Harman, Charles Tart, Elizabeth Sahtouris, Thomas Berry, Christian de Quincey, David Ray Griffin, Theodore Roszak, Brian Swimme, Ralph Metzner, Duane Elgin, Erwin Laszlo, and others.

From the introduction by Ken Wilber 
Wilber, one of my favorite thinkers, also has a summary of his integral all quadrants theory at the end.

 The integral medicine that is rapidly developing today has moved significantly beyond early attempts in this area, variously known as &quot;holistic,&quot; &quot;allopathic,&quot; &quot;alternative,&quot; and &quot;complementary.&quot; Although some of the components of those pioneering efforts are retained, integral medicine is being launched from a platform much wider in its reach, more grounded in empirical research, and more effectively related to comprehensive models of human psychology and consciousness. But it is helpful to remember that an integral medicine differs in significant ways from both conventional and complementary medicine, while attempting to include the enduring and effective elements of each.
Beginning in earnest a decade or two ago, there was an explosion of hard empirical research showing that positively enlisting various emotional factors—on the part of the heath-care practitioner as well as the patient—had a profoundly affirmative effect on the treatment, in many cases not only reducing recovery time but medical costs as well. Nor was this a case of &quot;needy&quot; patients doing better if somebody held their hands. Controlled studies consistently showed that, if certain emotional and affective elements are engaged in the healing process, positive effects tend to be seen across all types of patients. Put bluntly, not becoming emotionally involved in some ways could not only increase medical costs but significantly harm the patient. What&apos;s a poor doctor to do?

Medical schools across the country began eyeing this research warily. The whole thing had too much of a &quot;New-Age&quot; ring to it for most conventional medical practitioners. Trying to introduce these &quot;subjective&quot; factors was the opposite of what modern medicine ought to be doing. Nonetheless, virtually all medical schools were forced to confront this issue when research showed that patients were fleeing orthodox medicine and spending some 2 billion dollars annually on types of healthcare that did not ignore these subjective factors. Over two-thirds of medical schools now have courses in complementary medicine, although the relationship between the two approaches remains as uneasy (and even cynical) as it ever was. Part of integral medicine is an attempt to find a framework that can allow both of those approaches—conventional and complementary—to exist in a framework that embarrasses neither.

Some of the Best and most often overlooked health sites


Tara Parker-Pope in the Wall Street Journal. writes a terrific column called Health Journal about health issues that directly impact on our daily lives. Since nearly one-third of all visits to the Internet are for medical help and news on health issues, her listing of some of the Internet&apos;s best - and overlooked -health sites is particularly valuable. You probably know about WebMd and the Mayo Clinic, but do you know about these?

The first stop in any Internet health search she thinks should be Medline. Sponsored by the National Institute of Health and its National Library of Medicine, the largest medical library in the world, Medline has interactive tutorials on over 165 topics and links to listings of nearly 11,000 clinical trials, privately-funded as well as government-funded.

 Your disease risk is a cool site where you can find out your risk for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Calling itself the source on prevention, the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention has expanded to offer more interactive questionnaires where you can get your personal risk assessment, see how you rate against the average in colorful graphics and get some personalized tips for prevention.

If you&apos;re a parent, Dr Greene may be the next best thing to your own pediatrician, maybe even better.
Recognized as one of the top 25 most influential forces in health care, Dr Greene is on the Clinical Faculty at Stanford University School of Medicine, Founder and CEO of DrGreene.com, and President of Hi-Ethics (Health Internet Ethics), This is a terrific website about Caring for the Next Generation, - easy to navigate with lots of good information, almost daily chats with the doctor, a daily dose of practical advice and a community of parents who trade advice and no ads.

 ACOR is website of the Association of Cancer Online Resources and indispensable for navigating cancer information on the Web. Lots of links and more than 70 online cancer information and support groups which, in my mind, are an example of the Web&apos;s great gifts. You can tap into the vast knowledge of other cancer patients and survivors to get answers to your questions and tips from people who really understand what it&apos;s like.

 HealthWeb a one-stop shop to find noncommercial health Web sites that have been evaluated by medical librarians from university medical schools. Sponsored by the National Library of Medicine, you can find what sites on alternative medicine, dentistry or psychiatry to name a few have passed a good screen.

 Fertility Friend has many useful tools -ovulation calculators and fertility charts and more. No medical advice, but good support groups

Starbucks for Health Food?

A complex beverage with an exquisite aroma when brewed right, coffee is much more than caffeine.
&quot;More and more studies have linked coffee consumption to a number of health benefits, including a reduced risk of diabetes, Parkinson&apos;s disease, gallstones, colon cancer and potentially heart disease&quot; writes Janet Helm in the Chicago Tribune 

 

&quot;Coffee has much more in it than caffeine,&quot; said Dr. Peter Martin, director of the Vanderbilt University&apos;s Institute for Coffee Studies, which conducts medical research on coffee and is funded by a grant from a consortium of coffee-producing countries. &quot;It&apos;s a very complex beverage that contains hundreds of compounds, including many with antioxidant effects.&quot;

Though the tea industry has been touting its antioxidants, turns out coffee may contain even more--specifically polyphenols. One of the most potent antioxidants in coffee is called chlorogenic acid, which is partially responsible for the coffee flavor. Some reports estimate that more than 850 compounds are packed inside the humble bean.

Martin said that the roasting process appears to change the structure of the compounds in coffee--boosting the potential disease-fighting benefits. Martin, who is also a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at Vanderbilt, is looking at the potential use of coffee compounds to treat addiction and depression. Past studies indicate that coffee may help lift moods, reduce anxiety and depression, and even reduce the risk of suicide.

Some of the strongest and latest research may be the connection between coffee drinking and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, a growing health epidemic that is closely linked to the rising rates of obesity.

 

Load up on the sweeteners and whipped cream though and you&apos;re packing on calories that you don&apos;t need.

Diabetes connected to Alzheimer&apos;s?

Diabetics face a 65% increased risk of developing Alzheimer&apos;s, according to a study of 824 Roman Catholic nuns, priests and brothers published in the Archives of Neurology and led by researchers at Chicago&apos;s Rush University Medical Center.

Dr. George King of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston called the research &quot;quite important in light of the fact that diabetes is exploding,&quot; with some 18 million Americans affected and the numbers expected to double by 2050.

A good diet and a consistent exercise program can dramatically delay diabetes and now probably Alzheimer&apos;s for the 10 million Americans at high risk for type 2 diabetes according to the findings of a major clinical trial announced by HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson at the National Institutes of Health

The Cyborgs Among Us

Cyborgs are among us and they are not who you think. Granted there are geeks like Gareth Branwyn, an editor of Boing-Boing , who underwent a total hip replacement to relieve the pain of severe degenerative arthritis and wrote this funny account Borg Like Me 

But the people who have the greatest understanding of their relationship with technical augmentation, who understand and appreciate the miraculous technology some of us have in our bodies are

the severely handicapped and the elderly.

While recuperating, Gareth found many fellow implantees on their second, third or fourth replacement in order to live longer and better. His roommate, a man in his 70s, in for a knee replacement called it a &quot;tune-up before we hit the road&quot; or, in his case a trip around the world with his wife, after a host of medical problems (quadruple bypass, ovarian cancer and arthritis)

Read the comments to see what others say and how Gareth is doing. (He now boasts &apos;that part of me was manufactured by DePuy Industries of Warsaw, Indiana&apos;.)

 Four years later, with the perspective of distance and of living with the successful results, I&apos;m here to tell you, it could have been two or three times more painful, challenging, and intense, and it still would have been worth it.

Ladies Home Journal vs. Runner&apos;s World

Health related magazines, particularly those aimed at men, rate the lowest scores for their accuracy in nutrition writing according to a recent survey by the American Council on Science and Health. Here&apos;s how they ranked:

Here&apos;s how they ranked in terms of factual information, objectivity and sound recommendations:
•Cooking Light
•Parents
•Ladies&apos; Home Journal
•Better Homes and Gardens
•Good Housekeeping
•Consumer Reports
•Reader&apos;s Digest
•Redbook
•Woman&apos;s Day
•Glamour
•Self
•Health
•Runner&apos;s World
•Prevention
•Shape
•Fitness

With Americans turning more than ever to magazines as a source of nutrition information, the survey&apos;s conclusion that most (4/5ths) of today&apos;s consumer magazines are providing their readers with scientifically sound articles about nutrition. Only 1/5th were rated poor and they were aimed at men.

Splendid Omega

Maybe it&apos;s because I used to sell salmon, splendid salmon, that I&apos;ve become a real proponent of omega 3 fatty acids. You don&apos;t have to eat salmon, there&apos;s other fatty fish like mackerel, flaxseed oil you might have on hand, that old stand-by cod-liver oil or you can give in, save time and take fish oil capsules. They&apos;re great for your skin and I think brain functioning, raising HDL (the good cholesterol), promoting heart health, boosting fetal growth and maybe even treating schizophrenia 


Omega 3 fattty acids are essential fatty acids, necessary from conception through pregnancy and infancy and undoubtedly through all of life. Essential because they are fats the body can not manufacture yet are essential for building cell membranes An inadequacy of essential fatty acids is one of the most widespread nutritional deficiencies among modern humans. 

 Dr. Joseph Mercola rates Omega 3 thusly
 The following is a partial list of diseases that may be prevented or ameliorated with omega-3 fatty acids, in descending order of the strength of the available evidence as perceived by this reviewer:
Coronary heart disease and stroke;
Essential fatty acid deficiency in infancy (retinal and brain development);
Autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus and nephropathy);
Crohn disease;
Cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate;
Mild hypertension; and
Rheumatoid arthritis.

Preventing Medical Errors Before you go to the Hospital

Did you know that hospital errors are the eighth leading cause of death in America? As many as 98,000 patients die each year in the more than 5000 US hospitals because of medical errors, according to the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine study in 1999. That&apos;s more than motor vehicle deaths, breast cancer deaths or AIDS.

Later studies by the Commonwealth Fund indicate that one in five Americans report that they or a family member experienced a medical error of some kind, that&apos;s almost 23 million people. Of those, 10 percent reported that they or their family member got sicker and half of those said the medical mistake was very serious. That means about 8 million households reported a medical mistake that was very serious.




Take charge of your own health care. Get the staff on your side. Treat them with respect and get to know their names. Here&apos;s some more tips

These pointers come from Dr.Isidore Rosenfield, Health Editor of
