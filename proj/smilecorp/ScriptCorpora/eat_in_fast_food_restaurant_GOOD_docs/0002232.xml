 Tim Hortons

The country’s largest coffee chain is adding real espresso coffee to its product lineup later this month.

Starting at $2 a cup, Tim Hortons, which has wanted to enter the espresso market for a number of years, says it’s taking a previously premium product and making it more mainstream.

Worth an estimated $1 billion annually, espresso coffee sales are growing faster than regular coffee sales though they still account for a very small percentage of the overall market.

More and more coffee chains are adding espresso to their menus. McDonald’s Restaurants recently launched a line of espresso style coffees under the brand name McCafe.

Long dominated by Starbucks, espresso-based coffees were originally seen as manually prepared, premium-priced drinks that didn’t easily fit the fast-food environment.

Tim Hortons said it wanted to be sure it could introduce an espresso that met its standards for speed of service, quality and value.

“We finally found a solution that delivered all of those pieces,”Tim Hortons chief marketing officer Bill Moir said in an interview. The chain said it will be using automated espresso coffee machines.

The new drinks will begin rolling out in the Ontario market Nov. 14 and eventually be offered in nearly 3,000 Tim Hortons’restaurants across Canada and the U.S. Some of its smaller units may be unable to offer it.

The new espresso-based coffees will include lattes, mocha lattes and cappuccinos.

The retailer will use 100 per cent Arabica beans.

But will Tim Hortons’customers–often portrayed as sensible, hard-working families buy a product associated with Starbucks’urban elite image?

“Our demographics are so broad,”said Moir.“I think what we’ve been able to do here is mainstream this product. Part of the reason people don’t buy them today is simply because they’re quite expensive.”

An espresso-based latte at Starbucks, for example, starts at $3.52 for an 8 ounce cup. In comparison, Tim Hortons is charging just $2 for a 10-ounce espresso based drink.

Tim Hortons has customers who drink both regular coffee and espresso-based coffee, often at different times of the day and on different occasions. Moir added.

While regular coffee sells well in the morning, specialty coffees are more of a mid-afternoon treat, he said.

Canadians bought 1.96 billion cups of hot coffee for the year ending August, 2011, according to The NPD Group, a leading market research firm. Of those, just over 1.7 billion were brewed coffee, while 258 million were espresso-based beverages. Brewed coffee consumption was flat while espresso-based coffee rose 2 percentage points over the previous year.

Tim’s current product offering includes various flavoured cappuccinos, but they’re not based on espresso beans. The fast-food restaurant chain plans to keep both styles of specialty coffee on its menu.

Tim Hortons already dominates the regular coffee market, serving eight out of every 10 cups of coffee sold at quick-service restaurants in Canada.

It also says it sells more specialty coffees than all other quick service restaurants combined in Canada.
