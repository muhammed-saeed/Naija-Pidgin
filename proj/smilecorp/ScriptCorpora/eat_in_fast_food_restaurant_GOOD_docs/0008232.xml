Definitely the best Mexican food in Encinitas.

LOVED me the carnitas taco, enchilada, and refried beans. Four stars to the carne asada plate. Pass on the tamale.

It&apos;s slightly nicer on the inside than Juanitas or Filibertos, but not quite date-night worthy... an order at the front, eat in plastic chairs type of place. It seemed to be  slightly more expensive than Encinitas comparables, but the increase in quality far outweighs the increase in price.

The Nopalito market looks like a great place to get meats and other Mexican food necessities, and bonus points for being (or at least looking) cleaner than El Torito Market on the 101.

This shopping center could really round itself out by adding a down-to-earth, blue-collar Mexican bar. Yes please.

The 4**** rating takes into account that this is a hole in the wall, in a little strip mall....basic basic basic, but very good food, friendly service.

For what it is, a 4 **** rating.  Is it as good as other higher-end places? In some way no, and in other ways much better.

It was as I expected it would be.  The tortillas were authentic, the breakfast burrito I had (at 2 pm) was delicious and fresh made.

I was very happy and would eat here again.
And I would never call this &quot;healthy Mexican food&quot;.....God forbid! It wouldn&apos;t taste as good! :0)

I&apos;m not a fan of Mexican food; however, today I changed my mind. haha! My boyfriend and I was our first time to eat here today and we were amazed with the food. My first time to eat carnitas and&quot; Oh My!&quot; that was the first word came from my mouth after I tasted the food. LOL...It was really good!! From the beans with hot chips, Spanish rice, and the meat were tasteful. I would drive up to this place from South bay if I crave on their food. haha!
The guy who took our order was very nice. Great customer service.

Recommendation: &quot;TO GO&quot;

Now I&apos;m hungry thinking of the food!

That was tasty! I was already well versed on the salsa, Encinitas Crack, but the food, mmmmmm. We had a carnitas dinner plate as well as a Carne asada plate. Very moist, seasoned perfectly, not greasy at all. Yes, it is a hole in the wall, but if you had the local high school in your establishment Mon-Fri @ lunch time, how nice would it remain&amp;for how long? Really? That&apos;s the complaint? Good lord people. I swear, some people use this as a forum to strictly bitch about anything.
The food is very good. The salsa, rocks! Tamales too. The staff, very helpful&amp;polite. No, you will not be sitting in luxury, get over it.

Sorry Yelpers... That&apos;s what makes the world go round...different strokes I guess. Not sure who wrote the reviews, but we were extremely disappointed.  This is a hole in the wall, but that&apos;s ok if the food is good.  Food was poor and tasted like it was full of lard.  If you are into fresh healthy Mexican food, this is not for you.

I&apos;m writing about the market. Their tortilla chips are one of the best that I&apos;ve tried, better than many local taco shops, Rubio&apos;s, chips that you get from grocery stores. Their salsas are delicious as well. And the carne asada in their meat section was very tasty! This is a good place to stop by if you want to make some tacos at home.

I haven&apos;t eaten here.  Hell, the place may be filled with roaches and have a C rating as others have stated.

Hell, I haven&apos;t even BEEN here.

But, a kindly coworker of my man brings us plenty of yums from this joint&apos;s market, which gives it 4 stars from me.

Fantastic homemade tortillas.  Delightfully crunchy tortilla chips.  Delicious smoked salsa and perky, vibrant salsa verde.  Though the guacamole is cut with sour cream (boo!), even it&apos;s tasty.

So, I give them 4 stars.  And really, REALLY want to head here for dinner.

Bottom line: if you want to make your hosts happy, bring &apos;em noms from this joint.  I know it made our dinner party spectacular...

Now this is what Mexican food is suppose to taste like! Granted this place doesn&apos;t beat carnitas (pork) from Rosarito, Mexico; however, it was very close! It was probably the best carnitas I&apos;ve had in San Diego county. I didn&apos;t really like the ambience there so next time I&apos;d get it to go...

Yup this place is pretty ghetto.  Its kinda scary. and a little bit off the beaten path.  However, I&apos;ve had salsa from this place for the last 5 years of my life at almost every family reunion (cousins also live in san diego).

Roasted salsa, green salsa are amazing.  Food is decent.

Super friendly service. Got some chicken tamales to go. Just go home and steam it, and it makes for a good, quick meal. We also had the carne asada fries and fish tacos. They double fry their chips, which I&apos;m not a big fan of, but my boyfriend likes that it&apos;s extra crispy. The fish tacos were really terrible. It tasted like it had been sitting out all day, and since it&apos;s fried fish, it made it extra bad. Stick with what the restaurant&apos;s good at- beef or pork.

Look out for the hours. It closes earlier than you would expect.

Bad me, went here on a full stomach.

Chicken mole, chicken simmered in the mole goodness.  Sooooo tender.  The tortillas that accompany the beans and rice and chicken, I could make a meal of the tortillas dipped in the mole sauce.  And very inexpensive, what more can you ask for?

Every New Year&apos;s Eve my BF and I make a list of 12 must try restaurants to hit by year&apos;s end.  Thank goodness El Nopalito made the list.

C rating rumors had me a little sketched out so was thrilled to be welcomed by an A at the door.

The employee behind the counter oozed with friendliness and helpful recomendations.  We&apos;re thinking he had to be the owner&apos;s son.  If not, he deserves a big fat raise.

I asked him what the best meat dish they had was and he steered me to the Carne Asada plate which came with rice, beans, chips and 3 tortillas for $9.51!  The meat was seasoned to sheer perfection and such a large portion that it was 3 separate meals for me - one heavy dinner and 2 light lunches.  My vegetarian boyfriend opted for the cheese enchildadas and was also very pleased.

Recognizing El Nopalito was known for their salsa, we quizzed the employee about his favorite choice.  He stopped what he was doing, told the next guest in line he&apos;d be right back to take their order and then proceeded to walk us to the salsa bar to direct us to the roasted salsa.  AMAZING and unique!  He then came back with a large basket of complimentary chips for us to enjoy while we waited for our meal.

While this place has zero ambiance, it offers a great value on  authentic, flavorful Mexican food and is definitely worth a place on your list!

For a hole in the wall Mexican joint El Nopalito delivers excellent tasting food.

I would not choose to eat at this location, but take out it could be 5-stars.

I would rank El Nopalito higher than Betsy&apos;s and Juanitas and some of the other &quot;authentic&quot; mexican food spots in Encinitas

Having a little back yard grilling session, here&apos;s a GREAT way to impress your friends, walk into the market (not the restaurant) and buy a couple pounds of the Arracherra (not the asada para preperada), Arracherra is the tender skirt steak (trust me on this people) and buy a stack of corn tortillas along with some guacamole and salsa and BAM! your friends will say these are the BEST tacos I ever ate. It&apos;s a quick and simple way to get your little gathering all pumped up! you&apos;ll look like the chef of the year! ARRACHERRA people...learn it, try it and LOVE IT!

The food is pretty good for a hole in the wall taco shop.
The roasted salsa is AWESOME... and we love going into the store for fresh made chips and tortillas. (you have to get the ones that are hot ;)
It is located in the &quot;rough&quot; part of Encinitas off Sante Fe... but you will be just fine going in and getting a carna asda burrito.

The food here is alright.  The service leaves something to be desired, but it&apos;s as much a culture thing as a indifference.  Why people go here is the fire roasted salsa !  I have friends that come from all over California, and they always make sure they go home with 5or6 quarts of the stuff.  I beggining to think they only come to visit for the salsa.  Yes, it is that good !

the 5 stars is for the chips and salsa.  I still dream about them and try to come up with reasons to drive to Encinitas for more.  I thought the carnitas taco was good, not great.  Same with the Carne Asada burrito.  Bonus points to the nice accommodating employee that was extremely patient with the lame guy asking a million questions about a catering order.  Bonus bonus points to the girl working the counter who had to work extra hard for the 30+ minutes the other employee was tied up with lame customer.
I tried to go back for more the next night, but that pesky power outage blocked my salsa nirvana

I bought a Groupon from here, based on the yelp reviews. Food was good! The Carne Asada was a 5 the Carnitas were a 3. Our daughter had the Quesadilla - she liked it a lot, she&apos;s 10. Beans were good, rice was good. :)

One note, it&apos;s a pretty rough neighborhood. I&apos;d say go for the food, however if you are uncomfortable, make it to go!

..When there because I saw it had great reviews..But it was big disappointment....The food was not good at all..I got the carne Asada Burrito&amp;Two Carne Asada Tacos..Both where bad...the tacos tortillas where dry&amp;Stale...That also goes for the free chips...Very stale..The Burrito was  a little better but got gross out after awhile cuz it was to salty..and the flour tortilla wasn&apos;t fresh either..

Don&apos;t know how this place got so many great reviews..The food is below decend... The only good thing about this place is good service..But not worth going to for the food.. I would not recommend going here..

I love El Nap.  El Nap has, hands down, the best Carne Asada I have ever tasted!  And, when you get it uncooked to bring home for w BBQ it like $4 a pound, which works out great when trying to feed a crowd and not break the bank.  The Carnitas is also very good.

My favorite part about El Nap has to be the freshness of everything.  If you&apos;ve only been to the restaurant and never been over to the store, you gotta go and check out the monster tortilla making machine.  A good tortilla can seriously make or break a burrito for me and El Nap knows what they are doing when it comes to tortillas.  The chips are always fresh and never stale also.

The salsa selection, also extremely fresh, is amazing.  You have to try the Roasted Red!  My parents live in Seattle and are constantly trying to get me to ship it up to them.  I also really like the Salsa Fresca and the Guacamole is delicious.  If you&apos;ve ever had ceviche, and enjoyed it, you gotta try it here.  Again, it&apos;s super fresh and the seafood mix is great.

I also really like that El Nap isn&apos;t afraid to serve some truly authentic, and often not offered, selections.  The Lengua, cow&apos;s tongue,  is amazing and I really like the tripe in the Menudo.

I&apos;ve never been disappointed by El Nap and plan to continue going there as often as possible.

Shhh! Don&apos;t tell anyone but this is the best Mexican place in North County! It doesn&apos;t get more authentic than this. Not only do they have a restaurant that serves amazing fresh Mexican, but they also have a deli where you can buy their homemade chips, salsa, guac, variety of meats, rice and beans, and even huge pieces of chicharron. Excellent friendly service and food, I hope this place will always be here.

You could pass right by and not notice this place, but you must have heard about it from time to time. They&apos;ve been here forever. They do sell fresh (REALLY fresh) meats and I always stock their condiments ( salsas and guacamole) in my house. If you want to make great Mexican meals at home, you can buy all the groceries like tortillas, rice, beans etc. here also. Yes 5 stars!

This place is the heat!  My favorite mexican joint in Encinitas.  The carne asada is delicious and the tamales are wonderful.  The best thing about El Napolito is their roasted salsa.  Just the right amount of heat with tons of flavor, they have it in their salsa bar and you can also buy a container to take home with you.

Wow, my first review motivated by disgust... to the point: found a dead roach in the carnitas (about the size of a fingernail).

I was pumped because this place is close to my house and has a great rating. Bought the family carnitas meal, got home opened it up, made one taco, went to make a second, and there it was... a dead roach... wow... still turning my stomach.

Ok I just don&apos;t get it. This place was totally mediocre.

Hubs and I both got the combo #4 plate which comes with 1 beef tamale, 1 chicken enchilada, refried beans, and rice. We also got an order of chips and guacamole.

Nothing was super flavorful or tasty. The tamale was too thick and the filling was not good. The enchilada was lacking flavor.

The guacamole was decent but frankly my husband makes better guacamole thanks to our friends recipe from El Salvador.

It&apos;s definitely a hole in the wall type of place. It was a bit dirty, had Spanish boxing on tv, and poor customer service (you order at the register and they bring the food to you.) The cashier forget about our order of chips and guacamole so I had to ask for it and it took him about 10 minutes to remember to bring us our drinks.

While I still haven&apos;t found a Mexican place that knocks my socks off yet, there are definitely better places than this.

Thank goodness we had a groupon for $20 worth of food which only cost me $10...I wouldn&apos;t have wanted to pay any more than that for this meal.

I went to this place the other night and got there as they were closing. It seriously looked worth going back (just based on their yelp rating alone). After all, that&apos;s how I found this place because seriously...who gets off the I-5 on Santa Fe Drive?

Ventured in there for lunch with Mrs. Steve M. and Steve M. Jr. Had the carnitas, chili verde, carne asada nachoes and some drinks. I really wanted the food to &quot;WOW&quot; me but you know what kids....yep...it was so-so. And honestly, after all the crazy positive reviews on here I wanted to be throwing down 4 stars plus for this place but you know what? I can&apos;t do it.

Too many people like this place, I&apos;m just going to have to say it was Sunday and my taste buds must have been off or at church or who knows where because nothing was going on here but some basic fast food Mexican. The place serves authentic cuisine, its a cut above the rest but you&apos;ll have to try it for yourself to decide.

I like getting off Santa Fe Drive to go to the gas station there. I&apos;ve seen this little restaurant hanging out near the 7-11 for years. Usually, though, I&apos;m by that way late in the evening. So late I don&apos;t think they were even open.

Finally, today, I got my chance and boy I&apos;m glad I did. Apparently it&apos;s a popular spot as there were a number of people enjoying dinner and a number of people waiting in line to get to order dinner. Mixed crowd, mixed ethnicities -- definitely a good sign.

I ordered a simple Vegetarian Burrito for $5.30 I waited a bit over 5 minutes and while I waited I got some salsa - they had at least 5 different kinds and I tried to. Okay, one would probably be better defined as a pico de gallo and the other was some sort of chipolte salsa. While I waited I got to watch an American Football game on TV and browse their jukebox machine - filled mostly with Mexican and Spanish music. I wasn&apos;t going to eat there so I didn&apos;t pop in $1 to enjoy 3 songs of my choosing.

Eventually my food came and the burrito was delicious and BIG. The burrito appeared to contain refried beans, rice, cheese, pico de gallo, and guacamole. I was also stoked to get a small side of chunky, thick chips. Both were SO satisfying. I didn&apos;t really dig the pico de gallo as it was a little to watery for me - but that might have been my own fault when digging it up in the first place. And, I&apos;m not much of a chipolte fan, but if you are, it had some nice heat. I was ready to pop by the time I had a 1/4 of a burrito left and a number of chips left -- but they were so good I ate the rest of the burrito.

Can&apos;t wait to try &apos;em again and satisfying my urge for an awesome veggie burrito and just as awesome chips.

For the uninitiated, do not confuse the two (2) El Noplitos.  While affiliated, they are not litterally attached as each are in their own buildings that are next to each other.  One is the local Mexican market; the other is the restaurant.

I&apos;ve always embraced El Nopalito, the restaurant, and then quietly, they taco rolled out of my lunch rotation.  I&apos;d drive by and tell myself, Oh yeah! I need to go back even though - I went to other places a block away.  Since the plaza&apos;s remodeling, I&apos;ve escaped work like others to have lunch in a local joint and watch ESPN during lunch. HA.

My preferred taco of choice (wait for it....) - carnitas.  I prefer my carnitas to not be stringy or shredded or dry - akin to a piece of forgotten turkey meat texturely (is that a word?).  EN&apos;s carnitas are everything else and beyond what I don&apos;t like.

On the other hand, El Nopalito is known for their tamales - cheese, chicken, pork, or beef.  They do brisk business during Christmas - which I still don&apos;t understand the connection of tamales and Christmas - short of googgling.   Regardless I am not averse to their tamales at all either!

Don&apos;t dismiss El Nopalito because of its obvious location in a small corner stripmall in the northeast corner of I-5 and Santa Fe Avenue.   It&apos;s not a sexy local shopping venue, but it has everything for the local neighborhood.

I&apos;m sold on this place.   I had an El Pastor burrito on Thursday and then came back the following Monday to try the Carne Asada burrito.    The burritos are less than $5 and they have a really good salsa bar including spicy carrots and roasted peppers.

I&apos;m looking forward to surfing in North County just so that I can share this new found burrito joint with my friends aftewards.

I discovered this place through a mutual friend a long time ago and when I was sent out for work near here; I took the opportunity to pick up some of that salsa I&apos;ve been missing.

Their restaurant is a hole in the wall as is their market.  The restaurant has good tacos; I really think their carne asada shines over everything else, but their birria isn&apos;t bad either; gotta love game meats.  I had street tacos for lunch and tried to sample many of their flavors, but the carne asada taco was still the best.  I will say their lunch service could be a bit faster, but the food was good and the people were friendly.

They have a market across the street and their salsa is excellent.  I recommend the Roasted or Chipotle Salsa; it&apos;s very tasty.

After having a huge Mexican meal in Old Town that failed to impress we asked a Mexican guy who worked at our hotel where he eats.
He directed us here. He raved about it. He is from Mexico and says it is authentic, he would know!
It was more authentic than Old Town but maybe we went on an off day. We had enchiladas and tamales. My husband had their chips and salsa he said they were good.
It was  good not great. I actually enjoyed the Mexican food I had in LA better. I expected it to be better in San Diego. But that is based on the few restaurants I have been to in both cities.
If I am in San Diego again (we stay sometimes on our way to Hawaii) I would like to give it another try.

This review is for the market only.

This is the real deal, amigos y amigas.  Super fresh corn tortillas (I&apos;ve never seen flour), excellent thick corn chips, fresh fresh guacamole and salsas, carne asada, pollo adobado, candies, pinatas, and all sorts of Mexican goodness here.

My one (minor) complaint is that they cut the guacamole with sour cream.  But I double dog dare you to buy the chips here and a tub of guacamole and not make a serious dent in it all in one day.  And make sure you get the roasted salsa.  It is great.

Stay fat and hungry, my friends.
