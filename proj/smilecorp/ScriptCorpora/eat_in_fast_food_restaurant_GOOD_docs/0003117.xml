Cooking up a love of conscious eating
 
There&apos;s no denying the fact that America&apos;s love affair with food has turned a little sour. With a fast food restaurant on every corner, instant meals in every freezer and a food industry that&apos;s known for marketing gimmicks, it&apos;s no wonder that people have a hard time cooking and eating healthfully. Luckily, there&apos;s a new food connoisseur on the block who is dedicated to helping the next generation get back into the kitchen to rediscover the benefits of fresh, healthy meals. Claire Thomas, the host of ABC&apos;s Food for Thought, and the creator of popular food blog, The KitchyKitchen , took the time to detail her own food journey in this exclusive interview with GirlsGoneSporty.

 Discovering and understanding food

 GirlsGoneSporty (GGS): Food for Thought is a new show designed to help the next generation of young adults discover foods and cooking, with the goal of helping them eat for life, rather than just feed their hunger. Can you tell us a little about your own food journey – how you came to know and love cooking?

 Claire Thomas (CT): I grew up in a &quot;food family&quot; where my mom was an amazing cook, so I did not grow up feeling the need to cook.  But, in high school and college, you have to fend for yourself, and I started cooking out of necessity.  I quickly found that I turned to cooking when I was stressed, feeling creative or just want to fill an hour.  Before I knew it, I started my blog and began honing my food photography skills.

I discovered that food should be fun, not intimidating or scary. I always treated it as a place to be creative and a venue through which I could examine all of my other interests, like looking at food from historical or cultural perspectives.

Through food, you can understand the culture, society, economy, and politics of people. And, it&apos;s so personal that it instantly connects you with your community. I wanted to bring people back to the table, so to speak, to make it personal again and the TV show was the best avenue to do this!

 GGS: What do you think are some of the biggest barriers to healthy, informed eating?

 CT: Eating healthy has become a very intimidating prospect for some. Depending on where you live and how much money you have to spend, eating healthy can seem like a challenge.

Growing up and living in California, I’ve always been surrounded by beautiful, fresh produce in a community that supports eating healthy and embraces understanding your body. In areas of the country that don&apos;t have that kind of access and openness, you definitely have to work harder. Plus, eating healthy can seem more time consuming and difficult simply because it usually requires actual cooking. In this day of convenience and pre-packaged food, spending an extra ten minutes to prepare a healthy meal may not seem worthwhile. But the truth is, with a little bit of planning and some education, you can have beautiful, healthy snacks and meals ready for you at a moment’s notice.

 GGS: This is a similar question, but a little different – what do you think are the biggest misconceptions about healthy cooking, and what do you think is the best way to battle those misconceptions?

 CT: I think the biggest misconception about healthy cooking is that it doesn’t taste as good as unhealthy cooking. The truth of the matter is that fresh, seasonal ingredients have better, stronger flavors and require a lot less cooking than their off-season, under-ripe counterparts. If you give me two peaches, one ripened in the peak of summer and the other synthetically ripened in January, there&apos;s a world of difference in taste. I literally don’t have to do anything to make the naturally-ripe peach taste good - but that under-ripe peach? I have to add sugar, butter, spices and a whole host of other things to give it any flavor.

So, if you go out into your community and make friends with gardeners, farmers or even start a garden yourself, you’ll constantly be surrounded by good information on what tastes best when. You&apos;ll also realize that when you buy something in-season, it costs less, too. People think that to purchase fresh ingredients, it has to be more expensive, but that&apos;s not necessarily the case. In the short-term, if you buy in-season and buy easily accessible ingredients (i.e. foods your region is known for), the price will be right. And, because you&apos;re avoiding pre-packaged foods that can be laden with preservatives, chemicals and hidden salts and sugars, eating whole, natural foods can end up saving you money in the long-run by cutting down on health care costs.

Heart-healthy cooking

 GGS: February is American Heart Health month. Do you have any quick, heart-healthy guidelines for cooking?

 CT: Heart disease is the #1 killer of American women, and though genetics have a lot to do with it, the cumulative effects of your diet can make a colossal impact. Eating well means living well, and hopefully that means living well for a long while.

The easiest way to help your heart is to cook your own food. It sounds simple, but when you’re the one adding the butter or deciding to buy a steak, you’re going to think more about the cooking process than when you leave the cooking up to someone else. Everyone loves indulging, but when you do it in a restaurant, there’s usually a lot more going on in the kitchen than you’re aware of.

Other easy tips are ones you’ve probably already heard: cutting down on your red meat consumption, eating dark colored fruits and vegetables and limiting your sugar intake. The bright colors of dark fruits and vegetables usually indicate a greater concentration of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and all that good stuff. That’s one of the reasons why kale has become the new superfood. Reducing one’s sugar intake is trickier because cutting down on sugar doesn’t mean switching to Splenda for your coffee. Cutting down sugar means cutting down the things that turn into sugar once your body processes them. This means products made with refined flour, such as bread, pasta or packaged foods that have a lot of carbohydrates. I say this as a bread-lover, so the idea is basically to know what you’re putting in your body. It’s okay to love foods that aren’t always the best for you, but just know to moderate them.

 GGS: What are your favorite heart-healthy foods?

 CT: I just mentioned kale being a superfood and honestly, it’s one of my favorite ingredients. Kale chips are a delicious and crunchy treat and they add heartiness to soups and sides. You can roast it, sauté it, puree it. It’s really versatile, which I love. Another ingredient I love is turkey. We all know it&apos;s roasted for Thanksgiving, but I love using turkey as a lighter alternative to red meat. It’s great in burgers, perfect in chili and it really stands up to the stronger spices you would usually use with red meat.

Making time for it all

 GGS: How do you make time to shop and cook when you’re so busy balancing your TV show, blog and personal life?

 CT: There wouldn’t be a blog or TV show if I didn’t get myself to the kitchen on a regular basis. For the show, I create all of the recipes and test them weeks in advance, shooting them for the blog. And my blog posts are the result of me experimenting and having fun in the kitchen. I treat going to the Farmer’s Market and checking out new shops in town as part of my job. I get inspiration when I taste, smell and see ingredients. Without that, I wouldn’t be able to create the recipes and share them.

 GGS: What three must-have kitchen tools (aside from large appliances) can’t you live without when it comes to cooking healthy meals?

 CT: I would have to say cutting boards and good knives are the first that come to mind. My first apartment kitchen was covered in stone, which I had to be very careful with. I like to have a big wood cutting board for slicing produce, and a plastic one for raw meat or fish because it&apos;s so easy to clean off. I also use my wood cutting board as a serving platter.

With knives, if you have a clean, sharp knife; it takes half the effort and time to slice or chop something up. When a knife is dull, that’s when you’re more likely to cut yourself because you have to use extra force to get it to cut.

And lastly, I love silicon mats. You can use them instead of parchment for baking, and I love using them for roasting cherry tomatoes and vegetables. The vegetables perfectly caramelize without sticking to the bottom, which means less clean-up!

 GGS: What are some other ways that you maintain life balance to stay healthy and happy?

 CT: I don’t always enjoy working out. There, I said it! I would so much rather be sitting and reading or sitting and blogging or sitting and eating. To get past this, I’ve embraced things that are doable and practical for my lifestyle. Instead of driving to my favorite coffee house to sit and read, I walk there. And every week, I do Pilates because I have a weak back and tight muscles. I try to do at least thirty minutes of physical activity a day, whether it’s walking, Pilates, working out with my sister or doing sit-ups with my mom. Regardless, I get moving and do something.  And the funny thing is, I actually feel really good after I do it!
