Bulalo @ Tagaytay Market
 April 4th, 2012 bonz 
 
They said that Bulalo is one of Tagaytay’s specialties, even my hubby confirmed it.  I’ve been there, at Tagaytay, many times already but nobody told me about the Bulalo. 

Good thing, my best friends suggested to eat Bulalo when they‘kidnapped’me last Monday. The explanation of‘kidnapped’is over my personal/parenting blog, Zoie’s Mom Blogging .

I really didn’t know where we ate, I only heard that it was a market in Mahogany.  When you say market and you’re going to eat there, you’ll expect that you’re going to eat at a carinderia or canteen.  But I didn’t expect that it was neatly rowed carinderias.  I think it was, more or less, 10 carinderias lined up.  Mind you, even it is a market place it was clean.

Anyway, we picked randomly where we will eat because all of them are serving Bulalo. ^_^  And here’s what we ordered.

 Bulalo and Crispy Dilis 6 cups of plain rice 

 

 4 bowls of Bulalo for me, my best friend Hannah, her husband Jay&amp;close high school buddy, TJ. 

Of course before eating I need to take some pictures for my food blog. Photo opp!

 

 

 

 Yum Yum 

Their Bulalo is so good…^_^ So, as soon as I get back home that day, I told hubby to go back there together and eat Bulalo!

Bulalo! Love it. I’ve try this when we got there in Tagaytay. That is the most delish food I’ve ever tried. Hope I could visit the place again.

I remember the time when a Filipino friend took me to Tagaytay to have that. It was cheap and very yummy.
