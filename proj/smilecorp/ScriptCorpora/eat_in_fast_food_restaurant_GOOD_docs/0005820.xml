 Flag Close Post a comment Have you ever found yourself sorting through your refrigerator looking for something for dinner when you happen across a jar of your favorite pasta sauce? Of course, if it&apos;s in the refrigerator, it has probably been opened, but how long ago? I have found myself doing this countless times. Or I did until I found the Days Ago Digital Day Counter, a product that allows me to keep track how long items have been in the refrigerator.
I read about this product in Real Simple magazine about a year ago and thought it was a great idea. Something for the absent minded who continuously finds random things in the refrigerator and has no idea how long they have been in there hanging out. I placed an order through www.howmanydaysago.com where I was able to get two of these handy devices for $10. When they arrived I found myself just waiting to find a use for them. These small round devices come with metal or suction on the back which allows you to stick them to almost any surface. Stick them on the top of your jars or on top of those leftovers and press the reset button on the top of the device and a daily count will begin to tell you how long ago you put it in the refrigerator or how long ago you used it. These products are great. They are super durable. Last for a long period of time without the battery running down and can count up to 99 days.

While I originally purchased them for use in my kitchen I have found they can be used for other things as well. I have one of the Days Ago Digital Day Counters in my car to remind me how long it&apos;s been since I got my oil changed. I have one stuck to the side of my furnace so I know how long it&apos;s been since I changed the filter. I can think of many more uses and will most definitely be purchasing more of this handy little gadget. One of my favorite parts is that the batteries can be replace which make them reusable for a very long time.

Over the past two years this device has been featured on many television shows including the Oprah Show. They have also been profiled in magazines such as Good Housekeeping. They can be purchased through the company&apos;s website at www.howmanydaysago.com and retail for $10 for a set of two. The are available in four bright accented colors. The are also available with pink accents as a special promotion for breast cancer awareness.

If you are tired of wondering how long things have been in the refrigerator or if you are like me and forget how long ago it was that you changed your oil or furnace filter this small device could be a lifesaver for you.
