 How to Order From a Drive Thru at a Fast Food Restaurant

 Pin It Article Edit Discuss History 
Drive-thru windows help drivers who don&apos;t have time to stop and sit in a restaurant . Most fast-food places have them. They are there for your convenience, so don&apos;t hesitate to stop by one. 
 
 Edit Steps 
 
 1 Choose the place . Figure out which fast food restaurant you want to go to. What are you in the mood for? Do you want a spicy chicken sandwich or a small salad ? Try to consider these things before making the drive so you will know which direction you will be headed for. 2 Pull into the line . Drive carefully into the drive-thru lane. Use common sense; obviously trying to cut in line won&apos;t result in anything good. 3 Decide on what you want . Try to have an idea of what you want before you even pull into the driveway of the restaurant so you won&apos;t keep anyone waiting. Staring at a menu with no clue of what to order holds up the line and isn&apos;t convenient for those behind you. Take a quick glance at the menu to collect your thoughts. If you need to take a good look at the menu, go inside. Drive-thrus are meant to be a fast process. 4 Speak clearly and loudly . Muttering your words will confuse the employees working the drive-thru. Take short pauses from time to time to make sure the person is keeping up. Also, be conscious of your volume. Don&apos;t speak too loudly or too softly. 5 Get your money ready . Have your form of payment ready once the window opens. Remember that this is a smooth process in which everything must be kept going. Waiting on a person fumbling around for change isn&apos;t exactly delightful for the fast-food staff. 6 Thank the person who gives you the food . This may seem obvious, but many forget this step. Saying thank you shows what type of character you have. Smile , don&apos;t have an attitude . Attitudes take away from the thank you, making it less sincere . No matter how bad the service is, being thankful allows the person to see you as a kind person. 7 Check your meal . Make sure that what is in the bag is what you ordered. Nothing destroys a person&apos;s mood like getting the wrong food. 

 
 
 Edit Tips 
 
 Avoid stopping by a drive-thru when it is busy. You will end up waiting longer if there is a line of cars . Don&apos;t go inside if a place is busy in the drive-thru. Going inside will just pull people away from helping out in the drive-thru and you will still have to wait for the orders that were placed in front of you in the drive-thru because it is first come first serve for the whole store, not just for each section. Only go inside if you want something simple like a drink or if you are going to order a lot of food and don&apos;t mind waiting. You don&apos;t want to bug everyone behind you because you ordered the entire menu! If you do get the wrong order, calmly walk inside the restaurant and ask for a new order. Don&apos;t become angry about the situation; blowing up makes everything worse. 

 
 
 Edit Warnings 
 
 Don&apos;t drive and eat. Eating distracts you from paying attention to the road. Either wait to eat, or park in the parking lot and eat your food. Do not go through the drive thru on foot. This is very dangerous. Instead go inside and order.
