 General Electric uses Cyclopentane to Reduce CO2 Footprint of Refrigerators 
 



 

General Electric is using cyclopentane as a foam blowing agent for insulation in refrigerators and freezers. Using cyclopentane in place of HFC such as HFC-134a or HFC-245fa (typically used by US refrigerator manufacturers) significantly reduces the CO2 footprint from foam blowing.

GE is using cyclopentane at two major facilities – Appliance Park, KY and Decatur, GA. - to lower toe CO2 footprint associated with prior HFC foam blowing agents.

 At Appliance Park – “ … reduce average annual CO2 emissions … by more than 99 percent, or 117,781 metric tons of CO2 annually …”

 At Decatur GA – “ .. reducing … by 400,000 metric tons of CO2 … a 99-percent reduction in GHG emissions ..”

This is equivalent to the “ … of 101,185 car” and the amount of CO2 “ … absorbed by 132,093 acres of Southeastern U.S. forest”.

 University of Delaware Reaserch Using EVs as Power Grid Stabilizers 
 



 The University of Delaware is working on technology to enable EV owners use their cars batteries as storage / stabilizing capacity for the grid. 

 The University of Delaware is working with NRG Energy and eV2 on this project. EVs may be able to provide power to the grid to cover peak needs and serve as significant storage capacity for smoothing out peak needs. 

“…resulting in cost savings to electric vehicle fleet operators and eventually other electric vehicle owners and consumers,…“  

The technology works while the EV is plugged in to the charging system…and instead of drawing power would send power to the grid.

“…allow electric vehicle owners to sell battery storage back to the electric grid…at no risk or inconvenience to daily driving needs.“

 GE and Home Depot Partner on EPA’s Responsible Appliance Disposal (RAD) Program 
 



 

Many communities recycle glass, aluminum and paper … maybe even some plastics.

What about old appliances ? In addition to containing easy to recycle metals some appliance also contain harmful refrigerants. 9 million (+ / –) refrigerators are thrown out each year in the U.S. and most are shredded to reclaim the metal … the foam and other materials go to a landfill and may release GHG to the atmosphere. 

GE and Home Depot have a different approach that keeps an additional 47 lbs of a typical refrigerator out of landfills (resulting in 102 lbs not sent to landfill per refrigerator).

With Responsible Appliance Disposal a refrigerator’s refrigerant is safely removed and recycled / processed. Then any GHG from foam insulation is safely processed and the remaining material is separated for recycling.

“ … Refrigerants and recoverable components are removed … will reduce the weight of typical refrigerator landfill waste by approximately 85%.”

“ … Approximately 95% of the insulating foam is recovered, compressed and can be used as fuel”.

Many Home Depot locations will take the appliances for recycling. For locations see links below …

The CBS series “The Good Wife” is a green production. From the practices on the set to the scenes they film they are being green. 

The set has made significant reductions in waste … using soda fountains instead of cans of soda, mostly eliminating paper plates and plastic ware, using reusable water bottles and sending scene / script rewrites electronically rather than printing paper copies.

They even “lead by example” by modeling green behaviors … having characters carry reusable water bottles instead of single use plastic bottles.

Research Frontiers, Inc&apos;s SPD technology uses suspended particles in glass to react to a small voltage to change from clear to nearly blocked. With voltage is applied the glass is clear.


This would allow for large glass windows for light and letting the same windows block direct sun to reduce A/C load and reduce UV damage to fabrics.

&apos; ...provides exceptional control over solar energy...&quot; 

&quot;... ability of architectural smart glass to improve the energy efficiency of buildings by effectively controlling solar heat gain and harvesting daylight ...&quot;

 Whole Foods Market Recycle Wine Bottle Corks 
 



 

Ever wonder what to do with corks after you finish that bottle of wine? How about recycling them ? Whole Foods and Cork ReHarvest has partnered to set up recycling boxes at Whole Foods MArkets.

&quot;... make it easy ... to properly dispose of cork at all of our 292 stores in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. ...&quot;

Did you know that cork production is environmentally friendly as trees are not cut but t he bark (cork) is harvested approx every 10 years from trees that can live for 300 years.

What about the environmental impact of cork recycling - the energy and cost to ship cork back for processing? The cork is returned on the same trucks that deliver so there is a close to ZERO net carbon footprint. So the cork recycling loop is close to impact free.

Depending on the location the corks are used to make floor tiles or other products.

 These Come From Trees .... Promote Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. 
 



 

I saw this sticker on a paper towel dispenser and wanted to know more about it. It seems this was a grass roots effort that seems to work. From their website ...&quot;... From our field testing, each sticker deployed saves about a tree&apos;s worth of paper (~100 lbs.) a year. Crazy, isn&apos;t it? &quot;and saves about 29% per year in paper.


The idea is to use what you need but not more ... many folks grab lots of paper towels (same for napkins) and toss most unused into a trash can.

According to the blog site there are over 10,000 of these at Starbucks and 10,000 at McDondald. A typical coffee shop or fast food restaurant can use 1000 - 2000 lbs of paper towels a year. I saw&quot;mine&quot;at a local Starbucks (I ask for my coffee in a reusable ceramic mug or my reusable thermos !)

If you are looking for a way to green your office or work site consider buying a few ... !

 Be Green and make a difference.

 Stanford Students Design Recyclable Laptop Prototype 
 



e-waste is a growing problem. When tossed into a landfill they can cause water and soil pollution. Several Stanford University students have tackled the problem by developing a prototype laptop that is modular so it is easily “de-manufactured”. The process is fast and can facilitate recycling the constituent components.

Theoretically manufacturers could use this in “green advertising” to differentiate their product from others.

 Heat from Commuters in Stockholm’s Central Station Serves Nearby Office Block 
 



Here is a very interesting story from Sweden. Engineers in Sweden have found a way to recover the excess heat generated by commuters in Stockholm’s main train station.

 

The technology is really not that different from any other heat exchange process but is certainly unique. Certain factors help to make this application workable including the low winter temperatures in Sweden and their relatively high cost of energy. 

The energy created from businesses (like bakeries and restaurants that generate heat) and people is able to help a nearby office block reduce their heating costs by 20%. For a large office block this can really add up … this waste heat from the Central Station is a valuable energy for an office block nearby.

 US Army Evaluating Solar Tents 
 



 

The Army and its operations are energy intensive. Getting energy to remote or war ravaged areas is both expensive and dangerous.

Using&quot;... Flexible Photovoltaics (PV), ... convert light energy into electricity ... ideal for charging up batteries, making sure your (communications), night vision goggles and computers are powered ...&quot;

The key is technology that makes PV&quot;panels&quot;flexible so they are lightweight and foldable / packable. While still in the testing phase they may be deployed soon.

 Scott Naturals™ Tube-Free Saves Tons of Paper 
 



 According to the Scott&apos;s web site 17 billion toilet tissue tubes are thrown away each year ...&quot;That&apos;s enough to fill the Empire Sta Building. Twice&quot;. Or 20 747s.

That is a serious waste of a natural resource. Scott Naturals™Tube-Free are made without the cardboard core and are helping to reduce waste and save natural materials.

What a simple but great idea. Think of all the energy avoided by not manufactuing and then throwing away all those roll cores.

Something so simple can help individuals make an impact on the environment and save landfill space.

It is better to reduce than recycle or reuse!

 thinkeco modlet - help understand your electrical usage 
 



 

Thinkeco has a way to find the energy wasters in your house. Appliances are big power users and can even draw power when&quot;off&quot;. Some refer to this as vampire poser draws.

We sort of know that many electronic devises are drawing power all the time but also realize that it is not practical to unplug all you appliances when not in use; or even to be sure which are drawing the most power.

modlet solves this problem.


&quot;... plug the modlet into an existing electric outlet and plug your appliances into it. ... use your web browser to wirelessly monitor and manage your power consumption.&quot;

It is expected that the modlet can save 10 - 120% on your energy bill and pay for itself in 6 months. It is expected to be available for sale on-line and else where this year.

 Here are 10 quick things you can do to get your house in better shape for winter. Total time to complete is estimate to b e a weekend and costs are in the order of $100 making for a great return on time and investment.

Here are some highlights -&quot;Change your furnace filters ... Insulate your pipes ... Caulk your windows ... Weather stripe your doors ... [get / install a] Programmable thermostat ...&quot;

Do the ones you can yourself and save some money - consider a contractor if some arel. beyond your skill level. Each will make a difference to the environment and your energy bills.

While not on the list - do not forget to use CFLs or LED bulbs ... in my area (SouthEastern PA) they are reasonably inexpensive as they are subsidized (at least at the Home Depot) by PECO (local utility).

Here is a novel idea to turn dog waste into methane ...  &quot;dog waste ... decomposes over time. The anaerobic conditions inside the digester create methane gas ...&quot; The methane gas lights a gas lamp.

If successful this could be deployed to larger dog parks across the country.

If you buy from Calphalon you can have your old cookware recycled for free.

Pack the old cookware in the box from the new cookware (reuse) and they will provide a UPS shipping label to cover the shipping. Shortly after you should receive two 100% recycled cotton shopping bags (reduce and reuse).

Here is an interesting bit of information from their web site ...

&quot;Fact: Over 80 percent of items in landfills can be recycled, but they&apos;re not.&quot;

 Fast and Easy Ways to Be Green 
 



S ometimes being green really is plain and simply easy -- low or now cost and with little downside. There are lots of little things that taken together, over time can really add up. 

Check out these and other great idea from Earth911.com ...

Here are 3 ...

(1) Skip the drive through and park ...&quot;... every minute the average car engine idles, it emits 6 to 7 grams of pollutants into the atmosphere. ...&quot; Taken collectively for say a millions cars over the period of a year and you reduce / eliminate over 700 tons of emissions. You also save a lot of gas and money ... and get some exercise !


(2) Pay your bills on-line ...&quot;.. reduce your household’s paper consumption ... eliminate paper waste ...&quot;

(3) Turn stuff off ... not just lights that are on when no one is in the room but electronics. Many devices are actually sucking power in standby mode and not actually&quot;off&quot;. &quot;... Even a cell phone charger continues to use energy when plugged in, whether your cell phone is charging or not. ...&quot; This often called phantom power users because many electronic devices are drawing power in standby mode and collectively that adds up. Save money, reduce the demand for power and keep the air cleaner. For your computer consider plugging all the electronics into a single power strip and with one switch you can turn off a PC, printer, monitor and other devices.
