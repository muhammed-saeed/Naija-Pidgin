Company Branding Examples
 by Miranda Brookins, Demand Media 

 
From athletic products to coffee houses, branding plays an important role in how companies are perceived, the types of customers they attract, the tactics they use to generate business and the way they achieve stature in their respective industries. Branding is more than just the visual representation of your business. &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine describes it as your promise to your customers.
 
Business Name

The name of your business is usually the first way a customer hears about your brand. Some companies select business names that are relevant to the types of products and services they offer, such a Build-a-Bear, a children&apos;s toy company, and Kentucky Fried Chicken, a fast-food restaurant specializing in chicken. Other companies, such as Apple, Go Daddy and Google, have business names that are seemingly unrelated to what they sell or employ made-up words.
 
Company Colors

The implied rules of branding state that the colors your select to use in your business logo also should appear on your company website and as a part of any marketing collateral you produce for your business. This includes everything from your email newsletter template and store signage to brochures and letterhead. Choose your colors carefully, paying close attention to the meaning and emotions behind the colors, as outlined by The Color Association. Fast-food restaurant McDonald&apos;s primarily uses red and yellow, while Tiffany&apos;s, a high-end jewelry store chain, uses its custom-made robin&apos;s-egg color and black as company colors.
 
Logo

Logos are the most common example of how companies brand themselves. By working with a skilled graphic designer, firms develop logos that act as visual representations for their brands and give insight into the products and services they offer. Some logos are designed solely with a company&apos;s name, while others only use a graphic representation. Many include both a graphic and words. Consumer software and electronics company Apple uses a bitten apple as its logo. Delivery company FedEx&apos;s logo includes text, as well as a hidden arrow, found between the &quot;E&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Ex,&quot; which symbolizes speedy delivery.
 
Slogan or Tag Line

Tell customers what your business does by adding a tag line or slogan to your company&apos;s branding toolkit. A tag line generally is a short phrase that gives your potential customers a snapshot of your business and what they can expect. Your tag line can focus on quality, efficiency or affordability, or simply can be a catchy phrase. Athletic company Nike has one of the most recognizable tag lines, &quot;Just Do It.&quot; Seafood restaurant chain Red Lobster uses the tag line, &quot;For the Seafood Lover in You,&quot; while fast-food restaurant Burger King uses &quot;Have It Your Way.&quot;
