 Dining Gluten-Free at WDW

 November 2009
by Rhoda Smith, Pittsburgh, PA 

We were at WDW November 7-14, 2009. My husband had been diagnosed with Celiac Disease just a couple of months before this trip, so we suddenly had to jump into the world of gluten-free (GF) eating at WDW! I want to reassure GF eaters that it really was an easy process, even for beginners like us! The key is to do a lot of preparation and researching before you go. The more you know before, the better prepared you are for your GF dining experiences when you arrive! Planning is essential.

Some important phone numbers/email addresses to know:
-General phone number for special dietary needs (call before trip): 407-824-5967
 -Magic Kingdom: 407-824-5967
-Epcot: 407-560-7292
-DHS: 407-560-1347
-Animal Kingdom: 407-939-7536
- specialdiets@disneyworld.com (email prior to trip)
(Know that many restaurants in Epcot and all in AK are not Disney-owned, but still do provide GF options) 
By either calling 407-824-5967 or emailing to the address above, WDW will send you an email full of information for GF dining. You want to do this as soon as possible to help with your meal planning, especially if you are using the Disney Dining Plan. There is a form to fill out with the name of the person who has the dietary restriction, contact info, restaurants with ADR&apos;s and confirmation numbers, etc. They make sure that your dietary need is connected with each reservation. I just needs to be returned to them prior to your visit. Then they also send several lists of info regarding GF dining, including:
 
-Guest Dietary Letter/Guest Allergy Dietary Request Form
-Information on allergy-free chicken tenders
-Food Allergy Dietary Reference Sheet
-No-Gluten-Added Products
-OP Allergy Menus for Epcot
-Water Parks Menu Items
-WDW Resort Dietary Sheets
We printed these off and my husband carried them with him daily.
 
When making ADR&apos;s via phone, be sure to tell the Cast Member you are speaking with about your GF dietary need. They will notate this on your reservation. When making online ADR&apos;s, there is a place to“click”for special dietary needs, and“wheat allergy”is one of them. You will have to notate this with each restaurant ADR, even if they are tied to your hotel reservation.

At every table-service restaurant, the server was aware of our dietary need and the chef came to our table to discuss food options. All of the chefs were knowledgeable, some more than others, but all left us comfortable in knowing our food would be prepared GF and would be tasty! All presented the possibilities of GF options from the menu, and then offered to make something totally different if nothing sounded good. For buffet table-service restaurants, the chef took my husband around the buffet and discussed every option, declaring it either GF or not GF. (I can assure you that at all buffets, he was able to load his plate several times over!). At a non-buffet restaurant, a separate server (or the chef himself) brings out the meal on its own tray, so there is no potential for cross-contamination with the meals for the rest of the family.

At counter-service restaurants, the manager must be notified and he will review GF options with you. Then he goes back and chooses one food-preparer to prepare the food and bring it to your table, again on its&apos; own tray. (**know that this takes longer than the preparation of normal food, so you may want to put in your GF food order first, and then order regular food for the rest of the family, so that GF tray has a head start).

We ate at the following restaurants and had these experiences:
 
- Pecos Bill&apos;s in the MK: Any sandwich can be prepared and placed on a GF bun. French Fries were made in a fryer dedicated to GF preparation (and took a good bit of time to fry). At this restaurant, the GF bun was hard, and the GF cookies provided for dessert (in a big package) were very small and average tasting.
- Tony&apos;s Town Square in the MK: EXCELLENT for GF dining. Rice pasta can be substituted for all pasta dishes except the ravioli. The mushroom sauce on the grilled pork tenderloin is not gluten free so that must be left off. But otherwise all dishes can be made GF. Veggies (artichokes, broccoli, red peppers) and marinara sauce were substituted for pasta and mushroom sauce on the grilled pork tenderloin. GF rolls were provided for dipping in oil (these were cold and hard…in other restaurants the same rolls were heated and very good).
- Pinocchio Village Haus in the MK: GF pizza is available and was very good. French fries are baked instead of fried, yogurt cup for dessert.
- Hollywood&amp;Vine in DHS: many options available…buffet options change so I didn&apos;t write them all down. Caesar salad is not GF, and the only dessert is soft-serve ice cream in a dish.
- ABC Commissary in DHS: Chicken Cordon Bleu can be made on GF bun (or hamburger on GF bun). French Fries (didn&apos;t taste like baked, may also have their own fryer) were said to be GF. Large fruit bowl for dessert. Manager stated that the salads here are pre-made and dressings are questionable as to being GF.
- Tangierine Cafe in Morocco, Epcot: EXCELLENT for GF dining. Chicken/beef/lamb mixture with onion, olive, lettuce, hummus is served on a plate (instead of in a wrap as a gyro). GF buns are provided for hummus spread. No dessert option, but side of rice was provided since there was no dessert.
- Garden Grill in Epcot: EXCELLENT for GF dining. Meals here are served family-style: fish, turkey and beef with potatoes, stuffing, veggies all on the same plate. For the GF eater, a separate plate of these foods is provided, with fish made without breading, stuffing left off, and no sauce on the steak or gravy on the turkey. Mashed potatoes and vegetables (squash, snow peas) are on the same plate. (To stay clear…the GF eater gets his own tray of meats/sides prepared GF. The rest of the family gets a normal tray of foods). There is also a salad and GF rolls that were very good warm. Fruit was provided for dessert.
- Cinderella&apos;s Royal Table in the MK: All menu options are adaptable for being gluten-free. My husband had the salmon, rice and GF rolls. An appetizer was brought to the table, containing bruschetta, cheese, greens, Mediterranean salad…be sure to ask for a GF version for the GF diner (they just leave off the bruschetta). Sorbet for dessert.
- Columbia Harbor House in the MK: GF fried chicken and French fries, GF macaroni and cheese, big GF chocolate chip cookie (packaged) for dessert.
- Flame Tree BBQ in AK: EXCELLENT GF dining! Either the ribs or chicken meal are GF, with baked beans and cole slaw (they use a corn-based starch). GF prepackaged brownie for dessert. **This was by far the quickest counter service meal…perhaps because no french-fries were involved?)
- Le Cellier in Canada in Epcot: EXCELLENT GF dining! Any steaks were suitable, but the chef recommended the 14 oz NY Strip Steak or the 16 oz Kansas City Strip Steak (because the accompanying sides were GF). The KC Strip was excellent, with a side of delicious cream cheese mashed potatoes. GF rolls were provided instead of the regular breadsticks. And the best…Crème Brulee for dessert!
- Cantina de San Angel in Mexico in Epcot—We didn&apos;t get the name written down, but the chicken/corn tortilla dish that is the first option on the menu is GF (“something-pollo”). Comes with refried black beans and Mexican rice. There was no dessert option. (**This place seemed to be the least knowledgeable about GF preparation, language barrier did not help any. They did provide a notebook with labels of all their products used in preparations of food. The corn tortillas were GF).
- Cosmic Ray&apos;s at the MK: At this restaurant, there are many options and 3 service bays. The one my husband chose was a GF chicken salad, with a large GF chocolate chip cookie (packaged).
- Backlot Express in DHS: A large grilled chicken salad and large fruit bowl were the favorite GF option here.
 
A quick summary: Here are the counter service restaurants throughout WDW which easily provide GF meals:
Magic Kingdom:
Cosmic Ray&apos;s
Pecos Bill&apos;s
Main St. Bakery
Toontown Farmer&apos;s Market
Liberty Square Market
Pinocchio Village Haus
Auntie Gravity&apos;s Galactic Goodies
Enchanted Grove
Plaza Ice Cream Shop
Scuttle&apos;s Landing
Sleepy Hollow
Sunshine Terrace

Epcot:
Liberty Inn
Sunshine Seasons
Tangerine Café
Electric Umbrella

Disney Hollywood Studios:
Sunset Ranch
Backlot Express
Studios Catering Company/Flatbread Grill
ABC Commissary
Toy Story Pizza Planet
Dinosaur Gertie&apos;s
Min&amp;Bill&apos;s Dockside Diner

Animal Kingdom:
Pizzafari
Restaurantosaurus
Flame Tree BBQ
Harambe Fruit Cart
Safari Turkey

THE ULTIMATE KEY is to be sure your server and chef (in table service restaurants) or the manager (at counter service restaurants) is made aware of your dietary need. You will get personalized service, one-on-one preparation and service of your meal. WDW is better about GF dining than any restaurant we have encountered outside of WDW!
 
 A Gluten Free Family Vacation

 Valerie Lobo 

 March 
 2009 

Below is a report of our recent trip to WDW accommodating 4 celiac 
 diners (my husband, me and our 2 daughters).

The folks 
 at Disney World impressed us before we ever even got on the flight 
 to head to Disney. We received an email containing restaurants that 
 could accommodate us, the GF products carried in Disney World, and 
 a generic food allergy form to be filled out. We were very skeptical 
 about the generic form but we included all of our table service reservation 
 numbers and also sent in the quick service locations we planned on 
 visiting. From there our journey began. We were contacted directly 
 by the chefs and sous chefs of the restaurants we planned on visiting. 
 Yep, you read that correctly. The chefs called or emailed us to discuss 
 menu options, etc. One of the quick serve locations we mentioned wanting 
 to visit in Hollywood Studios would not be able to accommodate GF. 
 They called to let us know what quick serve locations we could go 
 to instead. It was nice to have a warm and fuzzy feeling before our 
 trip even began.

 Magic 
 Kingdom 

Our first 
 dining experience in the Magic Kingdom was at the Crystal Palace for a character dining with Winnie the Pooh and friends. When we checked 
 in they had our reservation stating we had a food allergy. Once we 
 were seated a chef came out to our table. Since this was a buffet, 
 the chef walked the line with us. He informed us of what was safe 
 and then took our order. He went to the back and got us fresh items 
 so there was no chance of contamination. We were served Ener-g tapioca 
 dinner rolls with our meal. I took one and broke it in half. The texture 
 threw me since it appeared to be like tearing apart a foam cushion. 
 However, we didn&apos;t let that deter us. One bite was all it took 
 to get us hooked. These were absolutely fabulous! We ordered seconds 
 of the rolls. Definitely one of the best GF rolls we&apos;ve ever 
 had. For dessert we ordered the GF brownie. I have no idea who the 
 vendor is for this item. I would say to avoid this like the plague, 
 though. I&apos;ve never tried a worse brownie. It was a very mealy 
 texture and tasted horrible. Let me put it this way, after that first 
 brownie experience, we were to chicken to try brownies anywhere else 
 in case they were the same! Overall, the dining at Crystal Palace 
 was a wonderful experience. It was nice to know that we had our own 
 chef to look after us.

We had 
 our second table service at Tony&apos;s Town Square. This is 
 a cute Lady and the Tramp themed restaurant. Everyone remembers that 
 cute spaghetti dinner at Tony&apos;s where they kiss. The have a variety 
 of options at this location, even boasting GF meatballs. The items 
 we choose were chicken parmesan, shrimp scampi, and macaroni and cheese. 
 They do carry those fabulous dinner rolls at this location. Have I 
 mentioned you need to try them, yet? Every table service we attended 
 had the fabulous rolls. We always ordered seconds. Overall, the food 
 here was ho-hum. The sauces didn&apos;t have much flavor and the veggies 
 in the shrimp scampi were odd. Instead of the traditional garlic flavor 
 it was overpowered by sun dried tomatoes and asparagus. It reminded 
 me of a pasta primavera and not shrimp scampi.

Our quick 
 service meal at Cosmic Ray&apos;s was good. We had great customer 
 service. As soon as we walked in and told the attendant we were GF, 
 she handled our order from start to finish. So, even though it&apos;s 
 a quick service location you are treated as thought it is table service 
 with them bringing your meal out to you. They do carry GF rolls here 
 and can do everything but chicken nuggets. The children&apos;s menu 
 at this location was limited to hamburger or hotdog, though. We ordered 
 a rib meal, bbq pulled pork sandwich, and a hotdog. I don&apos;t know 
 if they heat the rolls differently here or what. It wasn&apos;t good, 
 though. They fall apart and you&apos;re better off eating the meal 
 minus the rolls. I did notice that the rolls at the table service 
 locations were wonderful but at the quick service locations throughout 
 Disney World it was better to eat just the meat.

Our second 
 quick service meal was at the Columbia Harbor House . This was 
 definitely our best quick service experience of our whole trip. Honestly, 
 the GF selection was limited. What the menu lacked in variety the 
 staff made up for in customer service. We had the pleasure of meeting 
 Edward from Warren Robbins, WA. He was by far the most attentive manager 
 we&apos;d come across. He pulled out the books to go over safe options 
 with us. We ordered chicken tenders, and the Garden Harvest salad 
 substituting the chicken tenders on it, as well. He came out while 
 our food was cooking to double check one of the items on the salad 
 to be sure it was safe. I questioned whether they had fries at this 
 location since he hadn&apos;t mentioned it earlier. He stated that 
 they did. When our order came out I was surprised to see fries there 
 since we technically hadn&apos;t ordered them. Edward brought them 
 out since I had asked about them, though. The chicken tenders were 
 great. Definitely one of the best GF varieties I&apos;ve ever tried. 
 The dessert options here were limited to applesauce or grapes. The 
 kid&apos;s meal came with carrots and grapes. Edward checked on us 
 several times during our meal. Once we done eating he came over and 
 chatted with for quite awhile. He mentioned the training they go through 
 to be aware of food sensitivities, etc. He spoke of his long and happy 
 career with the Disney family. He also told us about the chefs that 
 get assigned to each allergy family as they come into an establishment. 
 At the end of the meal he brought out some of the trading pins to 
 get our girls started on their own collection. If you have the good 
 fortune of meeting Edward during your visit, consider yourself lucky!

 Animal 
 Kingdom 

We chose 
 to eat at the Yak and Yeti . Numerous items could be made GF 
 here. The flavoring would primarily be tamarind based. I was disappointed 
 that none of the interesting tamarind or maple flavors could be used. 
 I guess they just stock blends instead of having separate containers 
 of the maple or tamarind. This was probably the most disappointing 
 table service of our entire stay. The food was so bland. You can usually 
 taste ginger and garlic in the sauces. All of the dishes had the same 
 boring flavor. The chef essentially just made tamari gravy that he 
 poured over the entrees. The flavor could have been so much better 
 if some ginger or garlic were added. We ordered beef and broccoli, 
 Mahi Mahi, and a kid&apos;s vegetable lo mein. Can you see the vegetable&apos;s 
 in the lo mein? Neither could we. Thankfully we ordered broccoli and 
 carrots as the sides with her meal. The fish was cooked well but the 
 sauce didn&apos;t add anything to it. The beef and broccoli was bland. 
 I will give them credit for having tasty sorbets for dessert. Mango, 
 Raspberry, and lemon sorbet&apos;s to choose from. Yummy!

For dinner 
 we ate at the Flame Tree BBQ . It was simple but yummy. We ordered 
 ribs and chicken there. The food was well cooked, the ribs had a good 
 smoke on them, and the chicken was nice and tender. This is an excellent 
 GF option. If you enjoy BBQ be sure to stop by this quick service 
 restaurant. You will not be disappointed.

 Hollywood 
 Studio&apos;s 

Our first 
 table service dinner was at Mama Melrose&apos;s . They carry 
 GF pasta at this location and have numerous GF options for entrees 
 and dessert. They can even do fried calamari, chicken parmesan, or 
 eggplant. The chef uses a rice flour blend on them. For dessert you 
 can have a chocolate flourless cake that&apos;s not even on the menu, 
 creme limone with whipped cream and berries, and various gelatos. 
 We ordered the wood grilled shrimp pasta, Fra Diavolo, and spaghetti 
 w/ tomato sauce. This was a great meal and the calamari so very yummy.

Our second 
 table service was at the Sci Fi Diner . The food here was fair 
 at best. If you choose to go to this restaurant just remember that 
 you are going for the atmosphere and not the food. We ordered a pasta 
 primavera, steak, and a hot dog.

Our first 
 quick service experience was at Pizza Planet . We had difficulties 
 with the young cast member taking our order. We were already used 
 to dealing with the managers as soon as we walked in and that is what 
 we expected. When we stated that we are GF, the girl stated it was 
 fine that she could take our order. So, we attempted to order. Then 
 the girl told us that GF could NOT be accommodated on a kid&apos;s 
 meal. I told her that our entire party is GF, though. She said,sorry 
 but we can&apos;t do it. I requested to speak to the manager. 
 The girl got an attitude and stated,The answer is going to 
 be the same but fine I&apos;ll go and get her. Pizza Planet 
 is a pizza place and a large arcade restaurant. Do you really think 
 that we chose this restaurant? Heck no, our kid wanted this one. When 
 the manager came out I explained that our entire party if GF. I then 
 told her that the cast member stated GF was not possible on a kid&apos;s 
 meal. The manager apologized and gave our daughter the GF pizza kid&apos;s 
 meal. The manager even threw in some yummy all fruit bars for dessert 
 that aren&apos;t even on the menu. I was thankful that the manager 
 dealt with the situation accordingly.

Our second 
 quick service experience was at the Back Lot Express . Not only 
 do they have a dedicated fryer for GF, they also have a nice southwest 
 salad with corn chip strips and a chimichurri dressing. Dessert here 
 is limited to pudding or grapes. The only child&apos;s menu option 
 is chicken nuggets with fries, carrots, or grapes. They do have hot 
 dogs and burgers on the menu here but, that is not an option for the 
 kid&apos;s meal.

Hollywood 
 Studios is the one park that needs to be more accommodating to kid&apos;s 
 GF requests. Pizza Planet didn&apos;t want to accommodate a GF kid&apos;s 
 meal. At two other quick service locations (Back Lot Express and Studio 
 Catering Company) there was only one kid&apos;s meal option. What 
 are you supposed to do if your child doesn&apos;t want chicken?

 Epcot 

We had 
 a character dining at the Akershurs restaurant in Norway . The 
 best thing about this dining experience is that the princesses are 
 present and stop by every table. Before you are led to your table 
 you have your picture taken with a princess. Surprisingly, you are 
 given the picture for free. Yep, you read that correctly. You get 
 the princess picture for free. This is a buffet setting. The chef 
 came out and discussed our menu options with us. Since the buffet 
 didn&apos;t look like there was much chance of cross contamination, 
 I followed the chef&apos;s assessment and just ate from the buffet 
 instead of getting fresh items from the back. I would love to be able 
 to say that is was a safe dining experience. However, I cannot. I 
 believe I was contaminated at this meal. I do appreciate the fact 
 that they really do try hard to keep you safe, though. Unfortunately, 
 following this meal, I got to be very familiar with the restroom. 
 The meal was tasty and would been great aside from the probable contamination 
 issue. The only dessert options were chocolate flourless cake and 
 rice cream with berries.

Our second 
 table service was at the Coral Reef . Once again the chef came 
 out to discuss menu options and to take our order. Out of all of the 
 menu&apos;s that we had encountered over the trip, this menu appears 
 to have the most GF options. We ordered the pan seared catch of the 
 day (Grouper), seared Ahi Tuna, and Mahi Mahi. The food was all cooked 
 wonderfully. Once again we received a nice big basket of tapioca rolls. 
 The dessert options were crcme brulee, chocolate flourless cake, and 
 sorbet. This was our best meal of the entire trip.

 Port 
 Orlean&apos;s Riverside ResortRiverside Mill Food Court 

We had 
 a couple of meals at our resort. It was not on the list of restaurants 
 accommodating GF options however, Boatwright&apos;s was on the list. 
 So, maybe they grabbed the chef from Boatwright&apos;s? As soon as 
 the staff at the food court knows that you are GF, they get the chef 
 for you. The chef goes over the various options with you. At breakfast 
 we were able to order pancakes and waffles. They come with sausage, 
 bacon, and fresh fruit. The bacon here is paper thin. Other items 
 available at breakfast include eggs, omelets, and potato wedges.

For lunch 
 the chef came out to go over our options again. He had me follow him 
 over to the salad station so he could make my grilled chicken salad. 
 The chef waved me to the front so I could tell him what I wanted on 
 my salad.

In closing, 
 I would just like to say, Disney World does care and goes out of their 
 way to ensure a safe GF vacation. Be sure to make reservations at 
 the dining locations and let them know when you&apos;ll be there. 
 If you&apos;ve been considering a Disney vacation, go for it. You 
 won&apos;t be disappointed.

 
 A Gluten-Free Disney Dining Experience

 Christie, October 2008 

We have been big Disney fans since our first visit in 1992. Since then, we&apos;ve been annually vacationing with the mouse. But when I was diagnosed with celiac disease this summer, I was suddenly dreading being away from my safe gluten-free kitchen during our planned October vacation. After reading everything I could find about vacationing gluten-free, I was happy to learn that Disney has an excellent reputation for allergy awareness.

 Planning in advance - With that being said, I took the advice of others on this site and made sure that all of our table seating reservations were marked with my special dietary requirement and gluten intolerance. I also emailed Disney and was sent a list of all the foods that they carried in the parks which would be safe, all the places that I could eat, and a list of all the gluten-free substitutions that they have in the restaurants (such as Ener-G tapioca rolls, Amy&apos;s pizza dough, gluten-free brownies, rice flour, etc.).

Next, I made an effort to contact all of the chefs at the restaurants where we had table seating reservations. Because of my work schedule, it was a bit hard to get in touch (I would recommend around 4PM), but I was able to speak with Chef Phillip from Citricos in advance. My phone conversation with him was wonderful. He put my mind completely at ease and told me all of the things I could eat (the list was endless). We had reservations for Citricos on my birthday so I asked if it might be possible to have a special dessert (preferably something chocolate!). He told me that would not be a problem at all, and came up with a flourless cake, while speaking with his sous-chef, Eddy.

Despite all the wonderful things I had heard and my great experience with the chefs and managers so far, I was still nervous and wanted to bring some snacks with us (just incase). I was also happy to find out that although Disney does not usually allow outside food, they do let guests with special dietary needs bring snacks into the parks. So I packed up some gluten-free granola, energy bars, and crackers, and was on my way!

 Arrival - This was our first DVC trip and we stayed at Saratoga Springs. It happened to be excellent timing as it was great to have the fully equipped kitchen (fridge, microwave, stove, sink, dishwasher, etc.) and we stocked up on a few things to make dining easier. The convenience store at Saratoga carried Yoplait yogurt (labeled gluten free) in peach and berry flavor. I had that with my gluten-free granola for breakfast daily. They also had gluten free brownies and Lays Stax potato chips (made on dedicated equipment and marked naturally gluten free). However, my favorite thing was that the bar at Saratoga Springs (Turf Club Lounge) carried Redbridge gluten-free beer. This was excellent news and throughout my trip, I was able to relax near the pool and enjoy a delicious cold one!

 Citricos (Grand Floridian) –My birthday dinner was amazing! As soon as we arrived, I reminded the hostess of my gluten intolerance (which I recommend doing at all restaurants). She was very friendly and said that she would make sure our server knew and that the chef would come out to meet us. For drinks, I started out with a Citricos bellini (made with champagne, peaches, and raspberries); our server checked to make sure that it was not a packaged mix and that it would be naturally gluten-free. The head chef, Phillip, came out to our table and walked me through the menu. Since everything was made fresh, there was very little that I wouldn&apos;t be able to have. I opted for the naturally gluten-free Filet Giardiniere (Filet of Beef with House-cured Vegetables, Quattro Formaggi Crushed Potatoes and Veal Glacéde Viande). It was delicious and by far, the best meal I had eaten in quite some time. For dessert, sous-chef Eddy brought me out a chocolate flourless cake that he had specially made for my birthday. It was a molten chocolate cake with a lava center and was exceptional! I almost cried because it was so wonderful and they made me feel so special. The chefs really went out of their way to create such an enjoyable experience, but they do it in such a gracious manner and act like it&apos;s no trouble at all. Truly magical!

 Turf Club Lunch (Saratoga Springs) –Once again, the chef came out right away to discuss menu options with me. Since it was only lunch and I really wanted to try these Ener-G rolls, I opted for the Angus Chuck Cheeseburger - topped with cheddar cheese and applewood smoked bacon. I also had the french fries since the chef assured me that they were safe (dedicated fryer, new oil, and a guarantee that he would prepare them himself). Once again, my meal was very yummy. The bun wasn&apos;t bad at all and was basically masked by the excellent flavor of the cheeseburger. The fries were also crisped to perfection.

 Flying Fish (Boardwalk) –After such a delicious and filling lunch, we were looking for something light for dinner. The chef came out to speak with me and recommended the Potato-Wrapped Red Snapper, served over a Creamy Leek Fondue, with a Veal Glace, Red Wine, and Cassis Butter Sauce. I decided to try it and wasn&apos;t disappointed. At first, I found the snapper to be a bit dry, but realized that it was really meant to be paired with the leek fondue. Eating the two in unison greatly enhanced the experience and dinner was once again, very good. We were too stuffed to even attempt dessert at this point.

 Flame Tree BBQ (Animal Kingdom) –This was a previous favorite of mine and one that I was looking forward to trying gluten-free. However, I must say that the experience was not as fabulous as I had hoped. We arrived for lunch a bit early (around 11AM–I had heard that it&apos;s usually best to go before or after peak hours in order to speak with the manager). It wasn&apos;t too crowded yet and the manager came out and showed us a book with all of the ingredients for their menu choices. The St. Louis Ribs were safe, but the BBQ sauce and baked beans were questionable (due to modified food starch). Also, they are no longer serving corn on the cob and now just have a corn muffin, which I couldn&apos;t have. I ordered the ribs (listed as ribs only–allergy), but without the sauce, beans, and muffin, it was a bit plain and not so appetizing. I did however see someone with a mixed greens salad (with chicken) that looked quite good. I think I would opt for that choice next time.

 Turf Club Dinner (Saratoga Springs) –Amazing! I didn&apos;t expect to enjoy this restaurant because of its fairly standard American fare, but the food was truly outstanding and the staff was exceptional! Our chef, Ron, came out to meet us right away and reviewed all of the menu choices. There wasn&apos;t a thing that I couldn&apos;t have! He offered to make rice pasta, gluten-free flat bread, crab cakes or fried calamari (with rice four), and said he could alter any menu choice accordingly. I decided to go with the Free-Range Chicken Breast - stuffed with sun-dried tomato pesto and goat cheese with roasted garlic risotto and balsamic glaze. Because the stuffing would have breadcrumbs, Ron made me two grilled chicken breasts topped with the pesto and goat cheese served alongside the risotto. I also had a mixed greens salad with a lemon-poppy vinaigrette dressing for an appetizer. And finally, Ron made me a special gluten-free brownie sundae (topped with Edy&apos;s ice cream) for dessert. I really enjoyed this meal and can&apos;t rave enough about the excellent service that I received!!

 Artist Palette Lunch (Saratoga Springs) –At first, I was a little nervous about eating here because the counter service did not seem to really cater to special dietary requirements. But boy was I wrong! We once again asked to speak with a manager, but the server said that she would instead send out the chef to discuss my needs. And what do u know, Ron came out to meet us! He was just as gracious as the night before and said that he could make any sandwich, salad or PIZZA that I wanted. Since swimming was on the list for today and I had such a big meal for dinner, I chose the House Salad with grilled chicken (served with the citrus vinaigrette, dried cranberries, dried blueberries, diced apples and chopped walnuts). Ron also waited in line with us to make sure that the cashier properly submitted the allergy requirement. Our food was served very quickly and was once again delicious!

 Yachtsman Steakhouse (Yacht Club) –Our waiter here was a long time Disney employee and was very knowledgeable regarding my gluten-free requirement. He brought out some Ener-G tapioca rolls right away and had the chef come out to meet me. The chef went through the menu and showed me what food I should avoid (this list here was a bit longer than other Disney restaurants and the chef did not seem to know how to alter anything that was normally made with flour, but this was OK because it was a steakhouse and the best meals were gluten free anyway–I was just happy that he knew about cross contamination and made sure that everything would be prepared safely). I started out with the Chilled Seafood Salad (Lobster, Shrimp and Jumbo Crab with Lemon Créme Fraiche and Avocado Cream–naturally gluten free). I had never had anything similar and it was excellent. For my entrée, I chose to eat the Yachtsman Filet Mignon, an 8-ounce Filet with Mashed Potatoes and a Red Wine Sauce. This was very good (although my similar meal at Citricos was admittedly better). I also had the crème brulee for dessert, which was outstanding. During dinner, the chef came out again to make sure that I was enjoying everything and that all the food was prepared to my satisfaction. I greatly appreciated this customer service and attention to detail–it really is the Disney Difference.

 Snacks –I had a variety of different snacks throughout my stay. Some of my favorites were the pineapple and vanilla swirl Dole Whip at Aloha Isle in Adventureland (Magic Kingdom) and the chocolate/caramel popcorn that I had in Epcot (this was a prepackaged bag that could be found in most convenience stores).

Overall, I was able to eat well and safely throughout my entire trip. I&apos;m very happy to say that this experience exceeded all of my expectations and I can&apos;t wait to travel back to Disney World again soon!
 
Sandy Morris&apos;GF Dining in DisneyAdventure

 February 2007 

 Cinderella&apos;s 
 Castle for Dinner - It 
 was unfortunate that we were REALLY hungry arriving at the castle 
 for dinner, as it took quite a while to get to the actual food. If 
 our tummies hadn&apos;t been so rumbly, we would have been able to 
 enjoy the ambience of the castle, with its suits of armor and stained 
 glass windows depicting scenes from Cinderella. We would have been 
 more patient while we waited for Cinderella to return from hertea 
 breakso we could have our picture taken. I&apos;d have rather 
 skipped the picture and gone straight to the food, but when we attempted 
 to storm the castle, we were promptly returned back to the queue to 
 wait for Her Majesty.



Since 
 I have to have a gluten-free diet, they sent a chef around to my tableeventually. 
 To be fair, he showed up long before our actual server. Again, we 
 were cranky from hunger and unable to properly enjoy the experience. 
 But at last the food arrived, and all the problems magically disappeared.



The chef 
 went over the menu with me and showed me which entrees and sides were 
 ok for me, and allowed me to mix and match to create a safe and enjoyable 
 meal. This is a fixed price meal with an appetizer/salad, entrée, 
 and dessert.



I began 
 with the BLT Salad, which sounds heavy, but was actually very light 
 and refreshing. It was a small salad of lettuce and spinach, topped 
 with bacon, tomato, and egg with a roasted shallot vinaigrette. This 
 was my only safe choice among the appetizers, but it was what I would 
 have ordered anyway, and it was delicious.



For my 
 entrée, I had the pork tenderloin, which is normally served 
 with orzo, but I substituted smoked corn polenta, resulting in the 
 best meal I had inside the Magic Kingdom park. It was fabulous, and 
 with yummy food in my tummy, my mood was definitely on an upswing.



I think 
 the disappointment on my face must have been pretty obvious when the 
 chef said the only dessert he had for me was raspberry sorbet, so 
 he immediately offered to bring me strawberries with whipped cream 
 instead. I agreed and it was delicious, though I have to admit, I 
 later saw a server bringing a raspberry sorbet to another customer, 
 and it actually looked really good.



The food 
 in the castle is great, but the high price tag is really for the show. 
 The Fairy Godmother and the two girl mice from the Cinderella movie 
 do a floor show that is very uplifting and funny. Afterwards, everyone 
 had the opportunity to take pictures of the characters, so it was 
 great scrapbooking material as well.



I would 
 highly recommend this meal for all GF adults.





 Crystal 
 Palace - Everywhere we went, my GF needs were already in the computer 
 and the servers did not need to be made aware of it. Instead of having 
 the server try to figure out what might be safe, they let me know 
 as soon as I sat down that a chef would be out to talk to me. I greatly 
 appreciate this, even though it meant I often had to wait; at home 
 I am always encounteringhelpfulservers who are certain 
 they know what I can eat and are reluctant to let me talk to someone 
 in the kitchen.



At the 
 Crystal Palace , the chef walked me through the buffet line, showing 
 me which foods were safe for me. He offered to make me a waffle or 
 pancake, which I declined, but I accepted his offer of tapioca dinner 
 rolls. I ate bacon, potatoes, eggs, and lots of fruit, but I was especially 
 happy with the rolls, which I ate four of.



The Crystal 
 Palace is a character breakfast with Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and Tigger. 
 In addition to the picture taking at each table, the characters also 
 lead the children on a parade throughout the restaurant, which makes 
 a great energetic start to the day.



I recommend 
 Crystal Palace for its fun atmosphere and quantity of food. The food 
 quality is good, but not memorable; however, if you are not eating 
 breakfast at Cinderella&apos;s or Chef Mickey&apos;s, this is a good 
 choice.



 Boma 
 -- Boma 
 is a hotel restaurant located in the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I was really 
 excited about Boma, but I&apos;m afraid it didn&apos;t live up to 
 my expectations. For starters, it&apos;s hard to get to. Animal Kingdom 
 Lodge is located out in the middle of nowhere and to get there from 
 the Polynesian, we had to first take a boat to the MK (believe it 
 or not, the monorail was broken), then take a bus from the MK to Animal 
 Kingdom, stopping at Blizzard Beach along the way.



So on 
 to Boma! I had read that instead of a buffet line, Boma was set up 
 in stations calledpodsthroughout the restaurant, with 
 chefs nearby to tell you about the dishes. Well, guess whatbuffet line. No pods, no chefs, just a standard buffet line, with 
 placards to tell you what you are eating. Don&apos;t know what Kofta 
 is? Salaai? Too bad. You are going to have to go track down your server 
 and ask him.



Of course, 
 I had a chef to take me through and tell me what was safe, thank goodness. 
 I would have been lost trying to make guesses on my own. However, 
 I didn&apos;t really get a lot of information on the actual food, 
 just if it was safe or not. The meats (salmon and beef) were not GF, 
 but the chef offered to make me a piece of either without seasoning. 
 I decided instead to go vegetarian for this meal and broaden my culinary 
 horizons, which is why I was in an African restaurant to begin with.



I had 
 Avocado, Papaya, and Grapefruit Salad, some Saffron Rice, Potatoes 
 WithAfritude,and FuFu, which is a combination of white 
 potatoes and yams, mashed together. (Really delicious!) I Googled 
 FuFu when I got home. Apparently the term refers to a wide variety 
 of dishes, many of which contain wheat, so I would not assume this 
 is safe to eat without double checking, even at Boma.



I had 
 some stir-fry vegetables, which were surprisingly spicy, like there 
 was a hot pepper of some kind in it. There was an impressive array 
 of desserts that I, of course, had to pass over. I was able to have 
 rice pudding (the sticky kind with raisins) and some small flourless 
 brownies that tasted like they were made on sugar, butter, and cocoa 
 powder and nothing else. It was very flat, so I don&apos;t think there 
 were any leavening ingredients in them. Very yummy.



Our server 
 was a fabulous gentleman who was also celiac. When pressed, he admitted 
 that he does not generally find much he can eat at Boma, as he is 
 also diabetic and lactose intolerant. I gave him my deepest sympathies 
 and wished him healthy eating.





 Flame 
 Tree BBQ - Flame 
 Tree BBQ is a counter service restaurant in Animal Kingdom, which 
 I had previously passed over as it appeared to have no seating. It 
 actually has ample outdoor seating behind the restaurant, including 
 tables next to a beautiful fountain (with ducks!) or by the lagoon, 
 with a perfect view of Mt Everest. It was a lovely peaceful oasis 
 away from the crowds.



I knew 
 the St Louis Ribs were GF, but I wasn&apos;t sure if the baked beans 
 were, so I skipped them. The ribs were great. My daughter and I shared 
 a plate and devoured them quickly. She got my corn on the cob, so 
 I can&apos;t report on that. My son&apos;s kid meal came with carrots 
 and grapes, so I shared those with him and let her have the corn. 
 I 
 have eaten at Tusker House on previous trips, and I am so glad to 
 have found a replacement. I recommend Flame Tree instead.



 Victoria 
 and Albert&apos;s - Victoria&amp;Albert&apos;s is Disney&apos;s premier restaurant, in their 
 Grand Floridian hotel. This is one of those Special Occasion, Once 
 In A Lifetime kind of restaurants. Unless you think nothing of dropping 
 $500 for dinner for two, in which case, can you please take me with 
 you?



Let&apos;s 
 start with the price, or else you won&apos;t read any farther. How 
 do we get to 500 bucks? This 
 is a fixed price menu at $115 per guestin other words, $230 
 for two. Add 
 in winealthough you can order by the glass, the full experience 
 requires the wine pairing. This gives you a new glass of wine with 
 each of your seven courses, each specially selected to complement 
 that food. Wine pairing adds $60 per guest, bringing our total to 
 350 smackers.



But wait! 
 There&apos;s more! Not all the items on the menu are included in the 
 price. Some items have a surcharge. If you want to have Iranian Oestra 
 Caviar as your appetizer, that will add $112 to your total price. 
 We skipped the caviar, but chose toswallowa couple of 
 surcharges. I added on $15 for Foie Gras, on the chef&apos;s recommendation 
 that it was the best thing on the menu, and another $30 for Australian 
 Kobe Beef Tenderloin, the famously pricey steak. My husband chose 
 to add a $20 surcharge for Seared Wild Turbot, a fish that neither 
 of us had ever heard of, let alone tasted. The chef described it as 
 tasting more like butter than like fish, and he was right. So, now 
 we&apos;ve added $65 to our bill bringing us to $415, and now we have 
 to tip for the best service of our life. 20% of $415 comes in just 
 under $500.



Now, 
 is it worth it? As a once-in-a-lifetime-special-occasion? YES! It 
 was absolutely incredible and we ate until we were in physical pain. 
 It was the most extravagant, sensual, incredible experience of our 
 lives. Every serving was a work of art, visually and gastronomically.



The menu 
 at V&amp;A changes nightly. The server presented us each with our 
 own personalized menu. They were the same except that mine had fewer 
 dessert choices. Our server explained that the chef would prepare 
 anything on my menu and ensure it was GF. I 
 don&apos;t think I have enough adjectives to go through everything 
 we ate, but I&apos;ll touch on the highlights. Seared 
 Colorado Buffalo Tenderloin, Braised Fennel, Radishes, and Satsuma 
 Tangerine Vinaigretteincredible!

Foie 
 Gras with Fuji Apple Tart and Mostarda di Cremonawe paid the 
 surcharge of $15 for this one and I think it was worth it. The Foie 
 Gras was too rich for me to take more than a couple bites, but I really 
 enjoyed the apples which were soaked in the meat drippings. My husband 
 finished the Foie Gras for me and was even more wild for it than I 
 was.

The Kobe 
 Beef Tenderloin was excellent, but I&apos;m not sure it was worth 
 the $30 surcharge. The fame surrounding this beef has to do with the 
 cattle which receive regular massages and are fed beer along with 
 their feed. I think I&apos;d rather be a Kobe cow than eat one. The 
 Cauliflower Puree that came with it, though, was divine.

Mark 
 had a cheese plate that included Pierre Robert cheese, which he fell 
 in love with. It was served with an amazing 1963 vintage Sandeman 
 Port, which has forever changed how we view port. Mark actually got 
 on the web to see if we could buy it, but it is rare and when available, 
 goes for upward of $200 a bottle. I had coconut gelato with micro 
 garden mint, which was fabulous, and it was served with a Moscato 
 D&apos;Asti champagne.

Mark&apos;s 
 desert was off the menu for me, but bears mentioning simply because 
 of its incredible presentation. A pyramid of Tanzanie Dark Chocolate 
 Mousse was topped with a small edible gold flag. (Yes, real 24k gold.) 
 Along the sides of the pyramid was chopped strawberries and chocolate 
 sauce. The backdrop to this confection was a looming wafer-cookie, 
 with a picture of Cinderella&apos;s Castle and the wordsDreams 
 Come True.Back 
 in the world of the celiac, I had vanilla crème brulee, which 
 was very good, but I couldn&apos;t eat very much at that point as 
 I was so incredibly full.



It is 
 incredible to me that I got to eat a meal like this and never once 
 worry about it making me sick. It&apos;s even more incredible that 
 I could eat off such an extensive menu without once askingcan 
 you check to see if this is thickened with flour?This is proof 
 that food does not have to be tasteless to be GF. Worth every penny, 
 even if you leave penniless.



 Ohana 
 Breakfast - Ohana 
 was a favorite of mine BC (Before Celiac) and I was disappointed that 
 it was off limits now (soy sauce city), but I was able to book us 
 for a character breakfast there. The characters are Mickey, Pluto, 
 Lilo, and Stitch. Adding to the fun, the kids get maracas to follow 
 the characters around the restaurant in a musical parade. This was 
 a pretty ordinary breakfast, the one exception being the Ohana Juice, 
 a mixture of orange, guava, and passion fruit, which is pretty darn 
 tasty.

Because 
 the meal is served family style, with the biscuits and waffles all 
 piled up on top of one big skillet, the chef brought me my own plate 
 with scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. The sausage was also GF, 
 but I&apos;m not a big sausage fan. It was hot and fresh and tasty. 
 Still, 
 if you are not traveling with a child under the age of 10, there is 
 no point in stopping here. The main attraction here is the characters.



 Chef 
 Mickey&apos;s - This 
 is probably the most fun restaurant in all of Disney, with upbeat 
 music, a dessert buffet and make-your-own Sundae station, and most 
 importantly, plenty of face time with the Mouse Himself.



There 
 were plenty of things I could eat on the buffet (prime rib, mashed 
 potatoes, veggies), although I worried about cross-contamination. 
 The chef here did not offer to bring me food from the back, but he 
 probably would have if I had asked. He did bring me a gluten-freebrowniefor dessert. It was a thick slice of dense, fudge-y 
 chocolate that was more like a decadence cake than an actual brownie.



If you 
 have children of any age, a group, or are looking for an upbeat party-atmosphere, 
 Chef Mickey&apos;s is a must-do. Romantic couples, on the other hand, 
 would probably do better to look elsewhere.



 Chip 
 and Dale&apos;s Harvest Feast at the Garden Grill - This 
 character lunch/dinner is located in The Land pavilion in Epcot. The 
 restaurant rotates (very very slowly) above the Living With The Land 
 attraction, providing a glimpse of the ride below. Chip, Dale, Mickey, 
 and Pluto were on hand that day, coming to each table for pictures 
 and autographs. This meal is normally served family-style and includes 
 flank steak, turkey, and fried catfish. However, since I needed a 
 GF meal, they brought out our food on separate plates. There were 
 several things on my husband&apos;s plate that I couldn&apos;t have 
 (buttermilk biscuits, catfish, bread pudding), but my own food was 
 delicious. The mushroom sauce normally served on the beef is not GF, 
 so my serving was plain, but it was still great, like beef brisket 
 without the BBQ sauce. The turkey with cranberry sauce was moist and 
 tasty and the mashed potatoes were a great compliment to the meal. 
 The waitress also brought me GF rolls (the same tapioca rolls I had 
 at Crystal Palace ) and offered to make me a dessert, but I was stuffed.

This 
 is for the Celiac page (there are three reviews there, and I hoped 
 to add to that with this blog link that shows pictures of what we 
 ate in Disneyworld as well as brief descriptions)

We ate 
 Gluten free and Dairy free, so this would be useful info for those 
 with Celiac, Autism and other dairy/wheat allergies.

 August 2006 

We 
 were incredibly surprised by the overwhelming support of my wife&apos;s 
 celiac&apos;s disease. Most experiences were excellent, some were horrible.

In general, 
 when booking a reservation, tell them you have a food allergy, and 
 list Celiac&apos;s disease. We were told once there that buffet places 
 are much better, because they have a very well equipped kitchen, and 
 even if they have limited selections at the buffet, with so many ingredients 
 in the kitchen, they can prepare lots of variety to bring out to you.

We ate 
 at Cape May (Beach Club) - just ok overall, but they were very 
 very accomodating, and made my wife her own salmon plate, salads, 
 and mussels.

 Hoop 
 de Doo Review - none of the served food was Gluten Free, so they 
 call ahead a day before and asked what you&apos;d like. My wife asked for 
 grilled veggies, ribs, chicken - and got mountains of it all. Her 
 food was miles better than the rest of ours (looking back, I might 
 be tempted to say we were all need that custom meal, cause it was 
 awesome).

 Boma - wow. The food was awesome for our tastes. It was tough to have 
 to skip the couscous, and many breads, etc - but still crazy amounts 
 of tasty foods that were gluten free. They also brought out a gluten 
 free cake that was phenomenal.

 Chef 
 Mickeys / Crystal Palace - both Character dining buffets. Pretty 
 good food, and decent gluten free selection.

 Dining 
 with Cinderella in the Castle - my wife sent her food back, and 
 didn&apos;t eat (we got our money back for her meal). We got the impression 
 that all food is premade, and assembled before service. She ordered 
 the same as me, and got the meat only on the potatoes, with no garnish 
 or sauce. It was really really pathetic. For such an expensive meal, 
 what a disappointment.

For Counter 
 Services - you can walk up and ask for a list of ingredients because 
 you have a food allergy. You can have look at the menu and figure 
 out what you can eat, and get it. That&apos;s hard-ish - because it takes 
 some time to get that, scrub it, and then if you find that you can&apos;t 
 eat there, you have to do it again. The wood fired oven-cooked gluten 
 free pizza at Pizza Planet (MGM) WAS awesome. So were the ribs at 
 Flame Tree (Animal Kingdom). The chef at the Port Orleans French Quarter 
 was very very nice and cooked my wife a very good chicken and salad 
 lunch, and gave her a WICKED good gluten free cheesecake. He was super, 
 and will make stuff to order with any advance noticed (he offered 
 gluten free pancakes for breakfast, but it was our last day).

All in 
 all - getting the dining plan and eating at disney was wonderful.

 2006 

After 
 having been to Disney World several times with my family, we faced 
 a new challenge in 2005, when my 8yr old daughter was diagnosed with 
 Celiac Disease.

Being 
 an avid planner, I took on the challenge of ensuring that our annual 
 trip to Disney World would be just as wonderful, as it was each and 
 every other time. Plus, I didn&apos;t want my daughter to feel deprived 
 in any way, as a result of having her dining options limited. I researched 
 our options feverishly for months, and I can honestly say, that it 
 was well worth it in the end.

Here 
 are some helpful tips and some information, for anyone who is traveling 
 to Disney World with a child, (or adult), with Celiac Disease.

First 
 and foremost, I must commend Disney&apos;s table-service restaurants, for 
 being extraordinarily knowledgeable and accommodating to our family. 
 They literally came and sat at our table with my daughter, and asked 
 her what she would like, and made some suggestions. Every meal she 
 ate was outstanding. Luckily, my daughter is not a picky eater, so 
 that, I will admit, was very helpful. She&apos;s more inclined to eat mashed 
 potatoes and vegetables, than French fries and chicken nuggets anyways, 
 so that made things easier!

The one 
 thing I do have to say is that you must indicate, if you are making 
 Advance Reservations, that you have a member of your party who has 
 a food allergy, (and yes, be sure to specify Celiac Disease),. When 
 you arrive, you must again remind them of the allergy and ask to speak 
 with the chef. The Chef usually will come to your table when you are 
 seated, and sometimes, they will contact you in advance by phone, 
 as you&apos;ll read below.

We dined 
 at Cinderella&apos;s Royal Table for breakfast, and she had a wonderful 
 breakfast provided to her. The chef came out to greet us and asked 
 all sorts of questions as to what she liked and disliked and seemed 
 fairly knowledgeable about Celiac. She was a little blue, however, 
 that she couldn&apos;t have the croissants, rolls and muffins that were 
 set out for the rest of us on the table, so we asked to have them 
 removed, which they did, and we all abstained.

Breakfast 
 at the Crystal Palace was great and the Chef, again, came to speak 
 with us when we were seated. He took my daughter and I up to the buffet 
 and pointed out what she could and couldn&apos;t have. He offered to make 
 her some GF waffles, which we accepted, and she had a wonderful omelet 
 made for her. You do need to let them know about any allergy, so that 
 they can make it separately, if needed.

We also 
 dined for breakfast at 1900 Park Fare, which was also great. The chef 
 called us at our hotel the day before our reservation, and asked for 
 info on what my daughter liked. When we arrived at the restaurant, 
 we alerted our greeter that we&apos;d need to see the chef, and she came 
 out to walk us through the buffet, and then went to the kitchen to 
 get her special GF waffle. Great service, once again.

We dined 
 at Chef Mickey&apos;s for supper at the Contemporary resort on our first 
 evening of our trip, and it was great. The chef had actually called 
 us at home to go over her preferences, and greeted us when we were 
 seated so that he could walk us through the buffet. Again, he offered 
 to make her GF versions of many of the items in the buffet. Luckily, 
 the adult buffet, with roast prime rib and mashed potatoes is right 
 up my daughter&apos;s alley, so no special requests were necessary.

The 50&apos;s 
 Prime Time Caféwas good for lunch. The chef prepared her GF 
 chicken nuggets and mashed potatoes, and prepared all her favorite 
 veggies as well.

And finally, 
 on our last evening there, we went to the Hoop Dee Doo Revue. The 
 chef called us at our hotel a few days in advance to see what she 
 would like to eat. They made her grilled chicken and peppers, corn 
 on the cob, and rice. For dessert, she had a huge bowl of fresh fruit. 
 We were amazed at the amount and quality of her Gluten free meal. 
 The only down side, was that she had no option for dessert, other 
 than fruit. She was blue again to see all the strawberry shortcake 
 being handed out, so again, two of us abstained, however my 4yr old, 
 HAD to eat it!!

So, the 
 table-service restaurants scored an A+ with regards to their service, 
 attentiveness, and knowledge of my daughter&apos;s allergy. One minor exception 
 being that she couldn&apos;t have strawberry shortcake with her meal at 
 the Hoop Dee Doo Revue. That could be an easy-fix, however, as it 
 is easy to make up GF white cake, and freeze slices of it in the freezer. 
 Then, all that would need to be added would be the strawberries and 
 whipped cream, (provided they are prepared separately from the rest 
 of the strawberry shortcakes, i.e. not using the same utensils to 
 spoon the strawberries or whipped cream on. Also, I am certain that 
 somewhere, some company makes GF frozen strawberry shortcake, or a 
 version of it.),. It must be stressed however, that even if you indicate, 
 when you make your advance reservations, that you have an allergy, 
 you still need to mention to the cast member at the podium when you 
 check in for your reservation, that you will need to see the chef, 
 as well as the cast member who seats you, and your waitress/waiter.

With 
 regards to counter service restaurants, I must say, our favorites 
 were Toy Story Pizza Planet at MGM, and Flame Tree Barbecue at Animal 
 Kingdom. Toy Story Pizza Planet makes GF pizzas that are outstanding, 
 but they take longer to make, as they have to be cooked at Mama Melrose&apos;s, 
 next door. It only takes about 5-7 minutes to wait, and it&apos;s worth 
 it. She was thrilled and it tasted great. We ate there twice during 
 our trip. Flame Tree Barbecue was also great and she had ribs and 
 corn on the cob, along with a delicious cup of frozen lemonade that 
 was so refreshing on a hot October afternoon. It was a great surprise 
 to be eating lunch and have Mickey and Goofy and a few others, float 
 by in a boat. A cast member had alerted us that they&apos;d be coming by, 
 so we were prepared, and it was a great treat. Flame Tree Barbecue 
 and Toy Story were our best counter-service experiences, though I&apos;ll 
 admit, at Flame Tree, they had NO idea what I was talking about, when 
 I mentioned that we had a gluten allergy. I just asked for info on 
 their barbecue sauce for their ribs and left it at that. I would suggest 
 that anyone else do the same, as their ingredients could change.

We went 
 to Liberty Inn at EPCOT, and again, no one knew what we were talking 
 about. Luckily, I carried GF crackers and cookies, etc with us, wherever 
 we went. They did have a designated fryer for people with allergies 
 so French fries were an option. Apparently, they have GF buns for 
 hotdogs, though I wasn&apos;t sure if the wieners were GF, so opted against 
 taking the chance.

We stopped 
 for ice cream at the Plaza Ice Cream shop and, though the older gentleman 
 who worked at the cash had no idea what Celiac or gluten was, he had 
 a book with all the ice creams they had, and it had a listing for 
 what was nut-free, gluten-free, suitable for diabetics, etc. So that 
 was helpful.

And finally, 
 as most Celiacs know, McDonald&apos;s fries are not gluten-free, so the 
 little stands around Disney are now out for those with Celiac.

The popcorn 
 at Magic Kingdom is Orville Redenbacher&apos;s and is GF. So is the Itzakadoozie 
 popsicle, which is available around Disney in the ice cream carts.

The only 
 place where we really noticed a lack of accommodations for gluten 
 allergies was at our hotel, Pop Century. The food court was not accommodating 
 at all, and we really had few, if any options for my daughter. We 
 rarely ate there as a result, though we occasionally picked up fresh 
 fruit and potato chips, and purchased milk to put on her GF cereal 
 that we brought. We had one Caesar salad made to order, and it was 
 quite an ordeal, as they kept trying to put croutons in it. I reiterated 
 how important it was that the salad be made in a clean, fresh bowl 
 with clean, fresh salad tongs. She was ill shortly thereafter, so 
 I&apos;m not too convinced that my request was accommodated well. I had 
 alerted Pop Century that we would be coming in with someone with gluten 
 allergies, and asked if there would be anything that they could provide 
 at the food court such as GF pizza or spaghetti, but no one ever got 
 back to me.

Here 
 are some Disney numbers for contacts regarding dining with allergies, 
 and attending the parks with someone who has allergies:

From 
 Disney.ca:

If you 
 have specific inquiries or would like recommendations regarding the 
 food served at the park restaurants, you are welcome to call the executive 
 chefs or Food and Beverage managers for our theme parks, at the telephone 
 numbers listed below. If no one is immediately available when you 
 call, please be sure to leave a message and a telephone number where 
 you may be reached.

Magic 
 Kingdom Park: 407-824-5967
Epcot: 407-560-7292
Disney-MGM Studios: 407-560-1347
Disney&apos;s Animal Kingdom: 407-939-7536 (Please note Walt Disney World 
 Company operates no full-service restaurants in this park.)

We would 
 also like to mention that as an exception to our standard policy, 
 guests who have specific food allergies are welcome to bring their 
 own small snack items with them into the theme parks.
However, picnic baskets, ice chests, and coolers are not permitted.

Another 
 thing to note, for those on the Disney Dining Plan: We were concerned 
 that our daughter wouldn&apos;t be able to have any of the counter service 
 meals, given the fact that the plan stipulates that children must 
 have a child&apos;s meal. My husband and I had visions of the two us eating 
 cheese pizzas or chicken nuggets for our entire trip, while our daughter 
 ate our adult meals. As you may have noticed, nearly all children&apos;s 
 meals are overloaded with gluten, (PB&amp;J sandwiches, breaded 
 chicken nuggets, hot dogs, and pizzas),. I asked our travel agent, 
 to find out for us if there was any lenience on the policy, and this 
 is what she had to say:&quot;After calling Disney Dining 407WDWDINE 
 they assured me that you will be able to go to any fast food restaurant 
 and talk to the manager if needed. You should be able to get anything 
 suitable for gluten free meals on the menu for your daughter even 
 if it is an adult item.&quot;
