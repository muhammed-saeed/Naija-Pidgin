Pam Daniel

Sarasota&apos;s consuming passion gets respect, with a high-powered
panel on food and wine, this month.

In this job, you go to a lot of receptions, cocktail parties and
dinners, and if nothing else, you learn to listen for what Sarasota
talks about. Some topics come and go--the Ringling Bridge, Katherine
Harris Katherine Harris (born April 5, 1957, Key West, Florida) is a former Secretary of State of Florida and member of the US House of Representatives. Harris won the 2002 election to represent Florida&apos;s 13th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.  and the recent election--but one subject evokes eternal passion,
no matter the occasion or the time of the year. And, no, it isn&apos;t
the arts, or philanthropy or even the stock market. It&apos;s food and
drink that keep this town alive.

man&apos;s relationship with food has always been a &quot;terrible and
passionate drama,&quot; and never more so than now, as everything from
supermarket takeout counters to an entire TV network tout food as epiphany Epiphany   (ĭpĭf`ənē)  [Gr.,=showing], a prime Christian feast, celebrated Jan. 6, called also Twelfth Day or Little Christmas. Its eve is Twelfth Night.  and art, and devotees fight for $300-a-plate meals at culinary

discussions about the latest restaurant, an upcoming wine dinner or even
a tasty new addition to the take-out cases at Morton&apos;s.

This month the Longboat Key Center for the Arts recognizes our
town&apos;s consuming passion with a panel on the latest trends in food
and dining. Italian culinary experts--and Sarasota residents--Marcella
and Victor Hazan, famous for their collaboration on cookbooks, magazine
articles and more, are big fans of the center and organized this event
for its benefit. They&apos;ve assembled an impressive panel of experts.
The panel will be moderated by Pamela Fiori, editor of Town and Country,
and includes my own personal idol, Dorothy Kalins, whose style and
warmth lit up the old Metropolitan Home and have made her new Saveur a
smash hit with those who love great food, design and writing. Also on
the panel, Atlantic Monthly editor Corby Kummer and several local
voices, including mega-restaurateur Michael Klauber-and me.

Properly cowed at the idea of appearing in the company of such
luminaries, I&apos;ve been frantically canvassing food-and-wine
magazines and local experts for something--anything--to contribute. It
didn&apos;t help that the first article I came across was by fellow
panelist Kummer, reminiscing in a recent Gourmet about how he first
savored white truffles in Italy at the age of 16. At that age, my idea
of a culinary adventure was heaping sour cream and chives chives

For many years the franchise&apos;s slogan was &quot;We treat you right!&quot; In recent years, it has been changed to &quot;DQ something different. .

Oh, I&apos;ve progressed since then. I&apos;ve sat in the sunshine
in Provence and made a feast of red wine, fresh tomatoes and fresher
bread. I&apos;ve learned that the darkest winter day in London turns
bright with double cream for breakfast and Guinness ale in the
afternoon. I even went through a brief cooking frenzy a few years ago,
grinding my own spices for Indian curry and starting my daughter&apos;s
friends by preparing a complete South African barbecue for her 16th
birthday. (&quot;Did you ever think about pizza?&quot; she hissed at me,

But recently, with our company s expansion into the Naples market,
I&apos;ve been coming home too late to cook and too tired to go to a
restaurant. Instead we&apos;ve been subsisting on Publix rotisserie

perhaps, but not exactly the sort of thing you&apos;d bring up on a

Or so I thought, until I talked to some food-and-wine insiders who
informed me that my culinary experiences fit right in with some
prevailing trends. Whether it&apos;s because they&apos;re working harder
and longer or because they&apos;re juggling more interests and
activities than ever before, most Americans are cooking less, my sources
told me. That&apos;s true even in a city like Sarasota, where a big
chunk of the population doesn&apos;t work at all.

&quot;I don&apos;t know Don&apos;t know (DK, DKed)

&quot;Don&apos;t know the trade.&quot; A Street expression used whenever one party lacks knowledge of a trade or receives conflicting instructions from the other party.  who cooks anymore,&quot; agrees Phil
Mancini, co-owner of Michael&apos;s On East catering business. &quot;I
don&apos;t know anyone who does.&quot; If anyone knows the kitchen
secrets of Sarasota, it&apos;s Mancini, who orchestrates hundreds of
events every year, from black-tie dinners for a thousand to exclusive
and elegant little soirees. In some Sarasota circles, even dinner
parties at home have become catered events, and that trend seems to be
increasing: Mancini says business is &quot;up 56 percent this year&quot;
with &quot;people fighting to get dates and contracts.&quot;

But if we&apos;re cooking less, we&apos;re eating better--and
that&apos;s not only thanks to Mancini and other restaurant
professionals but also to the ever-expanding shelves at our supermarkets
and specialty grocers. When I was growing up in Chicago, oranges in our
Christmas stockings were an exotic winter treat; now I toss plantains,
papayas and kiwi into my grocery cart and can find everything from
fresh-baked sourdough bread and seaweed salad to just-roasted chickens
and real mashed potatoes n. pl. 1. Potatoes which have been boiled and mashed to a pulpy consistency, usu. with sparing addition of milk, salt, butter, or other flavoring. It is a popular accompaniment to a meat course [U.S., 1900&apos;s], providing bulk and calories to a meal.  at the takeout counter.

Eating isn&apos;t just easier than ever; it&apos;s also more
exciting. Stand before the takeout counters at Morton&apos;s and you can
travel from Greece to Thailand to France just by scanning the
selections. And our eagerness for culinary adventures seems to be
accelerating. Five years ago, would anyone at the corporate offices at
Publix have predicted that sushi would be a staple in this Midwestern,
conservative market?

Mancini sees a similar expansion in his customers&apos; tastes.
Although &quot;meat is still No. 1,&quot; he&apos;s serving an
unprecedented number of fish entrees, and clients of all ages are
clamoring for Asian flavors. New restaurants like downtown&apos;s Silver
Cricket (reviewed in this issue) are attracting crowds with fusion
creations that blend Asian, Pacific and other influences; and even at a
neighborhood bistro like Fred&apos;s, the avocado and crab Napoleon with
mango sometimes outsells the steak.

With such a wealth of flavors and choices, no wonder so many of us
have let our ovens get cold. Yet strangely enough, though families are
shrinking and home cooking is declining, kitchens have never been more
elaborate. Our home and garden editor just returned from touring the
spectacular show kitchens at the Chicago Merchandise Mart--which does a
booming business in Southwest Florida Southwest Florida is a region of Florida located along its gulf coast, south of the Tampa Bay area, west of Lake Okeechobee and mostly north of the Everglades. It consists of five coastal counties from Manatee County south to Collier County, although it sometimes is considered to  kitchens. She reports (see
&quot;Luxury Home,&quot; page 134) that kitchens have become enormous,
extravagant spaces, equipped with every imaginable amenity, from double
sets of commercial-grade ovens to lounging areas with overstuffed o·ver·stuff

 2. To upholster (an armchair, for example) deeply and thickly.  sofas
and roaring fireplaces.

Don&apos;t look for a harried hostess in a smudged apron bending
over those gleaming ovens; instead, these kitchens are &quot;big,
wonderful status symbols,&quot; she says, theatrical sets waiting for
the caterer or personal chef A personal chef is a chef that goes to a client&apos;s home and prepares meals for their client based on their needs and personal preferences. Unlike a private chef that purchases the ingredients, prepares the meal, and cleans up after the dinner, a personal chef will leave meals  to get to work. They&apos;re also
entertainment centers, where friends gather as the hostess arranges the
takeout on the endless granite counter and the host uncorks a vintage
bottle from the climate-controlled wine room.

Okay, so I&apos;m not there yet. But the next time I rush home late
with my Publix sushi, I can at least explain to my ever-patient mate
that we&apos;re actually part of an exciting new culinary trend. Maybe I
can even spread the spicy tuna rolls and the little plastic packets of
