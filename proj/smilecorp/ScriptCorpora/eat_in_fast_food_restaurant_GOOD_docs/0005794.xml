Eating Healthy on a Budget


Think you have to be rich to eat healthy? Think again! Nutritionist and fitness trainer Robert Reames offers tips for eating healthy on a budget:

 Buy in bulk. Separate then freeze and/or refrigerate portions for you and your family. Don&apos;t eat out. Prepare and eat all meals at home from scratch. Profit margins are huge in the restaurant industry overall. Plan so you aren&apos;t stuck overpaying for a meal you really don&apos;t want. Don&apos;t overeat! Portion sizes in America overall are just too large. Don&apos;t eat takeout or delivery. Don&apos;t buy deli concoctions. Take the idea that you see in the deli show case and make your own homemade version. Use a crock pot to prepare many different kinds of soups, stews and sauces for your family. Bake a casserole. You can heat your crock pot for eight hours and it will only cost you 10 cents, whereas it costs 32 cents to run an oven for only an hour. Take lunches to work and/or pack lunches for the kids. Buy fresh foods at farms or farmers markets. Grow your own vegetables and fresh herbs. Make your own salad dressings using olive oil, vinegar and/or nonfat yogurt and your favorite herbs and spices. Eliminate juices, sodas and any other form of processed hydration. You&apos;ll waste tons of cash on these. Stay with fresh water. Flavor with a squeeze of fresh lemon, lime or orange for variation. Buy a thermos or container that you can constantly re-use for water, soup, tea, etc. Eliminate junk and processed foods. Excess sodium and sugar encourage over consumption. Not only are these foods bad value and a waste of money, but they are void of healthy nutrition. Plan your grocery trips out. This will eliminate impulse buying. Also, don&apos;t go to the grocery store hungry. Find one or two places close by to shop at regularly to avoid spending excess gas money on driving around. 

 Foods that are Excellent Value for Money and Nutrition: 

 Chicken, turkey and/or ground versions of these as well as lean ground beef: Buy frozen in bulk or bake a large chicken or turkey, then divide portions and freeze. Eggs: These can be cooked many different ways and used along with other foods. Fresh farmers market or frozen veggies. Beans and brown rice: Add in a frozen or fresh vegetable. Use your own fresh herbs, spices and homemade sauces. Quinoa, couscous or even high-protein/fiber whole wheat pastas in bulk. Homemade soups, casseroles and stews. Look for deals on large bag spinach and lettuce. Iced green tea: A pack of 100 tea bags will cost $10-12 and will make gallons and gallons of tea. If you drink coffee, prepare at home and travel with a thermos. Go out to the country and pick your own fresh fruit, or buy from the grocery store in large bags versus individually. Tuna: This can be used in many different ways. High-fiber oatmeal: You can incorporate some whey protein powder, which can also be purchased in bulk, to add in your protein. Use a Brita filter for fresh water versus buying plastic bottles.
