Good food , great prices. Just the right spice for me. I have been ordering take out for quiet sometime. I usually cut them into two meals (jerk chicken lunch specials) when I&apos;m not hungry.  I see a lot of locals and cars drop by to order take out. They usually have Carribean music playing when dining in.

A friend and me had to pick up her father from work. He also happened to be hungry (it being around 6:30pm), so we all decided to go for food. The two options I proposed were greasy or spicy (Chinese or Caribbean). We decided on Caribbean and so I suggested a little shop I saw by their home called JJJ Jerk Restaurant. My mentality, it&apos;s a small looking place with a few tables, how bad could it be.

First impressions being everything, I should have noticed it said Roti on the sign. I say that because when you walk in you are slapped in the face by a strong smell of curry. Unlike in an Indian restaurant, the smell did fade rather quickly. Behind the counter was a very happy and pleasant Jamaican woman who really loved her job (we assumed she owned the place). It was set up like a fast food place with windowed counters of food, but that did not make us run even though we were looking for fresh.

Both the father and myself got the jerk pork meal (jerk pork, rice and beans, and coleslaw) and my friend got the jerk chicken. My decision to go with pork over chick was very quickly validated when I saw the chicken. It was literally a quarter chicken cut up, bone and all. It looked rather dry and like there was no meat on the bones, and that was confirmed by my friend as well.

The pork on the other hand was rather tasty, even though not even remotely spicy like I have come to expect from jerk. My friend&apos;s father also got cod fritters which he claimed we excellent, I stay away from fish so I wouldn&apos;t know. I got fried plantains on the side which I LOVED during my travels in Costa Rica, but these were just dry and you could tell were sitting out in the glass counter for a while.

To put it as mildly as possible, I was underwhelmed. I have only been to one other jerk fast-food restaurant (that I will review at a later time), but this just doesn&apos;t meet up to even them. A small place like that in Scarborough, I was expecting fresh, and if not fresh than a taste that blew my mind. Instead we all left underwhelmed. Pricing was good, especially for sides which were $1, but they should have been lower for what we were served...
