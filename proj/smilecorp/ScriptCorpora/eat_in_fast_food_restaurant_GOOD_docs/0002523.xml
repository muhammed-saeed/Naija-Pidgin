The Nigerian organised fast food industry is currently worth about N190 billion with the potential to grow bigger. Mrs. Olayinka Adedayo, President, Association of Fast Food and Confectioners of Nigeria (AFFCON), said this at a stakeholders&apos; forum on “Excellence and Quality Consumer Services in the Fast Food Industry,” weekend, at the Golden Gate Paradise, Ikoyi, Lagos.

She said the association was promoting the rich and diverse nutritional culture of the nation through introduction of Nigerian food while our restaurants had become major eateries for Nigerians- young and old, to entertain themselves.

“The restaurant industry has been growing since the 70s and as a result, the industry is healthy.

&quot;Several factors contribute to the consistent growth in the industry. Average disposal income has increased giving families more money to spend on dining out.”

Adedayo stated that the cost difference between eating out and cooking at home had decreased.

People’s lifestyles are getting increasingly hectic. As a result, people no longer have time to cook meals at home.

The food industry was identified as the leading overall employer of labour, looking at the food supply chain from farm to the table.

Virtually all major professionals–scientists, engineers, marketers, accountants, etc are involved.

She explained that at the processing and retailing levels, the fast food industry employs a lot of workers because it is highly labour intensive.

The management of Quick Service Restaurants require the services of thousands of people starting from outside suppliers and various service providers (architects, builders, estate agents, auditors, accountants, refrigeration and A/C engineers, food scientists and engineers, advertisers, caterers, environmental scientists, computer scientists and IT professionals) who derive their wherewithal through business transactions in the fast food sector.

Some of the challenges faced collectively by fast food restaurant operators include inadequate food processing industries for value added chicken, meat and fish products, frozen and canned vegetables, seasonings, condiments, sauces and spices.

Cost of funds remains high. High bank lending rate, the global economic meltdown and the effect on the value of naira have led to a paucity of funds and high cost of essential materials.

There is also the issue of poor infrastructure, as basic utilities like poor power supply, potable water, poor road network hamper the growth of the industry. Multiple taxation and overlapping roles from tiers of government have increased the cost of running fast food operations in Nigeria.

The AFFCON president told the stakeholders from that there is competition in the industry with a plethora of the informal sector. The informal sector not only eats into the market share of the organized fast food sector, the attendant effect on public health and the environment has far reaching grave effect on the economy.

“However, renewed government focus on providing requisite enlightenment through proper education on hygiene, nutrition and the environment would go a long way in stemming environmental and public health concern.”

The forum was put together by the scientific and technical committee of the Nigerian Institute of Food Science and Technology (NIFST), whose national president, Prof. Isaac Adebayo Adeyemi and Vice Chancellor, Bells University of Technology, Ota, gave the welcome address.

Others who presented papers were Dr. Paul Orhii, Director-General, NAFDAC, Prf. I.a. Onimawo, President, Nutrition Society of Nigeria, Mrs. Ify Umenyi, Director-General, Consumer Protection Council while the First Lady of Lagos State, Mrs. Abimbola Fashola, delivered a good will message.
