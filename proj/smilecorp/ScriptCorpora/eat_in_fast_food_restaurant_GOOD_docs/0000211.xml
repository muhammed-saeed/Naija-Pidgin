The burgers were great, but spendy for the type of restaurant. The service was A+, but I don&apos;t expect to pay that much when ordering a burger at a counter. The Hickory Burger was amazing though! We also had garlic tots which I would recommend as long as you have some breath mints with you for the rest of your day.

Bottom line - great burgers but on the pricy side.

Finally tried this place with my family. The staff were very friendly but I didn&apos;t understand ordering at a counter then having a server at the table. It was really overkill with the server as well, she was at our table constantly which was wierd for this type of place. As for the food, it was ok but very expensive and everything is a la carte so expect to pay more than its worth. I wouldn&apos;t go back now that I have tried it.

Who doesn&apos;t like a &quot;home cooked&quot; tasting food? Well, that&apos;s what you get at Brother&apos;s. Great food with a home cooked taste, uber friendly service and a really well designed atmosphere. It&apos;s clean and unpretentious. It&apos;s just what the &apos;couve needs, a great place to get a burger that&apos;s not a fast food joint or a kid filled family casual restaurant. It&apos;s a new fave in the area! The best part about this new little place is that they are appropriately priced and they sell wine and beer! Welcome to the &apos;couve! We hope you stay!!!

The Burger was so greasy my husband was doubled over with gut pain after eating.
I was looking for a meatless, dairyless option and the closest I could get was a spinach salad with bacon and a couple of mushrooms. All available dressings were dairy based including the Italian. I was just hoping that since this has been touted as a &quot;gourmet&quot; burger establishment/sit down restaurant that they would at least have one option with some vegetables for people who are tagging along with the person who came for a burger. Disappointed in the food, but the ambiance was nice and people were friendly.

Brothers is a counter-service joint that charges like a sit-down brewpub.  My husband and I went on our lunch break and were puzzled by the contrast between the atmosphere and the pricing.  To be sure, it&apos;s a very nice new establishment, but not the kind of place where you expect to drop $9 on a burger (ie. my husband&apos;s Hickory burger).  The basic burger will cost around $5, but once you add cheese and fries, it&apos;ll cost you closer to $7.

I wish I could rate Brothers higher because they do make a pretty tasty burger.  My husband was raving about the perfect onion ring on his.  We got good service as well.  But for the price and the atmosphere, I just can&apos;t imagine going back.  It&apos;s too casual to qualify for a date night at that price, and way too expensive for counter-service lunch, especially with Five Guys just around the corner.  Sorry, Brothers.

I wish I could buy their buns and use them at my house.  :)

I&apos;d give the actual burgers 4.5 stars, I think they&apos;re pretty tasty.  Hubby likes the chicken burger quite a bit, always juicy.  Normal-size burgers are better than the sliders.

Minus 1.5 stars due to the price factor -- the burger is already moderately priced, and then everything is an add-on (fries/tots, fry/tot seasoning, even bbq/ranch/etc).

Minus 1 star for the ordering/serving set up -- order/pay at the counter, and then a (usually pretty attentive) server delivers your drinks/food/drink refills.  For those of us that pay with plastic, the opportunity to tip our server has passed and then you feel guilty for not tipping the poor waiter/waitress if you are so inclined!

Plus .5 star for decent drinking water.  Ambiance is OK, leans more towards being a sports bar I think.

So overall rating ends up at 2.5.We used to live closer and went in probably 4 or 5 times since it opened, but we moved a couple of months ago, and it&apos;s not a place we&apos;d make a special trip back for.

The problem with Brothers is not with the food, it&apos;s o.k. not out of the ball park fantastic.  The ratio of staff to customers was great and the place was clean and cozy.
My issue with the place was two fold:
1. It&apos;s loud and confusing. When you walk in where do you go? Smiling cashiers looked at us and didn&apos;t clue us in we order first then sit. With the open kitchen it great to see your meal being prepared but be prepared to talk above the noise.
2. The menu is a little busy and everything is extra, slice of cheese to french fries are all add on&apos;s so by the time your finished building your burger your easily close to the 10 to 12 dollar range.
So with Five Guys just a couple blocks away, I don&apos;t see what would make me come back if a want a gourmet burger.
Nice place but nothing special and there are lots of places in the couve that have more to offer

Hmmph...well, I wanted to like this place.  I thought it was cute and comfortable and our server was super friendly and overall the staff was pretty nice.

Definitely could tell that the place was newly opened.  The cashier/order taker was new and not exactly sure how to place orders/charge for a side of fruit or ring up a kids meal, but she figured it out and it was fairly painless.

So you walk in, place your order at the counter, get a number and find a seat.  I found it pretty simple and self-explanatory but glimpsing over other reviews, I guess this concept is not overly familiar for all.

I thought the space was cute and welcoming.  There is a decent outdoor space too.  We sat inside and were promptly attended to by our server who quickly brought our drinks (two blue moons and a kids&apos; milk) and then brought our food.  No problems with the service.

I had the black and blue burger.  Really, meh.  Hated the sauce on it and the sauce  was way too much.  What a mess  The burger lacked any serious flavor and just did not excite.  Had a side of tater tots, and they were just not good.  Either I do not like tater tots anymore or these were lacking some serious tater tot flavor.  Overall, my food choices were bland, bland, bland.  The blue moon, however, was delicious and served with the appropriate orange wedge.

Kid had the slider with cheese and a side of fruit (I think we have the one kid in the US who hates potatoes/fries/tater tots).  He chowed the slider.  It came with ketchup on it, although I do not remember reading that it would, but luckily he liked the ketchup.  I was worried at first that the burger would go uneaten.  The serving was probably just the right size for my toddler.  Any kid over 3 will be left hungry.  The side of fruit was pretty gross.  It was way too sweet, like it was candied.  Definitely from frozen.

So one little slider later, and a nose up at the candied fruit and complete disdain for a tater tot, he was looking around the table still hungry.  We got our server&apos;s attention and asked if it would be possible to get some yogurt for the kid, even though it was not breakfast hours.  She made it happen and brought it over.  Kiddie really enjoyed the strawberry yogurt and was finally feeling full.

Total hats off for that service!!!  Outstanding and really great! :)

My guy had the standard cheeseburger with bacon, side of fruit (yea, he&apos;s not a fry guy either....guess that&apos;s where our son gets it from).  He did not have much to say about his burger and the only thing he had to say about the fruit was, &apos;it&apos;s not good&apos;.

Overall, I found the place cute, comfortable, good beer, great service.  But the food was so bland and forgettable.

It was 40 bucks for two burgers, a side of fruit, tater tots, kids meal (slider, fruit, milk) and two large blue moons.

meh.....

We went to Brother&apos;s at lunch today. My thought for this place is, &quot;Mixed Metaphor&quot;.
From what I saw on the web site, I was expecting something like Fuddruckers. What I got was something not like that at all.

The initial walk up and order was much like 5 Guys (place your order at a walk-up counter, pay, receive an order number), yet they have waitress service. Here is where the mixed part comes in. The folks that bring out your food are not the people who you ordered your food from.  This design ensures every order is bungled in some way.  When your food does come out, the person bringing your food has to wander all over the seating area looking for a little card with your order number on it, which you&apos;ve hopefully displayed clearly on your table. In addition, a different waitress brings your food out each time it&apos;s prepared.  During our time there, we were offered food which we didn&apos;t order no less than twice by two different waitresses, so that by the time our food did finally arrive we weren&apos;t at all sure that it was our correct order either.

A better serving model would be for the waitresses to have turf, instead of wandering from table to table looking for something to do. The current model is better suited if the employees were the Looney Toons Tasmanian Devil.

Then the person who is your waitress (but who is not *your* waitress, apparently), to make note of what numbers are present on their turf and keep on the look out for those orders coming up. Just like a normal restaurant.

Overall the service process is a fingernail on chalkboard experience in how to do something inefficiently without any visible benefits. They should either go with the total self-service model of 5 Guys or the full waitress service model of Red Robin. As Yoda would say, Serve or serve not there is no half way.

Okay, the service process issues can all be fixed with the process changes, now onto the food.

The only thing that was even close to Fuddruckers was the bun, and that seemed a bit on the dry/stale side. The burger itself was nothing special in flavor or texture. The toppings while fresh and tasty were completely and utterly beat down by the use of the &quot;Brother&apos;s sauce&quot;. This is a closely resemblance of Thousand Island dressing, but only if you got it at Chuck-E-Cheese. The sauce is cloying sweet. I do not expect nor desire a sugar burger.

Unless this restaurant makes some major changes in food, ingredient quality (Read stale bun), and makes a case that distinguishes it from 5 Guys, Red Robin, Fuddruckers, or the Vancouver local place: Burger Bungalow. I don&apos;t see any reason to go there. Especially since there is a 5 guys about 2 blocks from there.

Went back on their Day 2 and tried their Brothers Cheeseburger (with Tillamook Cheddar - but they have lots of other choices). The burger was great! The patty was juice and cooked medium - not over cooked (which a certain other brother owned established with locations throughout OR&amp;WA, including prime real estate down on the Columbia River, does on a regular basis); the burger is made of ground chuck, which as a good fat content to keep the burger flavorful and juicy. The veggies (lettuce, tomato, red onion) were fresh and flavorful - lettuce was crisp, tomatoes taste like tomatoes. The fries, cut from fresh potatoes with the skins still attached, were good and not greasy; they are fried in &quot;clear liquid soy shortening,&quot; which I was told is trans fat free. For those concerned about GMO, the soy is probably GMO, as almost all non-organic soy is GMO.

Service was attentive and helpful. The wait for the burgers was at the most 5 minutes, which I thought was pretty good.

The only negative to the meal was the pickle spear that accompanied the burger. I&apos;m a Claussen pickle kinda gal, and these definitely were not Claussen. They were crisp, but they had a chemical-like taste with a metalically after taste. Nasty! But I won&apos;t knock points off for that little detail. I did talk with one of the brothers about it. Hopefully they will find a new supplier for some good pickles.

Burger patties are 1/3 pound, and prices start at $5.99. Burgers are a la carte (well, they come with that nasty pickle spear). Fries are $2.39 (I think - give or take 10 cents), but you can add fries to your burger for $1.89. They also offer 2 oz. sliders individually or as a trio. For those not a fan of beef, they also offer turkey (forgot to ask about the source of the poultry) and veggie patties, a grilled chicken breast sandwich, and grilled cheese. A BLT is also on the menu. Three salads are also offered: Ceaser, and Iceberg Wedge with bacon (and blue cheese, I think), and a Spinach Salad with some bacon and other stuff (I was mesmerized by the word bacon so I didn&apos;t pay much attention to anything else). Milk shakes are available, and sodas are from Coca Cola. Oh, and they have a selection of local beers (and I&apos;m assuming wine).

Mmmm.... Maybe I&apos;ll go back for Day 3 and get some sliders......

Burger was OK, salad was OK, restaurant was weird, but not in a good way.  Service was slow and seemed a bit desperate.  Their service model needs serious help.  I think maybe they&apos;re trying to be clever about it, but it just doesn&apos;t work.  First I order, then I pay (with tip in advance), then you give me a check, then I sit down, then you start my order?  Good thing I decided to sit outside, otherwise, where was I supposed to sit?  At the table your waitress walked past twice without clearing?

The part where you tip in advance would only work in an establishment where you would unquestionably receive stellar service, rather than having to ask for a fork, and then a knife in a completely separate interaction, when a wedge salad was served.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it seemed like a good wedge salad, but just assume that a person needs a utensil to cut something served to them that&apos;s bigger than their head.

Don&apos;t order for your kids off the kid menu unless your child is 3, BTW.  1 slider and 5 tater tots is not enough to satisfy an 8-year-old.

Bottom line: 5 guys is better, cheaper, faster, friendlier, and closer (for me).  Brothers didn&apos;t win it.

Way too many staff members here.  Way too many.  It&apos;s fine, but the way they have it organized puts the over-abundance of staff members to waste.  Don&apos;t go here on a Friday night, because there will be a line out the door.  Honestly, corralling people up and forcing them to pre-order in a sit-down restaurant environment is awkward.

The selection of food items is rather minimal.  They have burgers with stuff on it, a veggie substitute, a couple of omelettes, a salad, grilled cheese and a BLT.  Pretty basic.  The burger is alright, but nothing really special.

Edit:  Had much better luck with the Bacon Bits Wrap.  Good stuff.

The Restaurant:
So the business model is a little weird, but maybe it will work out in the long run and this new business will accomplish it&apos;s goal of dominating P-town.  I heard they want to open 15+ locations in the next few.... anyway

The most similar restaurant style would be a buffet or asian food.... order at the counter, then find a seat--but with burgers.
The servers are actually runners, but they will serve you as necessary.  This creates the problem a few issues:
how much to tip?
Should I have expectations that the restaurant is fast food or not?
Am I bothering the runners when I ask for refills or extra sauce?
Even though I&apos;ve paid at the counter, I pay wait staff again when I order said sauces?! (this means I might have a 45cent charge on my CC cause I&apos;m not carrying cash)

Maybe these issues aren&apos;t problems, but I still had to ask for clarification on where to sit, if I could order extra from the wait staff, and why I didn&apos;t get my drink at the counter.

Why don&apos;t they serve the drinks at the counter?!

Right or wrong - it&apos;s a new restaurant model, and people aren&apos;t accustomed to it.... yet.

The Food:
Bun - A
Burger (beef) - B minus
Value C
Service - A
Kitchen knows what they are doing - B (probably will move to an A)

I&apos;d go back again.... but i&apos;ll wait 4 months for the honey moon to end.  Then I&apos;ll rate again.... probably a 4star

I took Brothers up on their coupon offer for a free Classic burger, and also got a &quot;Black and Bleu&quot; to compare. They were tasty, with a tangy sauce, kind of like &quot;1000 Island&quot; dressing or Russian dressing. I scarfed them down, so they were pretty good. The drawback were the buns, which were a bit too bready or perhaps chewy would be a better word. But compared with a lot of fast food, they had better flavor.

Service was really quick and friendly.

First off this place is better than Five Guys for when you want food with real flavor that is not swimming in grease.

Today the owners were on the premises and the restaurant crew was ambulated while the business has almost found its sea legs. Once they find their Zen state, everything will likely find a comfortable harmony.

The restaurant is a first rate design with inside, outside and to go dining. You place your order at the counter, take a small folder with your number inserted at the end, sit down at the table or counter of your choice, and a server brings your food to the table. In the center of each table is an assortment of condiments and napkins. It would be nice if they add some malt vinegar for the fried potatoes.

The plate was nicely put together with the Black&amp;Blue Gorgonzola Burger that included a perfect combination of vegetables on a quality bun for $7.69. Included were a side of fries on the plate for $1.89, which was more than enough and asked two others at the table to help me finish. A full order of fries cost more. Also on the plate was a big slice of pickle to round out the meal. The drink glasses are very large and servers offer frequent refills.

Coming from a generation that enjoyed blackened foods without freaking out like some do today, the flavor of the burger was right on. However, if I could make one suggestion, I&apos;d like to have that same exterior while keeping the interior medium at the center.

There was a time when we enjoyed eating raw high quality beef with salt and garlic, which still speaks to my inner-cannibal, but I&apos;d never risk it with the factory farming methods of today.

We will definitely return again.

Eat life before life eats you;
Mazel a presto!

First off I have to say that I didn&apos;t actually eat there.
I walked in and encountered  a crowd around the cashier. I scanned the place and was pleasantly surprised to see a bar. So I walk over and sit down and there I sit. The staff seem friendly, they smile as they walk by. I finally realize that the people at the cashier are walking to  tables with their receipts.
Now some times I&apos;m a little slow and a creature of habit. I&apos;ve never seen this before. In my defense, you can usually just walk up to the counter to avoid the wait for tables.
So I casually stood and walked out like I had just finished my lunch.
They should have someone at the front door to point old dogs in the right direction.
I will be back. I will eat Cheeseburgers. I will rerate this post.

The food here is good. I thought that the chicken burger is really tasty. The Dijon mustard sauce on it is good.

The burgers tho, are, well.. typical. The only benefit is that you can put your own toppings on it.  If I were going to compare to somewhere else, it would be Five Guys.

Except, expect to pay 3x more, and get a better atmosphere to eat it in. They server you your drinks and food, and the service is usually good. When they are busy, forget about getting refills.

The whole experience is awkward at best.

We had to check it out cause its new, and why the hell not. We&apos;ve even tried the benefit of the doubt by going three times. Tried the garlic fries, tator tots, and normal fries.

Its ok. For the same money though, you could go to Red Robin twice.

Well we have been waiting for this place to open and I really thought you know with Burger in the name I hope they knock it out of the park.  I was wrong.  The meat is nothing fantastic - I mean really, you have burger in your name and the meat is just like Burgerville - just a bit thicker.  The fries lacked all flavor and were just processed frozen strips.  The onion rings were overcooked but had the potential if cooked correctly to be good.

To the reviewer who says it&apos;s better than 5 guys - sadly it isn&apos;t.  Everything is just frozen processed food.  Brothers doesn&apos;t do anything out of this world and there is no reason to go there except you can get a beer or wine with your meal - which is nice.

The service - was great!  They were attentive and prompt on refilling drinks.  You order at a counter when you come in, get a number but they do make sure you have what you need and ensure it from that point.  Delivery of food, refilling of drinks all of it done with a cheerful, helpful attitude.  Yippee!!

The burger wasn&apos;t great, the prices were too high, I was overcharged, didn&apos;t get our drinks until after the food came, they forgot one of the items we ordered, didn&apos;t ask if we wanted refills until after we were finished with our food...

On the other hand the cajun tots weren&apos;t bad.

Okay, I&apos;m going to be brutally honest here. We waited quite awhile for this place to open, went twice after it was supposed to be open only to see signs saying &quot;closed for private party&quot;. Third try we actually got in. Confusing is the first word. Line up, don&apos;t line up? Sit down, wait to be seated?? After some urging from the counter girl we made our approach. We ordered The Hickory, Black&amp;Blue, onion rings, fries and chocolate and vanilla shake (for the kids), and two soft drinks.

1)Drinks were unnecessarily huge and pricey, almost 4 bucks for 2...I was never asked a size preference and assumed I was getting the smallest they had since I said &quot;small drink&quot;. Nope
2)Both kids (who are no foodies!) complained the shakes tasted &quot;funny&quot;. Youngest son refused to drink his chocolate after a few sips. These shakes were 4 each!!! (one again I asked for smalls and was sold the adult size I guess).
3)The Hickory burger was a nice idea but not executed well. Large dollop of bbq sauce in the middle, no other sauce of any kind on this incredibly dry burger.
4)Meat patties have no flavor at all and are extremely overcooked. I have had a juicer patty at Sonic, for goodness sake.
5)Brioche bun is nice but seems a bit too much of a stretch here. Husband complained that it was too much &quot;dough&quot; to get through. If meat was juicier it would be nice to have the brioche to soak some of that up and give you a delivery system, but no luck.
7)Fries and onion rings are not very well done. Rings are too thick...no one wants to chew on a half of an onion, and the fries taste frozen and reheated. Even tried the rosemary/parm fry for flavor and wasn&apos;t impressed.
8)Wait staff...do they want to be a restaurant or fast food? Make up your mind! The endless cruising of the staff was irritating and unnecessary. Why are you wasting your profits on this gimmick???? Ours was friendly but the drink waitress was an idiot who walked past us twice with our drinks. I did not feel compelled to leave a tip.
9)What&apos;s with the breakfast menu? Shouldn&apos;t you just concentrate on making a fantastic burger???

Bottom line for $40 (and this includes 2 kids who ate nothing but a shake), this is WAY OVERPRICED and just not worth the money.

I had the chili burger and tots, the food was pretty good and the price was right. The drinks and tots are free refills, which is nice. I will be back but it&apos;s not a place I will frequent.

Based on the other comments I am wondering if we just had an isolated experience.  Everyone was very friendly, but the service was really, really,  really, slow.  In addition, while to food was pretty tasty, I still have to take issue with things like having an extra charge to add cheese (fine) but then an up charge on top of that for specific sorts of cheese on the menu.  I mean come on.  Then the questions of what dipping sauce you would like for fries or onion rings, etc., and finding that charged on the bill as well.  Long and short of it, $36 for 3 burgers, fries, and cokes.  It&apos;s gotta be better than what this place is offering for that price.

While it all sounded delicious it fell short. Slow restaurant should mean fresh food. We arrived just after lunch and I&apos;m pretty sure we were treated to the lunch rush leftovers - soggy fries and dry burger. Although I was asked 4 times after I had finished my coke &quot; which was perfect &quot; . 1 out of 3 aint bad.

Frozen patties are not what I expected from a place who&apos;s business is suppose to be all about the burger. Extremely disappointing.

Way way way too expensive for such mediocre food. Pricing for add-ons nickel and dime you to death, and the burgers just aren&apos;t very good.  As mentioned in another review, Five Guys is just down 192nd if you&apos;ve got an irresistible burger craving. Mmmmm, Five Guys...

We went to Brother&apos;s Burgers on a date night recently.  Thought I&apos;d share with you our experience.

Two and half stars if I were able, not so bad as meh, but not A-OK either.

Brother&apos;s Burgers seems to be a restaurant that can&apos;t decide if it is fast food or a full on sit down restaurant.  Why do I say this?  You walk through the doors to a nicely appointed, not overly ostentatious setting.  The tones are warm and inviting, the gas fire place a nice touch, especially as it was raining on this particular evening.  It has the feel of a Starbucks.  As you walk through the doors, you are greeted by an ordering counter.  You look at the board, select your meal of choice and pay the lady.  I didn&apos;t include a tip, because this type of setup is typical of a fast food restaurant, and who tips at a Burgerville or 5 guys?  They offer beer and wine with your meal, and not just cheep beer, but fine local selections for a price.  I paid 5 dollars for a large Mirror Pond to round out my custom
&quot;made to order&quot; meal complete with rosemary fries.   Then you sit down at a table and wait for the food to be brought out to you.  The meal was decent, my wife order the Hickory burger and very much enjoyed it. She ordered a side salad and was a bit disappointed to see a pile of lettuce, two tomato wedges and two slices of cucumber.  I&apos;m not a salad guy, but apparently, for the price, there should have been more to it.  27 dollars for two burgers, an order of fries, a side salad and a beer is a tad steep, especially if you&apos;re under the impression you are eating at a fast food restaurant.  A waitress appeared, brought us our food, returned to ask if everything was alright, and would have received a tip had I not been traveling with debit card only.  Over all it was not bad, but not memorable either.

Here&apos;s the thing; you have 5 Guys, who are expensive, but tasty fast food.  Then you have Red Robin, also expensive, but it&apos;s a sit down, full on restaurant.  Each restaurant knows where they are in the market place and delivers accordingly.  My recommendation to Brother&apos;s, decide where you want to be and go for it.  You can&apos;t be effect in the middle. The guests are confused and your wait staff is going to leave for a place where they actually get consistent tips.
Would we go again?  Maybe, depending on the mood.  It&apos;s quieter than a red robin, so a nicer atmosphere for a date and I&apos;d probably give their burgers another try.

A few thoughts for the owners if you happen to read these reviews:  Buy pre-wrapped straws.  The waitress came to the table with our water glasses and placed the unwrapped straw on the table.  That is the equivalent of having me lick the table before drinking my glass of water.  I commented on this to my wife.  She said maybe the waitress could have just put the straw into the glass before serving it and that would have been better.  At that moment we witnessed the girl behind the counter unpacking a gross of straws, placing them in a container and then packing them down by placing her hand on the top and mashing down.  What&apos;s the big deal you ask?  Whatever germs were on her hand are now on the drinking end of all those straws.  That&apos;s the equivalent of me licking the palm of her hand before taking a drink. No thanks!

Second, have the walk up order counter only for those ordering food to go.  You have a nice restaurant, a cool vibe.  Maximize it.  Have customers sit down, order from a waiter or waitress and feel like they are at a true sit down meal.  The wait staff will be rewarded with tips, the customers won&apos;t have to stand in line to order their dinner and the whole experience will be more enjoyable.

Third, season the beef.  The hamburger I custom ordered had bun, beef, Tillamook cheddar pickles, tomatoes, and a fried egg on it.  I couldn&apos;t tell if it had sauce, mayonnaise, or ketchup on it.  But the over taste was bland.  With all those tasty ingredients, bland should have been the last thing I was tasted.  A chef seasons the food to taste before sending it out the door to the dinners.  Take a page from their book and do likewise with your burgers.

Lastly, invest in thicker napkins.  Your burgers are juicy.  I went through at least 9 napkins.  It might be a cost savings method to get the thinner/ cheaper ones, but your whole atmosphere speaks to quality.  Get a thicker napkin to complete the message.

Best of luck, I&apos;m a big fan of local businesses and truly hope you succeed.

Julian S&apos;s review is spot on.  I too was relatively under whelmed.  We tried just about every day for 10 days to get in the place for lunch.  Now it seems the newness has finally worn off.  The lines to place you order are getting shorter.  Our Classic Burger with Tots arrived barely warm.  If you&apos;re looking for a quite place for lunch this is NOT your place.  The acoustics are terrible, a kin to the atmosphere of a sports bar.  The servers don&apos;t really have much to do, so they stand around and talk.  I&apos;m not sure I will go back again to pay $12 for a bacon cheese burger.  Market domination in this area ain&apos;t happening.  There are way cheaper and better alternatives.

Had a coupon for a free quarter pound burger so stopped in today.  Best thing about it was the pickle :(  One tomato slice was not red, lettuce was  anemic/thin and burger had no taste.  I rarely eat buns and this one did not tempt me.  I think it was $5 if not for the coupon.  I added some garlic fries which were good but greasy.  Then there is the need to tip since while ordering is self service, there is a wait staff.  So if one adds a drink, its easily over $10 with tax and tip - too much even if the inside atmosphere is better than BK or Micky D.  If I am going to spend $10 I will go to Paneras.  I will not be back.  PS On the plus side the cashier very friendly, patio looked nice and inside nice and cool.
