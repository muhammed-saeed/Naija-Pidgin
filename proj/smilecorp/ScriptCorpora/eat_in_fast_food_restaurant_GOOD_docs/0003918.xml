McDonald?s vs. Burger King

Organizational Diagnosis

by

Fastalk Consultants


In diagnosing the McDonald’s organization, the first issue we will examine is their

company goals. McDonald’s has a goal of one hundred percent total customer satisfaction.

However, they do realize that this goal is not always attainable. Therefore, if for any reason they

do not meet that goal, they will do whatever it takes to correct their mistake. McDonald’s has a

second company goal that sets them apart from most of their competitors. McDonald’s was

founded on the principle of giving back to the community, and that remains one of their primary

goals today. Through their charities, Ronald McDonald?s House and Ronald McDonald?s

Children’s Charities, McDonald’s has pumped millions of dollars back into the community over the

years.

McDonald’s customer service policy is laid out in the McDonald’s Guarantee. The

McDonald’s Guarantee states,“Your food will be hot. Your service will be fast and friendly. And

your drive-thru orders will be double-checked right. If you’re not satisfied, we’ll make it right. Or

your next meal is on us. Guaranteed.”

The customer service procedures of McDonald’s are centered on focusing on one

customer at a time. They are more concerned with the quality of the service than the speed of the

service. Employees usually take only one order at a time. They then prepare that order while the

customers wait. After the present customer is satisfied, they move on to the next customer. This

procedure allows great accuracy and quality, but lacks speed.

McDonald’s climate was not very appealing. Everything appeared to be focused around

the business instead of the customers. Employees were working at a rapid pace, but it seemed

like they had no time for customers. They acted as if it was a burden for them to stop and answer

a simple question or refill a drink. The atmosphere was also very noisy. There was constant

beeping, banging, and yelling coming from the service area. They did not provide a pleasant

ambiance for customers to dine in.

McDonald’s communication and leadership were also lacking. The only communication

between employees and customers was the placement of orders. The employees provided no

feedback in terms of double-checking orders or communicating any delays that might occur.

Communication between employees consisted of loud yelling throughout the kitchen. In terms of

leadership, we did not see a manager present during our entire visit.

Diagnosing Burger King was a little more difficult because they do not provide customers

with literature (pamphlets) communicating goals and policies, as McDonald’s does. However,

Burger King’s goals seemed quite clear. They want to individualize each customer’s order and

provide the fastest service possible.

Burger King’s policy is to give the customer many choices and to accurately and quickly

provide whatever the customer chooses. This policy is reflected in their slogan,“Your way, right

away.”Operating under this policy makes it very easy to achieve their goals. Through the many

choices they provide it is easy to customize each order.

Burger King’s procedures are also consistent with their goals. In order to individualize

each order they provide customers with many options when ordering. Some options include fries

or onion rings, cheese, bacon, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion.

The customer can pick any combination of these options that they desire. To facilitate fast service

Burger King takes customer orders on a continual basis. One employee takes the customer’s

order, the customer then moves down the line where another employee is preparing the order.

Meanwhile, the original employee is taking another customer’s order. Customers also get their

own drinks while they are waiting for their meal. This makes service much faster in that

employees do not have to prepare drinks or provide refills.

The climate at Burger King was very pleasant. The employees conveyed the attitude that

they were there to assist the customers in any way possible. The restaurant was very clean and

there were no loud noises from the service area. They also provided relaxing music for customers

to listen to while dining.

Burger King possessed more than adequate communication and leadership. Employees

gave the customers feedback on their orders. Each customer received a receipt, which enabled

them to double-check their order. The employees also read the order back to the customer before

handing them the order. In terms of leadership, there was a manager in plain sight throughout our

visit. The manager showed involvement by taking orders and coaching employees.

Our group compared and contrasted McDonald?s and Burger King as follows:


Comparison between McDonald’s and Burger King

Analysis:

I. Organizational Goals

Both McDonald’s and Burger King share the same basic organizational goals of profitability, sales

volume, fast and courteous service, and cleanliness. There are minor variations to these goals by both

companies.

II. Organizational Structure

When observing McDonald’s and Burger king, the organizational structures of the two restaurants were

very similar. There appeared to be a crew leader who was a non-managerial employee and, there was a

manager who was present behind the counter. The managers of the restaurants seemed to be in control of

every aspect of the entire food service process. He had keys to the store, and registers, and also was the

only one to take phone calls. One might assume that because both restaurants are chains, there is a

hierarchy of command. There is perhaps a regional manager, then a district manager, all the way up to a

CEO of McDonald’s and Burger King. The distinction between the management and the staff was very

clear and apparent by looking at their uniforms.

III. Technology

Both McDonald’s and Burger King are on the cutting edge of technology. They both employ state of the

art cash registers and both have electric timers built into their cooking machines. Although the cooking

styles vary between Burger King and McDonald’s, the method of production is the same. Large batches

of food are cooked at once then placed under heat lamps or put in the microwave when an order is placed.

Both stores have the same drive through technology with a speaker and a well-lit menu to relay the

message to the cooks. Usually whoever takes the order is also the same person to collect the money;

however, a different person usually puts the order together for the customer.

IV. Employee Motivation

The motivation of both stores for employees to perform well is hard to ascertain from just observing, but it

appears somewhat obvious. The people working in these establishments appear to have a lower social

economic status, and the fact that a paycheck is coming at the end of the week may be the only motivation

they have. The stores do have an“employee of the month”plaque on the wall, but it is doubtful that this

is motivation to strive day in and day out for. There is also the fear of potentially losing their jobs if they

perform sub standard.

V. Communication

Both stores employed a very open communication policy. Employees were talking, sometimes shouting at

one another to be heard. The management was openly involved in the employees routines and the

employees felt no barriers to prevent their communication with the manager. Sometimes in both stores,

there would be a break down in communication somewhere along the line and that would result in

extended waiting times for customers and sometimes, screwed up orders.

VI. Environment

The environment at McDonald’s and Burger King seems to be a simple, yet unstable one. It is apparent

that the majority of people who work there, are not choosing their employment as a career option.

Therefore, the workforce is constantly changing and adapting to new employees and new situations.

VII. Job Design

The design of the job in both McDonald’s and Burger King ran smoothly at times. There was autonomy

between the different positions. For example, the fry person would just make fries. If he ran into a

problem, he could use his knowledge of the fry machine to fix the problem without having to go to

management. There was a visual barrier between the different positions, however no position seemed

more glorified than another one.

VIII. Leadership Style

There was similar leadership style employed by the management at both stores. Task orientation was

essential to meeting the goal of fast food. Each person had to be focused on the task at hand, because

during certain hours of the day, both stores were very busy. There seemed to be little flexibility from

management if it meant compromising their goals.

IX. Policies/Procedures/Rules/Standards

Standardization seemed to be the key at both stores. One can walk into any McDonald’s in the country

and find that a“Big Mac”is the same everywhere. Similarly, a“Whopper”will taste the same at every

location. Therefore, the ingredients, and cooking methods must remain constant throughout. There can

be no variation. Rules and procedures were posted on clear signs and made directly available to the

employee.

X. Organization Climate

There seemed to be individual autonomy for the most part at both stores. However, the reward system was

not easy to identify. They seemed expected to do their job consistently and accurately, perhaps in fear of

punishment. They received cooperation from management as long as they were working diligently.

Contrast between McDonald?s and Burger King

Analysis:

I. Organizational Goals

At first glance there are no posters on the wall that state the goals that McDonald?s are trying to each. A

customer can find a list of the McDonald?s goals in what look to be children?s flyers round the restaurant.

The flyers stated that McDonald?s goal is ?100% total customer satisfaction.? Also if you weren?t

completely happy with your meal that the restaurant would do whatever it took to make it right. This is

not a very realistic goal for a fast food restaurant because with the amount of food that is served everyday

there is no way that every customer will be satisfied. When I got to Burger King there were no pamphlets

for the customer to read. There was nothing that let the consumer know what the company was all about.

There was a large sign, which read the slogan ?Workin for You.? This was what appeared to be the

organization goal and it was interesting to see that the slogan was in improper English. Although this

goal is much more realistic than the McDonald?s counterpart.

II. Organizational Structure

Although the structure of the two organizations are basically the same there were two differences that I

noticed. One difference is in the specific tasks of the employees working the front. In McDonald?s there

is one person who takes your order and gets your food. Only one person is helped at a time because the

cashier has to wait for the food and then serve you. In Burger King there are two separate stations to

order and then pick up your food. At the beginning of the line the customer orders and pays in exchange

for a number. Then you move down the line to where the customer picks up the food in accordance with

the number. This greatly speeds up the lines and reduces the waiting time. The other difference is in the

management. At both restaurants there is one manager that handles all the employees working at the

time. In McDonald?s the manager was no where to be found but in Burger King the manager was at the

front letting himself be seen and talking with the customers. He also wore a different colored uniform to

signify his position in the organization.

III. Technology

The production level of the two restaurants is the main difference in their technology. McDonald?s makes

their food in mass production. The burgers are already made and waiting under a heat lamp for you when

you order. They are separated into rows depending on what type of burger you order. In Burger King the

burgers aren?t already put together. The burger is cooking in the back but the toppings aren?t added till

the individual orders come. This gives the customer a better chance of getting a fresh meal.

IV. Communication

There wasn?t much communication going on in McDonald?s when we were there. The cashiers didn?t

smile and weren?t that polite when taking my order. The communication between the cashiers and the

cooks consisted of the cashiers screaming into the kitchen. The manager wasn?t around so I wasn?t able

to see the manager?s interactions with the staff. At Burger King I was welcomed by a smile. The cashiers

were nice and even held a conversation with me. The manager was out in front conversing with the staff

and the employees. The staff appeared to treat the manager as a friend instead of a superior.

V. Environment

McDonald?s environment was neither customer nor employee friendly. Everything in the restaurant is

colored brown which just isn?t inviting to customers. The staff has pinstriped uniforms that resemble

prison uniforms. The restaurant was also badly lighted which didn?t help the color. In Burger King there

were windows everywhere and the restaurant was extremely bright. The staff wore bright colored

uniforms and there was music playing which was enjoyable for the customers as well as the staff.

After our group observed the interactions between management, employees, and

customers at both operations, we discovered a few areas where Burger King and McDonald?s

both needed improvement. To begin with, our McDonald?s experience was overall enjoyable, yet

a few small, but important, details should be considered. Most of the employees? uniforms were

worn properly and neatly, but the rest were just plain sloppy. Shirts should be tucked in and

clean, and hats should be worn the way hats were meant to be worn. This would show that

employees value their jobs, and take them seriously. While we were dining, we could not help but

notice the loud, high pitched, constant beeping noises coming from the kitchen area. These

extremely irritating noises did not stop the entire time. This prevents the guests from enjoying

their meals in a soft, relaxing atmosphere. Quiet background music at McDonald?s would

probably help the ambiance a bit and offset some of the noises coming from the kitchen. We also

noticed that even though it was not busy, there was not a manager in sight. In fact, we can not be

sure that one was on duty at the time of our visit. At Burger King it was nice to see the manager

working along with the employees by taking orders and preparing food.

The major problem that we found with Burger King was the lack of menu consistency.

The location that we visited did not offer salads, while most other Burger King?s do. We feel that

if a salad is available at one location, then a customer should expect to be able to enjoy the same

salad at any Burger King. It is comforting to a customer to know that the food will be the same

(in preparation and availability) at whichever store he or she chooses to visit. We did enjoy how

they were willing to accommodate our personalized orders, but it is not appropriate to charge for

one slice of tomato or lettuce. McDonald?s did advertise quite a bit of community involvement

and service. At Burger King we did not see signs of any type of contribution to the community.

People may think that the company is greedy and only cares about profit. A charity would show

that Burger King cares about the community. In addition, both of these restaurants desperately

need to incorporate the fundamentals of great service into their game plans. It would make a

tremendous difference if a cashier would very simply smile and say ?thank you? after returning

your change. From the expressions on the faces of some of the employees we felt as if we ruined

their entire day just by walking through the door! Personality and attitude should be major

considerations when hiring employees. Hire only those who will take pride in their jobs, be

professional, and treat the guests very well.

Our final recommendation for both operations is to adopt a ?Total Quality Management?

philosophy. Food should come out with the right ingredients and at the correct temperature. It is

a waste of time and money to make an order over again if it is not perfect the first time. With

better training and communication there should be no reason for orders to be less than perfect.

The proper attention could be directed to the next customer waiting in line. If things are done

correctly the first time, it will save aggravation for the guest, who, by the way, will remember that

his order came out exactly how he wanted it. Basically, just take care of the customer. Give

employees the power to do whatever it takes to make them happy. Exceed their expectations

and, in return, you will have a life long patron. He will be back again, and again, increasing long

run profitability. This concept should be applied to McDonald?s as well as Burger King, to

helpattain their corporate goals.
