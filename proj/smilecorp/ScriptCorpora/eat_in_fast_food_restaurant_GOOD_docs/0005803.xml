 Words Fail Me 
 University | Michigan, USA | Students 
 (A student comes in to the Registrar’s office to pick up a transcript. After discovering that she never placed an order, I tell her to place the order so that it will be ready in the afternoon. After checking the system over the course of several hours and not seeing the order, I call the student.) 

 Me: “Yes, I see you still have not placed your order.”

 Student: “I placed it hours ago!”

 Me: “Uh oh, I hope something is not wrong with our system. Did you get confirmation that the order went through?”

 Student: “Yes! I still have it up right here on my screen. It says right here:‘Transaction Failed’!”

 To Some, Time Is A Foreign Concept 
 Post Office | Duncan, BC, Canada | 
 (I’m standing behind the counter at the postal outlet. We have a stand in front of the counter with a sign that shows our hours in military time. I notice a customer staring at the sign for a very long time.) 

 Me: “Can I help you?”

 Customer: “What is’20:00′?”

 Me: “20:00 means 8 pm.”

 Customer: “Oh. You should put the times in English.”

 Less Is More, More Or Less 
 Arcade | Pennsylvania, USA | Food&amp;Drink , Money Issues , Top 
 Me: “Hi! What can I get for you?”

 Customer: “Well, I have two coupons here. One is a large pizza, four sodas, and 70 tokens for $29.99. The other is for a large pizza, four sodas, wings, and 110 tokens for $29.99. Which one is better?”

 Me: “Well, I’d personally go with the second one. It’s the same price, plus you get an extra order of wings and 40 more tokens.”

 Customer: “You’re just trying to get more money off of me, so you picked the worse deal. I’ll take the first coupon, idiot!”

 One Immune System Boost, Please 
 Smoothie Shop | California, USA | Food&amp;Drink 
 (I work at a shake/smoothie shop that specializes in healthy shakes with organic ingredients blended before the customer’s eyes. A woman who looks to be in her late 30s walks in and looks at the menu a while.) 

 Customer: “What ingredients can you put in a shake?

 Me: “Well, we can include ground flax seed, hemp, wheat germ—”

 Customer: “What? You put germs in your shakes?!”

 Me: “No, ma’am, I said wheat germ—”

 Customer: “I heard what you said! You said germs! I can’t believe you put germs in your shakes! Wait until I tell everyone how filthy you are!” *storms out*

 Me: “No.”

 Customer: “Well, what do you have?”

 Me: “Pitas. We’re a pita shop.”

 Customer: “Well, what’s a pita?”

 Me: “It’s like a wrap.”

 Customer: “That’s gross!”
