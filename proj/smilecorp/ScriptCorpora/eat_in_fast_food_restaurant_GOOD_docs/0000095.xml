Vietnam fast food culture influence by western culture
 Edit 
 History 
 
Vietnam is the latest bustling destination for foreign investments. Western cultures have taken deep hold in Vietnamese business practice, architecture, entertainment, and most unexpectedly its food culture. Fast food culture is invading the country; and by all indicators, the industry will continue to grow. In 1997, the Korean chain Lotteria opened the first western style fast food restaurant in Vietnam. As of March 2009, Kentucky Fry Chicken is the market leader in Vietnam with 68 restaurants, Lotteria has 56 shops, and the Japanese chain Jollibee with 8. American top brand names McDonald and Burger King are expect to enter the market shortly.


One big different about fast food in Vietnam that may surprise western consumer is that fast food is not cheap in Vietnam; compare to traditional Vietnamese food, it’s very expensive. A fast food meal sets customer back about $3, whereas a local restaurant may charge less than $1 for lunch. So, why are people willing to pay more for western style fast food?


Vietnam has enjoyed 7.5% annual growth since 2000 as a result of the government opening its market to foreign investments. Much of the growth has concentrated in the wealthy class; and to a lesser extent an emerging educated, office-worker middle class. With a capita income of $1024 as of 2008, fast foods are expensive meals in Vietnam. The regular customers in a fast food restaurant tend to come from middle to high income family: office worker, affluent student… The act of eating in a fast food restaurant itself is becoming a fashionable trend, a statement that a person is wealthy or successful enough to dine in an expensive restaurant.


When ask why they like fast food restaurant, the majority response that they like the taste, clean environment, friendly service, modern amenities and comfort. And most importantly, they like to try new thing, especially western influence thing, a trend that has repeated itself in every other developing countries.


Vietnam domestic fast food cultures consist of mobile cart vendors and restaurants serving food on make-shift plastic table right on the street. For a very long time, people were not concern about food safety. As the media industry growth, stories about poor sanitary and food poisoning are more common. Consumers become more aware and demanding of food safety, thus they rank cleanliness as an important factor to choosing chain outlet over street vendor.


Friendly customer service is another big draw. Colorful uniform, welcoming smile and responsive quick service entice people to choose a fast food restaurant over a local diner, even if the customer is looking for a dish that both locations serve, and the fast food version is twice as expensive. Good service matter to the growing affluent customer base and domestic shops have been unresponsive to the new demand.


In another attempt to boost in status, fast food restaurants offer air condition, comfortable seating, wireless internet, music video and movie playing on television. They allure customers to hang out, surf the internet and chat with friend instead of leaving right after the meal. This strategy adds another advantage over the domestic market. In Vietnam, it’s a mild culture imperative that at a domestic fast food restaurant, people are expected to finish their meals and leave quickly; so that their seats become available to the next patrons. The punishment for a violation is very mild, usually it’s just disapproving looks form the annoyed waitress and owner; but it’s enough that most people follow the culture imperative. When people realize that the foreign fast food restaurant actually want customers to hang out afterward in a comfortable, modern environment, they are willing to pay a premium for such hospitable services. 


Not too long ago in Vietnam, burger and fries were novelty items only featured in magazine. Now, they are at every corner of the big cities. But, for all its advances in the last decade, it will be a while before Vietnam becomes a fast food nation. According to Vietnam Briefing, a 2008 Nielsen poll stated that only 8 percent of Vietnamese eat at a fast food restaurant monthly, most people simply cannot afford to spent money at a western style fast food chain on a consistent basis, especially when there’re many cheaper, delicious traditional alternative.


Yet western food chains won’t be pursuing a low cost strategy any time soon, since they are enjoying an easy and successful differentiation strategy. Their restaurant services are far ahead of a typical domestic one, and western fast foods still hold a celebrated status the Vietnamese culture. In the same previously mentioned Nielsen poll, Vietnam has a very young population with 65 percent under the age of 25, a great demographic for continuing the trendy fast food culture.
