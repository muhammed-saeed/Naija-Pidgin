You may not expect it from your typical fast food restaurant, but this location will pleasantly surprise you. The food is fresh, the restaurant is clean and the service from the employees is fantastic. They are always cheerful, polite and patient.  I only say patient because I observed many patrons order with the typical apprehension when it comes to their turn, even if they had been given plenty of time to order - why do we do that?

The food is prepared as you order so not only is it freshly prepped, but they bring it to your table.  I really like Taco Time, but this is by far the best location I&apos;ve ever been to set apart from the rest for their exceptionally awesome service.

Taco Time is not cheap or fast enough to be considered a quick lunch location.

Taco Time is not expensive or impressive enough to be considered a real restaurant.

Food court quality of meals and service. Crumpled little parking - though there are huge parking lots around.

If you still feel like getting those taco, don&apos;t lose your time - call them in advance, drive by, get your stuff, go back to the office.

Can&apos;t imagine any other use of Taco Time, sorry...

Some places just get it. They understand that customer service is more than just basic service, its the understanding that your patronage is valued.  Taco time at Deerfoot Meadows is just like that. They are alwaus super friendly, efficient and genuinely pleasant.  I was there today and had a veggie burrito combo with salsa chips and a diet coke.  As I watched them make the burrito ( its nice you can see the food being prepared) I thought there is no way I am going to eat all that for lunch. It was really big, packed with rice, beans and all the typical mexican staples, sour cream, lettuce, tomato etc...
The girl behind the counter was so pleasant, and accomodating when I asked for a take away bag.   One of the things I like is that unlike taco bell, here you can just pump out your hot sauce into those mini paper cups at the condiment station, rather than the packets  ( which in this day in age is not too earth friendly).
The food tastes much fresher and less artificial then at Taco Bell.  The dining room is always very clean and there is lots of parking out front and to the side.
Taco time is consistently delicious and at this location deliciously friendly.
