Tesco Goodwood

 &quot;This has been a fantastic project from start to finish, and the Yorkon team really pulled out all the stops to make it happen.&quot; 

 The Requirement 

 Tesco had a requirement for a specially-designed 1960s-style supermarket for the Goodwood Revival, the UK&apos;s biggest historic motor racing event. 

A typical 1960s street scene would be created for the event, to include a period car park, bus depot and a fully trading Tesco supermarket. Inside, visitors to the Revival would be able to buy some of their favourite products from the era, complete with heritage packaging.

 The Solution 

Using concepts produced by retail design consultants CDW&amp;Partners and working closely with Tesco, Yorkon successfully re-created a store from 1966 which was completed in just seven weeks , from receipt of order to handover at the Goodwood Circuit in Sussex .

Features of the retro store included:

 a stone-effect fascia with four white mosaic columns reminiscent of a 1960s precinct anodised aluminium glazing an ice cream hatch with a canvas canopy period fridges signage from the era a pebbledash-type finish to the end and rear walls separate entry and exit doors. 

 The 1,700sqft supermarket comprised six steel-framed modules which were manufactured off site at the Yorkon production centre in York and pre-fitted out with partitions, back-of-house facilities, electrics, chequerboard vinyl tile flooring, and other themed internal finishes, before being delivered to Goodwood and craned into position in just one day.



 Visionary Design Demonstrates the Flexibility of Off-site Construction 

The store had a completely bespoke design, which successfully demonstrates the flexibility of off-site construction and how Yorkon can push the boundaries of modular building.

The retro store will be re-used at the Goodwood Revival for a further two years.

 Comments from the Project Team 
 

 James Tutte, Store Development Manager, Tesco: 

&quot;This has been a fantastic project from start to finish, and the Yorkon team really pulled out all the stops to make it happen. It was a challenging project given the very tight programme but Yorkon performed extremely well both in terms of the quality of the finished store and the way it was delivered.&quot;

 Ralph Scott, CDW&amp;Partners:
 

&quot;Our challenge was to pick out the essence of retailing in the 1960s - and also to reflect a vision of that period that we would all recognise. We sourced materials and finishes for the store, and developed a visual style that would inject a sense of humour to the project. Signs had the appearance of handwritten posters and many products are stacked. The finished effect and how our vision was realised were really excellent.&quot;
