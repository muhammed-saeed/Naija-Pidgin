 Occupational wages in the fast-food
restaurant industry 

 Robert W. Van Giezen 
 
 T he fast-food restaurant
has been one of the fastest growing industries in the United
States. Over the past 20 years, it has accounted for a larger
proportion of food budgets, reflecting, among other reasons,
greater spending power and changing lifestyles prompted by
increasing participation of women in the labor force and the rise
of one-person households. In the 1970&apos;s, fast-food restaurants
sales expanded an average of 20 percent annually before&quot;slowing&quot;to 10 percent in the 1980&apos;s. 1 The industry has grown to more than 100,000 stores and
$60 billion in annual sales. 1 Fast-food
businesses now constitute more than 40 percent of the Nation&apos;s
restaurants. 2 

 Employment also has grown rapidly; fast-food
restaurants employ more than 2.3 million workers - more than 40
percent of the nearly 60 million employees who work at eating
places. 3 Fast-food restaurants rely heavily for their work force
on teenagers and others with little work experience, or those
looking for part-time employment. Nearly 70 percent of employees
are 20 years or younger, and the average work week is 29.5 hours.
Turnover is high, with only a little more than half the work
force remaining 1 year or longer. An analysis of the turnover
rate among employees in fast-food restaurants reveals that 75
percent of employees remain 6 months, 53 percent remain 1 year,
25 percent stay 2 years; only 12 percent remain 3 years of longer. In addition, nearly two-thirds of employees are women, and 23
percent are nonwhite. 4 For many teenagers, a fast-food restaurant is their
first work experience. For example, one researcher has estimated
that the first job for 1 in 15 workers in the United States was
at a McDonald&apos;s restaurant. 5 

 Average earnings for fast-food workers ranged
from $4.33 an hour in Puerto Rico to $5.70 in Honolulu, HI,
according to surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
from November 1992 to March 1993. 6 Earnings for
fast-food shift leaders also were lower in Puerto Rico ($4.64)
and highest in Guam ($7.43). (See table1.)
