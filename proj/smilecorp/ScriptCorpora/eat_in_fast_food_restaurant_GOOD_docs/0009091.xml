All the time very busy here its quite hard to find your self a seat inside here.Service from the staff though is good they are always cleaning up and looking for available tables.

Customer service here is a typical McDonalds one,food is tasty as expected.

This McDonalds has a drive way feature is much faster they take orders straight away. The longest wait here on the drive way option depends on how many cars are there.The service does seem much quicker than going inside here though.

For quality McDonalds always make their food fresh here.

They always make sure the food is right with the taste to. How often do you get perfectly cooked fillet o fishes here? The answer to the question is all the time. You may have to wait at McDonalds with the busy rushes but remember the food quality here is fresh and perfect all the time!

this mcdonalds is very nice and is always very welcoming. i enjoy the food and like to come here often. the staff are very on board and are always ready to help. its in a very good location and is very convinient. at times the store can be quite busy and will feel a little cramped out and sometimes it can be quite difficult to find a seat.

McDonalds is always busy a lot, If you come at lunchtime you will find no space to eat inside and always find your self waiting a long time to order your food. They make the food fresh here and always make it perfect, The customer service is good here just too many people here!

This Mcdonalds in Blackburn is absolutley fantastic. It is located in the centre of the town so you can come in for a bite after you have done your shopping! It has recently been done up as well. There is always a good atmosphere in here but it does get very busy at time but it is to be expected since it is in the town centre. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They don’t mind changing the toy in the happy meals for the kids if you ask them nicely ;) I have done a couple of birthday parties in here for my son and they are always very good with the children in here. I think they are quite quick with the orders as well to say how busy they get.

McDonald’s on King William St is located in the middle of the town centre. Inside it has recently changed to a more modern layout with more table and more comfortable chairs. When they did this they got rid of the childrens area which was often used for childrens partys.

There is often queues inside but the trick is to walk through the tables on the left to get to the tills on the left hand side are you’ll be stuck in the bottleneck ;) The food is served quite quickly but there can often be a wait for new items or things like Deli sandwhiches.

There is toilets inside but very small for the men’s with one urinal and one closed door toilet.

McDonald’s is a fast food restaurant, You can buy ice creams and fast food from here, The restaurant is most busy on the weekends and waiting lines do get to the door then, They make the food fresh from here and make it well, Its a great restaurant to eat from but with too much kids around throwing food it can be annoying eating here.

The interior is very funky!! Greens, blacks and browns - its really cool looking. the chairs are big and weird and it has a picnic table type thing as well!!
Located in the centre of town, which is useful.The food is average. Dont really like McDonalds - it tastes the same as all McDonalds:dry and strange.
