It is the largest Sikh temple in Europe. Building work at the Havelock Road site commenced in March 2000 and the Gurdwara opened on Sunday 30 March 2003, in order to accommodate for Southall&apos;s growing Sikh community. The Gurdwara cost£17.5 million to build. Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall was established in England by Sikhs who had emigrated in the fifties and early sixties. By the 1950s, a significant number of Sikhs were living in Britain, and the main congregational gathering was at Shepherd&apos;s Bush Gurdwara. To accommodate the Southall Sikhs, the Southall Sikh Cultural Society was established in 1960. This organisation held Sunday programmes at Shackleton Hall until it moved to 11 Beaconsfield Road. The emigration of Malaysian and Singaporean Sikhs led to the formation of another group -- Sri Guru Nanak Singh Sabha. The two groups remained independent until 1964, when they merged as Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall. 1964 also saw the first Gurdwara built. It was situated at the Green, and was the headquarters of the Sri Guru Singh Sabha. The Havelock Road site was purchased in 1967. The dairy was transformed into the Gurdwara in a matter of weeks.

 Southall is a large suburban district of west London, England, and part of the London Borough of Ealing . It is situated 10.7 miles (17.2 km) west of Charing Cross . Neighbouring places include Yeading , Hayes , Hanwell , Heston , Hounslow , Greenford and Northolt . The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. [ 1 ] 

Southall is located on the Grand Union Canal (formerly the Grand Junction Canal ) which first linked London with the rest of the growing canal system. It was one of the last canals to carry significant commercial traffic (through the 1950s) and is still open to traffic and is used by pleasure craft.

The town has one of the largest concentrations of South Asian people outside of the Indian sub-continent.

 Toponymy [link] 

The name Southall derives from the Anglo-Saxon dative æt súð healum, &quot;At the south corner (of the land or wood)&quot; and súð heal, &quot;South corner&quot; and separates it from Northolt which was originally norþ heal, &quot;North corner&quot; which through a later association with Anglo-Saxon holt , &quot;Wood, copse &quot; developed into Northolt . [ citation needed ] 

The district of Southall has many other Anglo-Saxon place-names such as Elthorne and Waxlow. Its earliest record, from ad 830, is of Warberdus bequeathing Norwood Manor and Southall Manor to the archbishops of Canterbury. [ citation needed ] 

 History [link] 

Southall formed part of the chapelry of Norwood in the ancient parish of Hayes , in the Elthorne hundred of Middlesex . [ 2 ] For Poor Law it was grouped into the Uxbridge Union and was within Uxbridge Rural Sanitary District from 1875. The chapelry of Norwood had functioned as a separate parish since the Middle Ages. On 16 January 1891 the parish adopted the Local Government Act 1858 and the Southall Norwood Local Government District was formed. In 1894 it became the Southall Norwood Urban District . [ 2 ] In 1936 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough , renamed Southall. [ 3 ] In 1965 the former area of the borough was merged with that of the boroughs of Ealing and Acton to form the London Borough of Ealing in Greater London. [ 4 ] 

The southern part of Southall (roughly south of the railway) used to be known as Southall Green (and a section of the main north-south road in the area is still called The Green) and was centred on the historic Tudor -styled Manor House [ 5 ] which dates back to at least 1587. Little of the building is original but much dates back to the days when Southall Green was a quiet rural village. It is currently used as serviced offices. [ 6 ] 

The extreme southernmost part of Southall is known as Norwood Green . It has few industries and is mainly a residential area, having remained for many years mainly agricultural whilst the rest of Southall developed industrially. Norwood Green borders, and part is inside, the London Borough of Hounslow .
 A tram from Hayes in the Broadway c.1905 
The main east west road through the town is Uxbridge Road ( A4020 ), though the name changes in the main shopping area to The Broadway and for an even shorter section to High Street . Uxbridge Road was part of the main London to Oxford stagecoach route for many years and remained the main route to Oxford until the building of the Western Avenue highway to the north of Southall in the first half of the 20th century. First horse drawn, then electric trams (until 1936) and, then, electric trolleybuses , gave Southall residents and workers quick and convenient transport along Uxbridge Road in the first half of the 20th century before they were replaced by standard diesel-engined buses in 1960. [ 7 ] 

 Nineteenth century [link] 

The opening of the Grand Junction Canal (later renamed Grand Union Canal ) as the major freight transport route between London and Birmingham in 1796 began a commercial boom, intensified by the arrival of Brunel&apos;s Great Western Railway in 1839, leading to the establishment and growth of brick factories, flour mills and chemical plants which formed the town&apos;s commercial base. In 1877, the Martin Brothers set up a ceramics factory in an old soap works next to the canal and until 1923, produced distinctive ceramics now known and collected as Martinware.

A branch railway line from Southall railway station to the Brentford Dock on the Thames was also built by Brunel in 1856. It features one of his (impressive for the period) engineering works, the Three Bridges where Windmill Lane, the railway and the Grand Union Canal all intersect – the canal being carried over the railway line in a metal trough. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument . The other notable local construction by Brunel is the Wharncliffe Viaduct which carries the Great Western Railway across the River Brent towards London and which was Brunel&apos;s first major structural design.

Otto Monsted, a Danish margarine manufacturer, built a large factory at Southall in 1894. The factory was called the Maypole Dairy, and eventually grew to become one of the largest margarine manufacturing plants in the world, occupying a 28 hectares (69 acres) site at its peak. The factory also had its own railway sidings and branch canal. The Maypole Dairy Company was later acquired by Lever Brothers who, as part of the multinational Unilever company, converted the site to a Wall&apos;s Sausages factory which produced sausages and other meat products through until the late 1970s.

 Twentieth century [link] 

The Quaker Oats Company built a factory in Southall in 1936. Part of the operation that made pet foods was sold to Spiller&apos;s in 1994, and the remainder to Big Bear Group in 2006. The site continues to produce brands such as Sugar Puffs . Other engineering, paint and food processing factories prospered for many years, mostly alongside the railway and/or canal. A collection of Martinware – salt-glazed stoneware , and birds – is on display at Southall Library.

On the eastern boundary of Southall was the Hanwell Asylum , once the world&apos;s largest asylum for the mentally ill. It was considered in its day to be a progressive institution with a good success rate for treatment. As attitudes to and treatment for mental illness improved, the site was renamed St. Bernard&apos;s Hospital. In the late 1970s, the site was extensively redeveloped, with most of the area now taken up by the Ealing Hospital . St. Bernard&apos;s still operates a large facility on part of the site under the West London Mental Health (NHS) Trust .

Southall was the home of Southall Studios , one of the earliest British film studios . It played a historic role in film-making from its creation in 1924 to its closure in 1959. In 1936, a fire destroyed the studio but it was rebuilt and enlarged. Numerous feature films (many featuring famous or later-to-be-famous actors) and the early TV series Colonel March of Scotland Yard were made at the studios, as were TV and cinema adverts. [ 8 ] 

There has been a locomotive works at the Southall Depot for nearly 150 years. Originally a Great Western Railway shed, it was possibly the last London steam depot, outlasting Old Oak Common and Stewarts Lane depots. The depot was later used for DMU maintenance and as a base for the electrification programme . Currently the site, now referred to as the Southall Railway Centre , is used by three independent groups, including Locomotive Services (where volunteers can contribute to the preservation and restoration of mainline locomotives) and the Great Western Railway Preservation Group.

The bus and commercial vehicle manufacturer Associated Equipment Company (AEC) was based in Southall, on a 25 hectares (62 acres) triangular site between Windmill Lane, the main Great Western Railway and the branch to Brentford Dock . The company moved there from Walthamstow in 1926 and closed in 1979 after losing market share whilst part of the giant but inefficient British Leyland group. The site was noticeable for railway passengers due to a large sign saying &quot;Builders of London&apos;s Buses for 50 years&quot;. A major gas works manufacturing town gas was located between the railway and the canal. Since production ceased in the 1970s, much of the 36 hectares (89 acres) site has been vacant, due to limited road access and remaining gas infrastructure.

During World War II Southall was the target of enemy bombing on a number of occasions. A German V-1 flying bomb destroyed a number of houses in Regina Road, killing the occupants. [ 9 ] Bomb shelters and bunkers were built during the war, close to or under most schools and public buildings. The bunkers at Hamborough Primary School were expanded during the Cold War , to become the North West Group War HQ for the London area Civil Defence organisation and the London Borough of Ealing Emergency Control Centre. This facility is now disused. [ 10 ] 

On 2 September 1958 at 7:10 am, a pilot of a Vickers Viking V624 (G-AIJE), which had just taken off from Heathrow Airport , reported that he had engine trouble. Some minutes later it crashed onto houses in Kelvin Gardens. It was on a cargo flight carrying aero engines to Tel Aviv and carried no passengers, however the three crew members and four people on the ground were killed. One of the surviving occupants, 14-year-old Brian Gibbons, was later awarded the George Medal for bravery, as well as the Carnegie Award. [ 11 ] The accident was due to poor maintenance, and caused the company, Independent Air Travel, to fail in October 1959. [ 12 ] 

On 23 April 1979, Blair Peach , a teacher and anti-racist activist, was killed after police knocked him unconscious during a protest against the National Front (NF). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Another demonstrator, Clarence Baker – a singer of the reggae band Misty in Roots , remained in a coma for five months. [ 15 ] More than 40 others — including 21 police — were injured, and 300 were arrested. [ 16 ] 

On 4 July 1981, a race riot was sparked at the Hambrough Tavern on the Broadway. [ 17 ] Local Asian youths mistakenly believed that a concert featuring the Oi! bands The Business , The Last Resort and The 4-Skins was a white power event. [ 18 ] Additionally, the venue had recently been sued for barring non-white customers, and local youths had heard that skinheads arriving for the concert had harassed other youths and women. [ 19 ] More than 200 skinheads had travelled by bus from East London, and a few of them smashed shop windows, [ 20 ] [ page needed ] wrote NF slogans around the area, [ 21 ] and shouted neo-Nazi slogans while using bricks and clubs to attack Asian youths who had gathered in opposition to the gig. This was one of several high-profile riots in Britain that year.

Although some of the skinheads were NF or British Movement supporters, among the 500 or so concert-goers were also left-wing skinheads, black skinheads, punk rockers , rockabillies and non-affiliated youths. [ 22 ] A few of the approximately 300 Asians threw petrol bombs and other objects, and five hours of rioting left 120 people injured — including 60 police officers — and the tavern burnt down. [ 17 ] [ 23 ] 

The Southall rail crash occurred on 19 September 1997 when a mainline high speed express train from Swansea to London Paddington ran a red signal, when the driver&apos;s attention was distracted, and it collided with a goods train just outside Southall railway station. Seven people died and 139 were injured.

Southall is primarily a South Asian residential district, sometimes known as &quot; Little India &quot;. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In 1950, the first group of South Asians arrived in Southall, reputedly recruited to work in a local factory owned by a former British Indian Army officer . This South Asian population grew, due to the closeness of expanding employment opportunities such as London Heathrow Airport . The most significant cultural group to settle in Southall are Asians. According to the Commission for Racial Equality , over 55% of Southall&apos;s population of 70,000 is Indian / Pakistani . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] There are ten Sikh Gurdwaras in Southall and one of them won the Ealing Civic Society Architectural Award in 2003. The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha , which opened in 2003, is one of the largest Sikh temples outside India .

This was painted on the tower after a number of pilots became confused between Heathrow and the nearby RAF Northolt which has a much shorter runway. One Boeing 707 landed at Northolt by mistake [ 33 ] and a number of other pilots were en route there when warned off by air traffic control .

Southall is also the location of the Glassy Junction public house , which has now closed down and its future is unsure.

 England i / ˈ ɪ ŋ ɡ l ə n d / is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west; the Irish Sea is to the north west, the Celtic Sea to the south west, while the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south separate it from continental Europe . Most of England comprises the central and southern part of the island of Great Britain in the North Atlantic. The country also includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight .

The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period, but it takes its name from the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in AD 927, and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world. [ 9 ] The English language, the Anglican Church , and English law —the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country&apos;s parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. [ 10 ] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world&apos;s first industrialised nation. [ 11 ] England&apos;s Royal Society laid the foundations of modern experimental science. [ 12 ] 

England&apos;s terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous Lake District , Pennines , and Yorkshire Dales ) and in the south west (for example, Dartmoor and the Cotswolds ). The former capital city of England was Winchester until London took over in 1066. Today London is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the European Union by most measures. [ nb 3 ] England&apos;s population is about 51 million, around 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, and is largely concentrated in London, the South East and conurbations in the Midlands , the North West , the North East and Yorkshire , which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century. Meadowlands and pastures are found beyond the major cities.

The Kingdom of England —which after 1284 included Wales—was a sovereign state until 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . In 1922, the Irish Free State was established as a separate dominion , but the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 reincorporated into the kingdom six Irish counties to officially create the current United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .

 [ edit ] Toponymy 
 See also: Toponymy of England 
The name &quot;England&quot; is derived from the Old English name Englaland , which means &quot;land of the Angles &quot;. [ 15 ] The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages . The Angles came from the Angeln peninsula in the Bay of Kiel area of the Baltic Sea . [ 16 ] According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first known use of &quot;England&quot; to refer to the southern part of the island of Great Britain occurs in 897, and its modern spelling was first used in 1538. [ 17 ] 

The earliest attested mention of the name occurs in the 1st century work by Tacitus , Germania , in which the Latin word Anglii is used. [ 18 ] The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an angular shape. [ 19 ] How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the Saxons , came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons. [ 20 ] It may be worth noting that in Scottish Gaelic , another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, it was the dominant Saxon tribe who gave their name to the word for &apos;England&apos; (&quot;Sasunn&quot;). [ 21 ] 

An alternative name for England is Albion . The name Albion originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The earliest record of the name appears in the Aristotelian Corpus , specifically the 4th century BC De Mundo : [ 22 ] &quot;Beyond the Pillars of Hercules is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are Albion and Ierne &quot;. [ 22 ] The word Albion (Ἀλβίων) or insula Albionum has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin albus meaning white, a reference to the white cliffs of Dover , the only part of Britain visible from the European Continent, [ 23 ] or from the phrase in Massaliote Periplus , the &quot;island of the Albiones &quot;. [ 24 ] Albion is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity. [ 25 ] Another romantic name for England is Loegria , related to the Welsh word for England, Lloegr , and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend .

 History [link] 
 Main article: History of England 
 Prehistory and antiquity [link] 
 Main article: Prehistoric Britain Stonehenge , a Neolithic monument 
The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor , dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago. [ 26 ] Modern humans are known to have first inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths , bison and woolly rhinoceros remained. Roughly 11,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula . [ 29 ] The sea level was lower than now, and Britain was connected by land to both Ireland and Eurasia . [ 30 ] As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.

The Beaker culture arrived around 2500 BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores. [ 31 ] It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, both of which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze , and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs , advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields ), as well as the production of more effective weapons. [ 32 ] 

According to John T. Koch and others, England in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that included the whole of the British Isles and much of what we now regard as France together with the Iberian Peninsula. Celtic languages developed in those areas; Tartessian may have been the earliest written Celtic language. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] 
 Boudica led an uprising against the Roman Empire . 
During the Iron Age , Celtic culture , deriving from the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures , arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy &apos;s Geographia there were around 20 different tribes in the area. However, earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55 BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a client king from the Trinovantes .

The Romans invaded Britain in AD 43 during the reign of Emperor Claudius , subsequently conquering much of Britain , and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province . [ 36 ] The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus . Later, an uprising led by Boudica , Queen of the Iceni , ended with Boudica&apos;s suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street . [ 37 ] This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of Roman law , Roman architecture , sewage systems, many agricultural items, and silk. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (modern-day York ) , where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor. [ 41 ] 

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, with probability lying much earlier. According to Bede , missionaries were sent from Rome by Eleutherius at the request of the chieftain Lucius of Britain in AD 180 to settle controverted points of differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials which were disturbing the church. There are, however, traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through Joseph of Arimathea , while others claim through Lucius of Britain . [ 42 ] By 410, as the Empire declined , Britain was left exposed by the withdrawal of Roman army units , to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars. [ 43 ] 

 Middle Ages [link] 
 Main article: England in the Middle Ages Replica of a 7th century ceremonial helmet from the Kingdom of East Anglia , found at Sutton Hoo . 
Roman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Angles , Saxons and Jutes who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and now began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country. [ 43 ] Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons&apos; victory at the Battle of Mount Badon , but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age . The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards and by Irish missionaries led by Aidan around the same time. [ 44 ] Disputes between the varying influences represented by these missions ended in victory for the Roman tradition.

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , East Anglia , Essex , Kent and Sussex . Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued. [ 45 ] The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. [ 46 ] In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw . This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea empire that also included Denmark and Norway . However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.
 King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt , fought on Saint Crispin&apos;s Day and concluded with an English victory against a larger French army in the Hundred Years&apos; War . 
A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy . [ 47 ] The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. [ 48 ] This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language. [ 49 ] 

The House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II , adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine . [ 50 ] They reigned for three centuries, proving noted monarchs such as Richard I , Edward I , Edward III and Henry V . [ 50 ] The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the Magna Carta , an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign&apos;s powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century [ 51 ] and the Lordship of Ireland was gifted to the English monarchy by the Pope.

During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to House of Capet and with it France—the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years&apos; War . [ 52 ] The Black Death epidemic hit England , starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England&apos;s inhabitants . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] From 1453 to 1487 civil war between two branches of the royal family occurred—the Yorkists and Lancastrians —known as the Wars of the Roses . [ 55 ] Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors , a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed. [ 56 ] 

 Early Modern [link] 
 King Henry VIII became Supreme Head of the Church of England . 
During the Tudor period , the Renaissance reached England through Italian courtiers, who reintroduced artistic, educational and scholarly debate from classical antiquity. [ 57 ] During this time England began to develop naval skills , and exploration to the West intensified. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] 

 Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England . In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological. [ nb 4 ] He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts . There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry&apos;s daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I . The former brought the country back to Catholicism, while the later broke from it again, more forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism .

An English fleet under Francis Drake defeated an invading Spanish Armada during the Elizabethan period . Competing with Spain , the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer Walter Raleigh in Virginia and named Roanoke . The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony, after it was found abandoned on the return of the late arriving supply ship. [ 61 ] With the East India Company , England also competed with the Dutch and French in the East. The political structure of the island was changed in 1603, when the Stuart James VI of Scotland , a kingdom which was a longtime rival, inherited the throne of England as James I —creating a personal union . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] He styled himself King of Great Britain , although this had no basis in English law. [ 64 ] Under the auspices of King James VI and I the so called Authorized King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It has not only been ranked with Shakespeare &apos;s works as the greatest masterpiece of literature in the English language, but also has been the standard version of the Bible most Christians have read for four hundred years.
 The English Restoration restored the monarchy under King Charles II and peace after the English Civil War . 
Based on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the English Civil War was fought between the supporters of Parliament and those of King Charles I , known as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms , involving Scotland and Ireland . The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced with the Commonwealth . Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653, a period of personal rule followed. [ 65 ] After Cromwell&apos;s death, and his son Richard&apos;s resignation as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660 with the Restoration . It was now constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, and the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without prior approval by Parliament. [ 66 ] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.

The Great Fire of London in 1666 gutted the City of London but it was rebuilt shortly afterwards. [ 67 ] In Parliament two factions had emerged—the Tories and Whigs . The former were royalists while the latter were classical liberals. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II , some of them, along with the Whigs, deposed him in the Revolution of 1688 and invited Dutch prince William III to become monarch. Some English people, especially in the north, were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed, [ 68 ] the two countries joined in political union , to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. [ 62 ] To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national church of each remained separate. [ 69 ] 

 Late Modern and contemporary [link] 
 Saltaire , West Yorkshire, is a model mill town from the Industrial Revolution , and a World Heritage Site . 
Under the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering. This paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire . Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution , a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. [ 70 ] The opening of Northwest England&apos;s Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In 1825 the world&apos;s first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway —opened to the public. [ 71 ] 

During the Industrial Revolution, many workers moved from England&apos;s countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at Manchester and Birmingham , dubbed &quot;Warehouse City&quot; and &quot;Workshop of the World&quot; respectively. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] England maintained relative stability throughout the French Revolution ; William Pitt the Younger was British Prime Minister for the reign of George III . During the Napoleonic Wars , Napoleon planned to invade from the south-east . However this failed to manifest and the Napoleonic forces were defeated by the British at sea by Lord Nelson and on land by the Duke of Wellington . The Napoleonic Wars fostered a concept of Britishness and a united national British people , shared with the Scots and Welsh. [ 75 ] 
 The Cenotaph, Whitehall is a memorial to members of the British Armed Forces who died during the two World Wars. 
London became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the Victorian era , and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. [ 76 ] Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage . [ 77 ] Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies . [ nb 5 ] Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies . At the end of the Phoney War , Winston Churchill became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz . Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation , and there was a speeding up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle &apos;s development of the jet engine led to wider air travel . [ 79 ] Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. England&apos;s NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] 

Since the 20th century there has been significant population movement to England, mostly from other parts of the British Isles , but also from the Commonwealth , particularly the Indian subcontinent . [ 82 ] Since the 1970s there has been a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry . [ 83 ] As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union . Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. [ 84 ] England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. [ 85 ] Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum. [ 88 ] 

 Governance [link] 

 Politics [link] 
 Main article: Politics of England Palace of Westminster , the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom 
As part of the United Kingdom, the basic political system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system . [ 89 ] There has not been a Government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707 , putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union , joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . [ 68 ] Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England . Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom , although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. [ 90 ] In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster , there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total. [ 91 ] 

In the United Kingdom general election, 2010 the Conservative Party had won an absolute majority in England&apos;s 532 contested seats with 61 seats more than all other parties combined (the Speaker of the House not being counted as a Conservative). However, taking Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales into account this was not enough to secure an overall majority, resulting in a hung parliament . [ 92 ] In order to achieve a majority the Conservative party, headed by David Cameron , entered into a coalition agreement with the third largest party, the Liberal Democrats , led by Nick Clegg . Subsequently the Labour Party leader, Gordon Brown was forced to step down as prime minister [ 93 ] and leader of the Labour party, now led by Ed Miliband .
 Changing of the Queen&apos;s Guard at the royal residence , Buckingham Palace 
As the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, there are elections held regionally in England to decide who is sent as Members of the European Parliament . The 2009 European Parliament election saw the regions of England elect the following MEPs: 23 Conservatives, ten Labour, nine UK Independence Party (UKIP), nine Liberal Democrats, two Greens and two British National Party (BNP). [ 94 ] 

Since devolution , in which other countries of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland —each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal&apos;s rejection by the North East in a referendum, this has not been carried out. [ 88 ] 

One major issue is the West Lothian question , in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. [ 95 ] This when placed in the context of England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees , [ 96 ] has led to a steady rise in English nationalism . [ 97 ] Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament , [ 98 ] while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs. [ 99 ] 
 
 Law [link] 
 Main article: English law The Royal Courts of Justice 
The English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of common law [ 100 ] legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries [ 101 ] and the United States (except Louisiana ). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union , as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts , applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent — stare decisis —to the facts before them. [ 102 ] 

The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature, consisting of the Court of Appeal , the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases. [ 103 ] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales . It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the judicial functions of the House of Lords . [ 104 ] A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions. [ 105 ] 

Crime increased between 1981 and 1995, but fell by 42% in the period 1995–2006. [ 106 ] The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. [ 107 ] Her Majesty&apos;s Prison Service , reporting to the Ministry of Justice , manages most prisons , housing over 80,000 convicts. [ 107 ]

The subdivisions of England consist of up to four levels of subnational division controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government . The highest tier of local government were the nine regions of England : North East , North West , Yorkshire and the Humber , East Midlands , West Midlands , East , South East , South West , and London. These were created in 1994 as Government Offices , used by the British Government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional Government offices were abolished. [ 108 ] The same boundaries remain in use for electing Members of the European Parliament on a regional basis.

After devolution began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional assemblies as a counterweight. London accepted in 1998: the London Assembly was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. [ 88 ] The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of local authority leaders&apos; boards . [ 109 ] 

Below the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 ceremonial counties . [ 110 ] These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the Middle Ages , with some established as recently as 1974. [ 111 ] Each has a Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff ; these posts are used to represent the British monarch locally. [ 110 ] Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly , England is also divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties ; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government [ 112 ] and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.

There are six metropolitan counties based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils. [ 112 ] In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the metropolitan boroughs . Elsewhere, 27 non-metropolitan &quot;shire&quot; counties have a county council and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as unitary authorities . Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 London boroughs , plus the City of London covering a small area at the core, governed by the City of London Corporation . [ 113 ] At the most localised level, much of England is divided into civil parishes with councils ; they do not exist in Greater London. [ 114 ]

 Landscape and rivers [link] 
 Wastwater in the Lake District 
Geographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly . It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom— to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. England is closer to the European continent than any other part of mainland Britain. It is separated from France by a 34-kilometre (21 mi) [ 115 ] sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone . [ 116 ] England also has shores on the Irish Sea , North Sea and Atlantic Ocean.

The ports of London, Liverpool , and Newcastle lie on the tidal rivers Thames , Mersey and Tyne respectively. At 354 kilometres (220 mi), the Severn is the longest river flowing through England. [ 117 ] It empties into the Bristol Channel and is notable for its Severn Bore tidal waves, which can reach 2 metres (6.6 ft) in height. [ 118 ] However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is 346 kilometres (215 mi) in length. [ 119 ] There are many lakes in England ; the largest is Windermere , within the aptly named Lake District . [ 120 ] 
 Terrain of Dartmoor , Devon 
In geological terms, the Pennines , known as the &quot;backbone of England&quot;, are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the Paleozoic Era around 300 million years ago. [ 121 ] Their geological composition includes, among others, sandstone and limestone , and also coal. There are karst landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire . The Pennine landscape is high moorland in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region&apos;s rivers. They contain three national parks , the Yorkshire Dales , Northumberland , and the Peak District . The highest point in England, at 978 metres (3,209 ft), is Scafell Pike in Cumbria. [ 120 ] Straddling the border between England and Scotland are the Cheviot Hills .

The English Lowlands are to the south of the Pennines, consisting of green rolling hills, including the Cotswold Hills , Chiltern Hills , North and South Downs —where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the cliffs of Dover . The granite Southwest Peninsula in the West Country includes upland moorland, such as Dartmoor and Exmoor , and enjoys a mild climate ; both are national parks. [ 122 ] 
 
 Climate [link] 
 Main article: Climate of England 
England has a temperate maritime climate : it is mild with temperatures not much lower than 0 °C (32 °F) in winter and not much higher than 32 °C (90 °F) in summer. [ 123 ] The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the English coast , while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October. [ 123 ] Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.

Important influences on the climate of England are its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, its northern latitude and the warming of the sea by the Gulf Stream . [ 123 ] Rainfall is higher in the west, and parts of the Lake District receive more rain than anywhere else in the country. [ 123 ] Since weather records began, the highest temperature recorded was 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) on 10 August 2003 at Brogdale in Kent, [ 124 ] while the lowest was −26.1 °C (−15.0 °F) on 10 January 1982 in Edgmond , Shropshire.

The Greater London Urban Area is by far the largest urban area in England [ 127 ] and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a global city and has a population larger than other countries in the United Kingdom besides England itself. [ 127 ] Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands . [ 127 ] There are fifty settlements which have been designated city status in England , while the wider United Kingdom has sixty-six.

While many cities in England are quite large in size, such as Birmingham , Sheffield , Manchester, Liverpool , Leeds , Newcastle , Bradford , Nottingham and others, a large population is not necessarily a prerequisite for a settlement to be afforded city status. [ 128 ] Traditionally the status was afforded to towns with diocesan cathedrals and so there are smaller cities like Wells , Ely , Ripon , Truro and Chichester . [ 128 ] According to the Office for National Statistics the ten largest, continuous built-up urban areas are: [ 127 ]

 Economy [link] 
 Main article: Economy of England The City of London is the world&apos;s largest financial centre . [ 130 ] [ 131 ] 
England&apos;s economy is one of the largest in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907. [ 132 ] Usually regarded as a mixed market economy , it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. [ 133 ] The official currency in England is the pound sterling , whose ISO 4217 code is GBP. Taxation in England is quite competitive when compared to much of the rest of Europe—as of 2009 the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to £37,400, and 40% on any additional earnings above that amount. [ 134 ] 

The economy of England is the largest part of the UK&apos;s economy , [ 132 ] which has the 18th highest GDP PPP per capita in the world. England is a leader in the chemical [ 135 ] and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly aerospace , the arms industry , and the manufacturing side of the software industry . London, home to the London Stock Exchange , the United Kingdom&apos;s main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England&apos;s financial centre—100 of Europe&apos;s 500 largest corporations are based in London. [ 136 ] London is the largest financial centre in Europe, and as of 2009 [update] is also the largest in the world. [ 137 ] 
 The Bentley Mulsanne . Bentley is a well-known English car company. 
The Bank of England , founded in 1694 by Scottish banker William Paterson , is the United Kingdom&apos;s central bank . Originally established as private banker to the Government of England, since 1946 it has been a state-owned institution . [ 138 ] The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales , although not in other parts of the United Kingdom. The government has devolved responsibility to the Bank&apos;s Monetary Policy Committee for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates. [ 139 ] 

England is highly industrialised, but since the 1970s there has been a decline in traditional heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. [ 83 ] Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals , cars—although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Rolls-Royce , Lotus , Jaguar and Bentley — crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm , aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages. [ 140 ] Agriculture is intensive and highly mechanised, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. [ 141 ] Two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, the other to arable crops. [ 142 ] 

 Science and technology [link] 
 Main articles: List of English inventions and discoveries and Royal Society Sir Isaac Newton is one of the most influential figures in the history of science . 
Prominent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton , Michael Faraday , Robert Hooke , Robert Boyle , Joseph Priestley , J. J. Thomson , Charles Babbage , Charles Darwin , Stephen Hawking , Christopher Wren , Alan Turing , Francis Crick , Joseph Lister , Tim Berners-Lee , Paul Dirac , Andrew Wiles and Richard Dawkins . Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a metric system was invented by John Wilkins , the first secretary of the Royal Society , in 1668. [ 143 ] As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution , England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include Isambard Kingdom Brunel , best known for the creation of the Great Western Railway , a series of famous steamships , and numerous important bridges, hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering. [ 144 ] Thomas Newcomen &apos;s steam engine helped spawn the Industrial Revolution. [ 145 ] The physician Edward Jenner &apos;s smallpox vaccine is said to have &quot;saved more lives [...] than were lost in all the wars of mankind since the beginning of recorded history.&quot; [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] 

Inventions and discoveries of the English include: the jet engine , the first industrial spinning machine , the first computer and the first modern computer , the World Wide Web along with HTML , the first successful human blood transfusion , the motorised vacuum cleaner , [ 149 ] the lawn mower , the seat belt , the hovercraft , the electric motor , steam engines , and theories such as the Darwinian theory of evolution and atomic theory . Newton developed the ideas of universal gravitation , Newtonian mechanics , and infinitesimal calculus , and Robert Hooke his eponymously named law of elasticity . Other inventions include the iron plate railway, the thermosiphon , tarmac , the rubber band , the mousetrap , &quot;cat&apos;s eye&quot; road marker , joint development of the light bulb , steam locomotives , the modern seed drill and many modern techniques and technologies used in precision engineering . [ 150 ] 

 Transport [link] 
 Main article: Transport in England London Heathrow Airport has more international passenger traffic than any other airport in the world. [ 151 ] 
The Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. There are many motorways in England , and many other trunk roads, such as the A1 Great North Road , which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle [ 152 ] (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the M6 , from Rugby through the North West up to the Anglo-Scottish border . [ 152 ] Other major routes include: the M1 from London to Leeds, the M25 which encircles London, the M60 which encircles Manchester, the M4 from London to South Wales, the M62 from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the M5 from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West. [ 152 ] 

 Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include National Express , Arriva and Go-Ahead Group . The red double-decker buses in London have become a symbol of England. There is a rapid rail network in two English cities: the London Underground ; and the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland. [ 153 ] There are several tram networks, such as the Blackpool tramway , Manchester Metrolink , Sheffield Supertram and Midland Metro , and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London. [ 153 ] 

 Rail transport in England is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825. [ 154 ] Much of Britain&apos;s 16,116 kilometres (10,014 mi) of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively, although a high proportion of railway lines were closed in the second half of the 20th century. There are plans to reopen lines such as the Varsity Line between Oxford and Cambridge. These lines are mostly standard gauge ( single , double or quadruple track ) though there are also a few narrow gauge lines . There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the Channel Tunnel , which was completed in 1994.

England has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is London Heathrow , which is the world&apos;s busiest airport measured by number of international passengers . [ 155 ] Other large airports include Manchester Airport , London Stansted Airport , Luton Airport and Birmingham Airport . [ 151 ] By sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including to Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. [ 156 ] There are around 7,100 km (4,400 mi) of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by British Waterways ( Waterscape ), [ 156 ] however water transport is very limited. The Thames is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the Port of Tilbury in the Thames Estuary, one of the United Kingdom&apos;s three major ports. [ 156 ] 

 Healthcare [link] 
 Main article: Healthcare in England Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham , an NHS hospital. 
The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system in England responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946 . It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report , prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge . [ 157 ] The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, [ 158 ] and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care. [ 159 ] 

The government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health , headed by the Secretary of State for Health , who sits in the British Cabinet . Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6 billion was spent in 2008–2009. [ 160 ] In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. [ 161 ] The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom . [ 162 ]

 Main articles: Demography of England , English people , and English diaspora The non-metropolitan counties and unitary authorities of England , colour-coded to show population. 
With over 51 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total. [ 163 ] England taken as a unit and measured against international states has the fourth largest population in the European Union and would be the 25th largest country by population in the world. [ 164 ] With a density of 395 people per square kilometre, it would be the second most densely populated country in the European Union after Malta . [ 165 ] [ 166 ] 

The English people are a British people . [ 3 ] Some genetic evidence suggests that 75–95% descend in the paternal line from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the Iberian Peninsula , as well as a 5% contribution from Angles and Saxons , and a significant Norse element. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] However, other geneticists place the Norse- Germanic estimate up to half. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ] Over time, various cultures have been influential: Prehistoric , Brythonic , [ 173 ] Roman , Anglo-Saxon , [ 174 ] Norse Viking , [ 175 ] Gaelic cultures, as well as a large influence from Normans . There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, Chile , South Africa and New Zealand. [ nb 6 ] Since the late 1990s, many English people have migrated to Spain. [ 180 ] [ 181 ] 
 2009 estimates of ethnic groups in England and Wales . [ 182 ] 
At the time of the Domesday Book , compiled in 1086, more than 90% of the English population of about two million lived in the countryside. [ 183 ] By 1801 the population had grown to 8.3 million, and by 1901 had grown to 30.5 million. [ 184 ] Due in particular to the economic prosperity of South East England , it has received many economic migrants from the other parts of the United Kingdom. [ 3 ] There has been significant Irish migration . [ 185 ] The proportion of ethnically European residents totals at 87.50%, including Germans [ 186 ] and Poles . [ 3 ] 

Other people from much further afield in the former British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% of people living in England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent , mostly India and Pakistan . [ 3 ] [ 186 ] 2.90% of the population are black, from both the Caribbean and countries in Africa itself, especially former British colonies. [ 3 ] [ 186 ] There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese . [ 3 ] [ 186 ] As of 2007 [update] , 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families. [ 187 ] About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration. [ 188 ] Debate over immigration is politically prominent; [ 189 ] according to a Home Office poll, 80% of people want to cap it. [ 190 ] The ONS has projected that the population will grow by six million between 2004 and 2029. [ 191 ]

Countries in light blue have English as an official language, de jure or de facto . English is also one of the official languages of the European Union . [ 192 ] 
As its name suggests, the English language , today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today. It is an Indo-European language in the Anglo-Frisian branch of the Germanic family. [ 193 ] After the Norman conquest , the Old English language was displaced and confined to the lower social classes as Norman French and Latin were used by the aristocracy.

By the 15th century , English came back into fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the English Renaissance , many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. [ 194 ] Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the British Empire , the English language is the world&apos;s unofficial lingua franca . [ 195 ] 

 English language learning and teaching is an important economic activity , and includes language schooling , tourism spending, and publishing . There is no legislation mandating an official language for England, [ 196 ] but English is the only language used for official business. Despite the country&apos;s relatively small size, there are many distinct regional accents , and individuals with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood everywhere in the country.

 Cornish , which died out as a community language in the 18th century , is being revived, [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] and is now protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages .

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] State schools teach students a second language , usually French , German or Spanish . [ 205 ] Due to immigration , it was reported in 2007 that around 800,000 school students spoke a foreign language at home, [ 187 ] the most common being Punjabi and Urdu . [ 206 ] 

 Religion [link] 
 Main article: Religion in England Canterbury Cathedral , seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury 
Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier, in Gaelic and Roman times. It continued through Early Insular Christianity , and today about 72% of English people identify as Christians. [ 207 ] The largest form practised in the present day is Anglicanism , [ 208 ] dating from the 16th century Reformation period, with the 1536 split from Rome over Henry VIII wanting to divorce Catherine of Aragon , and the need for the Bible in the English tongue . The religion regards itself as both Catholic and Reformed .

There are High Church and Low Church traditions, and some Anglicans regard themselves as Anglo-Catholics , after the Tractarian movement . The monarch of the United Kingdom is a titular leader of the Church, acting as its Supreme Governor . It has the status of established church in England. There are around 26 million adherents to the Church of England and they form part of the Anglican Communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury acting as the symbolic worldwide head. [ 209 ] Many cathedrals and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as Westminster Abbey , York Minster , Durham Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral .
 Saint George , the patron saint of England 
The second largest Christian practice is the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, which traces its formal, corporate history in England to the 6th century with Augustine&apos;s mission and was the main religion on the entire island for around a thousand years. Since its reintroduction after the Catholic Emancipation , the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an England and Wales basis where there are 4.5 million members (most of whom are English). [ 210 ] There has been one Pope from England to date, Adrian IV ; while saints Bede and Anselm are regarded as Doctors of the Church .

A form of Protestantism known as Methodism is the third largest Christian practice and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley . [ 211 ] It gained popularity in the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire , and amongst tin miners in Cornwall . [ 212 ] There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists , Quakers , Congregationalists , Unitarians and The Salvation Army . [ 213 ] 

The patron saint of England is Saint George ; he is represented in the national flag, as well as the Union Flag as part of a combination. [ 214 ] [ 214 ] There are many other English and associated saints; some of the best known include: Cuthbert , Alban , Wilfrid , Aidan , Edward the Confessor , John Fisher , Thomas More , Petroc , Piran , Margaret Clitherow and Thomas Becket .

Many ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period, amongst the best known are Stonehenge , Devil&apos;s Arrows , Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg . [ 226 ] With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas , baths , amphitheaters , triumphal arches , villas , Roman temples , Roman roads , Roman forts , stockades and aqueducts . [ 227 ] It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans.

 Early Medieval architecture&apos;s secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of Hiberno — Saxon monasticism , [ 228 ] [ 229 ] to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion.

In the aftermath of the Renaissance a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity, synthesised with Christianity appeared—the English Baroque style, architect Christopher Wren was particularly championed. [ 231 ] 

 Georgian architecture followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace .

It is also known as the Rose of England . [ 299 ] The oak tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The term Royal Oak alludes to the escape of King Charles II from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father&apos;s execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.

The Royal Arms of England, a national coat of arms featuring three lions, originated with its adoption by Richard the Lionheart in 1198. It is blazoned as gules, three lions passant guardant or and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England; it is similar to the traditional arms of Normandy . England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has God Save the Queen . However, the following are often considered unofficial English national anthems: Jerusalem , Land of Hope and Glory (used for England during the 2002 Commonwealth Games ), [ 300 ] and I Vow to Thee, My Country . England&apos;s National Day is 23 April which is St George&apos;s Day : St George is the patron saint of England. [ 301 ]

 Notes [link] 
 
 ^ English is established by de facto usage. ^ Assigned on a United Kingdom basis, not constituent country ^ According to the European Statistical Agency , London is the largest Larger Urban Zone which uses conurbations and areas of high population as its definition. A ranking of population within municipal boundaries places London first. However, the University of Avignon in France claims that Paris is first and London second when including the whole urban area and hinterland , that is the outlying cities as well . ^ As Roger Scruton explains, &quot;The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the &apos;Reformation Parliament&apos; of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not until later make substantial change in doctrine&quot;. [ 60 ] ^ Figure of 550,000 military deaths is for England and Wales [ 78 ] ^ For instance, in 1980 around 50 million Americans claimed English ancestry . [ 176 ] In Canada there are around 6.5 million Canadians who claim English ancestry . [ 177 ] Around 70% of Australians in 1999 denoted their origins as Anglo-Celtic , a category which includes all peoples from Great Britain and Ireland. [ 178 ] Chileans of English descent are somewhat of an anomaly in that Chile itself was never part of the British Empire, but today there are around 420,000 people of English origins living there. [ 179 ] ^ Students attending English universities now have to pay tuition fees towards the cost of their education, as do English students who choose to attend university in Scotland. Scottish students attending Scottish universities have their fees paid by the devolved Scottish Parliament. [ 96 ] ^ While people such as Norman Foster and Richard Rogers represent the modernist movement, Prince Charles since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his Poundbury development in Dorset. [ 232 ] Architects like Raymond Erith , Francis Johnson and Quinlan Terry continued to practice in the classical style. ^ These tales may have come to prominence, at least in part, as an attempt by the Norman ruling elite to legitimise their rule of the British Isles, finding Anglo-Saxon history ill-suited to the task during an era when members of the deposed House of Wessex , especially Edgar the Ætheling and his nephews of the Scottish House of Dunkeld , were still active in the isles. [ 236 ] [ 238 ] Also Michael Wood explains; &quot;Over the centuries the figure of Arthur became a symbol of British history—a way of explaining the matter of Britain, the relationship between the Saxons and the Celts, and a way of exorcising ghosts and healing the wounds of the past.&quot; [ 235 ]

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland [ nb 5 ] (commonly known as the United Kingdom , the UK , or Britain ) is a sovereign state located off the north-western coast of continental Europe . The country includes the island of Great Britain , the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state—the Republic of Ireland . Apart from this land border the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , the North Sea , the English Channel and the Irish Sea .

The United Kingdom is a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system , with its seat of government in the capital city of London . It is a country in its own right [ 10 ] and consists of four countries : England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales . There are three devolved administrations, each with varying powers, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] based in Belfast , Edinburgh and Cardiff , the capitals of Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Associated with the UK, but not constitutionally part of it, are three Crown Dependencies . [ 13 ] The United Kingdom has fourteen overseas territories . [ 14 ] These are remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in 1922, encompassed almost a quarter of the world&apos;s land surface and was the largest empire in history . British influence can still be observed in the language , culture and legal systems of many of its former territories.

The UK is a developed country and has the world&apos;s seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It was the world&apos;s first industrialised country [ 15 ] and the world&apos;s foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. [ 16 ] The UK remains a great power with leading economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence. [ 17 ] It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth in the world. [ 18 ] 

The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union and its predecessor the European Economic Community since 1973. It is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations , the Council of Europe , the G7 , the G8 , the G20 , NATO , the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization .

 Etymology and terminology [link] 

 
 See also: Name of Britain , Terminology of Great Britain , and Terminology of the British Isles 
The name &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; was introduced in 1927 by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act to reflect the reality that the de facto independence of the Irish Free State , created by the partitioning of Ireland in 1922, left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland still within the UK. [ 19 ] Prior to this, the Acts of Union 1800 , that united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland in 1801, had given the new state the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . Great Britain before 1801 is occasionally referred to as the &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] However, Section 1 of both of the 1707 Acts of Union declare that England and Scotland are &quot;United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain&quot;. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ nb 6 ] The term united kingdom is found in informal use during the 18th century to describe the new state but only became official with the union with Ireland in 1801. [ 26 ] 

Although the United Kingdom, as a sovereign state, is a country, England, Scotland, Wales and (more controversially) Northern Ireland are also referred to as countries, although they are not sovereign states and only Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved self-government. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The British Prime Minister&apos;s website has used the phrase &quot;countries within a country&quot; to describe the United Kingdom. [ 10 ] With regard to Northern Ireland , the descriptive name used &quot;can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one&apos;s political preferences.&quot; [ 29 ] Other terms used for Northern Ireland include &quot;region&quot; and &quot;province&quot;. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] 

The United Kingdom is often referred to as Britain . British government sources frequently use the term as a short form for the United Kingdom, whilst media style guides generally allow its use but point out that the longer term Great Britain refers only to England, Scotland and Wales. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] However, some foreign usage, particularly in the United States, uses Great Britain as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Also, the United Kingdom&apos;s Olympic team competes under the name &quot;Great Britain&quot; or &quot;Team GB&quot;. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] GB and GBR are the standard country codes for the United Kingdom (see ISO 3166-2 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 ) and are consequently commonly used by international organisations to refer to the United Kingdom. [ citation needed ] 

In 2006, a new design of British passport entered into use. Its first page shows the long form name of the state in English, Welsh and Scottish Gaelic . [ 39 ] In Welsh, the long form name of the state is &quot;Teyrnas Unedig Prydain Fawr a Gogledd Iwerddon&quot; with &quot;Teyrnas Unedig&quot; being used as a short form name on government websites. [ 40 ] In Scottish Gaelic, the long form is &quot;Rìoghachd Aonaichte na Breatainne Mòire is Èireann a Tuath&quot;.

The adjective British is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom. Although the term has no definite legal connotation, it is used in legislation to refer to United Kingdom citizenship . [ 41 ] However, British people use a number of different terms to describe their national identity. Some may identify themselves as British only, or British and English, Scottish, Welsh, or Northern Irish. Others may identify themselves as only English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish and not British. In Northern Ireland, some describe themselves as only Irish. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]

 Before 1707 [link] 
 Stonehenge , in Wiltshire , was erected around 2500 BC. Main articles: History of England , History of Wales , History of Scotland , History of Ireland , and History of the formation of the United Kingdom 
Settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago . [ 45 ] By the end of the region&apos;s prehistoric period , the population is thought to have belonged, in the main, to a culture termed Insular Celtic , comprising Brythonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland . [ 46 ] The Roman conquest , beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain , was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brythonic area mainly to what was to become Wales . [ 47 ] The region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century. [ 48 ] Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) [ 49 ] [ 50 ] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. [ 51 ] 
 The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings and the events leading to it. 
In 1066, the Normans invaded England and after its conquest , seized large parts of Wales , conquered much of Ireland and settled in Scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture. [ 52 ] The Norman elites greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, each of the local cultures. [ 53 ] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and made an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to annex Scotland . Thereafter, Scotland maintained its independence, albeit in near-constant conflict with England . The English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years War . [ 54 ] 

The early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country. [ 55 ] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England , [ 56 ] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown . [ 57 ] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and land given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. [ 58 ] In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots , inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political institutions. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War ) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Although the monarchy was restored, it ensured (with the Glorious Revolution of 1688) that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system . [ 63 ] During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power (and the interest in voyages of discovery ) led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies , particularly in North America. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] 

 Since the Acts of Union of 1707 [link] 
 Main article: History of the United Kingdom The Treaty of Union led to a single united kingdom encompassing all Great Britain. 
On 1 May 1707 a new kingdom of Great Britain was created by the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in accordance with the Treaty of Union , negotiated the previous year and ratified by the English and Scottish Parliaments passing Acts of Union . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] 

In the 18th century, the country played an important role in developing Western ideas of the parliamentary system and in making significant contributions to literature, the arts, and science. [ 16 ] The British-led Industrial Revolution transformed the country and fuelled the growing British Empire . During this time Britain, like other great powers , was involved in colonial exploitation, including the Atlantic slave trade , although with the passing of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 the UK took a leading role in battling the trade in slaves . [ 69 ] The colonies in North America had been the main focus of British colonial activity. With their loss in the American War of Independence , imperial ambition turned elsewhere, particularly to India . [ 70 ] 

In 1800, while the wars with France still raged, the Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union , uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , which came into being on 1 January 1801. [ 71 ] 
 The Battle of Waterloo marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the start of Pax Britannica . 
After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), the UK emerged as the principal naval and economic power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830) [ 72 ] Unchallenged at sea , Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the Pax Britannica . [ 73 ] [ 74 ] It was also a period of rapid economic, colonial, and industrial growth. Britain was described as the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;, [ 75 ] and the British Empire grew to include India , large parts of Africa , and many other territories. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain&apos;s dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, Argentina and Siam . [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Domestically, there was a shift to free trade and laissez-faire policies and a very significant widening of the voting franchise. The country experienced a huge population increase during the century, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. [ 78 ] By the end of the century, other states began to challenge Britain&apos;s industrial dominance. [ 79 ] 
 Infantry of the Royal Irish Rifles during the Battle of the Somme . More than 885,000 British soldiers died on the battlefields of World War I. 
The UK, along with Russia, France and (after 1917) the USA, was one of the major powers opposing the German Empire and its allies in World War I (1914–18). [ 80 ] The UK armed forces grew to over five million people [ 81 ] engaged across much of its empire and several regions of Europe, and increasingly took a major role on the Western front . The nation suffered some two and a half million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. [ 81 ] After the war the United Kingdom received the League of Nations mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies, and the British Empire had expanded to its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world&apos;s land surface and a quarter of its population. [ 82 ] The rise of Irish Nationalism and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921, [ 83 ] and the Irish Free State became independent with Dominion status in 1922, while Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. [ 84 ] The Great Depression (1929–32) occurred when the UK had not recovered from the effects of the war, and led to hardship as well as political and social unrest. [ 85 ] 

The United Kingdom was one of the Allies of World War II and an original signatory to the Declaration of the United Nations . Following the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war, the United Kingdom continued the fight against Germany, notably in the Battle of Britain and the Battle of the Atlantic . After the victory, the UK was one of the Big Three powers that met to plan the postwar world. The war left the country financially damaged. Marshall Aid and loans from both the United States and Canada helped the UK on the road to recovery. [ 86 ] 
 Territories that were at one time part of the British Empire . Current British Overseas Territories are underlined in red. 
The Labour government in the immediate post-war years initiated a radical programme of changes, with a significant impact on British society in the following decades. [ 87 ] Domestically, major industries and public utilities were nationalised , a Welfare State was established, and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service , was created. [ 88 ] In response to the rise of local nationalism, the Labour government&apos;s own ideological sympathies and Britain&apos;s now diminished economic position, a policy of decolonisation was initiated, starting with the granting of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947. [ 89 ] Over the next three decades, most territories of the Empire gained independence and became sovereign members of the Commonwealth of Nations . [ citation needed ] 

Although the new postwar limits of Britain&apos;s political role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956, the UK nevertheless became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test in 1952). The international spread of the English language also ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture , while from the 1960s its popular culture also found influence abroad. As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the British Government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries, thereby transforming Britain into a multi-ethnic society in the following decades. [ 90 ] In 1973, the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC), and when the EEC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, it was one of the 12 founding members. From the late 1960s Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK and also the Republic of Ireland) conventionally known as the Troubles . It is usually considered to have ended with the Belfast &quot;Good Friday&quot; Agreement of 1998. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] 

Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative Government of the 1980s initiated a radical policy of deregulation, particularly of the financial sector, flexible labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies ( privatisation ), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others. [ 94 ] Aided, from 1984, by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues, the UK experienced a period of significant economic growth. [ 95 ] Around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-legislative referendums , [ 96 ] and the statutory incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights . Domestic controversy surrounded some of Britain&apos;s overseas military deployments in the 2000s (decade), particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan . [ 97 ] 

 Geography [link] 
 Main article: Geography of the United Kingdom The topography of the UK 
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the British Isles [ 98 ] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the south-east coast coming within 35 kilometres (22 mi) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel . [ 99 ] As of 1993 [update] 10% of the UK was forested, 46% used for pastures and 25% used for agriculture. [ 100 ] The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London is the defining point of the Prime Meridian . [ citation needed ] 

The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49° to 61° N , and longitudes 9° W to 2° E . Northern Ireland shares a 360-kilometre (224 mi) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland. [ 99 ] The coastline of Great Britain is 17,820 kilometres (11,073 mi) long. [ 101 ] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel , which at 50 kilometres (31 mi) (38 kilometres (24 mi) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world. [ 102 ] 

 England accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering 130,395 square kilometres (50,350 sq mi). [ 103 ] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, [ 100 ] with mountainous terrain north-west of the Tees-Exe line ; including the Cumbrian Mountains of the Lake District, the Pennines and limestone hills of the Peak District , Exmoor and Dartmoor . The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames , Severn and the Humber . England&apos;s highest mountain is Scafell Pike (978 metres (3,209 ft)) in the Lake District . Its principal rivers are the Severn, Thames, Humber, Tees, Tyne, Tweed, Avon, Exe and Mersey. [ 100 ] 
 Ben Nevis , in Scotland, is the highest point in the British Isles 
 Scotland accounts for just under a third of the total area of the UK, covering 78,772 square kilometres (30,410 sq mi) [ 104 ] and including nearly eight hundred islands , [ 105 ] predominantly west and north of the mainland; notably the Hebrides , Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands . The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault —a geological rock fracture —which traverses Scotland from Arran in the west to Stonehaven in the east. [ 106 ] The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the Highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland&apos;s mountainous land, including Ben Nevis which at 1,343 metres (4,406 ft) is the highest point in the British Isles . [ 107 ] Lowland areas, especially the narrow waist of land between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth known as the Central Belt , are flatter and home to most of the population including Glasgow , Scotland&apos;s largest city, and Edinburgh , its capital and political centre. [ citation needed ] 

 Wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering 20,779 square kilometres (8,020 sq mi). [ 108 ] Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales . The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, and the South Wales Valleys to their north. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon ( Welsh : Yr Wyddfa ) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales. [ 100 ] The 14, or possibly 15, Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914 m) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s . Wales has over 1,200 km (750 miles) of coastline. There are several islands off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey ( Ynys Môn ) in the northwest.

 Northern Ireland accounts for just 14,160 square kilometres (5,470 sq mi) and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at 388 square kilometres (150 sq mi), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area. [ 109 ] The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft). [ 100 ] 

 Climate [link] 
 Main article: Climate of the United Kingdom 
The United Kingdom has a temperate climate , with plentiful rainfall all year round. [ 99 ] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below −11  °C (12  °F ) or rising above 35 °C (95 °F) . [ 110 ] The prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, [ 99 ] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind—as the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. [ citation needed ] Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream , bring mild winters; especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south-east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills. [ 111 ] 

 Administrative divisions [link] 
 Main article: Administrative geography of the United Kingdom Administrative units of the United Kingdom 
Each country of the United Kingdom has its own system of administrative and geographic demarcation, which often has origins that pre-date the formation of the United Kingdom itself. Consequently there is &quot;no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom&quot;. [ 112 ] Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function. [ 113 ] Change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either. [ citation needed ] 

The organisation of local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements. Legislation concerning local government in England is decided by the UK parliament and the Government of the United Kingdom , as England does not have a devolved parliament. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine Government office regions or European Union government office regions. [ 114 ] One region, Greater London , has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum . [ 115 ] It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies but the rejection of a proposed assembly in the North East region, by a referendum in 2004 , stopped this idea in its tracks. [ 116 ] Below the region level England has either county councils and district councils or unitary authorities and London which consists of 32 London boroughs . Councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member wards. [ 117 ] 

 Local government in Scotland is divided on a basis of 32 council areas , with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of Glasgow , Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas as is the Highland Council which includes a third of Scotland&apos;s area but just over 200,000 people. The power invested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors, of which there are currently 1,222 [ 118 ] and are each paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a Provost , or Convenor , to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area. Councillors are subject to a code of conduct enforced by the Standards Commission for Scotland . [ 119 ] The representative association of Scotland&apos;s local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). [ 120 ] 

 Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities. These include the cities of Cardiff , Swansea and Newport which are unitary authorities in their own right. [ 121 ] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system. [ 122 ] The most recent elections were held in May 2008. The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local authorities in Wales. [ 123 ] 

 Local government in Northern Ireland has, since 1973, been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote . Their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste, controlling dogs, and maintaining parks and cemeteries. [ 124 ] On 13 March 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system. [ 125 ] The next local elections were postponed until 2011 to facilitate this. [ 126 ] 

 Dependencies [link] 
 Main articles: British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies British Overseas Territories are indicated in red, Crown Dependencies in blue, and the United Kingdom in green. 
The United Kingdom has sovereignty over seventeen territories which do not form part of the United Kingdom itself: fourteen British Overseas Territories [ 127 ] and three Crown Dependencies. [ citation needed ] 

The fourteen British Overseas Territories are: Anguilla ; Bermuda ; the British Antarctic Territory ; the British Indian Ocean Territory ; the British Virgin Islands ; the Cayman Islands ; the Falkland Islands ; Gibraltar ; Montserrat ; Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha ; the Turks and Caicos Islands ; the Pitcairn Islands ; South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ; and the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus . [ 128 ] British claims in Antarctica are not universally recognised. [ 129 ] Collectively Britain&apos;s overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 667,018 square miles (1,727,570 km 2 ) and a population of approximately 260,000 people. [ 130 ] They are the remnants of the British Empire and several have specifically voted to remain British territories ( Bermuda in 1995 and Gibraltar in 2002 ). [ citation needed ] 

The Crown Dependencies are British possessions of the Crown , as opposed to overseas territories of the UK. [ 131 ] They comprise the Channel Island Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea . Being independently administered jurisdictions they do not form part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union , although the UK government manages their foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown ( Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor). [ 132 ] Since 2005 each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government . [ citation needed ] 

 Politics [link] 
 Main articles: Politics of the United Kingdom , Monarchy of the United Kingdom , and Elections in the United Kingdom Elizabeth II , Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms 
The United Kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy . Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK as well as of fifteen other independent Commonwealth countries . The monarch has &quot;the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn&quot;. [ 133 ] The United Kingdom has an uncodified constitution , [ 134 ] as do only three other countries in the world. [ nb 7 ] The Constitution of the United Kingdom thus consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including statutes , judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions . As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and &quot;constitutional law&quot; the UK Parliament can perform &quot;constitutional reform&quot; simply by passing Acts of Parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. [ 135 ] 

 Government [link] 

The UK has a parliamentary government based on the Westminster system that has been emulated around the world—a legacy of the British Empire . The parliament of the United Kingdom that meets in the Palace of Westminster has two houses; an elected House of Commons and an appointed House of Lords . [ citation needed ] Any bill passed requires Royal Assent to become law.

The position of prime minister , the UK&apos;s head of government , [ 136 ] belongs to the member of parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons, usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The prime minister and cabinet are formally appointed by the monarch to form Her Majesty&apos;s Government , though the prime minister chooses the cabinet and, by convention, the Queen respects the prime minister&apos;s choices. [ 137 ] 
 The Palace of Westminster , seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom 
The cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister&apos;s party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which they are responsible . Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom , and become Ministers of the Crown . The Rt. Hon. David Cameron , leader of the Conservative Party , has been Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service since 11 May 2010. [ 138 ] For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is currently divided into 650 constituencies [ 139 ] with each electing a single member of parliament by simple plurality . General elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises. The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 require that a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election. [ 140 ] 

The UK&apos;s three major political parties are the Conservative Party , the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats . During the 2010 general election these three parties won 622 out of 650 seats available in the House of Commons; 621 seats at the 2010 general election [ 141 ] and 1 more at the delayed by-election in Thirsk and Malton. [ 142 ] Most of the remaining seats were won by minor parties that only contest elections in one part of the UK: the Scottish National Party (Scotland only); Plaid Cymru (Wales only); and the Democratic Unionist Party , Social Democratic and Labour Party , Ulster Unionist Party , and Sinn Féin (Northern Ireland only, though Sinn Féin also contests elections in the Republic of Ireland). In accordance with party policy no elected Sinn Féin member of parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak on behalf of their constituents – this is because members of parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch. The current five Sinn Féin MPs have however, since 2002, made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster. [ 143 ] For elections to the European Parliament the UK currently has 72 MEPs , elected in 12 multi-member constituencies. [ 144 ] 

 Devolved administrations [link] 
 Main articles: Devolution in the United Kingdom , Northern Ireland Executive , Scottish Government , and Welsh Government The Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood is the seat of the Scottish Parliament 
 Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own government or executive , led by a First Minister (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, a diarchal First Minister and deputy First Minister ), and a devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively, [ 145 ] on matters affecting England that are handled by devolved legislatures for their own constituencies. [ 146 ] 

The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically &apos;reserved&apos; to the UK parliament, including education , healthcare , Scots law and local government . [ 147 ] Following its victory at the 2007 elections the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) formed a minority government with its leader, Alex Salmond , becoming First Minister of Scotland . [ 148 ] The pro-union parties responded to the electoral success of the SNP by creating a Commission on Scottish Devolution [ 149 ] which reported in 2009 and recommended that additional powers should be devolved, including control of half the income tax raised in Scotland. [ 150 ] At the 2011 elections the SNP won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament. [ 151 ] 

The Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland. [ 152 ] Following the passing of the Government of Wales Act 2006 the assembly was able to legislate in devolved areas through Assembly Measures once permission to legislate on that specific matter had been granted by Westminster through a Legislative Competence Order ; [ 153 ] but since May 2011 the Assembly has been able to legislate on devolved matters through Acts of the Assembly , which require no prior consent. The current Welsh Government was formed after the 2011 elections , and is a minority Labour administration lead by Carwyn Jones , who had been First Minister of a Labour / Plaid Cymru administration since December 2009. [ 154 ] 

The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have powers closer to those already devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly. Currently, Peter Robinson ( Democratic Unionist Party ) and Martin McGuinness ( Sinn Féin ) are First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively. [ 155 ] Devolution in Northern Ireland is subject to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent British-Irish Agreement between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Under those agreements, the participation of members of the Northern Ireland Executive in the North/South Ministerial Council , and co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on a number of devolved policy areas, are prerequisites of devolution in Northern Ireland. The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was also established under the agreements, whereby &quot;the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals&quot; on non-devolved matters with respect to Northern Ireland. However, the United Kingdom government remains sovereign over Northern Ireland unless a majority of the people of Northern Ireland vote to form a united Ireland . [ citation needed ] 

The United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty , the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. [ 156 ] [ 157 ] Indeed, in 1972, the UK Parliament unilaterally prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland , setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions. [ 158 ] In practice, the circumstances in which the UK Parliament would abolish devolution given the political constraints created by referendum decisions are unclear. [ 159 ] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament&apos;s power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland . [ 160 ] 

 Law and criminal justice [link] 
 Main article: Law of the United Kingdom The Royal Courts of Justice of England and Wales 
The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system, as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland&apos;s separate legal system. [ 161 ] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law : English law , Northern Ireland law and Scots law . A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords . [ 162 ] [ 163 ] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories , and the Crown Dependencies . [ citation needed ] 

Both English law , which applies in England and Wales , and Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles. [ 164 ] The essence of common law is that, subject to statute, the law is developed by judges in courts , applying statute, precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and binding in future similar cases ( stare decisis ). [ 165 ] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales , consisting of the Court of Appeal , the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions. [ 166 ] 
 The High Court of Justiciary  – the supreme criminal court of Scotland . 
 Scots law applies in Scotland , a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session , for civil cases, [ 167 ] and the High Court of Justiciary , for criminal cases. [ 168 ] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law. [ 169 ] Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary Court. [ 170 ] The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial: &quot; guilty &quot;, &quot; not guilty &quot; and &quot; not proven &quot;. Both &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not proven&quot; result in an acquittal with no possibility of retrial. [ 171 ] 

Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/08, [ 172 ] according to crime statistics . The prison population of England and Wales has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. [ 173 ] Her Majesty&apos;s Prison Service , which reports to the Ministry of Justice , manages most of the prisons within England and Wales. Crime in Scotland fell to its lowest recorded level for 32 years in 2009/10, falling by ten percent. [ 174 ] At the same time Scotland&apos;s prison population, at over 8,000, [ 175 ] is at record levels and well above design capacity. [ 176 ] The Scottish Prison Service , which reports to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice , manages Scotland&apos;s prisons. In 2006 a report by the Surveillance Studies Network found that the UK had the highest level of mass surveillance among industrialised western nations. [ 177 ] 

 Foreign relations [link] 
 Main article: Foreign relations of the United Kingdom The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron , and the President of the United States, Barack Obama , during the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit . 
The United Kingdom is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , a member of the Commonwealth of Nations , G7 , G8 , G20 , NATO , the OECD , the WTO , the Council of Europe , the OSCE , and is a member state of the European Union . The UK has a &quot; Special Relationship &quot; with the United States [ 178 ] [ 179 ] and a close partnership with France – the &quot; Entente cordiale &quot; – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries. The UK is also closely allied with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and many Irish citizens serve in the British Army. [ 180 ] Other close allies include other European Union and NATO members, Commonwealth nations, and Japan. Britain&apos;s global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and armed forces. [ 181 ] 

 Military [link] 
 Main article: British Armed Forces File:British Tri-Service equipment.jpg The Type 45 destroyer , the Challenger 2 and the Eurofighter 
The British Army , Royal Air Force and Royal Navy are collectively known as the British Armed Forces and officially as Her Majesty&apos;s Armed Forces. The three forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council , chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence .

The British Armed Forces are among the largest and most technologically sophisticated armed forces in the world, and as of as of 2008 [update] maintained over 20 military deployments around the globe. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ] The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK&apos;s global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO , including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps , as well as the Five Power Defence Arrangements , RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island , Belize , Brunei , Canada , Cyprus , Diego Garcia , the Falkland Islands , Germany , Gibraltar , Kenya and Qatar . [ 185 ] 

According to various sources, including the Ministry of Defence , the UK has the third- or fourth-highest military expenditure in the world. Total defence spending currently accounts for around 2.3% – 2.5% of total national GDP. [ 186 ] 

The Royal Navy is a prominent blue-water navy , currently one of only three world wide, with the French Navy and the United States Navy being the other two. [ 187 ] The Royal Navy is also responsible for delivering the UKs Nuclear Deterrent via the UK Trident programme and four Vanguard class submarines .

The United Kingdom Special Forces , such as the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service , provide troops trained for quick, mobile, military responses in counter-terrorism , land, maritime and amphibious operations , often where secrecy or covert tactics are required.

Recent defence policy has a stated assumption that &quot;the most demanding operations&quot; will be undertaken as part of a coalition. [ 188 ] Setting aside the intervention in Sierra Leone , UK military operations in Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan , Iraq and, most recently, Libya , have followed this approach. The last war in which the British military fought alone was the Falklands War of 1982, in which they were victorious.

 Economy [link] 
 Main article: Economy of the United Kingdom The Bank of England  – the central bank of the United Kingdom 
The UK has a partially regulated market economy . [ 189 ] Based on market exchange rates the UK is today the sixth-largest economy in the world and the third-largest in Europe after Germany and France, having fallen behind France for the first time in over a decade in 2008. [ 190 ] HM Treasury , led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , is responsible for developing and executing the British government&apos;s public finance policy and economic policy . The Bank of England is the UK&apos;s central bank and is responsible for issuing the nation&apos;s currency, the pound sterling . Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. Pound sterling is the world&apos;s third-largest reserve currency (after the U.S. Dollar and the Euro). [ 191 ] Since 1997 the Bank of England&apos;s Monetary Policy Committee , headed by the Governor of the Bank of England , has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year. [ 192 ] 

In the final quarter of 2008 the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991. [ 193 ] Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January 2012 the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to 22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Total UK government debt rose from 44.5% of GDP in December 2007 to 76.1% of GDP in December 2010. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] 
 The Airbus A380 has wings and engines manufactured in the UK. 
The UK service sector makes up around 73% of GDP. [ 198 ] London is one of the three &quot;command centres&quot; of the global economy (alongside New York City and Tokyo), [ 199 ] is the world&apos;s largest financial centre alongside New York, [ 200 ] [ 201 ] [ 202 ] and has the largest city GDP in Europe. [ 203 ] Edinburgh is also one of the largest financial centres in Europe. [ 204 ] Tourism is very important to the British economy and, with over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world [ 205 ] and London has the most international visitors of any city in the world. [ 206 ] The creative industries accounted for 7% GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6% per annum between 1997 and 2005. [ 207 ] 

The Industrial Revolution started in the UK [ 208 ] with an initial concentration on the textile industry, followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding , coal mining, and Steelmaking . [ 209 ] [ 210 ] The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7% of national output in 2003. [ 211 ] 

The automotive industry is a significant part of the UK manufacturing sector and employs over 800,000 people, with a turnover of some £52 billion, generating £26.6 billion of exports. [ 212 ] The aerospace industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest national aerospace industry depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £20 billion. [ 213 ] [ 214 ] [ 215 ] The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the UK economy and the country has the third highest share of global pharmaceutical R&amp;D expenditures (after the United States and Japan). [ 216 ] [ 217 ] 

The poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. [ nb 8 ] In 2007–2008 13.5 million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU members. [ 218 ] In the same year 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line after housing costs were taken into account. This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998–1999. [ 219 ] The UK imports 40% of its food supplies. [ 220 ] 

 Science and technology [link] 
 Main article: Science and technology in the United Kingdom Charles Darwin (1809–82), whose theory of evolution by natural selection is the foundation of modern biological sciences 
England and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century [ 221 ] and the United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, [ 208 ] and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. [ 222 ] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton , whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science, [ 223 ] from the 19th century Charles Darwin , whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell , who formulated classical electromagnetic theory , and more recently Stephen Hawking , who has advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology , quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes . [ 224 ] Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry Cavendish , [ 225 ] from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming , [ 226 ] and the structure of DNA , by Francis Crick and others. [ 227 ] Major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK in the 18th century include the steam locomotive , developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian , [ 228 ] from the 19th century the electric motor by Michael Faraday , the incandescent light bulb by Joseph Swan , [ 229 ] and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell , [ 230 ] and in the 20th century the world&apos;s first working television system by John Logie Baird and others, [ 231 ] the jet engine by Frank Whittle , the basis of the modern computer by Alan Turing , and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee . [ 232 ] 

The modern UK plays a leading part in the aerospace industry, with companies including Rolls-Royce playing a leading role in the aero-engine market; BAE Systems acting as Britain&apos;s largest and the Pentagon&apos;s sixth largest defence supplier, and large companies including GKN acting as major suppliers to the Airbus project. [ 233 ] Two British-based companies, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca , ranked in the top five pharmaceutical companies in the world by sales in 2009, [ 234 ] and UK companies have discovered and developed more leading medicines than any other country apart from the US. [ 235 ] The UK remains a leading centre of automotive design and production, particularly of engines, and has around 2,600 component manufacturers. [ 236 ] Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry. [ 237 ] Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7% of the world&apos;s scientific research papers and had an 8% share of scientific citations, the third and second highest in the world (after the United States and China, and the United States, respectively). [ 238 ] Scientific journals produced in the UK include Nature , the British Medical Journal and The Lancet . [ 239 ] 

 Transport [link] 
 Main article: Transport in the United Kingdom Heathrow Terminal 5 building . London Heathrow Airport has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world. [ 240 ] [ 241 ] 
A radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads. [ 99 ] In 2009 there were a total of 34 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain. [ 242 ] The National Rail network of 10,072 route miles (16,116 km) in Great Britain and 189 route miles (303 route km) in Northern Ireland carries over 18,000 passenger and 1,000 freight trains daily. [ 99 ] Plans are now being considered to build new high-speed railway lines by 2025. [ 243 ] 

In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers. [ 244 ] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers). [ 244 ] London Heathrow Airport, located 24 kilometres (15 mi) west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world [ 240 ] [ 241 ] and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways , as well as BMI and Virgin Atlantic . [ 245 ] 

 Energy [link] 
 Main article: Energy in the United Kingdom An oil platform in the North Sea 
In 2006 the UK was the world&apos;s ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th largest producer. [ 246 ] In 2007 the UK had a total energy output of 9.5 quadrillion Btus , of which the composition was oil (38%), natural gas (36%), coal (13%), nuclear (11%) and other renewables (2%). [ 247 ] In 2009 the UK produced 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1.7 million bbl/d. [ 248 ] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005. [ 248 ] As of 2010 [update] the UK has around 3.1 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves , the largest of any EU member state. [ 248 ] 

In 2009 the UK was the 13th largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU. [ 249 ] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004. [ 249 ] In 2009 the UK produced 19.7 million tons of coal and consumed 60.2 million tons. [ 247 ] In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons. [ 247 ] It has been estimated that identified onshore areas have the potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) . [ 250 ] Based on current UK coal consumption, these volumes represent reserves that could last the UK between 200 and 400 years. [ 251 ] The UK is home to a number of large energy companies, including two of the six oil and gas &quot; supermajors &quot; – BP and Royal Dutch Shell  – and BG Group . [ 252 ] [ 253 ] 

 Demographics [link] 
 Main article: Demography of the United Kingdom 
A Census occurs simultaneously in all parts of the UK every ten years. [ 254 ] The Office for National Statistics is responsible for collecting data for England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries. [ 255 ] In the 2001 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 58,789,194, the third largest in the European Union , the fifth largest in the Commonwealth and the twenty-first largest in the world. By mid-2010 this was estimated to have grown to 62,262,000. [ 256 ] 2010 was the third successive year in which natural change contributed more to population growth than net long-term international migration. [ 256 ] Between 2001 and 2010 the population increased by an average annual rate of 0.6 per cent. This compares to 0.3 per cent per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 per cent in the decade 1981 to 1991. [ 256 ] The mid-2007 population estimates revealed that, for the first time, the UK was home to more people of pensionable age than children under the age of 16. [ 257 ] It has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080. [ 258 ] 

England&apos;s population in mid-2010 was estimated to be 52.23 million. [ 256 ] It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 383 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2003, [ 259 ] with a particular concentration in London and the south-east. [ 260 ] The mid-2010 estimates put Scotland&apos;s population at 5.22 million, Wales at 3.01 million and Northern Ireland at 1.80 million, [ 256 ] with much lower population densities than England. Compared to England&apos;s 383 inhabitants per square kilometre (990 /sq mi), the corresponding figures were 142 /km 2 (370 /sq mi) for Wales, 125 /km 2 (320 /sq mi) for Northern Ireland and 65 /km 2 (170 /sq mi) for Scotland in mid-2003. [ 259 ] In percentage terms Northern Ireland has had the fastest growing population of any country of the UK in each of the four years to mid-2008. [ 256 ] 

In 2009 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.94 children per woman. [ 261 ] While a rising birth rate is contributing to current population growth, it remains considerably below the &apos;baby boom&apos; peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, [ 262 ] below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63. [ 261 ] In 2010, Scotland had the lowest TFR at only 1.75, followed by Wales at 1.98, England at 2.00, and Northern Ireland at 2.06. [ 263 ]

Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th century: the Celts , Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans . Recent genetic studies have shown that more than 50 percent of England&apos;s gene pool contains Germanic Y chromosomes, [ 267 ] though other recent genetic analysis indicates that &quot;about 75 per cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age&quot;, and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people . [ 268 ] [ 269 ] [ 270 ] 

The UK has a history of small-scale non-white immigration, with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s, [ 271 ] and the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century. [ 272 ] In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas. [ 273 ] 

Since 1945 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire . Migration from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups but, as of 2008 [update] , the trend is reversing and many of these migrants are returning home, leaving the size of these groups unknown. [ 274 ] As of 2001 [update] , 92.1% of the population identified themselves as White, leaving 7.9% [ 275 ] of the UK population identifying themselves as mixed race or of an ethnic minority .

Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4% of London&apos;s population [ 276 ] and 37.4% of Leicester &apos;s [ 277 ] was estimated to be non-white as of June 2005 [update] , whereas less than 5% of the populations of North East England , Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities according to the 2001 census. [ 278 ] As of 2011 [update] , 26.5% of primary and 22.2% of secondary pupils at state schools in England are members of an ethnic minority. [ 279 ] 

 Languages [link] 
 Main article: Languages of the United Kingdom The English-speaking world . Countries in dark blue have a majority of native speakers; countries where English is an official but not a majority language are shaded in light blue. English is one of the official languages of the European Union . [ 280 ] and the United Nations [ 281 ] 
The UK&apos;s de facto official language is English ( British English ), [ 1 ] [ 2 ] a West Germanic language descended from Old English which features a large number of borrowings from Old Norse , Norman French, Greek and Latin . The English language has spread across the world, initially because of the British Empire and subsequently due to the dominance of the United States, and has become the main international language of business as well as the most widely taught second language . [ 282 ] 

There are four Celtic languages in use in the UK: Welsh , Irish , Scottish Gaelic and Cornish . The first three are recognised as regional or minority languages subject to specific measures of protection and promotion under relevant European law , while Cornish is recognised but not specifically protected. In the 2001 Census over a fifth (21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, [ 283 ] an increase from the 1991 Census (18%). [ 284 ] In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England. [ 285 ] In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4%) stated that they had &quot;some knowledge of Irish&quot; (see Irish language in Northern Ireland ), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2% of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72% of those living in the Outer Hebrides . [ 286 ] The number of schoolchildren being taught through Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish is increasing. [ 287 ] Among emigrant-descended populations some Scottish Gaelic is still spoken in Canada (principally Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island ), [ 288 ] and Welsh in Patagonia , Argentina. [ 289 ] 

 Scots , a language descended from early northern Middle English , has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion. [ 290 ] 

It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England, [ 291 ] and up to age 16 in Scotland. French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland. In Wales, all pupils up to age 16 are taught Welsh as a second language, or taught in Welsh. [ 292 ] 

 Religion [link] 
 Main article: Religion in the United Kingdom Westminster Abbey is used for the coronation of British monarchs 
Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years. [ 293 ] Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, [ 294 ] while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam. [ 295 ] This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith, [ 296 ] secularised , [ 297 ] or post-Christian society. [ 298 ] In the 2001 census 71.6% of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths (by number of adherents) being Islam (2.8%), Hinduism (1.0%), Sikhism (0.6%), Judaism (0.5%), Buddhism (0.3%) and all other religions (0.3%). [ 299 ] 15% of respondents stated that they had no religion , with a further 7% not stating a religious preference. [ 300 ] A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly. [ 301 ] 

The ( Anglican ) Church of England is the established church in England. [ 302 ] It retains a representation in the UK Parliament and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor . [ 303 ] In Scotland the Presbyterian Church of Scotland is recognised as the national church . It is not subject to state control , and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to &quot;maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government&quot; upon his or her accession. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] The (Anglican) Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, as the (Anglican) Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland , there is no established church in Northern Ireland. [ 306 ] Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, Ceri Peach has estimated that 62% of Christians are Anglican, 13.5% Roman Catholic, 6% Presbyterian , 3.4% Methodist with small numbers of other Protestant denominations and the Orthodox church. [ 307 ] 

 Migration [link] 
 Main article: Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922 See also: Foreign-born population of the United Kingdom Estimated foreign-born population by country of birth, April 2007 – March 2008 
The United Kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration. The Great Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants. [ 308 ] Over 120,000 Polish veterans settled in Britain after World War II, unable to return home. [ 309 ] In the 20th century there was significant immigration from the colonies and newly independent former colonies, driven largely by post-World War II labour shortages. Many of these migrants came from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent . [ 310 ] 

In 2010, there were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the UK, corresponding to 11.3% of the total population. Of these, 4.76 million (7.7%) were born outside the EU and 2.24 million (3.6%) were born in another EU Member State. [ 311 ] The proportion of foreign-born people in the UK remains slightly below that of many other European countries, [ 312 ] although immigration is now contributing to a rising population, [ 313 ] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. Analysis of Office for National Statistics data shows that a net total of 2.3 million migrants moved to the UK in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006. [ 314 ] [ 315 ] In 2008 it was predicted that migration would add 7 million to the UK population by 2031, [ 316 ] though these figures are disputed. [ 317 ] The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 percent to 239,000. [ 318 ] In 2011 the net increase was 251,000: immigration was 589,000, while the number of people emigrating (for more than 12 months) was 338,000. [ 319 ] [ 320 ] 

195,046 foreign nationals became British citizens in 2010, [ 321 ] compared to 54,902 in 1999. [ 321 ] [ 322 ] A record 241,192 people were granted permanent settlement rights in 2010, of whom 51 per cent were from Asia and 27 per cent from Africa. [ 323 ] 25.1 per cent of babies born in England and Wales in 2010 were born to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2011. [ 324 ] 
 Estimated number of British citizens living overseas by country, 2006 
At least 5.5 million British-born people are living abroad, [ 325 ] [ 326 ] [ 327 ] the top four destinations being Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada. [ 325 ] [ 328 ] Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930 around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe. [ 329 ] 

Citizens of the European Union , including those of the UK, have the right to live and work in any member state. [ 330 ] The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria which joined the EU in January 2007. [ 331 ] Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK of some 700,000 over that period. [ 332 ] [ 333 ] The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, [ 334 ] with the migration becoming temporary and circular. [ 335 ] In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. [ 336 ] In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country. [ 319 ] 

The UK government has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government&apos;s Fresh Talent Initiative . [ 337 ] In June 2010 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government introduced a temporary limit of 24,000 on immigration from outside the EU, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011. [ 338 ] The cap has caused tension within the coalition: business secretary Vince Cable has argued that it is harming British businesses. [ 339 ] 

 Education [link] 
 Main article: Education in the United Kingdom See also: Education in England , Education in Northern Ireland , Education in Scotland , and Education in Wales King&apos;s College , part of the University of Cambridge which was founded in 1209 
Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system.

 Education in England is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education , though the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local authorities . [ 340 ] Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944, with education becoming compulsory for all 5 to 14 year-olds in 1921. [ 341 ] [ 342 ] Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August). The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. State schools which are allowed to select pupils according to intelligence and academic ability can achieve comparable results to the most selective private schools: out of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 two were state-run grammar schools . Despite a fall in actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools has risen to over 7%. [ 343 ] Over half of students at the leading universities of Cambridge and Oxford had attended state schools. [ 344 ] The universities of England include some of the top universities in the world; the University of Cambridge, University College London , the University of Oxford and Imperial College London are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 QS World University Rankings , with Cambridge ranked first. [ 345 ] Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated pupils in England 7th in the world for maths and 6th for science. The results put England&apos;s pupils ahead of other European countries, including Germany and the Scandinavian countries. [ 346 ] 
 Queen&apos;s University Belfast , built in 1849 [ 347 ] 
 Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning , with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two non-departmental public bodies have key roles in Scottish education: the Scottish Qualifications Authority is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, post-secondary colleges of further education and other centres; [ 348 ] and Learning and Teaching Scotland provides advice, resources and staff development to the education community to promote curriculum development and create a culture of innovation, ambition and excellence. [ 349 ] Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496. [ 350 ] The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4%, although it has been rising slowly in recent years. [ 351 ] Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008. [ 352 ] 

 Education in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Minister of Education and the Minister for Employment and Learning , although responsibility at a local level is administered by five education and library boards covering different geographical areas. The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations&amp;Assessment (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the government on what should be taught in Northern Ireland&apos;s schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications. [ 353 ] The Welsh Government has responsibility for education in Wales . A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the Welsh language ; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16. [ 354 ] There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh-medium schools as part of the policy of creating a fully bilingual Wales.

 Healthcare [link] 
 Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom The Royal Aberdeen Children&apos;s Hospital , an NHS Scotland specialist children&apos;s hospital 
Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded health care , together with alternative , holistic and complementary treatments. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization , in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world. [ 355 ] [ 356 ] 

Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council , the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges . However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives ; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive ; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government ; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government . Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts. [ 357 ] [ 358 ] 

Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average. [ 359 ] The UK spends around 8.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and about one percentage point below the average of the European Union. [ 360 ] 

 Culture [link] 
 Main article: Culture of the United Kingdom 
The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation&apos;s island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the British Empire , British influence can be observed in the language , culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies; including Australia, Canada, India , Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a &quot;cultural superpower.&quot; [ 361 ] [ 362 ] 

 Literature [link] 
 Main article: British literature The Chandos portrait , believed to depict William Shakespeare 
&apos;British literature&apos; refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in the English language. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the largest publisher of books in the world. [ 363 ] 

The English playwright and poet William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time, [ 364 ] [ 365 ] [ 366 ] and his contemporaries Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson have also been held in continuous high esteem. More recently the playwrights Alan Ayckbourn , Harold Pinter , Michael Frayn , Tom Stoppard and David Edgar have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

Notable pre-modern and early-modern English writers include Geoffrey Chaucer (14th century), Thomas Malory (15th century), Sir Thomas More (16th century), and John Milton (17th century). In the 18th century Daniel Defoe (author of Robinson Crusoe ) and Samuel Richardson were pioneers of the modern novel . In the 19th century there followed further innovation by Jane Austen , the gothic novelist Mary Shelley , children&apos;s writer Lewis Carroll , the Brontë sisters , the social campaigner Charles Dickens , the naturalist Thomas Hardy , the realist George Eliot , the visionary poet William Blake and romantic poet William Wordsworth . 20th century English writers include: science-fiction novelist H. G. Wells ; the writers of children&apos;s classics Rudyard Kipling , A. A. Milne (the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh ), Roald Dahl and Enid Blyton ; the controversial D. H. Lawrence ; modernist Virginia Woolf ; the satirist Evelyn Waugh ; the prophetic novelist George Orwell ; the popular novelists W. Somerset Maugham and Graham Greene ; the crime writer Agatha Christie (the best-selling novelist of all time); [ 367 ] Ian Fleming (the creator of James Bond ); the poets T. S. Eliot , Philip Larkin and Ted Hughes ; and the fantasy writers J. R. R. Tolkien , C. S. Lewis and J. K. Rowling .

 Scotland&apos;s contributions include the detective writer Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes ), romantic literature by Sir Walter Scott , children&apos;s writer J.M. Barrie , the epic adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson and the celebrated poet Robert Burns . More recently the modernist and nationalist Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance . A more grim outlook is found in Ian Rankin &apos;s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of Iain Banks . Scotland&apos;s capital, Edinburgh, was UNESCO&apos;s first worldwide City of Literature . [ 368 ] 

Britain&apos;s oldest known poem, Y Gododdin , was composed in Yr Hen Ogledd ( The Old North ), most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur . [ 369 ] From around the seventh century, the connection between Wales and the Old North was lost, and the focus of Welsh-language culture shifted to Wales, where Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth . [ 370 ] Wales&apos;s most celebrated medieval poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym (fl 1320–1370), composed poetry on themes including nature, religion and especially love. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age. [ 371 ] Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character. Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are both Thomases. Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century. The Swansea writer is remembered for his poetry – his &quot; Do not go gentle into that good night ; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&quot; is one of the most quoted couplets of English language verse – and for his &apos;play for voices&apos;, Under Milk Wood . Influential Church in Wales &apos;poet-priest&apos; and Welsh nationalist , R. S. Thomas , was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts . [ 372 ] [ 373 ] 

Authors of other nationalities, particularly from Commonwealth countries, the Republic of Ireland and the United States, have lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include Jonathan Swift , Oscar Wilde , Bram Stoker , George Bernard Shaw , Joseph Conrad , T.S. Eliot , Ezra Pound and more recently British authors born abroad such as Kazuo Ishiguro and Sir Salman Rushdie . [ 374 ] [ 375 ] 

 Music [link] 
 Main article: Music of the United Kingdom See also: British rock The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the history of music , selling over a billion records internationally. [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] 
Various styles of music are popular in the UK from the indigenous folk music of England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland to heavy metal . Notable composers of classical music from the United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it include William Byrd , Henry Purcell , Sir Edward Elgar , Gustav Holst , Sir Arthur Sullivan (most famous for working with librettist Sir W.S. Gilbert ), Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten , pioneer of modern British opera. Sir Peter Maxwell Davies is one of the foremost living composers and current Master of the Queen&apos;s Music . The UK is also home to world-renowned symphonic orchestras and choruses such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus . Notable conductors include Sir Simon Rattle , John Barbirolli and Sir Malcolm Sargent . Some of the notable film score composers include John Barry , Clint Mansell , Mike Oldfield , John Powell , Craig Armstrong , David Arnold , John Murphy , Monty Norman and Harry Gregson-Williams . George Frideric Handel , although born German, was a naturalised British citizen [ 379 ] and some of his best works, such as Messiah , were written in the English language. [ 380 ] Andrew Lloyd Webber has achieved enormous worldwide commercial success and is a prolific composer of musical theatre, works which have dominated London&apos;s West End for a number of years and have travelled to Broadway in New York. [ 381 ] 

 The Beatles have international sales of over one billion units and are the biggest-selling and most influential band in the history of popular music. [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] [ 382 ] Other prominent British contributors to have influenced popular music over the last 50 years include; The Rolling Stones , Led Zeppelin , Pink Floyd , Queen , the Bee Gees , and Elton John , all of whom have world wide record sales of 200 million or more . [ 383 ] [ 384 ] [ 385 ] [ 386 ] [ 387 ] [ 388 ] The Brit Awards are the BPI &apos;s annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include; The Who , David Bowie , Eric Clapton , Rod Stewart and The Police . [ 389 ] More recent UK music acts that have had international success include Coldplay , Radiohead , Oasis , Muse , Spice Girls , Amy Winehouse and Adele . [ 390 ] 

A number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had more UK chart number one hit singles per capita (54) than any other city worldwide. [ 391 ] Glasgow &apos;s contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it was named a UNESCO City of Music , one of only three cities in the world to have this honour. [ 392 ] 

 Visual art [link] 
 Main article: Art of the United Kingdom J.M.W. Turner self-portrait, oil on canvas, c. 1799 
The history of British visual art forms part of western art history . Major British artists include: the Romantics William Blake , John Constable , Samuel Palmer and J.M.W. Turner ; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud ; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L. S. Lowry ; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris ; the figurative painter Francis Bacon ; the Pop artists Peter Blake , Richard Hamilton and David Hockney ; the collaborative duo Gilbert and George ; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin ; and the sculptors Antony Gormley , Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore . During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the &quot; Young British Artists &quot;: Damien Hirst , Chris Ofili , Rachel Whiteread , Tracey Emin , Mark Wallinger , Steve McQueen , Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.

The Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school University of the Arts London , which includes the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and Design ; Goldsmiths, University of London ; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of University College London ); the Glasgow School of Art ; the Royal College of Art ; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of the history of art . Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the National Gallery , National Portrait Gallery , Tate Britain and Tate Modern (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7 million visitors per year). [ 393 ] 

 Cinema [link] 
 Main article: Cinema of the United Kingdom Alfred Hitchcock 
The United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean are among the most critically acclaimed of all-time, [ 394 ] with other important directors including Charlie Chaplin , Michael Powell , Carol Reed and Ridley Scott . [ 395 ] [ 396 ] [ 397 ] [ 398 ] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: Julie Andrews , Richard Burton , Michael Caine , Charlie Chaplin, Sean Connery , Vivien Leigh , David Niven , Laurence Olivier , Peter Sellers and Kate Winslet . [ 399 ] [ 400 ] [ 401 ] [ 402 ] [ 403 ] [ 404 ] [ 405 ] [ 406 ] [ 407 ] [ 408 ] Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including the two highest-grossing film franchises ( Harry Potter and James Bond ). [ 409 ] Ealing Studios has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world. [ 410 ] 

Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of American and European influence. Many British films are co-productions with American producers, often using both British and American actors, and British actors feature regularly in Hollywood films. Many successful Hollywood films have been based on British people, stories or events, including Titanic , The Lord of the Rings , Pirates of the Caribbean , and the &apos;English Cycle&apos; of Disney animated films which include, Alice in Wonderland , Peter Pan and Robin Hood . [ 411 ] 

In 2009 British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom. [ 412 ] UK box-office takings totalled £944 million in 2009, with around 173 million admissions. [ 412 ] The British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking of what it considers to be the 100 greatest British films of all time, the BFI Top 100 British films . [ 413 ] The annual British Academy Film Awards , hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts , are the British equivalent of the Oscars . [ 414 ] 

 Media [link] 
 Main article: Media of the United Kingdom Broadcasting House , London, headquarters of the BBC 
The BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK&apos;s publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence . [ 415 ] [ 416 ] Other major players in the UK media include ITV plc , which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network , [ 417 ] and News Corporation , which owns a number of national newspapers through News International such as the most popular tabloid The Sun and the longest-established daily &quot; broadsheet &quot; The Times , [ 418 ] as well as holding a large stake in satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting . [ 419 ] London dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales respectively. [ 420 ] The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people. [ 421 ] 

In 2009 it was estimated that individuals viewed a mean of 3.75 hours of television per day and 2.81 hours of radio. In that year the main BBC public service broadcasting channels accounted for an estimated 28.4% of all television viewing; the three main independent channels accounted for 29.5% and the increasingly important other satellite and digital channels for the remaining 42.1%. [ 422 ] Sales of newspapers have fallen since the 1970s and in 2009 42% of people reported reading a daily national newspaper. [ 423 ] In 2010 82.5% of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year. [ 424 ] 

 Philosophy [link] 
 Main article: British philosophy 
The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of &apos;British Empiricism&apos;, a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and &apos;Scottish Philosophy&apos;, sometimes referred to as the &apos; Scottish School of Common Sense &apos;. [ 425 ] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke , George Berkeley and David Hume ; while Dugald Stewart , Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish &quot;common sense&quot; school. Two Britons are also notable for a theory of moral philosophy utilitarianism , first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism . [ 426 ] [ 427 ] Other eminent philosophers from the UK and the unions and countries that preceded it include Duns Scotus , John Lilburne , Mary Wollstonecraft , Sir Francis Bacon , Adam Smith , Thomas Hobbes , William of Ockham , Bertrand Russell and A.J. &quot;Freddie&quot; Ayer . Foreign-born philosophers who settled in the UK include Isaiah Berlin , Karl Marx , Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein .

 Sport [link] 
 Main article: Sport in the United Kingdom London&apos;s Wembley Stadium , one of the most expensive stadia ever built [ 428 ] 
Major sports, including association football, rugby league , rugby union , rowing , boxing , badminton, cricket , tennis, darts and golf, originated or were substantially developed in the United Kingdom and the states that preceded it. A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom . [ 429 ] In most international competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing all of Ireland, with notable exceptions including at the Commonwealth Games and association football. (In sporting contexts, these teams can be referred to collectively as the Home Nations .) However there are occasions where a single sports team represents the United Kingdom, including at the Olympics where the UK is represented by the Great Britain team . London was the site of the 1908 and 1948 Olympic Games, and in 2012 will become the first city to play host for a third time.

Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and league system , though a few clubs play outside their country&apos;s respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons. England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland compete as separate countries in international competition and, as a consequence, the UK does not compete as a team in football events at the Olympic Games. [ 430 ] There are proposals to have a UK team take part in the 2012 Summer Olympics but the Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish football associations have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status – a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter. [ 431 ] England has been the most successful of the home nations winning the World Cup on home soil in 1966 , although there has historically been a close-fought rivalry between England and Scotland .
 Cardiff &apos;s Millennium Stadium opened for the 1999 Rugby World Cup 
 Cricket was invented in England. The England cricket team , controlled by the England and Wales Cricket Board , [ 432 ] is the only national team in the UK with Test status . Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from football and rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had fielded its own team in the past. Irish and Scottish players have played for England because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and have only recently started to play in One Day Internationals . [ 433 ] [ 434 ] Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the Cricket World Cup , with England reaching the finals on three occasions. There is a professional league championship in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete. [ 435 ] Rugby league is a popular sport in some areas of the UK. It originates in Huddersfield and is generally played in Northern England . [ 436 ] A single &apos;Great Britain Lions&apos; team had competed in the Rugby League World Cup and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when England , Scotland and Ireland competed as separate nations. [ 437 ] Great Britain is still being retained as the full national team for Ashes tours against Australia, New Zealand and France. The highest form of professional rugby league in the UK and Europe is Super League where there are 11 teams from Northern England, 1 from London, 1 from Wales and 1 from France. Rugby union is organised on a separate basis for England , Scotland , Wales and Ireland , each has a top-ranked international team and were collectively known as the Home Nations . The Six Nations Championship , played between the Home Nations as well as Italy and France, is the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere. [ 438 ] The Triple Crown is awarded to any of the Home Nations who beats the other three in that tournament. [ 439 ] 
 The Wimbledon Championships, a Grand Slam tournament, is held in Wimbledon, London every June or July 
The game of lawn tennis first originated in the city of Birmingham between 1859 and 1865. [ 440 ] The Championships, Wimbledon are international tennis events held in Wimbledon in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar. Snooker is one of the UK&apos;s popular sporting exports, with the world championships held annually in Sheffield . [ 441 ] In Northern Ireland Gaelic football and hurling are popular team sports, both in terms of participation and spectating, and Irish expatriates throughout the UK and the US also play them. [ 442 ] Shinty (or camanachd ) is popular in the Scottish Highlands . [ 443 ] 

 Thoroughbred racing , which originated under Charles II of England as the &quot;sport of kings&quot;, is popular throughout the UK with world-famous races including the Grand National , the Epsom Derby , Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival (including the Cheltenham Gold Cup ). The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in rowing . Golf is the sixth most popular sport, by participation, in the UK. Although The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland is the sport&apos;s home course, [ 444 ] the world&apos;s oldest golf course is actually Musselburgh Links&apos; Old Golf Course. [ 445 ] 

The UK is closely associated with motorsport . Many teams and drivers in Formula One (F1) are based in the UK, and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The UK hosted the very first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at Silverstone , the current location of the British Grand Prix held each year in July. The country also hosts legs of the World Rally Championship and has its own touring car racing championship, the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC). [ 446 ] 

 Symbols [link] 
 Main article: Symbols of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man The Statue of Britannia in Plymouth . Britannia is a national personification of the UK. 
The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack). It was first created in 1606 by the superimposition of the Flag of England on the Flag of Scotland and updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick&apos;s Flag . Wales is not represented in the Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom; the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out. [ 447 ] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is &quot; God Save the King &quot;, with &quot;King&quot; replaced with &quot;Queen&quot; in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.

 Britannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain . [ 448 ] Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair wearing a Corinthian helmet and white robes. She holds Poseidon &apos;s three-pronged trident and a shield , bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding on the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often been associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song &quot; Rule, Britannia! &quot;. Up until 2008, the lion symbol is depicted behind Britannia on the British fifty pence coin and on the back of the British ten pence coin . It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the British Army . The bulldog is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with Winston Churchill &apos;s defiance of Nazi Germany. [ 449 ]

 Notes [link] 
 
 ^ No law was passed making God Save the Queen the official anthem. In the British tradition, such laws are not necessary; proclamation and usage are sufficient to make it the official national anthem. God Save the Queen also serves as the Royal anthem for several other countries. ^ Under the Council of Europe &apos;s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , the Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish , Irish, Scots and its regional variant Ulster Scots are officially recognised as regional or minority languages by the UK Government for the purposes of the Charter. [ 3 ] See also Languages of the United Kingdom . ^ British dependencies drive on the left except for BIOT and Gibraltar . ^ ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 states that this should be GB and .gb was initially used by the Government, but registration has been suppressed in favour of .uk . The .eu domain is shared with other European Union member states. ^ In the United Kingdom and Dependencies, other languages have been officially recognised as legitimate autochthonous (regional) languages under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages . In each of these, the UK&apos;s official name is as follows: 
 Cornish : Rywvaneth Unys Breten Veur ha Kledhbarth Iwerdhon ; Irish : Ríocht Aontaithe na Breataine Móire agus Thuaisceart Éireann ; Scots : Unitit Kinrick o Great Breetain an Northren Irland ;
 Ulster-Scots : Claught Kängrick o Docht Brätain an Norlin Airlann 
or Unitet Kängdom o Great Brittain an Norlin Airlann ; 
 Scottish Gaelic : Rìoghachd Aonaichte na Breatainne Mòire is Èireann a Tuath ; Welsh : Teyrnas Unedig Prydain Fawr a Gogledd Iwerddon 
 ^ Compare to section 1 of both of the 1800 Acts of Union which reads: the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall...be united into one Kingdom, by the Name of &quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; ^ Namely: New Zealand, Israel, and San Marino ^ In 2007–2008, this was calculated to be £115 per week for single adults with no dependent children; £199 per week for couples with no dependent children; £195 per week for single adults with two dependent children under 14; and £279 per week for couples with two dependent children under 14.

Burrows, &quot;Unfinished Business: The Scotland Act 1998&quot; , The Modern Law Review , vol. 62, issue 2, (March 1999), p249: &quot;The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate. The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...&quot; ^ M. Elliot, &quot;United Kingdom: Parliamentary sovereignty under pressure&quot; , International Journal of Constitutional Law , vol. 2, issue 3, (2004), pp 553–554: &quot;Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the U.K. Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed &quot;devolved matters&quot; is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament&apos;s general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...&quot; ^ G. Walker, &quot;Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Devolution, 1945–1979&quot; , Journal of British Studies , vol. 39, no. 1 (January 2010), pp 124&amp;133 ^ A. Gamble, &quot;The Constitutional Revolution in the United Kingdom&quot; , Publius , volume 36, issue 1, p29: &quot;The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.&quot; ^ E. Meehan, &quot;The Belfast Agreement—Its Distinctiveness and Points of Cross-Fertilization in the UK’s Devolution Programme&quot; , Parliamentary Affairs , vol. 52, issue 1, (1 January 1999), p23: &quot;[T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland’s new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminister and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states... Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminister’s ‘powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland’ remains ‘unaffected’, without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement&quot;. ^ &quot;The Treaty (act) of the Union of Parliament 1706&quot; .

 Early life [link] 
 File:Appendix XL Sukerchakia Genealogy - A History of the Sikhs pg478.jpg Maharaja Ranjit Singh&apos;s family genealogy 
Ranjit Singh belonged to a Sikh clan of Northern India. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] He was born in Gujranwala , now in modern-day Pakistan. According to some historians, into a Jatt Sikh family [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] and some that he was born into a Sansi Sikh family [ 5 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] who were Sukerchakia misldars . [ 5 ] As a child he suffered from smallpox which resulted in the loss of one eye. At the time, much of Punjab was ruled by the Sikhs under a Confederate Sarbat Khalsa system, who had divided the territory among factions known as misls .

Ranjit Singh&apos;s father Maha Singh was the Commander of the Sukerchakia misl and controlled a territory in the west Punjab based around his headquarters at Gujranwala . After his father&apos;s death he was raised under the protection of Sada Kaur of the Kanheya Misl . [ 21 ] Ranjit Singh succeeded his father at the age of 18. [ 22 ] After several campaigns, he conquered the other misls and created the Sikh Empire .

 Pashtun King Amir Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772 of Afghanistan Durrani Known as Kings of Kings first crossed the Indus River in 1748, the year after his ascension – his forces sacked and absorbed Lahore during that expedition. The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede Sindh and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the Afghan Pashtun forces of the Durrani Empire.

The Pashtun King Amir Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772 was not Interested as a Policy to remain in his Domain of India as a King but rather wanted to live the Life of a General or Soldier always on the Move and in Battle to Uphold his Kingdom

Then in 1756-57, in what was his fourth invasion of India, Ahmad Shah sacked Delhi Agra , Mathura , and Vrndavana .

However, The Pashtun King Amir Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772 did not displace the Muslim Mughal dynasty as a Policy, which remained in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah Abdali suzerainty over the Punjab, Sindh , and Kashmir .

He installed a puppet emperor, Alamgir II , on the Mughal throne, and arranged marriages for himself and his son Timur Shah 1772 – 1793 into the imperial family that same year.

 Ahmad Shah Abdali married the daughter of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah .Leaving his second son Timur Shah 1772 – 1793 (who was wed to the daughter of Alamgir II ) to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772 finally left India to return to Afghanistan.

About 30 years before Maharaja Ranjit Singh came to power in 1799, Lahore and its environs were ruled by a triumvirate of Sikhs which included Lehna Singh Majithia as the Lahore Governor.

The rule of these three Sikh chieftains started when Afghan , Pashtun Amir Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772, As a Policy decided to give Lahore to a sardar named Lehna Singh Majithia .

 Lehna Singh Majithia teamed up with two other Sikh chieftains to secure the environs around Lahore in 1765 and that is how the triumvirate of Lehna Singh Majithia , Gujjar Singh Banghi and Suba Singh came to occupy power in and around Lahore.

For thirty long years Lehna Singh Majithia , Gujjar Singh Banghi and Suba Singh ruled supreme and kept paying the Afghan Pashtun Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772 and his offspring Timur Shah 1772 – 1793 an annual sum as Taxes.

The Lahore Fort and the Walled Lahore City and its gates went to Lehna Singh Majithia . He was, for formal purposes, the Governor of Lahore , and was so recognized.

To Suba Singh went the area to the south of the Walled Lahore City, and he resided in the garden of Zubaida Begum in Nawankot, where he built a small fort for himself.

The area between Amritsar and Lahore , or more correctly between the Shalamar Gardens and Lahore , went to Gujjar Singh Banghi .

 Gujjar Singh Banghi erected that part of the city, then a jungle and invited people to settle there. He also dug wells to supply water. A mosque was also built for the Muslims in the area. He also built himself a small fort called Qila Gujar Singh . Today, a few walls of that old fort can be seen in a street between today’s Nicholson Road and Empress Road, and the area is still called Qila Gujar Singh .

On a final note, their rule of ended when Ranjit Singh besieged the Lahore Fort in 1799 and the three chieftains Lehna Singh Majithia , Gujjar Singh Banghi and Suba Singh fled, leaving the city firmly in the hands of the young man from Gujranwala Ranjit Singh .

 Lehna Singh Majithia , was later made Mahraja Ranjit Singhs most able ministers and advisers and a General in His Army

 The Maharaja [link] 
 Ranjit Singh&apos;s Empire Sher e Punjab Ranjit Singh 
Ranjit Singh was crowned on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Baisakhi ). Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak Dev , conducted the coronation. [ 23 ] Gujranwala served as his capital from 1799. In 1802 he shifted his capital to Lahore . Ranjit Singh rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single Sikh misl to finally becoming the Maharaja (Emperor) of Punjab.

He then spent the following years fighting the Afghan invaders, driving them out of the Punjab. He also captured Pashtun territory including Peshawar (now referred to as North West Frontier Province and the Tribal Areas ). This was the first time that Peshawari Pashtuns were ruled by Punjabis . He captured the province of Multan which encompassed the southern parts of Punjab, Peshawar (1818), Jammu and Kashmir (1819). Thus Ranjit Singh put an end to more than a thousand years of Muslim rule. He also conquered the hill states of punjab including north of Anandpur Sahib, the largest of which was Kangra .

When the Foreign Minister of the Ranjit Singh&apos;s court, Fakir Azizuddin , met the British Governor-General of India, Lord Auckland , in Simla , Lord Auckland asked Fakir Azizuddin which of the Maharaja&apos;s eyes was missing, Azizuddin replied: &quot;The Maharaja is like the sun and sun has only one eye. The splendor and luminosity of his single eye is so much that I have never dared to look at his other eye.&quot; The Governor General was so pleased with this reply that he gave his gold watch to Azizuddin.

Ranjit Singh&apos;s Empire was secular , none of the subjects were discriminated against on account of their religions. [ 24 ] The Maharaja never forced Sikhism on his subjects and respected all religions.

 Secular Sikh rule [link] 

The empire of the Sikhs was most exceptional in that it allowed men from religions other than their own to rise to commanding positions of authority. Besides the Singh (Sikh), the Khan (Muslim) and the Misr (Hindu Brahmin) feature as prominent administrators. The Christians formed a part of the militia of the Sikhs. In 1831, Ranjit Singh deputed his mission to Simla to confer with the British governor general, Lord William Bentinck. Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa , Fakir Aziz-ud-din and Diwan Moti Ram ― a Sikh, a Muslim and a Hindu representative ― were nominated at its head.

Externally, everyone in the Sikh empire looked alike; they sported a beard and covered their head, predominantly with a turban. This left visitors to the Punjab quite confused. Most foreigners arrived there after a passage through Hindustan , where religious and caste distinctions were very carefully observed. It was difficult for them to believe that though everyone in the Sarkar Khalsaji looked similar, they were not all Sikhs. The Sikhs were generally not known to force either those in their employ or the inhabitants of the country they ruled to convert to Sikhism. In fact, men of piety from all religions were equally respected by the Sikhs and their ruler. Hindu sadhus , yogis , saints and bairagis ; Muslim faqirs and pirs ; and Christian priests were all the recipients of Sikh largess. There was only one exception – the Sikhs viewed the Muslim clergy with suspicion. Mullahs were not looked upon kindly, as they were known to rightly defend their religion. [ 25 ] 


In their conquests, the Sikhs never perpetrated atrocities as by invaders into the sub-continent. It was true that the Sikhs held a grudge against the Afghans for the atrocities they had perpetrated, over decades, against them. Before them, the Mughals had hunted down the Sikhs like animals in the field. Every Sikh carried a price on his head. The Afghans had caused havoc and mayhem in the Punjab during the lifetime of both Ranjit Singh&apos;s father and grandfather. Despite that, during the rule of the Sikhs there were no reports of torture of the kind routinely inflicted upon the Sikhs by some of the Muslim rulers of Hindustan and subsequently by the Afghan invaders. The Sikhs were reportedly a most tolerant nation.
 
At present, flushed by a series of victories, they (the Sikhs) have a zeal and buoyancy of spirit amounting to enthusiasm; and with the power of taking the most exemplary revenge, they have been still more lenient than the Mohammedan were ever towards them&quot;. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 

— Masson 
 
The horses were attacked with an epidemic disease from which a Mohammedan, who resides in a neighboring sanctuary, is believed to have cured them. Though a Mohammedan the Sikhs repaired and beautified his temple, which is now a conspicuous white building that glitters in the sun. I have always observed the Sikhs to be most tolerant in their religion… [ 29 ] 

— Alexander Burnes , British Agent, narrating an incident at Royal Stud-Farm, Putte 
 
The Sikhs were never accused of the routine inhuman behaviour attributed to the Muslims. In fact, they made every attempt not to offend the prejudices of Muslims noted Baron von Hügel , the famous German traveler, [ 30 ] yet the Sikhs were referred to as being harsh. In this regard, Masson&apos;s explanation is perhaps the most pertinent:

&quot;Though compared to the Afghans, the Sikhs were mild and exerted a protecting influence, yet no advantages could compensate to their Mohaomedan subjects, the idea of subjection to infidels, and the prohibition to slay kine, and to repeat the azan , or summons to prayer&quot;. [ 31 ] 

Hinduism emphasizes the sanctity of cows, [ 32 ] which has carried over into Sikhism. The ban on cow slaughter was universally imposed in the Sarkar Khalsaji. [ 33 ] 

The Sikhs never razed places of worship to the ground belonging to the enemy. The Sikhs were utilitarian in their approach. Marble plaques removed from Jahangir &apos;s tomb at Shahdera were used to embellish the Baradari inside the Fort of Lahore, while the mosques were left intact. Forts were destroyed however, these too were often rebuilt ― the best example being the Bala Hissar in Peshawar , which was destroyed by the Sikhs in 1823 [ 34 ] and rebuilt by them in 1834. [ 35 ] 

 Gurdwaras built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh [link] 
 Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) 
At the Harmandir Sahib , much of the present decorative gilding and marblework date back from the early 19th century. The gold and intricate marble work were conducted under the patronage of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Maharaja of the Punjab . The Sher-e-Punjab (Lion of the Punjab) was a generous patron of the shrine and is remembered with much affection by the Sikhs . Maharaja Ranjit Singh deeply loved and admired the teachings of the Tenth Guru of Sikhism Guru Gobind Singh , thus he promoted the teachings of the Dasam Granth (the Tenth Granth) and built two of the most sacred temples in Sikhism. These are Takht Sri Patna Sahib , the birth place of Guru Gobind Singh, and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib , the place where Guru Gobind Singh took his final rest or mahasamadhi, in Nanded , Maharashtra in 1708.

 Ranjit Singh&apos;s generals [link] 
 Jean-François Allard became a General in the army of Ranjit Singh. 
Ranjit Singh encircled himself with an array of strong generals and soldiers. They were men from different clans, castes and regions

These included:

 Mahan Singh Mirpuri Hari Singh Nalwa Desa Singh Majithia Hukma Singh Chimni Dewan Mokham Chand Fateh Singh Ahluwalia Veer Singh Dillon later Jallaha of Gurdaspore Sawan Mal Sirdar Gulab Singh Pahuwindia Sham Singh Attariwala Sardar Sangat Singh Saini Sher Singh Shaikh Elahi Bakhsh [ 36 ] General Ghause Khan (Mian Ghausa) [ 37 ] Sultan Mahmud Khan (Son of Ghause Khan) [ 38 ] Zorawar Singh Chattar Singh Attariwalla Balbhadra Kunwar – Gorkhali General who served for Ranjit Singh after the Anglo-Gorkha war (1814–1816). Mahan Singh Mirpuri Akali Phula Singh Lehna Singh Majithia Misr Diwan Chand 

Among his European Mercenary Generals were:

 Jean-François Allard Jean-Baptiste Ventura – Italian (Modena) Paolo Di Avitabile – Italian (Naples) Claude August Court – French 

Americans of note:

 Josiah Harlan – American general and later governor of Gujrat Alexander Gardner – American (Scots – Irish) 

 Conquests [link] 
 Runjeet Singh and his Suwarree 
Ranjit Singh&apos;s earliest conquests as a young misldar (baron) were effected by defeating his coreligionists, the heads of other Sikh Sardaris (popularly known as the Misls ). By the end of his reign, however, he had conquered vast tracts of territory strategically juxtaposed between the limits of British India to the East and the powerful Afghan Empire to the West. The land that eventually became the Kingdom of the Sikhs had been ruthlessly subjected to the worse kind of atrocities by invading armies coming through the Khyber Pass into the Indian sub-continent, over eight centuries.

In 1799, Ranjit Singh captured Lahore and made it his Capital. After the capture of Lahore, Ranjit Singh rapidly annexed the rest of the Punjab, the land of the five rivers. Having accomplished this, he extended his empire further north and west to include the Kashmir mountains and other Himalayan kingdoms, the Sind Sagar Doab, the Pothohar Plateau and trans-Indus regions right up to the foothills of the Sulaiman and Hindu Kush mountains.

Ranjit Singh took Amritsar from the Bhangi Sardari and followed this with the more difficult conquest of Kasur , the fabled twin city of Lahore, from the Pathans. [ 39 ] With the conquest of Multan the whole Bari Doab came under his sway. [ 40 ] In the year 1819, Ranjit Singh successfully annexed Kashmir . [ 41 ] This was followed by subduing the Kashmir mountains, west of the river Jhelum (today, Hazara in Pakistan and Pakistan Administered Kashmir). [ 42 ] 

The most significant encounters between the Sarkar Khalsaji and the Afghans were fought in 1813, 1823, 1834 and in 1837. In 1813, Ranjit Singh&apos;s general Dewan Mokham Chand led the Sikh forces against the Afghan forces of Shah Mahmud led by Fateh Khan Barakzai .

Following this encounter, the Afghans lost their stronghold at Attock. Subsequently, the Pothohar plateau, the Sindh Sagar Doab and Kashmir came under Sikh rule. In 1823, Ranjit Singh defeated a large army of Yusafzai tribesmen north of the Kabul river , while the presence of his Sikh general, Hari Singh Nalwa prevented the entire Afghan army from crossing this river and going to the aid of the Yusafzais at Nowshera . This defeat led to the gradual loss of Afghan power in the trans-Indus region. In 1834, when the forces of the Sarkar Khalsaji marched into Peshawar, the ruling Barakzais simply fled the place without offering a fight. [ 43 ] In April 1837, the real power of Maharaja Ranjit Singh came to the fore when his commander-in-chief, Hari Singh Nalwa, kept the entire army of Amir Dost Mohammad Khan , the Wali of Kabul, at bay, with a handful of forces till reinforcements arrived from Lahore over a month after they were requisitioned. [ 44 ] 

 Geography of the Sikh Empire [link] 
 The former haveli of Nau Nihal Singh , the grandson of Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab, Lahore 
The Sikh Empire was also known as Punjab, the Sikh Raj, and Sarkar Khalsaji, [ 45 ] was a region straddling the border into modern-day People&apos;s Republic of China and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan then popularly referred to as the Kingdom of Cabul. [ 46 ] The name of the region &quot;Punjab&quot; or &quot;Panjab&quot;, comprises two words &quot;Punj/Panj&quot; and &quot;Ab&quot;, translating to &quot;five&quot; and &quot;water&quot; in Persian . When put together this gives a name meaning &quot;the land of the five rivers&quot;, coined due to the five rivers that run through the Punjab. Those &quot;Five Rivers&quot; are Beas , Ravi , Sutlej , Chenab and Jhelum , all tributaries of the river Indus , home to the Indus Valley Civilization that perished 3000 years ago. Punjab has a long history and rich cultural heritage. The people of the Punjab are called Punjabis and they speak a language called Punjabi . The following modern day political divisions made up the historical Sikh Empire:

 Punjab region till Multan in south [ 47 ] 
 Punjab , India Punjab , Pakistan Ganganagar , India Haryana , India. Including Chandigarh . Himachal Pradesh , India 
 

 Kashmir , conquered in 1818, India/Pakistan/China [ 48 ] [ 49 ] 
 Jammu , India Gilgit , Northern Areas, Pakistan (Occupied from 1842 to 1846) [ 50 ] 
 Khyber Pass , Afghanistan /Pakistan [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 
 Peshawar , Pakistan [ 53 ] (taken in 1818, retaken in 1834) [ 54 ] North-West Frontier Province and FATA , Pakistan (documented from Hazara (taken in 1818–22) [ 55 ] to Bannu ) [ 56 ] 
 Parts of Western Tibet (1841), China [ 57 ] 
 The Harmandir Sahib (also known as the Golden Temple) is the temple of worship of Sikhs. 
 Legacy and aftermath [link] 
 The Samadhi of Emperor Ranjit Singh in Lahore , Pakistan 
Maharaja Ranjit Singh died in 1839, after a reign of nearly forty years, leaving seven sons by different queens. He was cremated. His ceremony was performed by both Sikh and Hindu priests, his wife Maharani Mahtab Devi Sahiba, the Princess of Kangra, daughter of Maharaja Sansar Chand, the Empress of Punjab, committed Sati with Ranjit&apos;s body as Ranjit&apos;s head lay in her lap, some of the other wives also joined her and committed Sati . [ 58 ] The throne went to his eldest son Kharak Singh , who was not entirely fit and prepared for ruling such a vast empire. Some historians [ who? ] believe that the other heirs would have forged an even more durable, independent and powerful empire, had they come to the throne before Kharak Singh. However, the empire began to crumble due to poor governance and political infighting among his heirs. The princes died through internal plots and assassinations, while the nobility struggled to maintain their power. [ 59 ] 

In 1845 after the First Anglo-Sikh War , Ranjit Singh&apos;s Empire was defeated and all major decisions were managed by the British East India Company . The Army of Ranjit Singh was reduced, under the peace treaty with the British, to a nominal force. Those who gave the stiffest resistance to the British were severely punished and their wealth confiscated. Eventually, Ranjit Singh&apos;s youngest son Dalip Singh , was crowned Maharaja of Punjab in 1843 succeeding his brother, Maharaja Sher Singh . In 1849, at the end of the Second Anglo Sikh War , it was annexed by British India from Dalip . Thereafter, the British took Maharaja Dalip Singh to England in 1854, where he was put under the protection of the Crown. Dalip Singh&apos;s mother, Maharani Jind Kaur , escaped and made her way to Nepal where she was given refuge by Sri Teen Maharaja Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal, who then negotiated on her behalf to allow her to be reunited with her son. Maharani Jind Kaur and her son met at Spence&apos;s Hotel, Calcutta, on 16 January 1861, after some thirteen and half years apart. She was granted permission to come to England. A residence was taken up at No. 1 Lancaster Gate (now No. 23).
 Maharaja Ranjit Singh&apos;s throne , c. 1820–1830, Hafiz Muhammad Multani, now at V&amp;A Museum 
Jind Kaur stayed for a short while at Mulgrave Castle , later she was placed in the charge of an English lady at Abingdon House, Kensington . On the morning of 1 August 1863, Maharani Jind Kaur died peacefully. Her body was temporarily housed at London&apos;s Kensal Green Cemetery , and in the spring of 1864, Duleep Singh left for India and arranged for the cremation of her body.
 Portrait of Maharaja Ranjit Singh 
In the spring of 1864, Maharani Jind Kaur was cremated at Nasik in Bombay on the Panchvati side of the river. The authorities would not allow Dalip Singh to cremate his mother in the Punjab. On the left bank the Maharaja erected a small samadh built as a memorial in the memory of his mother. For a number of years the Kapurthala State Authorities maintained the memorial until 1924, when her remains were dug out and brought to Lahore by her granddaughter, Princess Bamba Sutherland , and deposited at the Samadh of Maharajah Ranjit Singh.

Dalip Singh was converted to Christianity in his youth, upon reuniting with his mother during his adult years, he reconverted to Sikhism, he then petitioned the Crown to have his kingdom returned. He never received any justice or the respect he deserved. He died in 1893, in Paris, France.

Maharajah Dalip Singh had three sons. The eldest Prince Victor was born on 10 July 1866, followed by Prince Frederick in 1868, and then Prince Albert Edward Alexander Dalip Singh (died at the age of thirteen), who was born on 20 August 1879.

Prince Victor Albert Jay Dalip Singh was Maharajah Dalip Singh&apos;s eldest son. He was honourable A.D.C. to Lord Halifax, and was promoted to Captain in 1894, but his military career, however, was a shambles, his interest lay in other things and he resigned in 1898. During the First World War, he was ordered to remain in Paris and not to leave, but shortly after the war ended, Prince Victor died on 7 June 1918, without any issue.

 Princess Sophia , the youngest of the Maharajah&apos;s daughters. On 22 August 1948, Princess Sophia died in her sleep. Her solicitor arranged for her cremation at Golders Green on 26 August. It was her request that her ashes be taken to India for burial.

Princess Catherine was born on 27 October 1871, and was named Catherine Hilda Dalip Singh. Princess Catherine died peacefully in her bed on the night of Sunday 8 November 1942 at her home in Penn , aged seventy-one. The cause of death was said to be heart failure. She was cremated.

Princess Ada Irene Helen Beryl Dalip Singh, born on 25 October 1889. On 8 October 1926, she committed suicide, local fishermen dragged her body from the sea, off Monte Carlo . She was apparently much aggrieved with the death of her brother Prince Frederick who had died two months earlier.

Princess Pauline Alexandrina Dalip Singh, born 26 December 1887, her death was unrecorded, she disappeared in war-torn France during the Second World War.

Princess Bamba Sutherland (Princess Bamba Sofia Jindan Dalip Singh) was born on 29 September 1869 in London, a year after her brother Prince Frederick. In England, Princess Bamba began styling herself as the Queen of Punjab. She was truly her father&apos;s daughter and had her father&apos;s rebellious nature and seemed to be the more aggrieved one among her siblings. She was the most affected at the realisation of who she was and her ancestry. She was often visited by her cousin Karl Wilhelm, grandson of Ludwig Muller, at Hilden Hall , by which time she was already dreaming of going back to India to die. In his memoirs Karl Wilhelm referred to Princess Bamba as &apos;the true heiress of Ranjit Singh&apos; meaning that she was most conscious of the actual desperate situation of the whole family. &apos;She considered the Punjab and Kashmir as the lost possession of her family and was absolutely furious when the border between Pakistan and India was drawn right across the Punjab.&apos; In Princess Bamba&apos;s eyes, Pakistan or India did not exist, there was just the Punjab and its capital Lahore. She met distant relatives throughout her travels in India, trying to have one last glimpse of the glory that she was denied. She located the families of Wazir Ishwari Singh Katoch of Kangra and Hari Singh Nalwa, both residing in Nabha at the time. She met members of several Hindu and Sikh royal families in an attempt to prevent the division of her grandfather&apos;s empire.

On 10 March 1957, Princess Bamba, the daughter of Maharaja Dalip Singh, died of heart failure at the age of eighty-nine, the last of the family. Her funeral was conducted in a Christian ceremony in Lahore. The rites were witnessed by a select few Pakistani dignitaries, the Pakistani authorities did not allow any of her distant relatives to attend, Sikh or Hindu, nor were any Sikhs in Pakistan allowed to attend her rites, thus no Sikh was present at Princess Bamba&apos;s funeral, the last of Dalip Singh&apos;s line.
 File:Ranjit Singh, ca 1835-1840.jpg Maharaja Ranjit Singh
ca. 1835–40 
Maharaja Ranjit Singh is remembered for uniting the Punjab as a strong nation and his possession of the Koh-i-noor diamond. Ranjit Singh willed the Koh-i-noor to Jagannath Temple in Puri , Orissa while on his deathbed in 1839. [ 58 ] His most lasting legacy was the golden beautification of the Harmandir Sahib , most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, with marble and gold, from which the popular name of the &quot;Golden Temple&quot; is derived.

He was also known as &quot;Sher-e-Punjab&quot; which means the &quot;Lion of Punjab&quot; and is considered one of the three lions of modern India, the most famous and revered heroes in Indian subcontinent&apos;s history. The other lions are Rana Pratap Singh of Mewar and Chhatrapati Shivaji , the great Maratha ruler. The title of &quot;Sher-e-Punjab&quot; is still widely used as a term of respect for a powerful man.

Captain William Murray&apos;s memoirs on Maharaja Ranjit Singh&apos;s character:
 
Ranjit Singh has been likened to Mehmet Ali and to Napoleon. There are some points in which he resembles both; but estimating his character with reference to his circumstances and positions, he is perhaps a more remarkable man than either. There was no ferocity in his disposition and he never punished a criminal with death even under circumstances of aggravated offence. Humanity indeed, or rather tenderness for life, was a trait in the character of Ranjit Singh. There is no instance of his having wantonly infused his hand in blood.&quot; [ 60 ] [ 61 ] 
 
Many famous folk stories about Maharaja portray a leader and the inspiration Maharaja Ranjit Singh was. In one famous incident, when Maharaja was about to cross the badly flooded river near Attock (now in Pakistan and called Kabul River ). One of Maharaja&apos;s generals reported this fact to Maharaja, saying that the river cannot be crossed and it is now an Atak (an obstacle in Hindi ) for us. Maharaja retorted &quot; eh Attock uhna lai atak hai, jehna de dillan wich atak hai &quot; or &quot;This river Attock is an obstacle for those, who have obstacles in their hearts&quot;, then crossed the river successfully. The army and other generals followed his lead. [ citation needed ] 

Another famous folk story about the Maharaja is that he was accidentally hit by a stone thrown by a 5-year-old boy, who actually wanted to hit a fruit tree to knock down some of its fruit. When he was brought before the Maharaja, Ranjit Singh gave him a gold coin. He said, &quot;How can I punish him for hitting me with a stone, when this tree will give him fruit for the same?&quot; [ citation needed ]

 Early life and education [link] 

Her family moved to California when Snatam was two, living in Long Beach and Sacramento . When Snatam was six, the family went to India where her mother studied kirtan . Snatam lived on a ranch near Bolinas, California until 8th grade and then moved to Mill Valley in 1986. During her childhood, she played kirtan with her mother in Sikh temples and at Sikh religious ceremonies. She attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley . While at Tam High, she played violin in the school orchestra and began songwriting. Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead coached Kaur and her classmates before they performed her song Saving the Earth at an Earth Day concert in San Francisco on April 22, 1990. [ citation needed ] 

Snatam was also active in social and environmental causes while in high school, serving as president of the social action club known as, &quot;Students for Justice,&quot; in her senior year. The club started a campus recycling program and organized environmental awareness programs. The club also led the effort to change the school mascot and sports team names from the Indians to the Red Tailed Hawk in 1989 and 1990 due to a speech given at the school by Sacheen Littlefeather . [ citation needed ] 

After graduating from Tam, Snatam attended Mills College in Oakland, California , receiving a bachelors degree in biochemistry. She then returned to India to study Kirtan under her mother&apos;s teacher, Bhai Hari Singh. In 1997, Kaur began a career as a food technologist with Peace Cereals in Eugene, Oregon . [ 1 ] 

 Snatam&apos;s music [link] 

In 2000, Kaur signed with Spirit Voyage Records—the founder of which, Guru Ganesha Singh, became her manager and guitarist. Her professional collaboration also includes New Age music producer Thomas Barquee. Titles of Kaur&apos;s CD&apos;s include: Prem, Shanti, Grace, Anand, and Liberation&apos;s Door. [ 1 ]

 The Celebrate Peace Tour [link] 

Snatam spends much of the year on the road, singing and teaching yoga wherever she’s invited.

Her Celebrate Peace world tour includes stops at schools, hospices, juvenile detention centers, and other facilities where her music can help to heal and inspire. “We reach out to children through our free Children’s Peace Hour, which serves many children in underprivileged communities.” Snatam is a Peace Ambassador working through a United Nations NGO (non-governmental organization) called the 3HO Foundation (the three H’s stand for “happy, healthy, holy”). Snatam uses her public programs as an opportunity to educate audiences about the importance of mutual understanding and respect in these troubled times.

On tour, Snatam is joined by her longtime musical partner GuruGanesha Singh who exudes joy and warmth with his guitar and vocals. She also travels with her husband Sopurkh Singh who serves as her manager, and their new baby daughter Jap Preet Kaur. [ 1 ] 

 Kundalini yoga [link] 

Snatam offers Yoga training via her “Creating Inner Peace through Kundalini Yoga and Meditation” workshops. These classes provide instruction in the technology of Kundalini as taught by Yogi Bhajan . Chanting is an essential part of the Kundalini Yoga practice. [ 1 ] 

 Sikh influence [link] 

 Sikhism is a world religion that began in India in the mid-fifteenth century with the master Guru Nanak (1469-1539 C.E.). The essence of being a Sikh is that one lives one’s life according to the teachings of the Sikh Gurus, devoting time to meditating on God and the scriptures, chanting, and living life in a way that benefits other people and the world. [ citation needed ] 

Snatam’s own teacher, Yogi Bhajan (1929-2004), was influential in helping promote the Sikh tradition in the West. [ citation needed ] 

Sikhism is based on the Shabad Guru. On Kaur&apos;s official website she explains, “Shabad is the sacred energy or recitation of sound, and Guru means the living teacher. For Sikhs, our living Guru exists within the sacred words of our tradition. As part of our daily practice we take a sacred divine reading from the Siri Guru Granth Sahib , which is a collection of writings from enlightened teachers and sages in India. It includes the Sikh Gurus, but also incorporates saints from other traditions.” [ 1 ] 

 Personal life [link] 

Snatam lives in Santa Cruz, California with her husband Sopurkh Singh Khalsa, whom she married in January 2006, and their daughter Jap Preet Kaur.
