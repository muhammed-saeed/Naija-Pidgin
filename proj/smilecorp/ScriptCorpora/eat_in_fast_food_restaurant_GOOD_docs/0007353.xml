  You can always count on Evos to provide a health array of choices for everyone. From burgers and fries to mix green salads, there will be something for even the most picky person. They even cover their bases with kids by having shakes on their menu! There service is always fast and friendly. The only drawback is that they are a bit on the pricy side. But if you health is important to you then the price is worth it! A diner

  When I heard about a fast-food restaurant that had &quot;low-fat&quot;, &quot;health conscious&quot;, and &quot;organic&quot; food, I was naturally excited (being a resident of Chapel Hill). The restaurant keeps a clean appearance and the environment is good. They stock random free-trade chocolate bars. I walk up to the register and I look at the menu. Everything is in the 7-10 dollar range, not good for a fast-food restaurant. But considering that the restaurant tries to be all healthy and organic, I decided to give them a chance. For about 8 dollars, I got a small, mediocre hamburger, &quot;air-baked&quot; fries and a drink. Honestly I can&apos;t say that airbaked fries taste better than normal fries. It&apos;s about the same. They offer a variety of ketchups, such as Cayenne firewalker. My 8 dollar meal was hardly enough, and I purchased an additional salad for 7 dollars. The salad was incredibly dry and the dressing was already poured onto the salad. After eating this salad, I was still quite hungry, but I did not want to spend more money. The bottom line is that Evos is one of those places with a nice mission but it doesn&apos;t do very well. Don&apos;t spend your money on a sub-standard burger just because it contains fewer calories than a Big Mac. If you are worried about making sensible meal choices or eating more organic food, you shouldn&apos;t be eating fast-food anyways.

  We had a nice time and the food was good. The only annoyance was being asked to pay for a to-go cup, after paying for the $15 plus pizza. We think this is a little too much, I mean, come on.
