 Introducing Night Terrors and Larenda Roberts 

July 7, 2012 in Non Fiction | Leave a comment 
 
 Louisiana-raised author Larenda Roberts uncovers the dark side of romance in the south in Night Terrors 

 
 As hot and dreamy as steam rising from the rich south Louisiana delta country where it takes place, Night Terrors is a story of conflict, sensuality, love, and violence. 

When tragedy leaves Ana Claiborne with more responsibility than she ever asked for, she must choose between two very different men and the chance to save an industry empire.
 

After eloping with the heir to the Claiborne Coffee fortune, Ana arrives from New York full of romantic expectations to begin a new life in Louisiana with her husband and his intimidating—and secretive—family. But Mark Claiborne is not as he seems, and the romance becomes as sinister and claustrophobic as the southern humidity.

With as many twists and turns as the Mississippi River Road, Night Terrors pulls the reader into Ana’s unforgettable saga and the courage she must summon to endure the tragedies and triumphs of her life.

With evocative cover art by Los Angeles-based artist Gayle Wheatley (GayleWheatley.com), Night Terrors is available exclusively for Amazon Kindle download at Amazon.com.

 Profile 

He could not say when it had begun.  At first it had been only a vague feeling, sort of like when something is about to happen, there is a sense of it, a premonition, but there is no idea what it will be.

He was about eight or nine, he guessed, when he first noticed anything.  As far as he could recall, there was no memory of his father or any of his relatives, except his mother.  It was not hard to bring her back even now.  He could see her bending over to tell him goodbye as she left for work, a heavyset woman in a billowy dress that smelled faintly of perspiration.  She had short hair that seemed to spring from her head in dark coils.

When she walked much, her breath would come in brief gasps.  He could smell its staleness and see the rage in her eyes when she shook him for spilling his Coke on the floor.  The memory of her brought a tight catch in his throat and a tingling that started along his spine and spread up across the back of his head.

He worked as a night security guard in a large office building in downtown Houston.  It was an adequate job, one that required little interaction with people.  He lived in a small crumbling apartment, one of many, on the north side of the sprawling hot city.

After getting off work every morning, he would stop at a Food Mart on his way home and buy a newspaper, three glazed doughnuts, a carton of chocolate milk, and food for his cats.  He had five cats—tabbies, Persian, one part Siamese—all strays from the area who adopted him.

He liked to return each morning to the dingy apartment, open the door, and hear the cats jumping off window sills, cabinets, and chairs, running to greet him, meowing incessantly.  He would put down the bag of groceries and pick the cats up, each in turn, stroking them gently.

The cats would run through his legs when he put them down, almost causing him to trip as he walked to the drawer where he kept the can opener.  While he opened the cans of food, they jumped on the countertop and nuzzled him, pushing and shoving each other to get to the food.  After he placed the open cans on the counter, he petted the cats and talked to them while they gulped the fishy brown mush, purring gratefully.

Next, he would have his doughnuts and milk, flipping on the television set and opening the newspaper.  After finishing the paper, he would turn off the set and head for the bedroom.  Here he undressed and rolled into bed and slept, dimly aware of the cats jumping on the bed one by one and settling around him, washing themselves and purring.

The feeling developed into a concept, then an idea, when he was in his teens.  He never gave trouble at school, because it was his escape from the house and his mother.  He hated to come home at the end of each day to the dark unkempt house that smelled of burnt grease and growing mold.  Usually, he stayed after school and read in the library or watched sport games.

One day, he felt ill and left school early.  His mother’s car was parked in back of their house, and as he entered, a strange man was coming out of the door adjusting his tie.  He was tall with wavy brown slicked-back hair and a pock-marked face.  The man looked surprised but only nodded to him.  As the man passed out of the house, he stood aside.  From the back room, he heard his mother’s voice in an unfamiliar whiny sing-song, “Don’t leave just yet, hon-ey…I got to tell you something.”

He walked into her room and met her coming out of the bathroom in her slip, its tight shoulder straps almost covered by her soft white flesh.  There were Styrofoam cups half-filled with liquor on the night table by the unmade bed, and the ashtray was stuffed with cigarette butts.  The whole room had a yeasty smell of whiskey and stale cigarette smoke, and it nauseated him.

His mother stopped, startled.  “You home so soon?” she asked, reaching for her drink.  She then began talking quickly about something irrelevant, he could not remember what, her breath coming in the gasps.  He said nothing.  She sickened him, he was repulsed.

She asked, “Why don’t you say nothing?”

For a few unsure moments, he stood before her looking down at his hands.  He quivered as he picked up a lamp off the dresser and flung it into the window, a shrill crashing of ceramic and glass shattering into thousands of tiny slivers.

His mother began screaming and cowered in the corner, crossing her arms to cover her chest.  He turned and walked out the front door, his mother’s screams following him, conscious of the neighbors already gathering in the next yard.  His nerves vibrated with a thrill he had never known.  He felt good.

It was not difficult to get a job, and so far as he knew, his mother never tried to find him.  Sometimes he ate at a chain café near his apartment and read a paperback or the newspaper, half-listening to the mindless conversations and coarse jokes of the local people around him.  What braggarts, he thought, how shallow they are.

The first girl he had was neatly dressed in a green polo shirt and brown shorts.  Her hair was dark brown, long, and streaked blonde in places.  He played with her hair and petted it, holding the mass of hair in one hand and rubbing it across his face.  The girl smelled of drugstore bath powder, and her skin was moist and fresh and young.  She never stopped looking at him.

It was not long before his feelings grew to an intensity he could no longer control.  When they would start, they would last for days, these surges of omnipotence, of power; a total and complete release he had never known.

The next girl worked at an all-night market, and her name was Holly.  It was on the name tag of a blue apron she wore over jeans and a white cotton shirt.  She smelled of hot dogs from the fast food sold at the market.  Her body was stocky and not well-proportioned, but she was as pliable and sweet-tasting as soft cookie dough in his mouth.

The high was unbelievable.  It would rise unexpectedly to a startling crescendo, over and over, leaving him physically and emotionally drained.  Afterwards, he would sleep for at least twelve hours.  In the end, they caught him sleeping in his bed in the tiny apartment.

When the detectives took him in, marching him briskly through a blinding flash of cameras clicking, he stared straight ahead.  They showed him the paper the next day, with his picture on the front page.  His mother was interviewed, and she said he had never been right, that he had even attacked her once.

From the cot where he lay, he stared vacantly at the blocked light coming through narrow window slats high above him and thought mostly about his cats.

 The Brood of Zelda Beth Gibson 

July 7, 2012 in Short Fiction | Leave a comment 
 
The Brood of Zelda Beth Gibson

Zelda Beth Gibson was a sort of fixture at the large church in the Texas community where I grew up.  Overweight, hampered by a bad leg, and cursed with rheumatoid arthritis, she could be seen limping from her beat-up Buick into the church building three times a week, accompanied by any number of rowdy, often sweaty grandchildren.

People tended to avoid Zelda Beth, probably because compared to their own lives, her life seemed to be an unending soap opera.  You never knew which of her grown children was back in rehab, had left their mate, or had become pregnant out of wedlock.  Zelda Beth’s husband had quit the church long ago, and it was rumored that his alcoholism cost him his job and caused the Gibsons to lose their house.  When asked about her latest troubles, Zelda Beth would always shrug, flash a tarnished smile and say, “God never promised us no carefree life.”

On the darkest, coldest Wednesday night, the 15-year-old rust-colored Buick could always be seen pulling into the church parking lot, and a pile of unruly children, dressed in sloppy, thrown-together clothes, climbed out, charging ahead of the hobbling Zelda Beth.

People often questioned Zelda Beth’s unwavering support of her wayward husband and children and why her grandchildren ran wildly through the church building and could never sit still during worship.  Bible school teachers secretly dreaded to see Zelda Beth’s grandchildren promoted into their well-ordered classrooms.  Some frowned and whispered about the mostly fatherless children, several of whom were of mixed races.

As they grew and became teenagers, Zelda Beth’s grandchildren were accepted into the youth group, whenever they attended activities, but there was always the stigma that they were from hopelessly dysfunctional “families.”  The teens were sometimes on suspension from school, or even in juvenile hall.  One of the girls became pregnant out of wedlock, just as her mother before her had done.

On a number of occasions, members of the Ladies Class and even church elders got involved in the Gibson family problems.  There were counseling sessions with the grown Gibson children, job offers, help with school clothes for the grandchildren, donations of used household goods.  But it seemed that for every problem solved, a host of new problems inevitably sprang up.  Many came to the conclusion that the Gibson family problems were brought on by their own moral weaknesses and poor judgment.

But when church members expressed concern and offers to help, Zelda Beth was always appreciative and thankful.  Often she would say, “Thanks to the good Lord, no one’s ever left my house hungry.  I can make that dollar stretch like a rubber band.”

Zelda Beth never missed a church potluck, hauling in a stew pot of seasoned red beans, a large pan of cornbread, or the grandchildren’s favorite dish, chicken and dumplings.  Many ill and grieving church members were surprised to find Zelda Beth on their doorsteps dropping off her trademark homemade chocolate pie.

One particular December night, a Texas-sized cold front was blowing into town, causing the wind to whip across the plains.  Tumbleweeds were rolling through the church parking lot, and menacing clouds hovered in the night sky.  The few members who had ventured out to class and a short devotional were hurrying away from the building to their cars and warm homes.  As usual, a horde of children jumped around Zelda Beth, clamoring for her attention to their latest Bible school handiwork.

A well-dressed church member walked up to the group, handed a white envelope to Zelda Beth and said, “A lady here told me to give you this, but I can’t tell you who she is.”

Zelda Beth opened the envelope, her thin nylon dress billowing around her.  She began to shout, “Thank you, Jesus!  Oh Lord, thank you, Lord!”  She was crying and praising God, hugging those who had gathered around to see what was going on.  Inside the white envelope was a holiday card to Zelda Beth, accompanied by a one thousand dollar money order.

“Lord, I’ll pay the rent, pay the bills, and even have money left over,” Zelda Beth said.  “Kids, this is gonna be the best Christmas we ever had.”

The unexpected gift could have come from one of any number of well-to-do members in the congregation.  Sure enough, word spread through the church that Zelda Beth’s family had one of the best holidays ever that year.

Zelda Beth’s crippled body finally succumbed to age and wear in August of last year, and she was buried on a hot Texas day, when the sunflowers were in full bloom.  Her husband and most of her children and grandchildren were in attendance.  The Gibson family watched as the remains of this woman, who did her best to hold them together, were lowered into the cemetery plot.

The church minister talked about Zelda Beth’s love for the Lord, her faithful attendance to every service, and her devotion to her family.  Several church members privately expressed that finally Zelda Beth had been granted the rest she deserved.  Her husband, children, and grandchildren would appreciate more than ever the unconditional love Zelda Beth had for each one of them.

As for me, my biological father is back in prison for a parole violation, and Mother lives out of state with her latest boyfriend.  My caramel skin is a testament to my mixed-race heritage.  The Bible school teachers who taught me the Word of God are older now, and we often laugh and share stories about the antics of my raucous childhood.

But Zelda Beth’s indomitable spirit remains immortal, and every time I ride up to the church building with my husband and new baby, I am reminded of the sincere faith which dwelt first in my grandmother Zelda Beth and which now I am certain lives in me also.

 April’s Tip

 April’s Tip 

Ordinarily I steer clear of roadside diners when traveling and opt instead for the familiar but dependable golden arches, red and white chicken buckets, clanging taco bells, or grinning Big Boys.  But not even three hours into my trip, I was hungry, it was drizzling, and I was tired of my little Honda Civic being passed and spattered by endless 18-wheeler trucks.  I was on my way to visit my daughter at the University of Southern California.  So when I saw a roadside diner, I went against my habits and pulled off the highway.

Ducking my head into the rain-splashed glass door, I thought how ironic this was.  I had an underlying fear of one day ending up slinging hash at a diner just like this one—and here I was.  The restaurant buzzed with a hustle and bustle of chatting amidst the clashing of durable dinnerware.  Since the booths and tables were full, I took a stool at the counter and opened the plastic-coated menu.

 Given your marital problems and current lack of employment, it’s only a matter of time before you’re on the other side of this black and white tile counter, I told myself.   “You like Janette Oke?” a voice asked, and I looked up from the menu to a friendly, buoyant face.  She wore a bright apple green shirt that contrasted with auburn hair pulled back into an attractive French twist.  Her eyes sparkled with life, and her name tag read “April.”  She was wiping the counter with one hand and refilling a customer’s coffee with her other hand, but she nodded toward the book I had brought in with me.

“Yes–her novels are supposed to be inspirational,”  I answered, picking up Love’s Abiding Joy, the book I was currently reading.  I didn’t say that I really didn’t care for “inspirational books” and was forcing myself to read this one at the suggestion of a good friend.

“You should read A Quiet Strength, April said.  “I think that may be Oke’s best work.”

“Oh, really?  I said. “Maybe I’ll look for it.” Not likely. 

A tall, high-school age boy walked into the restaurant and went behind the counter.  April patted him.

“Another late night, Matt?” she asked.  He gave her a hangdog look but grinned.

“You can always tell, can’t you?” he said.

“How’d you do on that math test?” April wanted to know.

“Made a C.”

“That’s not bad.  You keep on keeping on.  We’ll get you into college yet.”

I was impressed that April was familiar with the writings of Janette Oke, so she must be a believer.  Then I realized she was talking to me again.

“What can I get for you, hon?”

“Iced tea. Let’s see…a bowl of minestrone and the green salad.  Ranch dressing on the side, please.”

“Good choice,” she said, taking the menu.  I picked up my novel but continued watching April interact with customers, who seemed to be a mixture of locals and passersby.  There was a camaraderie, a warmth, a feeling of welcome in here.

My food came, and the Italian vegetable soup warmed my body.  I thought about my cousin in Dallas who was divorced, living in a Highland Park mansion.  She was alone and miserable. But at least she doesn’t have to work, I told myself.

As for me, I was enduring one dreadful temp job after another, while my husband made up his mind on whether or not he wanted to continue our marriage or not. But at least your temp jobs have been “white collar” so far, I thought.

I loved my husband, in spite of everything, and wanted nothing more than our normal life back.  My self-assurances that this was a mid-life crisis and would soon be over were starting to wear thin.  In spite of all the therapy and Scriptural counseling, he seemed determined to take another road.  It was hard for me to even form these thoughts in my mind.  All my dreams of a happy Christian family–shattered?  What would happen?  What will people think? What will they say? Didn’t he care what this was doing to our children? 

I took my best friend’s advice and replaced this thought with a Scripture:

And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose.

 Did God have another purpose for me and my children?  I couldn’t even think the “D” word…I had long ago left “one day at a time” and was now often living “one hour at a time.”  The bill for lunch brought me back to the here and now.

“You take care, hon,” April said, flashing a winning smile.  “It was nice meeting you.  Don’t forget to look for that book.”

In the same breath, she turned and asked the man on the stool beside me how his wife was doing.  I was amazed.  Here was a middle-aged woman, working hard for a meager living at a roadside diner—doing the very thing I feared.  But she was happy!

I was reminded of the apostle Paul’s declaration:

I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.  I can do everything through him who gives me strength.

 I said a prayer of thanksgiving. 

When I went outside to my car, a sharp ray of sun was piercing the muddled gray skies.  I got into my little Honda, started it up, and circled around the ramp leading to the highway.  Of the massive trucks passing by, I noted that many were filled with fruit and vegetables – corn, broccoli, cherries—bountiful California produce given to us by God.  A trucker with a load of spinach slowed and let me merge onto the interstate.  I thanked him with a wave, and he gave a friendly honk.  As I picked up speed, I saw one of the familiar white and green California highway mileage signs.  I was only 20 miles from the Pacific Ocean!  Glancing at my reflection in the rearview mirror, I smiled and gave God the glory for my unexpected euphoria.  Then I headed south into the sunshine.

 A Crash Course in BurgerSpeak 

July 15, 2011 in Humor | 2 comments 
 
Every time I drive through a fast-food restaurant with my husband, I brace myself for battle.  This is because he does not understand the language spoken at these places.  The other night, I wanted a hot fudge sundae, so we circled to a drive-through order window.  The conversation went something like this.

“Welcome to BurgerLand may I take your order?”squawked a faceless voice.

“Uh…. yes…. hello,”my husband said, scanning the menu.

“Take your order sir?”

“Hot fudge sundae no nuts,”I whispered to my husband.”

“Yes, I believe we would like some yogurt, and my wife would like some ice cream…”he began.

“Chocolate vanilla double twist?”the voice asked.

“Huh?”

“Chocolatevanillatwist?”

My husband was perplexed. I could see his face and neck turning red, and there were tiny beads of perspiration breaking out on his forehead.

“They mean what flavor do you want,”I translated.

“Oh, yes.  Vanilla,”he said.“We want vanilla.”

“That’ll be $2.29 please drive through.”

“My sundae.”

“And my wife would like a sundae, hot fudge, that is,”he added.  For a moment, I thought I saw steam rising from his nostrils.

“No nuts,”I said.

“That’s without nuts!”he shouted into the speaker.

“Hot fudge no nuts that’ll be $3.29 please drive through,”said the robotic voice.

My husband floored the accelerator and screeched up to the first window, where the hapless employee was already taking the next order.  I quickly handed him some money.

 It’s a good think you’re safe inside the restaurant, Mister,” I wanted to say.

“Thank you sir please drive through.”We lurched to the final window, where we were handed two vanilla cones and the sundae.

“This isn’t what we ordered,”I said.

“Just take them and be quiet, please,”he said in a very controlled voice.  We sped away while I attempted to balance the ice cream on my lap.

“Your problem is that you order like you’re at a five-star restaurant.  They don’t understand that,”I said.

“Every employee at BurgerLand is a moron!”he shouted.  I decided this would not be a  good time to tell him that the whole franchise would go out of business within a few weeks if he had to work there.

“No,”I said,“the employees are not morons.  They are just programmed to react to certain words, much like a computer.  They are menu-driven, so to speak.”

“I hate those places.”

“I will train you to communicate with them,”I said.

The next time we were cruising through fast-food heaven, family in tow, I leaned over and placed the order myself.

“One single no mayo, one double-cheese no onion, two medium fries, one biggie fry, one six-piece chicken nugget with sweet‘n sour, two medium diet Pepsis, one medium Dr. Pepper, one small shake vanilla.  That’s all.”

“Eleven ninety-five please drive through.”

“Now, you see how easy that was?”I asked.

“I didn’t understand a word you said,”he said.

“What you have to do is become familiar with the terms used at each place,”I continued.“Single, double, Big Mac, Junior Whopper, that sort of thing.  Once you know the terminology, it’s very simple.  You place your order using a numeral, followed by the item size and the proper nomenclature, such as‘Two medium fries, one biggie fry, one side salad, lite French dressing.’Don’t exchange pleasantries or add unnecessary words.  Say the order to yourself a couple of times before you get to the speaker.  Next time, you can try it.”

The following week, we had occasion to pass through another of these places, so I wrote out our order for him.

“Now,”I said.“Take a deep breath and go for it.”

“Good afternoon welcome to BurgerLand how are you today?”boomed the voice.

“Fine, I’m fine.  Thank you,”my husband said.  Uh-oh, I thought, he’s already broken the rule of never exchanging pleasantries.

“We need a plain hamburger and a cheeseburger.  No mayonnaise or onion,”he said, squinting at the list.“Then we need, uh, a salad, yes.  What—oh, French dressing with that salad.  And…“

“Side, garden, chef, Asian?”the voice asked.

“Huh?”

“A garden salad,”I prompted him.

“That was a garden salad,” he said.”And then we need a chicken nugget…“

“Six or nine?”

“Six.  Six.  Then a bacon-cheese burger, two medium diet drinks…“

“What king of sauce on the nuggets sir?”

 “What?” 

“Barbecue, barbecue,”I said,

“ Barbecue sauce .  A bacon-cheese burger, two medium diet drinks, a small Sprite, and two fries.  Two medium fries.”

Then he turned to me and said very slowly,“Pay the man and let’s get out of here.”

Our order was pretty much what we wanted, and as my husband sped away from the hated place, I remarked,“You know, I always wondered why they have those yellow poles in front of the drive-in windows.  Now I know.”

 A Californian Encounters Southern Hospitality 

May 19, 2011 in Humor | 1 comment 
 
All it takes is a week or so away from the great state of California to make me appreciate life here in the L.A. area.  Just when I thought I’d had my fill of exorbitant rents, freeway traffic, and the country’s rudest drivers, I had the opportunity to travel from the Golden State to my native Bayou State.

Ah, Louisiana—Cajun food, French Roast coffee, Southern hospitality—my family!  I could hardly wait.  The fun began as soon as I arrived.

“You look much better, now that you’ve put on weight,” remarked a catty cousin.

“What’s your real hair color?” my mother wanted to know.

And kicking back in his own luxurious living room, my brother made his usual inquiry, “How much you say you pay for that two-bedroom rental out there?”

Even though I love my relatives, they can be a tiny bit annoying.  Southerners are very sociable creatures.  They don’t have much need for shrinks or professional counselors, because life there is a series of endless therapy sessions.

My mother, God bless her, has several thousand intimate acquaintances and makes new ones wherever she goes.

On our first trip out, I learned Edna, our checkout clerk at the Winn Dixie, had a husband who gambled away his earnings on the riverboats, a mother having her third hip replacement, and a son doing a second stint in Angola, the state prison.

“But they let him use the Internet and watch cable,” Edna explained.  We departed with words of comfort and encouragement for Edna’s predicament.

At my parents’ home, a daily stream of friends, bug sprayers, yardmen, repairmen, neighbors, and even relatives of neighbors appeared uninvited and made themselves at home.  Each had a litany of personal problems and chronic medical conditions they were eager to share with us.  I was forced to endure life histories on every human being who crossed our path.  It was exhausting.

Since rudeness is an unforgivable offense in the South, I developed a strategy of saying, “Oh, really?” or “No kidding,” every time the visitor paused to catch a breath.  After a few days, I was numb, my face set in a permanent insincere smile.

By Sunday afternoon, I was mentally drained, so I decided to walk to the Winn Dixie for a wine cooler—maybe even a bottle of cabernet—to soothe my nerves.

It seems Louisiana drivers don’t have to yield to pedestrians like California drivers do—in fact, they think there’s something wrong with anyone walking along the roadway.  As I trudged through knee-high weeds and dodged cars, one gentleman in a pickup pulled over and wanted to know if I’d broken down and needed assistance.

“No, thanks, I’m out for a walk,” I said.

The Winn Dixie was farther away than I calculated, and when I arrived, sweaty, exhausted, and bug-bitten, I headed straight for the liquor aisle, where the following sign was posted:

NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES SOLD BETWEEN MIDNIGHT SATURDAY AND MIDNIGHT SUNDAY.

This can’t be true, I thought, grabbing a wine cooler anyway and proceeding to checkout.

“Sorry, ma’am,” said the young clerk with a toothy grin.  “No alcohol sold on Sundays.”

“Come on,” I said.  “I’m visiting from California, and it’s only a wine cooler.”

“Sorry, ma’am,” he repeated, still grinning.

Even though it was Sunday, I started to hate this person.  I decided it wouldn’t help to tell him I knew Edna.

Angry, dejected, and still sweaty, I began the long hike back, where a houseful of relatives and no relief awaited me.  When I arrived, I comforted myself by consuming a plate of fried food, a slab of pecan pie, and several glasses of sweetened iced tea.  It was time to go back.

As I flew home to California, no sight ever thrilled me more than the shiny waters of the Pacific Ocean.  I retrieved my car from the parking garage, merged on the 405, and had to cut in front of an SUV to make my exit.

The harried driver pressed on his horn, rolled his window down, and gave me that familiar obscene gesture known as “The Finger.”  I beeped my own little horn, rolled down my window, threw out my arms, and shouted, “Thank you, thank you!”

I imagine that poor guy is still wondering what he did for me.

 A Crash Course in L.A. Rentals 

May 19, 2011 in Humor | Leave a comment 
 
When my husband and I moved to southern California, we had jobs to start, so we “settled” for an average apartment in Ventura County—one of row after row of matching beige units, with beige walls, carpet, appliances.

As we unpacked, my husband said, “Soon we’ll find something with panache.  A place with character, a Hollywood studio, maybe something with an ocean view.  Not a cookie-cutter apartment like this one.”

“Right,” I agreed, searching for the dictionary to look up “panache.”  According to Webster’s , it meant “dash or flamboyance in style and action.”

We started spending nights and weekends studying online ads and visiting rentals in the greater Los Angeles community.  Eighteen months later, after viewing hundreds of units, online and in person, I compiled the following glossary.

Below are the true meanings of terms commonly used in L.A. rental ads.

 Bungalow—small dump. Quaint—hasn’t been redecorated since 1976. Charming—original 1930s appliances and plumbing. Writers/artists community—six-block long psych ward. Cozy—rooms the size of closets. Animal lover wanted—downstairs tenant breeds pit bulls. Retro charm—lots of green shag carpet, paneled walls, dinged-up harvest gold appliances. Luxurious—has a bathtub in one of the bathrooms. Sunny—no air-conditioning or trees. Newly renovated—amateur paint job, one commode replaced. Great neighbors—you can hear televisions and conversations of five families. Artist’s studio—den with a cramped bathroom and hot plate. Close to offices and highways—burglar-barred unit two blocks from Ventura Freeway. Gorgeous and roomy—huge rooms, disinfectant smell overpowers layers of mold and grease. Ocean view—hike a half mile, climb over a six foot chain link fence, and you can see the edge of the Pacific three miles away. Quiet, see the stars at night—in the canyons near the former Manson family ranch. Pool on premises—dank water pit in middle of shabby complex; water hasn’t been changed since 1983. Safe neighborhood—cop cars patrol every 15 minutes. Children welcome—neighbors on each side run day-care centers. Solitude, quiet neighbors—favored habitat for registered sex offenders and paroled serial killers. Near the Grove—hike six blocks to massive parking structure adjacent to massive outdoor mall and tacky food courts. Plenty of parking—two tandem parking spaces, each requiring annual city permits of $350. Movie star studio—1930s actor you never heard of spent two weeks there in 1952. Laundry facilities on premises—three broken washers and one working dryer in ant-infested basement. No credit check—eccentric landlord wants 3,000 word essay on why you should be his next tenant. Converted movie studio—two-way mirrors, zebra shag carpet, leopard fur walls; site of three dozen adult films. Rustic—no heating or air conditioning; commode backs up every time you flush it. Completely furnished, down to linens and bath towels—previous tenant died suddenly after mysterious illness. Convenient to LAX—jumbo jets roar over your roof every four minutes. Bankruptcy okay—subjects needed for psychological experimentation. Super-friendly neighbors/block party every Saturday—LAPD calls this neighborhood “Swingersville.” Share with quiet landlord and cat lover—get used to the smell of cat urine and kitty litter. Charming, ethnic restaurants—two blocks from illegal alien campground. Converted garage apartment—huge room with concrete floor, rusted yard equipment; commode in corner. Cottage connected to house—slightly off its foundation, cracks in walls from Northridge earthquake. For nature lovers—fearless coyotes hunt cats and small dogs; bobcats stalk residents. Inner city charm—adjacent to bus station; comes with homeless person on doorstep. Close to shops, restaurants, necessities—two liquor stores, pawn shop, and bail bondsman around the corner. Gutted, all new carpet, walls, even ceiling—no worries; evidence of recent crime 100% eliminated. 

One Sunday night, after another exhausting weekend spent wandering the endless streets of Los Angeles neighborhoods, we sat on our outdoor deck, sipping drinks and looking at identical parallel decks surrounding us.

“You know, this place really isn’t so bad,” I said.  “The strange woman who squats in the laundry room actually folded all my clothes last weekend.”

“That was nice of her,” he said.  “Roger told me yesterday he’s back with his wife and in AA.”  Roger was our on-site plumber.

“That’s good news,” I said, and indicated our next-unit neighbor, a nudist with a

30-pound cat.  “Dave’s really a sweet, harmless guy.”

He nodded. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”  he asked.  Our eyes met.

“Yes,” I said.  “This place has about all the panache we can handle for now.”

 Wind Chimes

Delicate tinkle of circular glass
Blending with chords of resonant brass.

Long silver pipes noisily clang
Striking loud notes under eaves where they hang.

Ceramic shells clash as the breeze swells
accompanied by jingles of tiny gold bells.

Sounding in the twilight
Gusty and warm
Ringing in the evening storm.
