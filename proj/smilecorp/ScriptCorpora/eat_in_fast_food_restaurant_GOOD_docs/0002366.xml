 33 Years of Travel Hospitality

 In 1975, Howard Roe and his daughter, Teri, came across a sign lying face down at an abandoned filling station along US-50 Highway (not far from the site where the travel plaza is today). The sign read &apos;BETO Junction&apos;. After finding out the name stood for the intersection of Burlington, Emporia, Topeka, and Ottawa, they decided it would be an appropriate name for their new place.

Less than a year later, the doors of BETO Junction opened in January 1978 in the middle of an ice storm at the intersection of Interstate 35 and US Highway 75.



 Over the years, the BETO Junction restaurant has gained a reputation for good food, including hand breaded chicken fried steaks, real mashed potatoes, and GIANT cinnamon rolls. In a nationwide survey, BETO Junction was voted as a favorite of truck drivers.

Drivers, locals, and highway travelers have remained loyal to BETO Junction, which often feeds up to 1,000 people a day. 





 BETO Junction Travel Plaza added a Wendy&apos;s Old Fashioned Hamburgers to offer a quality fast food restaurant to round out the complete offering of amenities to the highway traveler.
