It showcases some of the best talent and creativity available on MTS and in the community. Wow, how long has it been. I know everyone should be pleased with this one because it&apos;s the most requested fast food restaurant on this site. You guys can&apos;t even imagine how many different Google searches I had to do to find this design. Anyway It has an exotic exterior with a modern interior. The signs, walls, and floor covering were created by me. I really really hope you like this because I put so much time and effort in it. Please leave comments even if they are negative ones because they motivate me. Also you can download Exnem&apos;s Functioning Soda Machine for more realism here . If you look at one of the pictures, you will see the Functioning Soda Machine, but it is not included. Last go to my homepage to see the update on the big project I had planned. Thank you and God Bless

 Basic Download and Install Instructions: 

1. Download: Click the download link to save the .rar or .zip file(s) to your computer.

2. Extract: Use WinRAR (Windows) or Stuffit (Mac) to extract the .sims2pack file(s) from the .rar or .zip file(s).

3. Install: Double-click on the .sims2pack file to install its contents to your game. The files will automatically be installed to the proper location(s).

 You may want to use the Sims2Pack Clean Installer instead of the game&apos;s installer, which will let you install sims and pets which may otherwise give errors about needing expansion packs. It also lets you choose what included content to install. Do NOT use Clean Installer to get around this error with lots and houses as that can cause your game to crash when attempting to use that lot. Get S2PCI here: Clean Installer Official Site . 

 Need more information? 

 For a full, complete guide to downloading complete with pictures and more information, see: Game Help: Downloading for Fracking Idiots . 

 Custom content not showing up in the game? See: Game Help: Getting Custom Content to Show Up .
 Anyone can use both .rar and .zip files easily! On Windows, use WinRAR . On Mac, use Stuffit .
