Scientists Prove How to Value a Bottle of Wine, Just by Feeling its Dimple

 Scientists have shown it is possible to value a bottle of wine just by feeling the depth of its dimple. The theory, which until now had been reported to be an urban myth, was proven by making measurements on bottles of wine of different prices. The fact will provide a useful trick for visitors to parties. 

Birmingham, UK (PRWEB) February 28, 2005 -- A British scientist has shown it is possible to value a bottle of wine just by feeling the depth of its dimple. The theory, which until now had been reported to be an urban myth, was proven by making measurements on bottles of wine of different prices. The fact will provide a useful trick for visitors to parties.

Scientist Dr Karl Blanks, a graduate of the University of Cambridge, was frustrated when his friends dismissed his claim that expensive wines tended to have deeper dimples. A search on the Internet failed to support his belief – in fact some websites claimed the theory was an urban myth.

In response, Dr Blanks created a purpose-made depth gauge and carried out measurements on a large number of bottles of red wine at his local supermarket. The results suggested a clear link between dimple depth and price, which could be best described by the equation

Price of Bottle = (Dimple Depth in Millimetres + $6.65) / 4.314

Statisticians from around the world provided their support to verify that the results were valid. “Although the equation does not tell the whole story”, said Dr Blanks “it clearly demonstrates that there is a relationship.”

So whether you are receiving a bottle of wine as a gift, or making a choice between two bottles at a party, this quirky trick might come in handy.

The home-made depth gauge, which was used to make the measurements, was auctioned on eBay and fetched £2.70 (GBP).

Hispanics Embrace Healthy Cooking Traditions That Preserve Cultural Preferences

 Sazonando con Harry a hit with readers and provides inspiration of Hispanic culinary success story 

Dallas, TX (PRWEB) February 25, 2005 -- Chef Harry Salazar represents the American dream of so many Mexican immigrants not only in Dallas but across the nation. Now, Chef Harry has transformed that dream into a shared dream for many Hispanics and non-Hispanics alike—healthy Mexican culinary dishes that are leaner yet savory without compromising culture.

Earlier this month, Chef Harry’s recipes made their print debut in Diario La Estrella, the first Spanish daily in the DFW area. “We recognize the tremendous opportunity for our readers to have access to high culinary recipes that are both relevant to our cultural preferences and offer our community healthier cooking alternatives,” explained Javier Aldape, publisher of Diario La Estrella.

Chef Harry’s experience is one that also brings La Estrella readers additional value—his inspirational success story and the opportunity to dispel the myth that Mexican men stay out of the kitchen. The column further extends the reach of his culinary recipes to La Estrella readers from Sazonado con Harry events and programming.

Chef Harry Salazar took his message to the community last summer presenting his unique style and recipes to national Hispanic leaders and community members at the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) National Convention in San Antonio, Viva Dallas and at the State Fair of Texas in 2004. After getting an overwhelming response, Chef Harry has embarked on sharing his recipes through the Summer Grill Tour that will specifically target Hispanic audiences in a number of Texas cities. Sponsorship opportunities are currently under negotiation with a number of food related companies.

Chef Harry has also hosted a national Hispanic-focused cooking show entitled, Sazonando con Harry that aired on Hispanic Television Network and has been featured on various Spanish and English television segments.

“I am very excited about the column and sharing my experiences with a segment of the community that until now has had little access to healthy Mexican cooking” stated Chef Harry.

Sazonando con Harry was the first nationally televised cooking show produced by an independent production company in the US.

Gourmet Coffee Retailer Offers World’s Finest Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee for Less than 50 cents Per Cup

 Americans have gotten used to paying as much as $2 per cup for &quot;Regular&quot; coffee from premium coffee houses when they can have Jamaican Blue Mountain Gourmet Coffee, known as the finest coffee in the world, for less than 50 cents per cup when brewed at home. 

Parlin, NJ (PRWEB) February 25, 2005 -- American’s have come to accept high prices charged by premium coffee houses, up to $2 a cup, for just “Good Coffee.” Often those consumers are not aware that they can enjoy what has been called the world’s best coffee, Jamaica Blue Mountain Gourmet Coffee, for less than 50 cents per cup when brewed at home.

American coffee lovers who are sometimes put off by prices above $30 per pound in the U.S. for Jamaican Blue Mountain Gourmet Coffee don’t realize that there are over 35 standard cups of coffee to a half-pound bag. Compared to many premium coffee bar prices, that makes the cost of each cup brewed at home cost less at about 50 cents or so per cup for this recognized premium brew that has been called the best coffee in the world. Coffee houses routinely charge three to four times that for just average coffee.

Coffee was first introduced to Jamaica by the English governor of the island, Sir Lewis Hawes in 1728, when it was still a British colony. The Queen of England still gets her coffee by mail order from Jamaica. The Japanese currently import 85% of all Blue Mountain coffee produced, according to the Jamaican government. Japanese prices sometimes approach as much as $62 per pound.

Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee is not a brand, but a recognized growing region between 2000 and 5000 feet elevation in the Blue Mountain region on the Island of Jamaica. The mountainous region above 5500 feet to the highest peak at 7400 feet elevation is maintained as a forest preserve. The growing conditions in the Blue Mountain range are considered ideal for coffee with cool misty conditions and incredibly rich soil with high rainfall and excellent drainage to contribute to the smoothest coffee produced anywhere in the world.

The Jamaica Coffee Industry Board was formed in 1950 to monitor and assure quality processing and production techniques and verify growing regions. No beans grown below 2000 feet elevation or outside the Blue Mountain range can be labeled Blue Mountain Coffee. The quality controls assure the highest standards of gourmet coffee production and guarantee the richest, most flavorful, low acidity coffee with a hint of sweetness and exquisite bold aroma. Most Jamaican coffee is grown by small farmers throughout the mountainous region.

This fine gourmet coffee blend can now be purchased online from Gourmet Coffee Retailer, TastesoftheWorld.net where visitors can visit the Coffee Talk Forum http://www.tastesoftheworld.net/talk/ to discuss the Jamaican Blue Mountain gourmet coffee from Jablum.

About Tastes of The World
Tastes of The World coffee company focuses on specialty gourmet coffees which are not readily available in the United States. Rare Gourmet Coffee is their business so they make shopping with them risk free. If for any reason you are not happy, they will make it right.

An Ideal Meat for Today’s Diet

 Elk meat is an ideal protein source for today’s health-conscious, fat-avoiding, calorie- and carb-counting eaters. 

Watertown, SD (PRWEB) February 22, 2005 -- What has more protein, less fat and fewer calories than turkey, chicken, beef, pork, buffalo or salmon?

No, it’s not tofu. This meat has much more protein – and taste – than tofu. And it’s leaner than deer meat or beefalo, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Nutrient Database. Farmer Linda Karber wants you to know that elk meat is an ideal protein source for today’s fat-avoiding, calorie- and carb-counting eaters.

“I’ve been raising elk for almost 30 years,” Karber said, “and it’s amazing how today’s health-conscious eaters are becoming aware of elk meat. It’s not only healthy, but it tastes great and is environmentally friendly, because elk farming has a minimal impact on the land.”

Karber sells elk meat from her website, www.elkmeatshop.com, as well as from some South Dakota butcher shops. Most of what she sells comes from elk she has raised. For internet orders, the frozen meat in cry-o-vaced packaging, which will keep up to two years as long as the seal is not broken, is placed inside a Styrofoam cooler, usually along with dry ice, frozen gel packs or both, and shipped inside a heavy cardboard box. It generally arrives at the purchaser’s home in two or three days.

What cuts of meat can you buy? Various cuts of steak and roasts, elk burger, brats, breakfast and summer sausage, pickled Polish sausage, jerky, pepper sticks, liver, ribs, soup bones. Many of her customers have started buying half or whole elk, butchered to order.

“Elk meat tastes like mild (almost sweet) beef,” Karber said. “Elk can be substituted equally for venison in most standard venison recipes.”

Elk meat is leaner than the meat of domesticated animals like cattle, which have been bred to encourage the marbling of fat, Karber explained. “But the tenderness of elk meat is similar to that of domesticated animals as long as it’s not overcooked,” she added. “The elk meat should be cooked slowly in moist heat.” The elkmeatshop.com website contains numerous recipes and cooking instructions. The site also offers jewelry and other gifts made from elk antlers and the animal’s two ivory teeth, which are its uppers.

Elk are members of the deer family. The North American elk, similar to the “red deer” of Europe and Asia, were called “wapiti” by the Shawnee Indians until the English settlers gave them their current name. The bulls stand about five feet tall and weigh from 700 to more than 1,000 pounds. The females are smaller and lack the antlers of the male.

Elk farming grew in North America in the last two decades of the 20th Century, in part because of the demand from Asian countries for the antlers, which are used in traditional medicines there. More recently, elk meat is becoming recognized as a tasty and healthful alternative to other meats on the family dinner plate.

Elchrom Scientific Introduces Blot-EX With Highest Protein Recovery in Western Blotting

 Elchrom Scientific, a provider of state of the art solutions for biomolecular separations, analyses and purification, announced today the introduction of Blot-EX a new non-acrylamide, non-toxic, high resolution electrophoresis precast hydrogel especially conceived for increasing protein transfer efficiency during Western blotting. 

CHAM, Switzerland (PRWEB) February 22, 2005 -- Elchrom Scientific, a provider of state of the art solutions for biomolecular separations, analyses and purification, announced today the introduction of Blot-EX a new non-acrylamide, non-toxic, high resolution electrophoresis precast hydrogel especially conceived for increasing protein transfer efficiency during Western blotting. Blot-EX offers overall recovery efficiency up to 90%, obtained with significantly reduced transfer times (less than 10 minutes) when compared to industry standard polyacrylamide pre-cast gels. Blot-Ex operates in the size range 30 – 200 KDa. The improvement in protein transfer is more important in the upper part of the range, corresponding to enzymes and receptors.

&quot;We are leveraging the standards of quality, purity and yield that we have demonstrated in nucleic acid applications and applying our know-how to the field of proteomics with this striking innovation. The essential need for drastically enhanced performance in protein transfer is now fulfilled with 90% recovery. We expect to see a number of new target identification in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries following the implementation of this technology, alone and/or in conjunction with the patented high efficiency electro-elution recovery system already used for high purity oligo purification”, said Jean-Louis Roux dit Buisson, CEO.

“The unique polymer matrix of controlled porosity makes Blot-EX gels the best choice for research people who need fast and high protein recovery,” adds Franck Montagne, CSO.

Elchrom Scientific’s short term development plans include extending the Blot-EX line to cover the ranges below 30 kDa and above 200 kDa, introducing advanced solutions for proteomics as well as industrial siRNA purification solutions and pursuing the development of the application based business on a world-wide basis. Elchrom Scientific also plans to develop OEM partnerships for the reusable PCR CheckIT range of solutions with international distributors.

Elchrom Scientific’s solutions are designed to improve quality of results in industrial, governmental and academic research. Diagnostic laboratories and production facilities also benefit from Elchrom Scientific solutions where quality of purifications and separations matters.

Elchrom Scientific welcomes international distributors who are interested in promoting and selling the new Blot-EX product line. For more information visit our web site, www.elchrom.com.

Pizza News: Vintage Metal Pizza Signs for Italian Restaurant And Pizzeria Decor Are Selling Off The Walls

 Pizza signs are both fun and decorative, and now they are also a nice source of extra income for pizzerias and Italian restaurants. Vintage metal signs are incredibly popular right now and restaurants are adding these charming collectibles right to their menu. 

(PRWEB) February 21, 2005 -- Are you looking for a great new menu option or a catchy new trend to boost your sales a little? Look no further because we have found it for you. It&apos;s a popular new restaurant trend and it could mean some big revenues for your company.

Vintage metal signs have become so popular for restaurants these days and there are a couple of reasons why. The first reason is obvious: They add such a nostalgic and warm atmosphere to your eatery that your customers feel welcome and invited and return often. But did you know that they are also producing substantial profits for these restaurant owners as well?

While these signs hang beautifully on the walls as a decorative touch, they are also selling themselves to customers without anyone even lifting a finger. In fact, while we are recommending that you do hang a sign that says they are for sale, the customized signs are simply selling themselves right off the walls.

Customers are relishing the opportunity to take a bit of their favorite restaurant home with them and giving their kitchens a whole new look. What more could they want after their favorite meal, but a permanent keepsake they can adore in their home? A variety of customized and non-customized signs in your restaurant will give your customers something new to look forward to on their next visit and allow them to collect them all over a period of time.

The best part is, your initial startup costs should be very nominal. After all, you will only begin with a small amount of signs to see how they &quot;take&quot;. If you choose to customize your signs right away, you should figure in some added cost but on the average, you should purchase your signs for no more than 50% of what you are going to retail the sign for. Vintage metal art signs retail anywhere from $28 - $42, usually depending on the size and amount of colors used in the signs. If your wholesaling costs allow you to sell each sign for twice the cost of producing them, then you are on the right track. That&apos;s a minimum of a 100% profit for restaurant owners. Not too shabby, huh? Now you can see why they are so popular among business owners.

For more information on availability or pricing, we recommend that you visit the leading producer of vintage metal signs, as they have the largest selection we have found with very moderate prices.

 Bringing the tantalizing tastes of Indian cuisine to countries around the world, and into people’s kitchens in easy, quick to prepare means, is the goal of Satnam.

Basmati rice instead of hamburgers? Bringing the tantalizing tastes of Indian cuisine to countries around the world, and into people’s kitchens in easy, quick to prepare means, is the goal of Satnam. The aim of this major international exporter is “to continue to harvest nature’s purest products, process them using the most modern technology and make them available as far and wide across the globe as possible.”

Apart from its rich culture and heritage, India is known for many premium agro products, unique to its land. Basmati rice is one of these prized possessions. People everywhere savor the unique aroma and flavor of premium Indian basmati rice. And amongst the most revered names in Indian basmati, comes Kohinoor, which is appreciated for its divine aroma, supreme purity and extraordinary quality.

In India, Kohinoor enjoys more than 32% share of the branded basmati rice market, estimated at about $100 million. It is the leader in the premium segment and has emerged as the largest selling brand in the country. Kohinoor is also shipped round the globe to all the continents.

Apart from Kohinoor, the flagship brand of the company, Satnam Overseas has other notable brands like Trophy, Charminar, Rose, Shehanshah and Falcon in its portfolio. Catering to different market segments (as per their pricing and appeal), these brands have now become popular everywhere.

Quality and focus on research to understand changing consumer preferences and cater to their requirements is what drives those at Satnam Overseas, where age-old Indian traditions merge with world class standards, ensuring fine products. Their rice processing plants are world-class state-of-the-art, with one of the largest milling capacities in India. These plants are fully automated through the entire chain of processing of rice from paddy stage to the packaging of the final product. Production is fully computer-aided, with state of the art cameras to detect impurities, maintain quality, color and size.

The company has successfully branched out into ready to eat category with ‘Kohinoor Heat&amp;Eat’,‘Kohinoor Rice&amp;Curry’ and ‘Kohinoor Rice&amp;Spice’ offering a huge variety in each of these product lines. Satnam has also ventured into the snack food industry by launching ‘Kohinoor Numkeenz’, an exciting new range of authentic and premium namkeens for the Indian market. Kohinoor Heat&amp;Eat Indian Curries are a range of ready - to - eat Indian delicacies. Created by master Chefs, each recipe in this range is an exhibition of rare and authentic Indian culinary skills. Perfected over generations, these products use the very best of ingredients and the most exotic Indian spices and herbs. Rice&amp;Spice can be cooked in 15 minutes, either on stove-top or microwave. Kohinoor Rice&amp;Curry is an inspiration of this unique Indian culinary tradition and brings authentic meal options with added convenience. Embracing the spirit and flavor of global rice cuisine, Kohinoor Rice Treat comes in pre-cooked form offering authentic taste with modern convenience of ready meal solutions.

Satnam has also ventured into the Australian market by supplying premium Basmati Rice to the supermarket giant Coles, which enjoys 43% of the market share. The company is aggressively exploring new markets such as China, Malaysia, Thailand and other Asian markets. Satnam is the first company to bag a prestigious order from China for the “Heat&amp;Eat” range.

“Business&amp;Beyond” to Feature American Dairy Inc

 Milk and dairy products have become staples in the Chinese economy, once known mainly for tea, due to exposure to Western culture. 

Deerfield Beach, FL (PRWEB) February 18, 2005 -- Platinum Television Group is pleased to announce the selection of American Dairy Inc. for its innovative, educational television series, Business&amp;Beyond. The company will be featured in the Models of Excellence series on “Investment Opportunities in China.”

You may soon see Chinese people with milk moustaches in those “Got Milk?” ads that frequent publications. Milk and dairy products have become staples in the Chinese economy, once known mainly for tea, due to exposure to Western culture.

American Dairy, Inc., one of the leading producers and distributors of milk powder and soybean products in China, recently moved corporate headquarters to Beijing, China. Despite its name, American Dairy, with business offices in Los Angeles, CA, is looking to continue its strong track record of growth through expanded production facilities in China. The Chinese consumers’ demand for milk and milk-related products is growing faster than the supply. The company intends to grow its business to accommodate the demand and build its market share. “To reach our full potential and to operate more efficiently and effectively, we must equip ourselves with the best human resources available,” explained Leng You-Bin, President/CEO.

Due to this increase in demand, the production of milk has gone up from 0.6 million tons in the 1970s to nine million tons in 2000. American Dairy has experienced growth due to distinguishing its products from other dairy products, and by refining and targeting its message through both advertising and word of mouth.

American Dairy has a milk processing plant in China’s Kedong province. All aspects of production are designed to yield premium quality milk and wholesome tastes catered to the Chinese market. This facility processes 300 tons of milk a day and has one production line for processing milk, and three production lines for processing soybean milk and powders. They produce formula for babies (CPP) as well as liver treasure milk powder, soy milk powder and calcium supplement milk powders.

The company has numerous supply contacts with small local farmers and ranchers in the area. These farmers have approximately 514,650 acres of pastureland, which is about 27% of the pastureland in Kedong. American Dairy conducts operations in China through its owned subsidiary Feihe Dairy. Feihe means flying crane, and in China, the crane is a symbol of longevity. Feihe’ has recently spread its influence by being distributed in new provinces and reaching more consumers.

American Dairy is proud to stand for diversified products of quality and maintains a strong corporate reputation. Their emphasis is on producing healthy and nutritious products. Stock is publicly traded, and with expansion and a booming market in China for dairy products, American Dairy is a good investment opportunity. For more information, see www.americandairyinc.com

New Cracker Application For TasteTech&apos;s Encapsulation

 TasteTech UK has developed the application of its controlled release (CR) microencapsulation technology to make it easier for cracker and savoury biscuit manufacturers to flavour their products. Commonly used for retaining the delicate flavours of sweet and savoury spices through high temperature baking, TasteTech’s new application for use in fast bake crackers and savoury biscuits has been developed to facilitate the growing market trend for flavoured crackers. 

(PRWEB) February 16, 2005 -- TasteTech UK has developed the application of its controlled release (CR) microencapsulation technology to make it easier for cracker and savoury biscuit manufacturers to flavour their products.

TasteTech’s unique CR-100 encapsulation system is recognised by food manufactures throughout the world as one of the most efficient and economic methods of flavouring their products. Commonly used for retaining the delicate flavours of sweet and savoury spices through high temperature baking, TasteTech’s new application for use in fast bake crackers and savoury biscuits has been developed to facilitate the growing market trend for flavoured crackers.

Using the CR-100 technology a hardened vegetable oil microfilm is formed around the flavouring which protects the flavour and ensures it is not released in the baking process until a desired temperature of 60-65oC is reached, encouraging flavour retention and resulting in a tastier product. By doing so it considerably reduces the amount of flavouring required as well as the cost involved in the baking process.

“Fast bake products can be very difficult to flavour,” says Roger Sinton, Managing Director of TasteTech. “Seasoning crackers and savoury biscuits is particularly awkward because they have large surface areas and are baked at high temperatures where steam evaporation and distillation of flavour often occurs. As a result cracker manufacturers have to over compensate the amount of flavour they use in the baking process to get the desired result. Our encapsulation process basically solves the problem of flavour retention and makes it really easy for manufacturers to bake-in any combination of flavour.”

TasteTech can encapsulate a variety of tasty flavourings for crackers including sun-dried tomato, cheese&amp;onion and Mediterranean herb. Furthermore, as new flavourings are developed, TasteTech can engineer the CR mechanism to become activated by different changes of temperature, depending on the individual manufacturers baking process. More information on TasteTech’s unique controlled release system can be found on www.tastetech.co.uk

Notes to editors: TasteTech Ltd is a world leading flavourings manufacturer, specialising in microencapsulated food ingredients with a unique controlled release mechanism.

Urban Male Model’s Invention Revolutionizes the Bar Industry

 Kairi Jeffries is revolutionizing the bar, restaurant and catering industries with his new invention the drain scoop. 

Jersey City, NJ (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) February 15, 2005 -- Kairi Jeffries is revolutionizing the bar, restaurant and catering industries with his new invention the drain scoop. Watered-down drinks will no longer be a problem for bartenders and caterers across the U.S. What makes this ice scoop so amazing is its patented design of four slots, placed strategically, to allow excess water to drain from melted ice. “Every party needs tons of ice. After a few hours, the ice has melted and servers are scooping it out with their hands. Customers are complaining that their drinks are watered down. It’s creates a messy environment.”

Drain scoop is the brainchild of Kairi Jeffries, who used money from his modeling career along with investments from family and friends to complete design work and patent approval. Immediately Jeffries began shopping his design to potential buyers. He didn’t have to shop very long. He soon found an investor with deep ties to the industry and money to invest. “Now I’m distributing my product and other companies will have to come to me to even remotely use the design.” Drain scoop makes the perfect drink every time. The drain scoop also cuts time in half. Jeffries developed the idea while mixing for an upscale New Jersey caterer.

One patent release and seven investors later, Jeffries is now taking the catering, bar and restaurant industries by storm. “I know it’s a simple design. People always ask me- ‘are you sure it hasn’t been invented already?’ Well if it has someone had better tell the patent office.” Jeffries displayed the drain scoop at the International Restaurant and Foodservice Show of New York at the Javits Center. The drain scoop was awarded best new product at the show in the best equipment/services category.

For more information on the patented drain scoop and to see it in action, visit www.drainscoop.com or call Kairi Jeffries at (201) 459-9840

New Range of Healthy, Gourmet Foods

 New food process produces healthy, low in carb, low in calories, no fat gourmet cookies. 

Suffern, NY (PRWEB) February 14, 2005 -- Thanks to a revolutionary breakthrough in food technology consumers will soon be able to enjoy blueberry muffins, chocolate chip cookies and other treats knowing that they are not only delicious but that they are good for them too!

The products are very low in carbs, low in fat, have zero trans fat, are low in calories and high in fiber. They have no cholesterol, no sugar, no wheat, no gluten, no yeast, no milk and no animal fats. In addition, they are kosher and suitable for diabetics.

After years of research by food technicians in Europe, E-Z Gourmet is now developing a range of products from cakes to cookies and bagels to burgers that are not only good for your health they can also help people control their weight. E-Z Gourmet cookies are now available in a growing number of stores in New York and New Jersey and international orders are being shipped to Canada.

“The products not only taste scrumptious, they are healthy, nutritious and ideal for today’s fast paced, health conscious, weight watching society,” said Zina Minz, E-Z Gourmet’s founder and president.

“They even do you good because they can help fight heart disease and obesity, the nation’s two biggest killers. The products are all made from 100% soy flour – although you would never know it – and the secret method of mixing produces a home-baked type taste, flavor and texture that is truly unique,” she adds.

Soy is one of the few foods allowed to make a health claim because the Food and Drug Administration and American Heart Association acknowledge that a daily intake of 25gr of soy protein can lower cholesterol and the risk of a heart attack.

Soy produces many other health and nutritional benefits. It can play an important role in the war on obesity because products contain far fewer calories and are low in carbs and fat. And, because of the fiber you feel full faster so consume less, says Minz.

Medical studies have also shown that soy protein can lower diastolic blood pressure in women, can inhibit bone loss that leads to osteoporosis and can also ease menopause by substantially reducing the frequency of hot flushes.

“With obesity a national epidemic in the US and a leading killer, our products provide healthy, low calorie choices for adults and children alike,” she says.

The company is focusing initially on a range of baked food products that can be distributed fresh or frozen. There are already plans, however, to extend the range to include appetizers, entrees and desserts.

“The interest from the food industry has already been phenomenal and we are speaking with major distributors, national fast food chains and supermarkets,” adds Minz.

“Our proprietary production technique allows us to produce almost any product as a soy-substitute including breads, pasta and noodles to pies and meat-substitutes, like soy steaks and burgers. The great thing is that even though the products are made primarily from soy they taste even better than the original. Imagine the impact on the nation’s health and waistline if people switched to soy burgers and soy buns,” says Minz.

Visit more than 100 Wineries and Tasting Rooms in Oregon’s Premier Wine Country

(PRWEB) February 12, 2005 -- The roads are narrow and winding, the wineries intimate, and the winemakers passionate about their wine. Come discover Oregon’s Willamette Valley wine region, a short jaunt from Portland, nestled in a valley between the Cascades and the Coastal Mountain Range. More than 100 wineries and tasting rooms will welcome both causal sippers and serious oenophiles during the 15th annual Memorial Day Weekend in Wine Country, May 28-30th, 2005 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Take this opportunity to visit some of the Willamette Valley’s small, family-owned wineries often closed to visitors, as well as larger wineries and tasting rooms pouring select library wines. For a wine touring map with winery listings, lodging and dining, please call the Willamette Valley Wineries Association at 503-646-2985 or order online at www.willamettewines.com

Oregon’s Willamette Valley Celebrates 40 years of Vines:
The Willamette Valley is celebrating 40 years as a wine producing region, dating back to 1965 when David Lett, and his wife, Diana, planted 3,000 pinot noir vines in the Dundee Hills. A Utah native, Lett was traveling to San Francisco when he discovered the Napa Valley. He soon gave up a dream of dental school to study viticulture at the University of California at Davis before heading north to Oregon. After studying western Oregon’s geography and climate, Lett planted pinot noir grapes in the Northern Willamette Valley, convinced that pinot noir was a perfect fit. The Letts produced their first wines in 1970 and welcomed the migration of Oregon wine pioneers – including Dick Erath, Erath Vineyards, Dick and Nancy Ponzi, Ponzi Vineyards, David and Ginny Adelsheim, Adelsheim Vineyard, Joe and Pat Campbell, Elk Cove, Susan and Bill Sokol-Blosser, Sokol Blosser and Myron Redford, Amity Vineyards.

New Willamette Valley AVA’s:
Today, there are 121 wineries and tasting rooms represented by the Willamette Valley Wineries Association stretching south from Portland to Eugene. The Willamette Valley AVA was approved in the mid-1980s. Three new AVA’s have recently been approved for the Northern Willamette Valley; Yamhill-Carlton District, Dundee Hills and McMinnville. Three additional AVA’s are pending, including Chehalem Mountains, Eola Hills, McMinnville Foothills, Red Hills of Dundee, Ribbon Ridge, and Yamhill-Carlton District.

The Willamette Valley’s Less-Traveled Roads:
Touring the Willamette Valley wine country takes patience, a good touring map, and an adventurous spirit. With some of the 121 wineries and tasting rooms tucked back from the road, perched on top of a ridge, or housed in old pig farms and barns, the Willamette Valley has a surprise waiting at every fork in the road. Small towns like Carlton, Lafayette and Dundee dot the map, llamas and horses share pasture space, and rows and rows of grapevines paint a pastoral backdrop. With world class dining, intimate country inns, and nurseries and garden shops, the Willamette Valley is worth exploring – one back road at a time.

About Willamette Valley Wineries Association:
The WVWA is a non-profit industry association dedicated to achieving recognition for the Willamette Valley as a premier wine producing region. Currently, the new organization has 121 members representing wineries and tasting rooms throughout the Willamette Valley region – from Portland to Eugene. Memorial Weekend in Wine Country and Wine Country Thanksgiving (November 25-27, 2005) are the two oldest wine touring events in Oregon sponsored by the association. The Board of Directors includes: Paul Hart, president and owner of Rex Hill Vineyards; Josh Bergstrom, Bergstrom; Bill Hatcher, A to Z; Lisa Jenkins, Duck Pond; Harry Peterson-Nedry, Chehalem; Steve Vuylsteke, Erath Vineyards; Pat Dudley, Bethel Heights; Annie Shull, Raptor Ridge and Ken Evenstad, Domaine Serene.

MVI Technology Rolls Out Oven-Ready Solution at Allied Bakeries

 Allied Bakeries wanted to improve its manufacturing performance and customer service levels across its 13 bakeries but since there was no reliable measurement of current performance, the company was finding it difficult to identify the ‘hotspots’ on which to focus its improvement activities. It turned to RPM (real-time performance management) vendor, MVI Technology for help. 

(PRWEB) February 11, 2005 -- Founded in 1935 by Willard Garfield Weston, Allied Bakeries has a third share of the UK bread market. Products include morning goods, rolls and part-baked bread, with household brands such as Kingsmill, Allinson, Sunblest and Burgen. Allied is part of the Associated British Foods Group. ABF has a global turnover of £5.2 billion per annum and employs 35,000 worldwide.

The company wanted a better understanding of its productivity was, so plant managers could make informed choices about where improvements could be made.

Some of Allied’s bakeries had implemented manual and PC-based systems for monitoring performance but they all operated independently of each other and, according to the group’s project manager, Rod Whenray, reliability of the data they produced was at best ‘reasonable’.

“The systems were ‘home-baked’ (excuse the pun). We had lots of anecdotal information and half-truths on plant performance but no real plant history or analysis – in some cases reported unreliability of equipment simply wasn’t true.”

Allied contracted MVI Technology to implement its Mainsaver and Eventsengine software solutions. The MVI system provides a visual record of what happens when breakdowns and stoppages occur; the information relevant to operators is logged by them and instantly transformed into live graphical data on the line. It allows the company to capture all reactive work from the shopfloor for analysis of repetitive faults, so it can make improvements by eliminating or reducing the faults.

Implementation of the MVI system began at the company’s largest bakery (in West Bromwich) in January 2004 and is steadily rolling out across the group. Allied’s approach has been to implement the system in ‘manageable’ chunks. Whenray: “We installed it in stores and purchasing first and now we’re rolling out the final module to gather data on downtime. The first part of the implementation allowed us to identify precisely where our spend was by each individual piece of equipment; who was taking parts out and who we were buying parts from.

Whenray was able to eliminate the purchase of duplicate parts from different suppliers and drive down purchase costs as well as make savings because of improvements in equipment reliability and planned maintenance. “We reduced carriage costs at the West Bromwich site by 80% because we stopped having to call out taxis in the middle of the night – that alone saved us £14,000 a year. And we’ve saved another £22,000 because we’re buying more effectively - we can make better price comparisons: we know what we’ve got in stock; we know what usage has been and we can go out for more competitive prices

The savings at the West Bromwich site was the justification Whenray needed to roll out across the group and he expects similar savings at each of the other bakeries, as well as getting the group-wide information he needs to drive business improvement:

“The downtime data from the MVI system will give us better plant reliability and we’ll be able to supply our customers better. We already have superb customer service levels, but we can improve things by fulfilling orders more efficiently - we get orders at 4.00pm for delivery the next day and obviously we don’t carry any stock; if we get a breakdown in the middle of the night, that’s a problem.”

Whenray says the MVI system is easy to use and the usual operator resistance to new Information Technology was quickly overcome. He is pleased with the benefits the system has already delivered. “To be honest, we made savings even before the system went live – we identified the carriage savings we’d make at the West Bromwich plant simply as a result of collecting and populating data in preparation for the implementation.”

Mom Invented, Patented Food, Wine And Casserole Tote Featured On First-Ever Mom Invented™ Ebay Store

 Mom Invented newly patented product, Gourmet Tote, was added to the product line-up of The Mom Invented™ eBay store. 

Bradenton, FL (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) February 10, 2005 -- Mom Invented newly patented product, Gourmet Tote, was added to the product line-up of The Mom Invented™ eBay store. Owned and operated by Mom Inventors, Inc., the eBay store is the first and only store set up to exclusively sell products invented by moms. “We are pleased to offer this innovative product to our customers,” says Tamara Monosoff, CEO of Mom Inventors, Inc. and fellow inventor. Ms. Monosoff and representatives of Mom Inventors have been featured on Good Morning America, the Today Show, The View and in the New Yorker Magazine. A full description and photo of the Gourmet Tote can be found by going to http://www.mominventors.com and clicking on the eBay icon or http://stores.ebay.com/mominventors

“I am excited to work with other moms that have terrific products. With the addition of the Gourmet Tote to the Mom Invented eBay store, it also shows that not every product invented by moms has to be kid related. The Gourmet Tote solves the food transport issue we all have when attending holiday dinners, potlucks or just food related events we share with friends and family. Moms in general invent all sorts of products, we tend to be problem solvers. I like the idea of ‘moms helping moms’ and see this as an opportunity to offer customers an array of mom invented products,” says Leianne Messina-Brown, Creator and CEO of Gourmet Tote.

Mom Inventors, Inc. established by a mother and inventor in early 2003, is founded on the principle that many of the best and most unique ideas come directly from their target market – Moms. In addition to developing its own brand of Mom Invented™ products, Mom Inventors, Inc., licenses products, as well as supports other mom inventors in taking their product ideas to market.

The Gourmet Tote is the patented revolutionary, award winning, thermally insulated food, wine and casserole carrier with a convertible and removable shelving unit for carrying multiple casseroles, prepared dishes, appetizers and beverages in separate compartments. With its patented design, it allows you to bring the whole meal (wine, main course and dessert) to dinners and picnics without stacking items. The Gourmet Tote can be used for dinner parties, potlucks, tailgate parties, supper clubs, picnics and outdoor concerts. Its thermal lining (the same fabric used in pizza delivery bags) will keep hot items hot and cold items cold, and hot and cold separately. The Gourmet Tote also features a utensil holder, side pockets for personal accessories like car keys, wallet and cell phone and rubber stoppers on the bottom so contents don’t shift in travel. The tote carries and looks like a top of the line briefcase or carry-on suitcase.

Ms. Messina-Brown created the Gourmet Tote out of a personal need. She entertains in her home frequently and attends quite a few food related social gatherings every month. She realized she and her guests were transporting their prepared dishes in paper bags, canvas totes or simply boxes. This followed an uncomfortable car ride where hot plates were either wedged on the floor or hazardously placed on laps. She wanted the ability to bring more than one prepared dish, food item and perhaps a bottle of wine without stacking things on top of each other. She wanted something functional as well as fashionable when she showed up at functions. When her research came up with nothing compared to what she wanted, she decided to design one herself. The Gourmet Tote was born and www.GourmetTote.com went live in April of 2003.

Ag Pro&apos;s Breakthrough Cooking Oil Solves Age Old Problem

 Ag Pro will sell 1% linolenic soybean cooking oil which has no trans fats and 33% less saturated fat compared to hydrogenated oil. This oil is more healthy than both saturated fat oils and hydrogenated oils. 

New York, NY (PRWEB) February 10, 2005 -- A new cooking oil solves an age old problem. Foods cooked in saturated oils such as animal fats cause heart disease. Hydrogenated vegetable oils meanwhile contain trans fats which elevate LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in the blood and lower HDL (good) cholesterol.

Today Ag Pro in cooperation with Innovative Growers of Iowa announces the solution at the Restaurant and Foodservice Show February 9 through 11 at the Javits Center in New York City. Ag Pro will sell 1% linolenic soybean oil which has no trans fats and 33% less saturated fat compared to hydrogenated oil.

Hydrogenation adds hydrogen atoms to oil molecules to extend shelf life. Since linolenic acid is the primary cause of oil deterioration, growing soybeans with low linolenic acid makes hydrogenation unnecessary.

These 1% linolenic soybeans were developed using traditional breeding methods over more than 30 years at Iowa State University. Recently finished tests by Warner and Gupta for the Journal Of American Chemists Society have confirmed the viability and benefits of the new oil. Taste tests conducted by White, Su and Gupta of Iowa State University, showed the flavor of french fries prepared in the 1% linolenic and partially hydrogenated oils was found to be the same. Others report improved crispness and freshness of foods cooked in the 1% linolenic oil.

So consumers will now be able to enjoy healthier fried foods without sacrificing taste. Restaurants can save money because the new oil lasts longer in fryers so it can be replaced less often. Ag Pro will maintain the healthy benefits of the oil by using a mechanical process to squeeze the oil from the beans and a physical refining process rather than a chemical process as is used by most large-scale soy oil producers.

Demand for Ag Pro&apos;s new cooking oil is expected to spike when the FDA requires food labels in 2006 to indicate the trans fat content. Farmers are gearing up for demand. Jim Jensen a farm business management specialist at Iowa State University expects the amount of 1% linolenic soybeans planted to more than triple from 30,000 acres in 2004 to 100,000 in 2005.

Ag Pro, Ltd located in Massena, New York processes specialty and organic oilseeds (http://www.agprosoy.com, phone 315-764-5611). Innovative Growers is an association of Iowa soybean farmers (http://www.innovativegrowers.com)

Jeff “The Grillman” Tufts Celebrates Snow with Winter Grilling Tips

 With more than 10 years of experience and over 7,000 customers ranging from South Boston to the Cape, the folks at Grillman Propane are experts on Propane cooking and other gas related products. 

EASTON, MA (PRWEB) February 10, 2005 -- When there’s six inches of snow on the ground, what do you shovel first? A path to the garage or a path to the grill? At Grillman Propane, Jeff “The Grillman” Tufts naturally says the grill, as great food takes precedence!

With more than 10 years of experience and over 7,000 customers ranging from South Boston to the Cape, the folks at Grillman Propane are experts on Propane cooking and other gas related products.

Tufts, owner of the Easton, Mass. based company, shares his winter grilling tips with hardy New England grillin’ enthusiasts.

·First step is shoveling that path to the grill. Second is checking to make sure you have enough propane.
·Preheat the grill to prevent the food from sticking to grates. Turn grill on high until the grill comes to temperature, which may take about 20 minutes in inclement weather. Then turn heat down to low to cook roasts, lamb, steaks, chicken, fish and vegetables.
·When grilling in the cold weather, the trick is to keep the grill covered. Peeking at the food allows heat to escape quickly and adds 5 to 10 minutes to your cooking time, each time you lift the lid.
·Some comfort foods ideal for winter grilling include squash, apples, pumpkin, leeks, brussel sprouts, potatoes, sweet potatoes, chestnuts, and onions.
·Want to warm your insides? How about adding a little Merlot wine steak sauce to that great cut of beef or spicing up your chicken with a Vidalia onion and Jalapeno pepper hot sauce? Remember, add sauce or glaze after the food is cooked and very briefly place meat or chicken on a low grill.
·Now you’re smokin’. Like that authentic wood smoke flavor? Pick up an iron smoking box and wood chips for your gas grill. A smoking box is affordable and instructions for use are included.
·O.K., so it’s begun to snow. Keep safety in mind and don’t shirk your grill cleaning duties. If you don’t burn the grease off the grill after each use, the grease builds up and makes the grill super hot, but doesn’t cook the food properly. Grease build-up can also cause a fire. Turn the heat to high, close the lid and leave for 10-15 minutes to burn the grease off the grill.

Tufts remarks, “Winter grilling is just as quick and easy as any other season. Grilling during a blizzard requires some fortitude, but then again, we New Englanders are robust folk who like the challenge of the elements.”

Customer Service Software Identifies Repeat Offenders in Food Industry – Significant Possibilities for Other Industries

 Scottsdale, AZ Customer Service Software developers Lynk Software helps organizations achieve advanced database organization with their newly released version of Everest: Customer Focused Quality. 

Scottsdale, AZ (PRWEB) February 9, 2005 -– Customer Service Software developers Lynk Software helps organizations achieve advanced database organization with their newly released version of Everest: Customer Focused Quality. One of the key features added to the new version of Everest is duplicate account look-up. This is proving to offer some unique benefits. Originally designed for the purpose of helping the food industry identify “repeat offenders,” (consumers filing multiple complaints in order to receive free product), many other industries and organizations find themselves celebrating the feature for its organizational benefits.

The duplicate account feature immediately identifies customers already in the database, either by name, address or phone number. Organizations such as banks and retailers are finding that the feature supports customer service representatives in their goal of entering the same customer only once and adding additional complaints to the existing record as needed.

“Customer service representatives are known for dealing with multiple calls in short periods of time. Undertaking an extensive database search for existing records was time-consuming, and therefore difficult, due to other calls needing immediate attention. This feature allows customer service representatives to do their jobs quickly and efficiently,” reports Michael Herzog of Lynk Software.

One bank manager exclaimed, “In the past a new record would be created for each complaint, even when the customer was calling from the same household. Now, the inquiry or complaint is easily added to the existing record.”

This feature provides an opportunity for organizations to collect more accurate data for utilization in their quality improvement and customer service efforts, as well as helping the food industry manage their specific customer service requirements.

About Us
Lynk Software is an industry leader in the field of customer complaint management and customer service software. Their flagship product Everest: Customer Focused Quality is used by some of the nation’s largest organizations. Lynk Software was founded in 1970 and has been on the cutting edge of business software development.

Tungsten Branding Names New Coffee House Concept

 Tungsten, a national branding firm, names Joe Ricos, a new coffee house concept set to open in Houston, Texas 

(PRWEB) February 8, 2005 -- When entrepreneur Mark Mohr set out to open his new coffee business, he knew it would be different and he wanted a name to reflect that uniqueness. To capture the sense of organic origins, authentic ingredients and search for adventure, he turned to Tungsten Brand Marketing, (http://PureTungsten.com) a naming consultancy with credentials that include PODS, (Portable On Demand Storage), and the new TeamLogicIT franchise launched by FranServ; the company that created Sir Speedy and PIP Printing.

The final result? Joe Ricos Coffee and Tea.

&quot;The &apos;Joe&apos; portion of the name refers to the American slang for coffee and the &apos;Rico&apos; is Spanish for &apos;rich&apos;, so you basically have &apos;rich coffee&apos;&quot;, states Phil Davis, president of the naming firm. &quot;But beyond providing a clever meaning, it conveys the sense of adventure and wanderlust that is &apos;Joe&apos;. In that capacity, he will be the imaginary traveler who discovers these exotic brews and brings them home. It&apos;s Marco Polo meets Indiana Jones, and the look of the stores will reflect that feel.&quot;

When asked how his new coffee concept would differ from existing ones, Mohr replied, &quot;Unlike Starbucks, we&apos;re going to bake our muffins, bagels and scones fresh daily, in our micro bakery. And where Starbucks has gone to automated processes, we have chosen instead to use the proven old world methods of hand crafting our coffee drinks, using fair trade, organic, artisan coffee beans and teas. In addition, we will staff fully trained baristas who will custom make our drinks.&quot;

What also separates the Joe Rico concept is the wide offering. &quot;We&apos;ll be serving 100% real fruit smoothies- which allows us to offer a certified Koser product. Our base commitment is to utilize organic, Kosher and fair trade products because we believe it&apos;s possible to deliver a flavorful, fully natural beverage while benefiting small, co-op type farmers. The fair trade designation helps us to protect the integrity of the small coffee and tea growers throughout the world. It&apos;s part of what Joe Ricos is all about.&quot;

The new store is set to open mid March 2004 with a second store already planned to follow. Franching is also under consideration. But for now, Mohr is excited about the immediate future and the potential niche that Joe Ricos will serve. &quot;We&apos;re glad to have a name that embodies the essence of what this company is about... authenticity, adventure and commitment to our global community.&quot;

 Alex Avery, Director of Research at the Center for Global Food Issues, has written to the National Organic Program at the United States Department of Agriculture, asking why they are misleading farmers, consumers, and policy makers about the status of organic crops that test positive for biotech-derived crop material, and whether they’re doing it deliberately. 

Alex Avery, Director of Research at the Center for Global Food Issues, has written to the National Organic Program at the United States Department of Agriculture, asking why they are misleading farmers, consumers, and policy makers about the status of organic crops that test positive for biotech-derived crop material, and whether they’re doing it deliberately.

The USDA’s rules clearly state that so called “GM contamination” will not affect the organic status of a crop or farm. In fact, the USDA admitted in a December 2004 letter to the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture that not a single crop or farmer has ever lost “organic” status based on so-called “GM contamination.”

In answering this question on their website, however, the NOP misquotes USDA rules and adds unnecessary and confusing language: “The unintentional presence of the products of excluded methods will not affect the status of the organic operation. As to the status of the commodity, USDA’s position is that this is left to the buyer and seller to resolve in the marketplace through their contractual relationship. (See page 80556 of the preamble, “Applicability—Clarifications; (1) “Genetic drift”).” http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/Q&amp;A.html;

The cited section of the organic regulations actually states, “the unintentional presence of the products of excluded methods should not affect the status of an organic product or operation.” http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards/ApplicPre.html The rules say nothing about commodity status being left to buyer and seller to resolve.

After repeated phone calls and emails to the NOP, a public affairs spokeswoman emailed the following clarification to the Center for Global Food Issues: “According to USDA and the regulation, the crop status IS NOT adversely affected. But buyers and sellers in the market may have agreements; USDA does not enforce or intervene in private contracts under the National Organic Program. Also, the National Organic Program does not have a tolerance level for GMOs (like for chemical residues) at which food may no longer be sold as organic, and the preamble says the absence of this tolerance level does NOT create a zero tolerance.”

The NOP office has refused suggestions to correctly quote their own rules or to add a clarification to their website, thereby allowing the confusion to continue.

For years, organic activists have misled reporters and the public on this issue, helping them gather public support for local-level biotech crop bans such as the one passed in Mendocino California last year. The question is why the USDA is adding to the deliberate organic industry confusion?

Flor de Sal USA Announces Agreement with Market 2 Market, Inc. to Represent Their Products in the Pacific Northwest

 Flor de Sal USA, exclusive importer and distributor of Necton SA’s Flor de Sal and Sal Marinho Tradicional, hand–harvested salts of Portugal, is announcing their agreement with Market 2 Market to represent their products in the Pacific Northwest. Market 2 Market will serve as the exclusive brokerage firm in the states of Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Alaska. 

Seattle, WA (PRWEB) February 8, 2005 -- “Market 2 Market’s long-standing presence in the marketplace and industry contacts made them an easy choice to represent us in the marketplace. The stable of products they have chosen to represent to their customers matches the quality and excellence of our own,” says Brian Batts, Managing Partner, Flor de Sal USA.

“Our clients look to us to provide them with the newest in artisanal, specialty products, and more frequently gourmet salts. We believe we’ve found a product that meets the unique needs of our gourmet and specialty clients and are looking forward to presenting these products to them,” says Cheryl Hofer, Owner, Market 2 Market.

About Necton&apos;s Gourmet Sea Salt Products:
After the winter rains have ceased, and the birds have begun their journeys back north, the salt pans (salinas) of the Belamandil, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the European coastline, are ready to be harvested. During the summer months, weather permitting -- an absence of rainfall and a dry wind from the north -- the salinas are worked by local artisans, salt harvesters (marnotos). The marnotos, on a daily basis, skim the delicate crystals forming on the top of the salt pan by hand, with the same wooden implements that have been used for millennia. The resulting brilliantly white sea salt -- Flor de Sal – literally &quot;the flower of salt&quot; – also known as Fleur de Sel - is a light, crumbly, melt-in-the-mouth salt that maintains all the micronutrients naturally found in ocean water and has been described by many as having hints of sweetness and creaminess, without any of the harshness commonly associated with regular table salt.

Necton’s Traditional Sea Salt (Sal Marinho Tradicional), similar to Flor de Sal, is harvested by hand, but only after the salt crystals have settled on the bottom of the salina. Every three weeks, the marnotos, using similar implements and techniques as with Flor de Sal, exercise great care in harvesting Sal Marinho Tradicional. These crystals, along with Flor de Sal, are placed in piles beneath the Algarve sun, where they are naturally dried, and then sent off for packaging, with no additional processing taking place.

About Flor de Sal USA
Located in Seattle, WA, Flor de Sal USA was started in the summer of 2004 with the goal of bringing Necton’s award winning salts to the U.S. marketplace, with plans to work directly with Necton to develop additional nature-based products which spring forth from the salt pans of the Ria Formosa Natural Park in southern Portugal.

About Market 2 Market
Started in 1999, Market 2 Market is one of the premier brokerage firms in the northwest for gourmet and specialty foods. In addition to Belamandil Flor de Sal and Sal Marinho Tradicional, Market 2 Market represents such well known gourmet brands as Stonewall Kitchens, Republic of Tea and El Paso Chile Company. Market 2 Market prides themselves on their ability to identify gourmet and specialty trends in the marketplace and select the perfect stable of brands to represent to their distribution and retail customers in the Northwest.

City Tavern introduces new menu

 Incorporates mix of steaks and chops with trademark seafood 
 In a town where steaks and barbeque dominate the menus of most restaurants, City Tavern has crafted a niche by offering a variety of steaks, chops, oysters and seafood. 

Kansas City, MO (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) February 7, 2005 -- In a town where steaks and barbeque dominate the menus of most restaurants, City Tavern has crafted a niche by offering a variety of steaks, chops, oysters and seafood. The restaurant’s new menu maintains that tradition, but it also provides guests with more options when they are craving filets and strips.

Boasting a menu featuring the world’s best seafood, steaks and chops, City Tavern is nestled in a rustic building where art is now served – in the parking lot, on the plates and amid the historic architectural features. Adorned with dark reclaimed woodwork, exposed brick walls, antique light fixtures and vintage mirrors, the restaurant looks like it could have been there for a century, though its’ doors opened in this new millennium. That is exactly what Dan Clothier intended when his vision was finally fulfilled.

Situated between the highly regarded Lidia’s and Fiorella’s Jack Stack Barbeque, City Tavern represents the final element of a bustling entertainment spot Clothier imagined when he teamed with a group of investors to buy a dilapidated former railroad warehouse near the Kansas City Union Station in 1995. Today, his restaurant is part of a culinary destination that is known as the Freight House, which is the centerpiece of eclectic district lined with art galleries and refurbished 19th century buildings. In 2003 Gourmet magazine included all three Freight House restaurants in its Guide to America’s Best Restaurants, three out of just six restaurants listed in Kansas City.

More than two years after City Tavern first opened, the restaurant is brimming with a dinner crowd on a weekday night. Tables are dotted with oysters from the Pacific Northwest and North Atlantic; appetizers like tuna tartare and steamed mussels in shellfish broth; and entrees that include sea scallops with Chinese mustard glaze, Campo Lindo chicken, Alma Farms boneless pork chops with rosemary apples, and a dry aged Kansas City Strip with au poivre sauce. City Tavern has developed a following of loyal patrons who savor its selections of seafood dishes and creative preparations of duck, chicken, pork and beef entrees.

Word is spreading about City Tavern, in a favorable way, which is soothing to Clothier’s ears. Just as he encountered obstacles when it appeared the Freight House could not be revitalized, Clothier was confronted with another hurdle not long after his restaurant debuted in September, 2002. The original executive chef, who had previously owned and operated a four-star restaurant in Kansas City, developed a high-end, a la carte menu for City Tavern, with price points that exceeded $50 for dinner and $25 for lunch, despite the fact that the original business plan called for check averages more in the $35 and $15 range.

“We quickly learned that our customer base didn’t embrace our concept,” said Clothier, a real estate developer from Wichita who has a house in his hometown and an apartment in Kansas City. “So we hired a new chef, by promoting our sous chef, and changed our menu to a bistro style menu better suited to the new chef and to our patrons.”

With prices and cuisine that was more palatable for the restaurant’s customer base, City Tavern sales stabilized. The new chef, whose cuisine had also garnered four stars from the Kansas City Star food critic at a previous restaurant, immediately made his mark by simplifying dishes and broadening the menu to include shellfish, fish, lamb, duck, steaks and chops. Befitting the menu’s bistro style, sides and starches were added to create complete plate choices for diners and prices were lowered. Guests were pleased.

Combined with curiosity about the new menu, the ambience, which reflects Clothier’s passion for historic preservation, is a major factor in luring guests back to City Tavern. The restaurant’s interior is enlivened with salvaged pieces of structures that stood in Kansas City years ago. The 7,500-square-foot space includes 30-foot timbered ceilings, exposed brick walls, high-arched doorways and windows, Missouri marble atop the oyster bar, restored terra cotta and handmade tiles adorning the walls, and a heart of pine floor.

Clothier saw a drastically different picture when Sterling Capital acquired the building in 1995. Built in 1887 by a railroad company, the 500 foot long and 40 foot wide Freight House was a leaky eyesore that was destined for the wrecking ball until Clothier and his team of investors bought it and initially envisioned a restaurant, retail and office center with a hotel and parking garage. When plans for that complex were dashed, a marketing study was conducted and the results determined that the Freight House would be ideal as a destination of three restaurants.

To add to the growing community of artists and art galleries in the neighborhood, now known as the Crossroads Arts District, Clothier commissioned homegrown artists to transform the Freight House’s spacious parking lot, which borders the railroad tracks, into a haven for public art – an appropriate move for a district now known for its boutique art galleries. Even the parking lot lights are works of art – reminiscent of train signals with patterns of incandescent lights arranged in varying degrees of animation. The Freight House is a centerpiece of the Crossroads Arts District, which is now home to more than forty art galleries located within a few blocks of the Freight House.

Clothier also enticed celebrity chef Lidia Bastianich to open her first restaurant outside of New York City. Lidia’s Kansas City, which serves Northern Italian cuisine, opened in October, 1998. Fiorella’s Jack Stack Barbeque, owned by Jack Fiorella, debuted in October 2000, leaving space for one more location. Clothier, whose favorite dining destinations included seafood eateries in New York City and San Francisco, decided to open his own oyster bar and seafood restaurant in an atmosphere that illustrated Kansas City’s rich railroad heritage, defined by the nearby Kansas City Union Station, which was recently renovated and now houses a science center, shops and cafes. The Freight House is an instrumental part of Kansas City’s downtown renaissance, which will continue when a walkway from the Union Station to the Freight House is constructed.

“What we have is more than a group of restaurants; this is a destination,” said Clothier, who earned an undergraduate degree in history and a law degree from Kansas University. “It’s a place where pieces of old Kansas City live on, and where the new Kansas City thrives.”

L’Academie de Cuisine Announces Major Expansion

 The grand opening of the new 6,000 square foot expansion to L’Academie de Cuisine will feature a dedication to Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier. 

(PRWEB) February 7, 2005 -- L’Academie de Cuisine, a professional culinary school in Gaithersburg, Maryland, announced today that they will be hosting a March 6 grand opening reception and dedication for the school’s new expansion. The expansion, which nearly doubles the 7,000 square foot space, will be celebrated with an open house for chefs, alumni and friends and a dedication of the new pastry arts kitchen to Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier, who served as White House Executive Pastry Chef for 25 years.

State-of-the-art culinary and pastry chef kitchens, a demonstration/lecture classroom, offices and a new commissary are included in the expanded space. “The new classrooms will allow us to maintain small class size and personal attention to the students,” said L’Academie de Cuisine’s Founder and Director, Francois Dionot.

Brian Ross, Head Instructor in the Culinary Arts Training Program, added that the extra space will allow L’Academie to increase the scope of their curriculum without changing the basic structure of hands-on instruction in classic French techniques that has made them a premier culinary school.

Mesnier, who retired from the White House in November, developed L’Academie de Cuisine’s pastry chef arts program in 1979. He continued to teach the program until 1988. Dionot praised Mesnier for his years of dedication to the school and the industry. “Roland’s devotion to French pastry chef techniques and his desire to educate others has been an inspiration for our students.”

The school, located just outside of Washington, DC combines American sensibilities with modern French classic techniques to provide a solid foundation for a culinary career. Certificates in the culinary and pastry arts are offered.

The new kitchen classrooms will allow L’Academie to expand their professional training programs to four sessions throughout the year. The nationally accredited Career Training Programs will be held in January, April, July and October. They also offer culinary trips to France and recreational cooking classes for the amateur pastry chef or home cook.

About L’Academie de Cuisine:
Francois Dionot opened L’Academie de Cuisine in 1976 as a small, private school where students could learn classic French pastry chef techniques and become skilled professionals in the culinary world. L’Academie has grown to be the premier culinary school in the Washington, DC region and is recognized as one of the finest culinary schools in the nation. It received an International Association of Culinary Professionals Award of Excellence for Cooking Schools in 1997.

Applications for the April 2005 and July 2005 Culinary and Pastry Chef Arts programs, as well as schedules and financial aid information are available by visiting the school’s website at www.LAcademie.com. Special tours may be scheduled by calling 1-800-664-2433

In the U.S., Chocolate Candy is Dandy

 Universal Popularity, Growing Gourmet Appeal Defining the Market, According to New Report 
 Americans’ obsession with premium chocolate goes well beyond the red boxes that—as a means of self preservation in some cases—get frantically snapped up nationwide this time of year, according to &quot;The U.S. Market for Chocolate: Chocolate Bars, Bagged Chocolates and Gourmet Chocolate,&quot; a new market research report by publisher Packaged Facts. According to the report, 67% of U.S. adults eat chocolate candy and it’s become so universally popular that no single demographic grouping stands out as having higher-than-average consumption rates. 

New York (PRWEB) February 7, 2005 -- Americans’ obsession with premium chocolate goes well beyond the red boxes that—as a means of self preservation in some cases—get frantically snapped up nationwide this time of year, according to &quot;The U.S. Market for Chocolate: Chocolate Bars, Bagged Chocolates and Gourmet Chocolate,&quot; a new market research report by publisher Packaged Facts. According to the report, 67% of U.S. adults eat chocolate candy and it’s become so universally popular that no single demographic grouping stands out as having higher-than-average consumption rates.

Even more striking, according to Packaged Facts, is the fact that in terms of dollar gains, gourmet chocolate is quickly gaining wide acceptance and posting strong growth in the marketplace. Over the 2000-2004 period, for example, the Lindt gourmet chocolate brand ranked second only to Hershey in dollar sales gains, with $46.8 million in growth to Hershey’s $139.4 million.

The report adds that since gourmet chocolate consumers are less likely to indulge in non-healthy treats in general, they make it count when they do. As a result, product introductions and sales of premium sweets are on the rise. In addition, the premium market is being bolstered by an onslaught of small marketers introducing organic and exotic boutique candies and research indicating that chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, may have health benefits.

&quot;Chocolate as health food has almost a fantasy quality,&quot; said Don Montuori, Acquisitions Editor for Packaged Facts. &quot;But in fact, functional chocolates are hitting store shelves in record numbers, and if you believe the labels, these sweets will help alleviate PMS symptoms, increase energy, boost levels of omega-3 fatty acids, and add to your fiber intake.&quot;

&quot;The U.S. Market for Chocolate: Chocolate Bars, Bagged Chocolates and Gourmet Chocolate&quot; presents comprehensive sales and growth potential data along with insight into marketing and new product trends, industry players, and demographic preferences.

Harvest Food Service Equipment Opens New Online Store Aimed at the Gourmet Cook and the Professional Chef

 Harvest Food Service Equipment&apos;s new store carries the fine Mauviel line of Normandy copper, stainless and non-stick aluminum cookware, Bron Coucke slicers, Kranpouz crepe griddles and much more. Prices are right and include shipping! 

(PRWEB) February 6, 2005 -- My name is Ira Fink and I have been in the food service industry for nearly 35 years now. My first 32 years were in the food end of the industry, operating my family&apos;s restaurants and then as president of a food service management company that I founded. After selling the food service businesses I began a service that creates and manages auctions of used restaurant equipment on eBay for local dealers. I also opened an eBay store selling new food service equipment for a dealer.

After three years of running this service, my largest client merged with another company and no longer wishes to pursue selling used equipment on eBay. Not one to be daunted by adverse developments, I decided to create my own internet store selling top quality equipment aimed at the gourmet cook and the professional chef. http://www.harvestfoodserviceequipment.com was born!

Harvest Food Service Equipment features top quality Mauviel cookware, Eurodib meat slicers, Bron Coucke slicers, Krampouz crepe griddles and more; all at very good prices. I have even included the shipping cost into the prices of the items so there are no surprises when you get to the checkout!

Most orders are shipped within 48 hours of payment and items are shipped from the manufacturer’s authorized distributors directly to you. We ship to all of Canada and the continental U.S. Payments are accepted through the convenience and safety of PayPal and we also accept certified checks and money orders.

I’ve had 35 years of success in the food service industry and, judging by the startup business that http://www.harvestfoodserviceequipment.com has already generated, it looks like I have many more successful years to go.

Puget Sound Foods, Inc. Announces Major Expansion of Their Market Naturals™ Product Line

 Puget Sound Foods, Inc. February 4, 2005 announces a major expansion of their All-Natural Market Naturals™ brand to include New Sauces, Spice Blends and Grilling Planks. 

Mercer Island, WA, (PRWEB) February 6, 2005 -- Puget Sound Foods, Inc. February 4, 2005 announces a major expansion of their All-Natural Market Naturals™ brand to include New Sauces, Spice Blends and Grilling Planks.

“Our Market Naturals™ brand features Seafood oriented products developed with the World Famous Fishmongers from Seattle’s Pike Place Market,” says John Lettengarver, President&amp;C.E.O. “We introduced this new line last year and because of its success we are quickly expanding our offering.” He added. “Puget Sound Foods now offers Wild Smoked Canned Salmon, Sauces, Spice Blends and Grilling Planks. We are becoming a one stop shop for your seafood related products with a great brand franchise!”

Puget Sound Foods products are All-Natural, Preservative Free, Shelf Stable featuring flavors and fresh ingredients from the Pacific Northwest. Their versatile sauces and spice blends compliment fresh seafood. The new sauces include Alder Smoked Walla Walla Onion Tartar Sauce, Wasabi Cocktail Sauce and Horseradish Sauce. The new line of Spice Blends includes Northwest Seafood Seasoning, Clam&amp;Mussel Boil, Salmon Basting Sauce and Our Own Rub. The new Grilling Planks line up is available in various sizes and feature Red Cedar, Alder and Maple Wood.

Cooking on a wood plank has been a Northwest tradition for centuries. The fragrance of the wood imparts a wonderful flavor as the aroma fills the air. Grilling on wood is a unique, natural and healthy way of cooking. The organic, porous surface absorbs moisture when soaked in water prior to cooking and gives off that moisture with smoky flavor in the barbeque, oven or pit. Foods cooked on planks are juicier and more flavorful and less prone to nutrient loss. These planks are a very special way to cook seafood as well as meat, poultry and vegetables. Puget Sound Foods products are very versatile, easy to use and really compliment each other. For example, cooking fresh salmon seasoned with Northwest Seafood Seasoning then basted with Alder Smoked Walla Walla Onion Tartar, grilled on an Alder Wood Grilling Plank gives you a meal that is simple to create and spectacular in taste.

Headquartered in Mercer Island, Washington, Puget Sound Foods produces its Market Naturals, Gourmet Naturals and Captain Toady’s brands and sells it through its distribution network in select markets across North America. A leader in the premium all natural, shelf stable products Puget Sound Foods is known for its innovative labeling, marketing and great tasting products.

Milk is Milk Blog Addresses Harmful Demands from Grocers, Food Companies and Activist Groups

 Non-profit education campaign on misleading milk and dairy marketing warns consumers about marketing and activist scams. 

Churchville, VA (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) February 4, 2005 –- This week “Milk is Milk” Blog author Alex Avery addresses unquantifiable “consumer demand” often cited by food companies and activists seeking to force production restrictions on farmers from whom they buy milk and cheese. A disturbing trend among such groups finds dairy farmers face to face with mandates to abandon safe, scientifically tested animal health and productivity practices like antibiotics used to treat mastitis or supplemental somatotropin (rbST) to help boost productivity.

Avery contends limiting the tools farmers have to safety produce affordable milk for black marketing schemes and other activist political agendas creates a downward spiral in the market place causing an increased costs and reduced demands for dairy products. Avery takes a detailed look at the tactics of these groups revealing a cycle of costly and never-ending demands by activists and a resulting black marketing by a growing number that falsely disparages some dairy products and misleads consumers about the safety of milk. As a result, Avery claims farmers suffer economic damage while consumers pay more and consume less dairy products.

The Center for Global Food Issues “Milk is Milk” consumer education campaign Blog has created a buzz among the dairy industry and continues to draw significant traffic from media, industry experts and farmers during its first month of existence. Read Alex’s latest entry at http://www.milkismilk.com/blog.htm.

Jill Melton Named Editor-in-Chief of Cooking Smart Magazine

 Coincide Publishing announced that Jill Melton, MS RD, has been named Editor-In-Chief of Cooking Smart magazine, effective immediately. Melton served as Consulting Editor for the magazine&apos;s premiere issue. 

Scottsdale, AZ (PRWEB) February 4, 2005 -- Coincide Publishing announced that Jill Melton, MS RD, has been named Editor-In-Chief of Cooking Smart magazine, effective immediately. Melton served as Consulting Editor for the magazine&apos;s premiere issue.

As Editor-in-Chief, Melton will be responsible for the editorial content and overall direction of the magazine. &quot;I&apos;m a dietitian and a foodie. I grew up with my nose in cookbooks and cooking magazines, cooked my way through school, and then became a registered dietitian,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s a rare combination, but one that makes me uniquely qualified to head up a magazine about smart eating.&quot;

Melton started her publishing career in 1989, when she joined Cooking Light magazine as Assistant Food Editor. By the time of her 2004 departure, she had spent 10 years as the Senior Editor/Food Editorial Director of the magazine.

&quot;Jill&apos;s knowledge of food and nutrition, combined with her experience in the marketplace and understanding of our readers&apos; needs, is remarkable,&quot; says Kyle Cox, Publisher of Cooking Smart. &quot;She has a flair for putting together features that are timely, relevant, distinctive and personable, and we&apos;re delighted to have her on board.&quot;

Melton began her career by spending three years as a soups chef, then worked as both a public health nutritionist and nutrition consultant for several years before her tenure at Cooking Light.

Her editorial philosophy is simple. &quot;Individual foods aren&apos;t right or wrong, and styles of eating aren&apos;t right or wrong -- but some are smarter than others,&quot; says Melton, who adds that her main goal is to get readers in the kitchen. &quot;I find it sad that our culture promotes the notion that the less time in the kitchen, the better. Personally, I think there&apos;s no better place than the kitchen to connect with family, friends or yourself.&quot;

Cooking Smart magazine takes a positive approach to eating well, realizing that good nutrition used to just mean taking things out: fat, calories, sodium. Today, however, good nutrition is about what you can add to get the most out of your foods. This approach is manifested in the magazine&apos;s DietMatch™ feature, a tool to help people customize recipes for their particular needs. &quot;Eating should not be about deprivation, but instead emphasize balance, variety, moderation and good taste -- though not necessarily in that order,&quot; says Melton. &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m most looking forward to sharing with readers.&quot;

Jill Melton is a longtime member of several professional organizations, including the American Dietetic Association, and the International Association of Culinary Professionals. She also served on the Nutrition Committee for the American Heart Association from 1986 to 1993.

She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in home economics with a major in general dietetics from Ohio State University at Columbus; and a Master of Science degree in public health nutrition from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Melton lives in Birmingham, Alabama, with her husband and two children.

Some Valentine Chocolates are Healthier Than Others

 Chocolate itself is actually a healthy food. In moderation, chocolate can contribute to heart health, help you live longer, suppress a chronic cough, add needed magnesium to your diet, and help regulate your blood sugar. 

Clearwater, FL (PRWEB via Articlecity) February 3, 2005 -- Chocolate itself is actually a healthy food. In moderation, chocolate can contribute to heart health, help you live longer, suppress a chronic cough, add needed magnesium to your diet, and help regulate your blood sugar. And, chocolate gives you those good &quot;in love&quot; feelings. But many chocolates contain added ingredients that can harm your health...including a large amount of refined white sugar, pesticides, and even lead.

&quot;Fortunately, this Valentine&apos;s Day healthier chocolates are widely available in stores and on-line,&quot; says consumer advocate Debra Lynn Dadd, author of Home Safe Home and creator of Debra&apos;s List, an online directory of 100s of links to 1000s of healthy and eco-friendly products. &quot;There are more healthy chocolates than ever before. These chocolates are delicious, easy to find, and affordable.&quot;

According to Dadd, it&apos;s easy to choose healthy chocolates.

* Choose chocolates with a minimum amount of refined white sugar. Dark &quot;bittersweet&quot; chocolates with a high percentage of cocoa solids (usually the label will state the exact percentage) have less sugar than semisweet or milk chocolate and also have the greatest health benefits.

* Choose chocolates sweetened with evaporated cane juice or barley malt. Evaporated cane juice--the unprocessed whole juice of the cane--acts in the body like a whole food and doesn&apos;t give a sugar rush. Barley malt is also a slow-release sweetener, noted on the label as &quot;grain-sweetened.&quot;

* Choose organic chocolates. Certified organic chocolate ensures there are no harmful pesticide residues. These also don&apos;t contain lead.

* Choose quality over quantity. If you are going to eat chocolate, eat really good chocolate, and savor every bite. Give the chocolate your full attention and let it melt in your mouth to prolong the experience.

&quot;You can also make your own chocolates,&quot; says Dadd. &quot;It&apos;s easy to make many chocolate delights yourself, with the exact healthy ingredients you like. Start with unsweetened cocoa powder or baking chocolate and add the sweetener of your choice.&quot;

This Valentine&apos;s Day, choose a healthy chocolate, and enjoy it without guilt.

The First Compostable Logo for Cutlery Goes on NAT-UR® Utensils

 The NAT-UR® biodegradable plastic cutlery has just received another international honor. The Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) this week granted its first &quot;Compostable Logo&quot; to NAT-UR, Inc. for compostable utensils. NAT-UR® utensils are made of NAT-UR resin which incorporates NatureWorks PLA™. The BPI’s symbol demonstrates that NAT-UR’s cutlery meets ASTM D6400 “Specifications for Compostable Plastics”. 

(PRWEB) February 3, 2005 -- &quot;We are very pleased to be the first cutlery in the USA to carry the Compostable Logo, it has been a long search and a cooperative effort with ours suppliers and others. NAT-UR utensils offer a convenient, durable and responsible alternative for everyday use by consumers,” said Frederic Scheer, President and CEO, NAT-UR, Inc. “The cutlery provides more than just the performance and durability desired in flatware, it competes on price and will not deplete the earth’s limited resources like traditional, petroleum-based disposable serviceware.” The combination of higher costs for fossil fuels and the use of natural components makes NAT-UR® utensils competitive to conventional disposable plastic cutlery.

The BPI symbol will be used on all NAT-UR&apos;s utensils made including its forks, spoons, knives, and sporks of various sizes. NAT-UR utensils can be used like traditional plastic food service items but offer the benefit of being based on renewable resources and as well as being can be compostable. NAT-UR’s newest entries complement the company’s already extensive line of BPI approved food service containers and compostable bags.

“I am committed to using biobased raw materials wherever possible,” added Scheer. NAT-UR’s food serviceware are made with NAT-UR® resins which incorporate NatureWorks PLA™ resin manufactured by Cargill Dow using corn grown in the United States. The new utensils were tested by a third party laboratory for its biobased content using radiocarbon dating. The results confirmed that the products are biobased with content in excess of 95% and NAT-UR, Inc. is an active member of the Biobased Manufacturer Association.

The Compostable Logo is a joint effort between the U.S. Composting Council and the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) to identify plastic products which are designed to biodegrade satisfactorily in municipal and commercial composting systems, as do leaves, grass and food scraps. Before a manufacturer can receive the BPI symbol, it must provide data from an approved, independent laboratory that their products meet the specifications in ASTM D6400. This assures that the products will disintegrate and biodegrade quickly during composting and not leave behind any toxic residues or plastic fragments. Further, the data must be reviewed by knowledgable third party scientists to assure conformance.

Steve Mojo, BPI Executive Director, anticipates the growing list of compostable will lead to savings in the composting industry. He said, &quot;We encourage composters, officials and end users to look for products that meet the ASTM specifications and carry the BPI symbol in order to maximize the benefits and demonstrate their cost effectiveness.&quot;

About NAT-UR, Inc. and its biodegradable packaging
NAT-UR’s innovative manufacturing process combines natural starch with other biodegradable materials to produce packaging that are 100% biodegradable and compostable. And unlike so-called “degradable plastic,” NAT-UR products do not use polyethylene or polystyrene and do not leave any plastic residue. When composted, NAT-UR packaging biodegrade completely into carbon dioxide, water and biomass in 30-60 days, just like food scraps and yard trimmings.

Composting organic waste has always been difficult, since all contaminants such as plastic utensils and polystyrene packaging must be first separated from the waste stream, a painstaking process that is usually too costly and labor intensive to make economic sense. NAT-UR products can be disposed along with leftover food in biodegradable trash bags that can be taken directly to a composting facility without expensive sorting.

NAT-UR is a leading provider of biodegradable packaging designed to meet the highest needs for sustainability. NAT-UR assists individuals, communities, schools, businesses and governments in finding innovative ways to reach sustainability in the use and disposal of biodegradable packaging, relying on organic material through sophisticated waste recovery systems. NAT-UR is involved in all levels of the supply and the recovery of sustainable packaging.

NAT-UR’s products include lawn and leaf bags, bin liners, and food serviceware such as cutlery, cups, straws, lids and plates. NAT-UR products are sold by large national chain such as Whole Foods Market. NAT-UR received the BPI logo for its line of biodegradable-compostable bags&amp;liners and its other food serviceware including cups&amp;food containers. NAT-UR is based in Los Angeles, California. More information is available at its website (www.nat-ur.com)

BPI is a multi-stakeholder group, involving people and organizations that produce, use or recover biodegradable plastic products. It promotes the growth of biodegradable plastics through education, use of scientifically-based standards and cooperative efforts with organizations in Europe and Asia.

Flor de Sal USA Announces the Launch of Their Private Label Program for Their Line of Flor de Sal and Sal Marinho Tradicional

 Flor de Sal USA, exclusive importer and distributor of Necton SA’s Flor de Sal and Sal Marinho Tradicional, hand–harvested salts of Portugal, is announcing the launch of their private label program. 

Seattle, WA (PRWEB) February 3, 2005 -- Working directly with Necton S.A. to package the product, Flor de Sal USA is now able to provide numerous options to retailers and manufacturers for packaging and labeling.

“We’re excited to be able to offer our fine salts to retailers and manufacturers who have worked hard to develop their brands in the marketplace. Hand-harvested, artisanal, natural sea salts are an easy extension to an existing line - boosting sales and increasing consumer loyalty to a brand. In a category like salt and seasonings, the difficulty is finding something that sets a product apart from the rest – something that truly adds value to a brand. That is, in part, why we believe this program offers so much value to potential customers,” said Brian Batts, Managing Partner of Flor de Sal USA.

About Necton&apos;s Gourmet Sea Salt Products:
After the winter rains have ceased, and the birds have begun their journeys back north, the salt pans (salinas) of the Belamandil, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the European coastline, are ready to be harvested. During the summer months, weather permitting -- an absence of rainfall and a dry wind from the north -- the salinas are worked by local artisans, salt harvesters (marnotos). The marnotos, on a daily basis, skim the delicate crystals forming on the top of the salt pan by hand, with the same wooden implements that have been used for millennia. The resulting brilliantly white sea salt -- Flor de Sal – literally &quot;the flower of salt&quot; – also known as Fleur de Sel - is a light, crumbly, melt-in-the-mouth salt that maintains all the micronutrients naturally found in ocean water and has been described by many as having hints of sweetness and creaminess, without any of the harshness commonly associated with regular table salt.

Necton’s Traditional Sea Salt (Sal Marinho Tradicional), similar to Flor de Sal, is harvested by hand, but only after the salt crystals have settled on the bottom of the salina. Every three weeks, the marnotos, using similar implements and techniques as with Flor de Sal, exercise great care in harvesting Sal Marinho Tradicional. These crystals, along with Flor de Sal, are placed in piles beneath the Algarve sun, where they are naturally dried, and then sent off for packaging, with no additional processing taking place.

About Flor de Sal USA
Located in Seattle, WA, Flor de Sal USA was started in the summer of 2004 with the goal of bringing Necton’s award winning salts to the U.S. marketplace, with plans to work directly with Necton to develop additional nature-based products which spring forth from the salt pans of the Ria Formosa Natural Park in southern Portugal.

Additional information on the program can be found at www.flordesal.net/merchant.htm, or by contacting Flor de Sal by phone at (206) 407-3882.

McGuffy Industries offers Ceramic Technology to Produce Dischargeable Water from Oily Waste -Reduces Waste Streams as much as 20 Times

 New Ceramic Filtration System Reduces Wastes Streams Up to 20 Times 

(PRWEB) February 2, 2005 -- For over 53 years McGuffy has been providing cost-saving solutions but technologies have improved faster than Lynn McGuffy could have ever have imagined. Hilco&apos;s Ceramic Membrane Filtration System can pay large dividends by eliminating water from waste or product streams using ultra filtration ceramic membranes.

The filtration system utilizes high-velocity fluid cross flow across the face of a ceramic membrane. The Membrane filter has over 1800 channels and is designed to channel out permeates while allowing the entire filter face to be utilized. The system is designed for 3 separate membranes - 0.2 microns, 0.01 microns or 0.005 microns.

The Membrane is durable, can handle a broad PH Range (from 2-13) and is immune to chlorine attack. Its compact design is engineered for thermal shock resistance, and the system is back flushable, preventing unwanted fluids from re-entering the system.

The filtration process leads to dischargeable water. Typical results from waste stream to permeate: OIL/GREASE 136 ppm to 1 ppm, Pb .79 to .09, Ni 0.15 to 0.01, Cu 1.49 to 0.36 and Zn 5.9 to 0.37.

Ideal applications include use as an intermediate filter or pre-filter for more expensive RO membranes, reduction of oily bilge wastes, reduction of process wastes or reduction of wash water wastes.

See how Ceramic Membrane Cross flow Filtration can reduce your waste and save disposal costs. Contact McGuffy to find solutions for fluid, air or gas contamination, noise reduction, explosion control or housings for Gas Turbines or Reciprocating Engines. Since 1952 McGuffy Industries, Inc. has been servicing Pipeline Transmittion, Power Generation, Petrochemical, Petroleum and Marine Industries.

2004 Another Banner Year for Kentucky BourbonQ

 Kentucky BourbonQ announces the barbecue awards received during the 2004 year. Awards include a 2004 Scovie Award, accepted internationally as the top award for spicy foods, and 1st&amp;2nd Place People&apos;s Choice Awards at the 2004 International Zesty Food Show 

PRWEB) February 2, 2005 -- With yet another strong showing in multiple arenas of barbecue competition, Louisville-based Kentucky BourbonQ has shown once again why their products are the “BEST!” Shane Best, president of the 20 year old company, continues to create international champions with his winning combination of all-natural ingredients and award-winning packaging. A 2004 Scovie Award and 1st and 2nd Place People’s Choice Awards at the International Zesty Food Show in Dallas, TX, are among the awards bestowed upon Kentucky BourbonQ in the year 2004. While the Scovie competition is widely accepted as the top award for hot and spicy foods internationally, Best is more proud of his sweep of the People’s Choice Awards in Dallas. As Best pointed out: “Recognition from internationally renowned food experts is of course flattering. But I’ve always been more tickled when we get feedback from the customers. To win both 1st and 2nd Place People’s Choice Awards at an international food show in Texas is one of my biggest accomplishments. Because, as we all know, Texans know good barbecue!”

The recent Scovie Award is not the first received by Kentucky BourbonQ; they also received the honor from the 2001 ballot.

Facile Flexitarian Fun — Panax Publishing Releases Next Generation Cookbook

 Unintimidating, user-friendly new cookbook makes healthy pasta dishes fun—for adults and kids alike 

Corona Del Mar, CA (PRWEB) February 1, 2005 -- Panax Publishing has announced the release of “Grazing on Pasta,” a new cookbook designed to help streamline the feeding process. Wholesome, gourmet-style, whimsical and user-friendly, “Grazing on Pasta” sets a new standard in cookbooks.

Author Shari Rae Noyes, who shuns deprivation, is quick to point out that healthier eating does not have to mean boring. “Think delectable variety,” she says, “Who wants to feel restricted—or eat something that tastes like cardboard?”

Flexitarian for Life
“Grazing” offers a fresh take on the traditional Mediterranean diet, praised (and re-praised) for its excellent effects on health and longevity. “Grazing’s” recipes are rich in olive oil and include a plethora of herbs and vegetables, nuts and modest amounts of poultry or seafood.

Flexitarianism, the post-modern term for a diet consisting primarily of plant-based foods with moderate amounts of animal foods, reflects the traditional diet of the Mediterranean and other areas—and a wisdom that science continues to validate. Earlier this month, Mediterranean staple olive oil again starred in media reports—this time for breast cancer prevention.

Sizing up the Book
“Grazing on Pasta” serves up recipes in a convenient, 8.5” x 5.5” format, with a maximum of 10 steps in each. Other features include:
• Variety—seafood, poultry and vegetable recipes keep life zesty.
• Enticement—each recipe sports a gorgeous, full-color photo.
• Fun—whimsical recipe titles range from “Monsters and Greens” to “Purple Cords on Neptune.”
• Help—”Grazing” offers a preparation timetable, menu suggestions, cooking tips, presentation ideas and a glossary.
• Wear-and-tear power—the entire book is printed on sturdy cover stock.
• Easy access—it self-stands (on a shelf or windowsill) or mounts on a wall.

Stay Tuned
“Grazing on Pasta” is the first installment in a series of six—all in the same friendly format. With a touch of irony, Noyes has titled her series “Grazing” because the word evokes an image of leisurely consuming food—a practice in which most of us are deficient. “Slow food,” she says, “is the way to go. Eating snake-style precludes proper digestion, while thorough chewing slows down consumption—which translates to stretching out one’s satisfaction more than one’s waistline.” Noyes also teaches that taking time to feed oneself well nourishes more than body: “It sends the subconscious a message of worthiness.”

&quot;Flexebitionist&quot; Author
Noyes has been developing flexitarian recipes for over 15 years. Primarily self-educated, she complemented her early experience with a 15-month sojourn in Italy, where she experienced firsthand the Mediterranean lifestyle.

Going &quot;Grazy&quot;
Panax Publishing is offering “Grazing on Pasta” (ISBN 0-9702973-0-0), priced at $29.95, on the Web. Named after a type of ginseng, known for its vigor-inducing properties, Panax’s immediate mission is to help improve the grazing experience—especially for those interested in healthier eating—by offering this new tool.

Snack Addicts Offer Tips for Super Bowl Snacking

 Taquitos.net&apos;s snack reviewers have rated more than 2400 different snacks, and they&apos;ve compiled a list of tips to help maximize your Super Bowl snacking experience. 

(PRWEB) February 1, 2005 -- Having trouble figuring out what snacks to serve guests at your Super Bowl party? Let the snacking experts at Taquitos.net help!

The snack tasters at the &quot;Crunchiest Site on the Interweb&quot; (www.taquitos.net) have tasted and reviewed more than 2400 varieties of potato chips, cheese puffs, pretzels, popcorn and other treats in their quest to find the best snacks on the planet. Just in time for Super Bowl Sunday, the site is offering a list of Super Bowl Snacking Tips that will make any party as reliable as an Adam Vinatieri field goal.

The full list of Super Bowl tips is online at:
http://www.taquitos.net/snacks.php?page_code=108

&quot;Just like the two teams on the field, if you don&apos;t think through your snacking game plan in advance, it could be a disaster,&quot; said Jeremy Selwyn, co-founder and Chief Snacks Officer at Taquitos.net.

&quot;One small slip-up (like serving anything labeled low-fat, low-carb or sugar-free) would be like Scott Norwood going wide right against the Giants,&quot; said Keith Shaw, the other co-founder and Taquitos.net&apos;s Secretary of Snacks.

Tips for a Super Snacker Bowl include banning vegetables (unless there&apos;s a big bowl of Ranch dressing to go along with them); trying out unique flavors like pickle chips or gravy-flavored potato chips; and forgetting about cooking anything. &quot;The only thing that should be cooked is the nacho cheese sauce that you want to pour over the tortilla chips,&quot; Shaw said.

About Taquitos.net
Taquitos.net (www.taquitos.net) is the world&apos;s most comprehensive snacking Web site, with more than 2,400 snack reviews, articles about snacking and other food obsessions. Created in 2000, the site has been featured on The Food Network, Newsweek, BusinessWeek, The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe and The New York Times.

To the press: Both Selwyn and Shaw are available for media interviews to discuss the Web site and all things snack-related.
