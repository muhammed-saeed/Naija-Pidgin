 January 18, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it by rockleysrock ( 6 reviews ) I believe its closed anyway..so good or bad, doesn&apos;t matter..they all closed in Ontario... June 30, 2010 Likes it Mississauga Fulton- Tenth Line and Thomas by Chris Gold ( 1 review ) To Alex H: Fulton opened the week before you went so the kinks still needed to be worked out I assume. Not everyone opens up perfectly and now their service is amazing. The REAL menu boards are now up. The staff is fully trained. As for portions, I found the portions to be plenty. The burgers took about 5 minutes but that is because they are being freshly cooked. They have some new awesome specials: 1) beef burger, fries&amp;fountain soda = $5.99 2) Crispy chicken sandwich, fries&amp;fountain soda = $5.99 3) All beef gourmet hot dog, fries&amp;fountain soda= $5.99 4) poutine and fountain soda = $4.99 ***Tip: the student specials are not only for students they will give it to ANYONE, so it is basically an everyone special. June 24, 2010 Likes it Fulton Burgers Rock - Tasty, Juicy and Fresh by Bobby ( 2 reviews ) I beleive that Alex H must have been turned down for a job that was available when Fulton&apos;s opened recently. Or he&apos;s on some great cheap pharmaceuticals that hinders his ability to evaluate what a true burger tastes like. Went to the Mississauga location at 5606 tenth Line W a couple of weeks back and the place was just packed. (noonish)Just awesome in service, and FOOOOOOOOD! Burgers are thick, plump, juicy (the sauce drips off the side of your face!). Bun was soft and warm. Fries were piping hot and crunchy and served with the usual fountain soda. Great deal going on (or at least was when I went there) that if you buy the burger, the fries and drink are free. (lunchtime only during the weekdays - think it was to get the High schoolers down the street to get addicted to this stuff!). Special I think applies only to normal burger. Others are normal priced though but well worth it. Try it and you&apos;ll get hooked. The service was effecient, friendly, and prompt but as the burgers are made FRESH to order, you may have to wait a couple of minutes. I just found my new favorite burger joint. Woo Hoo. Good food, good service, and NOT YET well known - just the way I like it. May 6, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Stay away. by Alex H ( 1 review ) I visited the Mississauga location last night for dinner around 8pm. I had a particularly bad experience that I would like to share. I have attached some photos of my food there. The service as particularly bad. The menu was so small, I had to lean over the counter to even read the menu. The font used is tiny to the point where the cashier was handing out Take Out menus for everyone to order from. While my cashier was competent in punching up my order, the time it took for me to actually receive my food was over 20 minutes. I waited over 20 minutes at a table for my food. There were those in front of me who ordered take out and waited just as long as I did. For a fast food restaurant, this isn&apos;t very fast. If you look in the pictures that I have attached, you will see my&quot;Long Island&quot;burger. Promised was Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Fulton special sauce.

If you look in the pictures that I have attached, you will see my&quot;Long Island&quot;burger. Promised was Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Fulton special sauce. I was not asked if I wanted any additional toppings but for some reason, I received two slices of tomato. The bacon in my burger was so thin that you can see through it, and for a $7.49 burger, I only got two strips of bacon. Very disappointing product from a restaurant who prides itself on making good hamburgers. If you take a look into the picture of my poutine, you will see how little Poutine there actually is. For$ 4.98, I could count the number of fries with my fingers. Compaing to other burger places, like Hero Burger, the portions you provide are exceptionally small and astoundingly expensive. Comparing to actual restaurants like Montana&apos;s, Kelsey&apos;s, Boston Pizza, and etc., I could have gotten a larger burger and a large plate of fries for $10.99. I would have been served by someone who seated me, and brought me my drinks. At the end of the night, $24.24 for two people is outrageously expensive when the quality and grade of the food is no better than the local Harveys, McDonalds, or Wendy&apos;s.
