Make it or buy it: Burgers
 
Fancy a takeaway burger and chips? Could you make it yourself for less or is it cheaper to buy it from a fast food restaurant? I&apos;ve been experimenting this week.
 By Frugalp 16/06/2011 08:55 
 Whether you&apos;re a fast food fan or a barbecue aficionado, many of us love a good juicy beef burger (or a veggie one). If you need a quick bite to eat after a night out, a burger and fries meal is still a popular choice. But how does a homemade beef burger compare and is it possible to make your own for the same price or less? As part of my &apos;make it or buy it&apos; challenge , I thought I&apos;d investigate for myself.

 

I also thought I&apos;d have a go at making my own burger baps using my bread-maker. To make the rolls, I put the following ingredients into the bread-maker, put it on the dough setting and waited until it was ready: 1 teaspoon of yeast, 500g of strong white bread flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 25g of butter, 2 tablespoons of milk powder, 1&amp;1/2 teaspoons of salt and 300 ml of water. The programme took just over 2 hours to do. After it was finished, I took out the dough and divided it into 8 and shaped each piece into baps. Then I left the baps for about 45 minutes to rise. You have to put it in a warm place, so my other half DJ suggested the greenhouse, which worked well!

 

When the baps had risen, I glazed them with some beaten egg and baked them in the oven at 220 degrees C (gas mark 7) for 15 minutes on a baking tray. They looked amazing when they came out of the oven, I must say. And the scent of them baking was really something else.

 

Next up were the burgers. Never having made my own burgers before, I decided to follow a popular Jamie Oliver burger recipe from his book Jamie&apos;s America and adapted it slightly. First, I fried three large chopped Portobello mushrooms in place of the 2 onions in his recipe and let them cool. Then I processed four slices of bread into breadcrumbs, added 500g of minced beef, the fried mushrooms, 1 teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of pepper, the remains of the beaten egg used to glaze the baps, a little water and mixed it all together. After that, I made five burgers from the mixture - it&apos;s supposed to make six but I was a bit greedy! - placed them on a plate with some olive oil and put them in the fridge for a bit.

 

When I was ready to cook them, I fried them for four or five minutes on each side in a pan and served them in the homemade baps with some fresh salad from the garden and some homemade potato wedges. To make the wedges, you cut up your potatoes length-ways (Maris Piper and King Edwards work well), throw them onto a baking tray, add salt&amp;pepper, dried herbs if you like and drizzle olive oil on them. Then you bake them in a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees C (gas mark 4) for 45 minutes, remembering to turn them half way through.

 

I have to say that I was taken aback by how delicious this burger meal was. The burgers were really tasty and the baps were soft and light. I&apos;m not sure I could go back to eating fast food versions after this. But how did the costs compare? Here&apos;s my breakdown:

 

Baps

1 teaspoon of yeast - 10p

500g of strong white bread flour - 23p

1 tablespoon of sugar - 2p

25g of butter - 12p

2 tablespoons of milk powder - 4p

1&amp;1/2 teaspoons of salt - 1p

Total for 8 baps: 52p

Each bap = 7p

 

Burgers

1 teaspoon salt - 1p

1 egg - 20p

3 portobello mushrooms - 79p

4 slices bread - 29p

500g minced beef -£3.29

1 teaspoon pepper - 1p

Olive oil - 30p

Total:£4.89p

Divided by 5 portions = 98p per burger

 

Potato wedges - 8p per portion

 

So each serving of homemade burger and chips cost£1.13p, excluding the cost of energy to cook it. I&apos;m amazed! In most fast food outlets, the equivalent meal would set me back much more than this and, in my opinion, not taste as good. On the downside, it wasn&apos;t exactly fast food and did produce a fair amount of washing up. Although, once the baps and burgers were made, it didn&apos;t take long to serve them. You could make them another day and freeze a batch to use when you&apos;ve had a busy day, for example.

 

Next week I&apos;ll be making my own toiletries and finding out if it&apos;s better value to do so or to buy them. Hope you&apos;ll join me then!

 

 Could a homemade burger and fries ever replace your fast-food favourite? Leave a message and let me know.

The point of the experiment, Flo, is to make as many of the ingredients as possible rather than just buying baps and burgers. The difficulty with making things yourself is that it does take longer than it would simply going to a takeout joint. Whether it&apos;s worth doing so is again up to the individual. Often the whole point of buying takeout food is that we don&apos;t want to cook! But it&apos;s interesting to see what the price comparison is.

Good point re the breadmaker, Andrew, but you could still make the dough without it.

Christine Hewitt (Flo Myself) 20/06/2011 07:45 It&apos;s not a relevant comparison as you didn&apos;t take into account the cost of your time, the power required and the cost of washing up. If people wanted a fast food burger they could buy a packet of burger, a packet of buns and put the two together far more quickly at far less cost than you have done. The same goes for your pizza comparison.

Often people use fast food outlets because they haven&apos;t the time or are far too tired after a days work to cook a meal. There are more factors in life to eating than the pure cost of food.

 Previous replies Write a reply... Andrew Denny 16/06/2011 10:13 With respect, Frugralp, you have an &apos;other half&apos;, a breadmaker and a greenhouse (amongst other things).  
 Would you mind repeating the test on the assumption that you live alone&amp;don&apos;t have those things? For example if you lived in a bedsit? (I&apos;ll allow a fridge, grill and oven/hob, but not a freezer, and certainly not a breadmaker). Also, include the assumption that you don&apos;t want to eat burgers &apos;n chips more than twice a week.  
 How much does the home-made burger come out at now? Include the cost of wasted ingredients as they turn up green and furry at the back of your fridge two weeks later :-) 
 I admit, though, that it makes me want to bust my£2/day dinner budget.  
 Thanks!
