 How to Deal with Nosy People 

Ever wonder why you keep finding people’s nose in your business?  Nosy people want to know what’s going on in your life because . . let’s face it, their life is lame.  So, join their pity party just feel sorry for them and hope they find their own happiness one day very SOON.  Until then, here are a few ways to help you deal with them:

-Less is more.  That means give less information about your business.  Just ask them about themselves, that works everytime 

-Only give them as much information as you are comfortable with.

-If they are persistent, don’t be afraid to tell them (in a sensitive way) that it’s not something they need to know.

-Remember to keep your enemies closer than your friends.  Enemies seek to destroy your happiness!

-Be NICE to everybody!  It kills miserable people that they were unsuccessful at trying to bring you down!!!

 How to Save Money on Insurance 

1.  Shop around–Request quotes and compare prices from reputable companies, a little time and research can really pay off!

2.  Quality/consumer reviews–Company reputation is important, so by reading reviews you might be able to avoid low quality service in the future and learn something new.

3.  Raise your deductibles–The higher your deductible, the lower the cost of your premium!

4.  Bundle up!–That means taking out auto insurance, homeowners insurance, renters insurance, motorcycle insurance, RV insurance, boat insurance, etc. with the same company is an easy and convenient way to save money!

5.  Qualify for hidden discounts–You may qualify for discounts you won’t even think of, so research and ask which ones you qualify for.

6.  Consider pay as you drive–It’s the newest thing offered by most insurance companies.  It may or may not work with your lifestyle, but it doesn’t hurt to check into it!

7.  Don’t go without–YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU’RE GOING TO NEED IT . . .
