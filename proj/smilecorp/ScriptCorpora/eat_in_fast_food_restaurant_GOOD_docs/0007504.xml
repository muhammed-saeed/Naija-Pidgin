Professional Office Furniture Dimensions
 
If you want to create a professional atmosphere around the office, you have to have all the right furniture to give it the kind of ambience that you want. Oftentimes, having the right office furniture contributes to the productivity of everyone in the workplace.

In this regard, it is of vital importance that you have at least the basic office furniture pieces to give it a professional look for you, your co-workers and most importantly for your clients and suppliers.

Professional Office Furniture Dimensions

Before you start buying office furniture, it is first essential that you take stock of your office space so you will have an idea of the furniture dimensions that will fit into each space you have reserved for conferences, the reception area, workstations and executive offices.

Reception Desks

Any office would look more professional if guests are welcomed at the reception area. These desks would normally look like a half circle where there is a center area where the receptionist usually sits and then counters on each side.

A typical reception desk would measure about 24 inches deep for the center area with a transaction counter of about 12 inches in diameter by 4 inches in height. The side counters meanwhile can measure about 48 inches wide by 24 inches deep.

There are smaller reception desks as well with side desks that are approximately 24 inches wide by 24 inches deep. Transaction counters are about 24 inches wide, 12 inches deep and 14 inches high.

Conference Tables 

In a professional workplace, you will need a designated area for holding meetings with staff as well as making presentations to clients.

Since the conference table is the centerpiece of such a designated area, it is important that you get the right size to accommodate the number of people you want sitting at the table at the same time.

There are conference tables that measure 94 and one-half inches in length, 41 and three-fourths inches wide, 29 and one-fourth inches high with a thickness of one and five-eighths inches.

There are also those that are a bit longer and wider. These come in dimensions of 96 inches wide by 42 inches long and 30 inches high. These could also be thicker at 2 and one-half inches thick.

File Drawer Pedestal

Part of being professional is being organized and this means storing all hardcopies of your important documents properly. File drawer pedestals are therefore essential in any office.

These come in various sizes, depending on how much space you have and how much space you need for all your documents. You may find these in dimensions of 15 and three-fourths inches wide, 19 inches deep and 28 and one-half inches high.

Other dimensions include 34 and one-half inches wide, 19 inches deep and 28 and one-half inches high.
