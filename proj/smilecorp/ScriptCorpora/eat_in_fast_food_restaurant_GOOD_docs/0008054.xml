 The Industry 

 

 Restaurant
 industry sales are expected to reach a record $632 billion and post
 positive growth in 2012 of a 3.5 percent increase over 2011, marking
 the second consecutive year that industry sales have topped $600
 billion. In 2011 the
 National Restaurant Association reported record sales of $604
 billion an increase of 3.6 percent over 2010, or 1.1 percent in
 inflation-adjusted terms. The Industry is tied directly to the health of the U.S. Economy and
 consumer disposable income. The CBO
 anticipates that the current recession, which started in December
 2007, ended in the second quarter of 2009, making it the longest
 recession since World War II. Such growth compares to a 2.6% real
 rate of decline during 2009, the depths of the recession. The swing
 in performance from 2009 to 2010 was the widest since 1983, a period
 of 27 years. The increase in real GDP in 2010 primarily
 reflected positive contributions from private inventory investment,
 exports, personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential
 fixed investment, and federal government spending. Severe economic
 downturns often sow the seeds of robust recoveries. During a slump
 in economic activity, consumers defer purchases, especially for
 housing and durable goods, and businesses postpone capital spending
 and try to cut inventories. Once demand in the economy picks up, the
 disparity between the desired and actual stocks of capital assets
 and consumer durable goods widens quickly, and spending by consumers
 and businesses can accelerate rapidly. Although the CBO expects that
 the current recovery will be spurred by that dynamic, in all
 likelihood, the recovery will also be dampened by a number of
 factors. Those factors include slow wage and employment growth, high
 unemployment as well as a continued sluggish housing market. Current
 expectations by the CBO are for real GDP growth of 2.0% in 2012 and
 1.1% in 2013.

 The
 continued rebound in GDP will also affect real disposable income
 growth. Real DPI increased 1.8 percent in 2010, compared with an
 increase of 0.6 percent in 2009. In
 making these assumptions, it is important to keep the underlying
 economic projections in mind. CBO has forecast real GDP growth of
 2.0 percent in 2012 and 1.1 percent in 2013. It then assumes an
 average growth rate of 4.1 percent for the years of 2014 to 2017.
 Inflation is expected to be modest, at 1.2 percent in 2012 and below
 2 percent in all other years. The unemployment rate is assumed to be
 mostly unchanged from current levels. We do not reach full
 employment for several years, with the forecasted unemployment
 rate being 5.6 percent by 2017. With less uncertainty by
 businesses and investors as to tax policy this year and next and
 with rising expectations that split government in Washington will
 slow the explosion in government spending the economy looks poised
 for sustained growth as businesses and investors get back to the
 business of growing and expanding the bottom line. While the
 industry is expected to grow in 2012, the top challenges cited by
 restaurateurs are food costs, building and maintaining sales volume,
 and the economy. Giving consumers what they want will be crucial for
 restaurant operators in 2012. As the recession has caused 8 out of
 10 consumers to cut back on spending to some degree, it is more
 important than ever for operators to nudge those guests into
 patronizing their restaurants. For operators just getting
 started this Junebe the best time within the business cycle to plan
 and open your new facility understanding that with interest rates
 still at all time low levels and marginal operators going out of
 business you will have accounted for the marginal efficiencies
 necessary to not only survive against the competition but to thrive
 as we cycle once again into economic expansion. 

 For 
 operators just getting started this Junebe the best time within the 
 business cycle to plan and open your new facility understanding that 
 with interest rates still at all time low levels and marginal 
 operators going out of business you will have accounted for the 
 marginal efficiencies necessary to not only survive against the 
 competition but to thrive as we cycle once again into economic 
 expansion. 

 Starting a small business is always risky, and 
 the chance of success is slim. According to the U.S. Small Business 
 Administration, over 50% of small businesses fail in the first year 
 and 95% fail within the first five years. Whether you are starting a new restaurant are looking to raise additional capital 
 to expand your currently profitable Restaurant, or looking to 
 evaluate and value your Restaurant to sell, current statistics prove 
 that you will do much better with a business plan than without. According to Dunn and Bradstreet the 
 primary reasons for failure vary, but all of the reasons come 
 under the category of poor planning. You 
 are a part of the second largest Industry in the United States 
 representing 4% of the U.S. Gross National Product in the most 
 competitive Industry in the world. Your management decisions will 
 decide whether your Restaurant survives or thrives in the face of 
 increased competition. The most important benefit of a business plan 
 is that it sets the stage for the future of your Restaurant as you 
 want it to be positioned in the marketplace. A business plan will 
 make it easy for your banker to take action as he/she gains insight 
 into the details of your restaurant and the goals that you have 
 outlined. Potential investors can review your plan and decide 
 whether or not to make an investment based upon the risk. You will 
 benefit most as you study and gain detailed insight into your own 
 operations. Updating and constantly reviewing your plan will give 
 you more insight as both a manager and decision maker. 
 
 TIME IS 
 MONEY.. . We 
 have estimated that it takes an average of 100 hours to research, 
 and write a comprehensive business plan within any Industry. 
 Creating and compiling the five year financial plan and forecasts 
 including 5 years of budgets, income statements, balance sheets, 
 cash flow analysis, and key financial ratio analysis can take more 
 than 20 hours of work by you or your accountant. Now consider 
 sitting down in front of your computer to edit and fill in the 
 details of an already written and organized sample restaurant 
 business plan and outline. Whether you are starting a fine dining, 
 full service or fast food restaurant, are looking for expansion 
 capital to open your second restaurant, or want to sell your multi 
 restaurant chain, you will be able to edit this plan into your own.

 ALREADY RESEARCHED and WRITTEN ... The 
 Foodservice Industry Analysis included, was written based upon 
 current sources including the National Restaurant Associations&apos; Food 
 Industry Analysis and covers not only the Full service Restaurant 
 segment, but Eating Places, and Fast Food also with an Outlook 
 through 2010. Now use your computer&apos;s word processor to turn this 
 sample plan into your own. Enter your food and beverage revenue 
 assumptions, your operating expense assumptions, and your cash flow 
 assumptions into the QuickPlan five year forecasting template 
 using your computer&apos;s spreadsheet program. You will immediately have 
 five years projected month to month operating budgets, income 
 statements, balance sheets, cash flow analysis and key financial 
 ratios. Once you have finished editing, print your plan and simply 
 insert it into the three ring binder included, indexing it according 
 to the pre-labeled inserts.

 a complete 10 page Employee Manual covering descriptions , wage policy, performance appraisals, etc., a 25 page Operations Manual including job descriptions, and now includes 
 a 20 page Bar Tender/ Bar-back operations manual and par daily

 copy and software for you to edit into your own. Then simply insert
