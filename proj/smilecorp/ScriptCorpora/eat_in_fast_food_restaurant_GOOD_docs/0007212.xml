 The burgers are sliders. Very thin meat patties with holes punched thru them so they can be cooked very quickly. They are greasy, served on a buttery but tiny rolls topped with condiments and served steaming warm. I do not care for them but always take the opportunity to seal my opinion of them when I go home to Chicago by visiting a local White Castle. It always results in the same indigestion but I have to say that McDonald&apos;s actually makes me ill while White Castle just doesn&apos;t&quot;sit well&quot;.

 You either love it or hate it. I live in Canada, and there are no White Castles here either. But I&apos;ve driven to Detroit a few times and had the burgers there. I enjoyed them, but I know a lot who don&apos;t. I really like them, because I drove to Detroit, risking my life and getting shot to get some burgers, lol.

 Yes they are, if they are made fresh. thats the key. Out of the grocery store they&apos;re not all that great. Or if they sit on their grill for awhile,
otherwise they are excellent, I&apos;ve eaten there hundreds of times.
They are costly though, 54 cents a piece plus tax.

 They are small, greasy, and are covered in sauteed onions. So if you like that kind of thing...
