Fundraising Discount Cards

Sell Fundraising Cards For Quick Profits

Looking for ideas for fundraisers? You&apos;re not the only one. Every group is searching for easy fundraisers that 
produce big results. Well, selling fundraising discount cards is one of the best fundraisers around.

Discount cards deliver considerable revenue for your group at $10 each. They usually produce average sales of 10 units per seller. Coupled with 
their 80%-90% profit margins, they also generate considerably more profit than most other fundraising products.

These are simple immediate-sale fundraiser cards that your group can sell quickly. Discount cards provide these benefits:

 They are very easy to sell They offer good value to customers They produce excellent results 

 Three types of fundraising discount cards: 

 Shopping cards 
 Pizza cards 
 Fast food cards 
Each of these fundraisers has benefits that are easy to explain to your supporters. They have widespread appeal and each can be offered for immediate sale or sold via a simple brochure.

Fundraising Card: Discount Shopping
What exactly is a discount shopping card?

It is a wallet-sized card packed with a selection of prearranged
discounts at local and national merchants in your area. Most
usually contain a dozen special offers that save the bearer
either a fixed amount or a percentage discount.

Each card usually retails for $10 and provides for almost unlimited
usage of the special offers. The only exception is when you
custom design a card to feature a special one-time only
discount from a sponsoring merchant.

This type of premium offering is often worth half the $10 purchase
price all by itself, such as $5 off from a national oil change company.

Other money saving examples include free drinks with a fast food
order, $1 or more off on a submarine sandwich, savings on video
rentals, haircut discounts, free ice cream, and other special
offers.

Because of their high perceived value (what family doesn&apos;t 
want to save money these days?), these cards are excellent fundraisers.

Discount cards can often produce impressive unit sales per 
participant. It&apos;s not unusual for each seller to make ten or more sales.

Another interesting benefit is the unique customization of the
card. Many suppliers can place your schools&apos; name and logo on the front side of each card.
This firmly affixes your group&apos;s value proposition in their minds for your next fundraiser.

Cards are usually good for a one year period and bear an 
expiration date on the front. This creates a built-in market for repeat sales.

As with any type of fund raising product it pays to do more than a little supplier research.

Costs for 1,000 unit batches begin at $4 each with many suppliers and can drop 
much lower with the best companies.

Among ideas for fundraisers, discount shopping cards are a
perennial favorite. They also make a good overlay or add-on 
item for candy fundraising or a catalog fundraiser.


Fundraising Card: Two-for-One Pizza
What is a pizza card and how is it different?

A pizza card is a discount card with an offer tied to a single
merchant, usually a national chain. It often provides a two-
for-one offer on every order and is tends to be priced at $10
for a card good for a one-year period.

Offers vary with most being tied to either a single location or
a small group of outlets for a national chain. Pizza Hut cards
are good for eat-in dining while most others are aimed at the
take-out or delivery market.

Given how popular pizza is with younger children as well as 
teenagers, pizza cards are excellent school fundraising ideas.

The cards for Pizza Hut and those for some of the other chains
place a limit on the number of times you can use the card,
often 21 times. That is a lot of free pizza for $10.
Usage is tracked via holes punched in marked spots on the card.

Some of the offers also specify that your initial order must be
for a large pizza while your free pizza is a medium size. When 
you think about it, that works well for most adults because 
they usually want a different set of toppings than what their
children enjoy.

Pizza cards can be obtained from many
suppliers. Most offer the same set of national chains and
prices can vary widely, so it pays to shop around.

All in all, pizza cards are among the best easy fundraisers based on profitability and ease of sale.

Fundraising Card: Fast Food Discount
What do I need to know about fast food discount cards? Well, they are usually specific to just one fast food chain and often are limited 
to just one or two locations of that particular chain. They retail for $10 and 
usually cost less than $2, so they&apos;re a great moneymaker.
Offers vary by company, but 
they usually provide a matching main item with 
purchase of the same. For example, at Burger king, you might get a free 
hamburger. At Subway, you usually get a free soda, chips, or cookie with each 
sandwich purchase.

The cards are limited in duration and number of uses. Usually, they 
are good for up to one year and restricted to roughly ten uses. Again, the offers vary 
by chain, so check the details closely.

Participating national chains are:
 McDonalds Burger King Subway Dairy Queen Pizza Hut Dominos Pizza Papa Johns Pizza 

Fundraising Discount Cards Recap

So, what&apos;s the bottom line on discount card sales?

The excellent consumer value of all these cards makes them an
easy sale. Their $10 price point makes a cash purchase a
simple transaction yet a higher amount than most fundraising
items.

Their great value, small size, light weight, and easy handling requirements make
selling these cards a breeze.

Most suppliers will provide the discount cards and pizza cards to
your group on easy credit terms.
That makes them great school fundraisers because you can offer
them to your supporters as an immediate sale item, thus simplifying
the delivery process tremendously.

Instead of relying on your supporters&apos; discretionary purchasing 
power in these tough economic times, why not tap into your 
supporters&apos; everyday spending on fast food meals?

They&apos;re not quite necessities, but they are an ingrained spending 
habit with many families.

Selling fundraising discount cards positions you for
a better chance at a larger portion of your supporters&apos; spending.
And, because of their high unit volumes, healthy profit margins, 
and ease of sale, they are excellent school fundraisers
because they&apos;ll produce exceptional profits.

Make sure your group gets your share!
