 A man in Wisconsin is to eat his 25,000th Big Mac today at 3pm CDT (8pm GMT).

A Big Mac is the popular hamburger sold by fast-food restaurant McDonald&apos;s. Two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions and pickles are served with a sauce inside a sesame bun.

According to WISinfo.com , Don Gorske, who consumes around two Big Macs a day, is planning to eat his milestone burger on the 39th anniversary of when he had his first Big Mac back in 1972.

Gorske has also kept every receipt from every Big Mac he has bought, which is a result of his obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Of his impending achievement, he said: &quot;I think 25,000 is a pretty awesome number. [But] I&apos;ll never live long enough to eat 50,000.

&quot;I eat what I need to survive.&quot;

Gorske also revealed that he always packs two Big Macs in his luggage in case he can&apos;t find a McDonald&apos;s when he travels. Furthermore, he recently got his cholesterol levels checked, with test results indicating that he is in perfect health.
