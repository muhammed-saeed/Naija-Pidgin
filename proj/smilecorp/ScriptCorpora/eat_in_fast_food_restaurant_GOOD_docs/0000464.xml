America’s Top 10 Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants
 Posted Mar 03 2009 2:06pm 
 
 Have you ever wondered what fast food restaurants are the healthiest?

Well, wonder no longer.

Health.com has put together a top Ten List and you may be surprised what restaurant is at number eight.

According to Health.com :

&quot;Among the big burger-based chains, McDonald’s is leading the way in
overhauling its menu to offer more heart- and waist-friendly fare. Take
the Happy Meals, which you can order with a side of apple dippers (with
low-fat caramel) instead of fries and low-fat milk or fruit juice
instead of soda. (Now the trick is just getting your kid to go for
them!) And if you’ve gotta have fries, McDonald’s are made in a healthy
canola-blend oil and come in at just 230 calories for a small.

The Grilled Chicken Classic sandwich and wraps are healthy choices,
too (just skip the mayo or sauce). So is the salad with Paul Newman
low-fat balsamic vinaigrette. Registered dietitian Moore notes that an
Egg McMuffin, at 300 calories, is a smart alternative to other“calorie-laden biscuit breakfasts.”And our whole panel commends
McDonald’s for spelling out the nutritional information right on the
back of its tray liners.

 We love: The chain’s 260- to 270-calorie Snack Wraps (choose grilled chicken) for protein without a lot of unwanted carbs.
 Danger zone: Although McDonald’s made our list, this is still the land of supersizing and giant sodas. It’s up to you to request a small.&quot;
