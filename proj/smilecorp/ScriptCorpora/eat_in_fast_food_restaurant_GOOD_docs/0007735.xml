 Why do other people&apos;s B cups look bigger than my B cup? LOL? Q: I noticed in magazines, internet, and T.V. when they talk about celebrities breast sizes, the ones that are B cups..I would think are C cups.... I&apos;m a 34 B but I look smaller than them...I&apos;m 5&apos;3 and 115lbs...weight could have to do with it..But then again the celebs are skinny and have B cups that look prety big. A: its because boobs look different with all people it all depends on your height Is a B cup much bigger than an A cup? Q: I know A&apos;s are quite a bit bigger than AA cups. Are B cups quite a bit bigger than A&apos;s or is it not really much of difference? A: An&quot;A&quot;cup means your bust measurement is one inch more than your band measurement.A&quot;B&quot;cup is a two inch difference.A&quot;C&quot;cup is a three inch difference.Consequently, the cup size for a 34C is the same as the cup size for a 36B. Would you consider small c-cups (or even large b&apos;s) to be big breasts, if they are on a small frame? Q: My friend is 23 yrs. old, about 5&apos;1&quot;and about 110 lbs., so she has a pretty small frame, like me. However I have a-cups, and she has large b-cups and is always bragging about how huge her boobs are! Sure, they definitely look larger on her than they would a woman who was 5&apos;10&quot;, but I wouldn&apos;t consider them to be big.So, my question is, would large b-cups be considered&quot;big&quot;on a small frame like this? (Cuz I think only small c&apos;s on my/my friend&apos;s type of frame could be considered big.) So, what do you think the minimum cup size is, on a very petite body, to be considered as having&quot;big&quot;breasts? A: I&apos;ve definitely seen very petite women with medium-large b-cups that have a lot of the characteristics of&quot;big&quot;breasts. Remember that cup size is determined by the number of inches around the breast, and proportionally speaking, an inch is a lot more on a small body. It&apos;s all about proportion.When someone is below or near 5&apos;and below or near 100 lbs, and/or when you are in band sizes of 32 and below, a large b-cup can seem big. I&apos;ve seen breasts this size that form definite cleavage and that, in a bra, have the same general rounded shape as c-cups on medium-sized women. However, breasts this size often share the small-breast characteristics of being perky even when unsupported (because the absolute size is still small) and of looking&quot;pointy&quot;when braless.Don&apos;t worry about your a-cups; take advantage of what you&apos;ve got. A-cups on a very petite frame are about equivalent to b-cups on a medium frame, which is about average. And you can get away with low-cut tops, going braless, and even going topless at appropriate beaches/pools, all of which can attract attention if you want. A cute petite woman with small breasts who is confident in her body is just as attractive as a confident large-breasted woman. TOP
