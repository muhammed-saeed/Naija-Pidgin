She was so caring, lovable, helpful and patient&amp;importantly Rich girl who seeks only the pure love from me. I gave her the same.

 A Car Which Runs in Water….

Skyrocketting fuel prices, adulterated fuel, long queues at petrol stations, often unscrupulous attendants out to fleece you—your cup of woes spills over everytime you need to fill the tank of of your car.

But all this could be history if Genepax—a Japanese company—is successful in commercialising its latest innovation: the‘water car.’

Genepax unveiled the car in Osaka, Japan on June 12, saying that a litre of any kind of water would get the engine going for about an hour at a speed of 80 kmph, or 50 mph.

Genepax president Kiyoshi Hirasawa, in a mission statement published on the company’s official web site, said,“Our mission is to develop technology and products for efficient production and use of energy. By‘efficient,’we mean ecologically and economically efficient. Ecological and economical energy is our business. Our goal is to create energy that is not taxing on our natural environment.”

The water needed to run the car could be tap, rain or sea water, the company clarified.

Once the tank (which is at the rear) of the Genepax car is filled with water, a generator would extract hydrogen from the water using, what the comapny calls, its Water Energy System, or WES, to produce electricity that the car runs on. As opposed to the hybrid cars which emit water, Genepax’s invention consumes water.

Whether the car is a commercial success or not remains to be seen, but Genepax said it had applied for a patent and is planning to collaborate with Japanese auto manufacturers.

“Energy made from water,”as Hirasawa says,“is not a dream story anymore We hope many people will join us in our challenge to promote the use of our WES, for the better future of the earth,”he added in a statement.

Tips for Better Life
==============================

1. Take a 10-30 minutes walk every day. And while you walk, smile.

2. Sit in silence for at least 10 minutes each day.

3. Sleep for 7 hours.

4. Live with the 3 E’s—Energy, Enthusiasm, and Empathy.

5. Play more games.

6.  Read more books than you did in 2007.

7. Make time to practice meditation, yoga, and prayer. They provide us with daily fuel for our busy lives.

8. Spend time with people over the age of 70&amp;under the age of 6.

9. Dream more while you are awake.

10. Eat more foods that grow on trees and plants and eat less food that is manufactured in plants.

11. Drink plenty of water.

12. Try to make at least three people smile each day.

13. Don’t waste your precious energy on gossip.

14. Forget issues of the past.  Don’t remind your partner with his/her mistakes of the past.
That will ruin your present happiness.

15. Don’t have negative thoughts or things you cannot control.  Instead invest your energy in the positive present moment.

16. Realize that life is a school and you are here to learn. Problems are simply part of the curriculum that appear and fade away like algebra class but the

lessons you learn will last a lifetime.

17. Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a beggar.

18. Smile and laugh more.

19. Life is too short to waste time hating anyone.  Don’t hate others.

20. Don’t take yourself so seriously. No one else does.

21. You don’t have to win every argument. Agree to disagree.

22. Make peace with your past so it won’t spoil the present.

23. Don’t compare your life to others’. You have no idea what their journey is all about. Don’t compare your partner with others.

24. No one is in charge of your happiness except you.

25. Forgive everyone for everything.

26. What other people think of you is none of your business.

27. GOD heals everything.

28. However good or bad a situation is, it will change.

29. Your job won’t take care of you when you are sick. Your friends will.
Stay in touch.

30. Get rid of anything that isn’t useful, beautiful or joyful.

31. Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need.

32. The best is yet to come.

33. No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up.

34. Do the right thing!

35. Call your family often.

36. Your Inner most is always happy.  So, be happy.

37. Each day give something good to others.

38.  Don’t over do.  Keep your limits.

39. When you awake alive in the morning, thank GOD for it.
