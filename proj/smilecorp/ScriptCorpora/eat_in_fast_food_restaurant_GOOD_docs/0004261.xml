Description Of This California Fast Food Restaurant Franchisor Business For Sale:
 Why Buy A Franchise When You Can Buy The Franchisor!

Blendz Franchises is a franchisor of healthier fast food Restaurants. We specialize in tossed-to-order Salads, Grilled Panini Sandwiches, Blended Smoothies and Juices, and Gourmet Soups with select locations offering Coffee and Espresso drinks.

This is a highly unusual opportunity with a massive upside for the right person or group A fully built and ready to grow franchise system with almost a decade of operating history behind it. You are not buying a franchise; you are buying the entire franchise company.

Our niche after developing the concept over the past nine years is&apos;Alternative&apos;locations. We are well positioned to exploit and dominate this opportunity. Alternative locations include Car dealerships, Fitness centers, Car washes, Office buildings, Mall Kiosks etc. We currently have successful units operating in Stevens Creek BMW in San Jose, CA., Milpitas Honda in CA., Pure Fitness Gym in San Diego, Two Car wash locations . We also have two in-line retail stores open in the San Francisco bay area.

Blendz has two distinct types of business opportunities for franchise prospects as well as the traditional In Line retail locations.

1) Alternative/ Express units: These units average 400 to 800 square feet and are custom built out into Car Dealerships, Hospitals ,Fitness Centers, Car washes and large Office complexes, etc.
2) Mobile Cart Units; Portable units that are located in office complexes, outdoor malls, sports complexes, street fairs, school fund raiser&apos;s, etc.

We have fully developed Operations Manuals, Training Programs, Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDD), Business Plan, Franchise Development, etc.

The Opportunity - Revenue Streams

Area Director Franchise Sales: Approximately 60 sales opportunities at an average of 50,000.00 each (3,000,000.000)

Alternative/ Express units- 400 at 25,000.00 franchise fee each (10,000,000.00)
Mobile Event Carts 500 at 25,000 franchise fee each (12,500,000.00 )
Royalties fees estimated at full build out of franchise system. ( 19,000,000.00)
This type of opportunity comes along very rarely. The franchisor business can be operated from anywhere in the U.S. It is currently located in Carlsbad, CA (San Diego County).
