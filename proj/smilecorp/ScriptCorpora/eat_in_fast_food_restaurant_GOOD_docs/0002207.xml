 Trends in the Quick-Service Restaurant Industry 
 by Ron Gorodesky and Ed McCarron 
 W e recently made a presentation to a large quick-service restaurant franchise operator. We discovered some interesting trends in this
industry - some you probably know about, some you may not know about -
that we wanted to share with you.
 DIET FOODS DON&apos;T WORK. 
Diet foods don&apos;t work in the quick-service, or fast food, industry.
Mickey D&apos;s McLean burger was a great idea but it just didn&apos;t catch on
with the fast-food eating public.

 
 LARGER PORTIONS DO WORK. 
We&apos;ll single out Michael Jordan&apos;s favorite fast food restaurant chain
again. The Deluxe series at McDonald&apos;s (Arch Deluxe, Fish Filet Deluxe,
Crispy Chicken Deluxe and Grilled Chicken Deluxe) serves up sandwiches
which are larger, cost more but taste about the same as the regular
models in an effort to attract more adults to the Golden Arches.
 VALUE PRICING IS IN. 
Value pricing is a direct response to increased competition for all
dayparts and to saturated markets. Speaking of markets, have you tried
Boston Market&apos;s Chicken Carver Combo for $4.00? It includes a chicken
breast sandwich, a side dish and a medium soft drink. Pretty good
value, don&apos;t you think? Value-priced meals at fast food restaurants
usually include a sandwich, french fries and a soft drink. These meals
help increase sales of french fries and soft drinks, which are high
profit margin items.
Even the mid-scale restaurants such as Red Lobster are moving to
value-priced meals. Restaurants are trading lower average checks for
increased covers.
 THE BURGER SECTOR IS DOWN, BUT NOT OUT 
The burger chains did not grow as fast as the pizza and chicken chains
over the last five years, but they are still about double the size of
pizza chains, the second largest group, in dollar volume and still make
up almost half of dollar volume of the total U.S. fast food market which
has revenues of almost $100 million. See the chart in this article.
The main deterrent of burger chain growth is a more health-conscious
American public.
 OLD FAVORITES, NEW LOCATIONS 
More fast food restaurants are showing up in the strangest locations.
Little Caesars is now in K-Mart and McDonald&apos;s is now in Wal-Mart. This
trend will continue as increased competition and saturated markets cause
fast food companies to become more creative in selecting their
locations.
 OLD FAVORITES, SAME LOCATIONS 
The use of &quot;multiple-branding&quot; - whereby several restaurant chains
operate at the same location - is an attempt to draw more customers by
offering a large number of items from which to choose. Chains that
engage in multiple-branding can better absorb fixed operating costs,
such as rent. Pepsico, owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, has
started co-branding where you&apos;ll see a Taco Bell kiosk in a KFC store.
Fast food restaurants have become more creative in their pricing
strategies, real estate locations and marketing schemes in response to
the fiercest competition ever in this industry. As long as the American
public continues its fierce competitiveness in the workplace, working
longer hours with no time to prepare food at home and continues its
insatiable hunger for new restaurant concepts, the most creative and
aggressive fast food companies will flourish with these trends and also
create new trends.
