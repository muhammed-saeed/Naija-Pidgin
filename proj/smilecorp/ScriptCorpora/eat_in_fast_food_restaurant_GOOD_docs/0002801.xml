Champagne tastes on a burger budget

Natalie Hayden and Billy Whitcomb sat opposite one another, holding hands over empty plates of burgers and fries. They were celebrating Valentine’s Day like millions of couples.

The two chose an unlikely place to enjoy their one-week anniversary–White Castle on Versailles Road.

Different than most evenings at the local fast-food restaurant though, they were seated among hearts, cupids and flowers.

Once each year–Valentine’s Day–the eatery is transformed into a lover’s retreat complete with white linen tablecloths and red and pink cloth napkins.

“We were introduced by friends,”Hayden said about their week-long courtship.

Not far from them, seated in a booth, were Paul and Tammy Matte and their daughter Mallory, 6, and son Michael, 3.

“This is our Valentine’s to be here,”Paul said.“It’s our third year to bring the children for them to enjoy the celebration.”

In order to get a seat from 5–8 p.m. at the restaurant on Feb. 14, reservations are required–and there were 60 made this year.

Hostess Tonya Hamilton wore a bright red shimmering blouse and dark pants and stood behind a stand greeting guests. Her husband, Rich Hamilton, manager of the Frankfort White Castle, stood close behind to welcome and help with seating.

“It’s the only way I get to see my husband on Valentine’s Day,”said Tonya, who does not normally work alongside her sweetheart of 24 years.

Rich, dressed in a white shirt and bow tie with a brightly decorated black apron with red hearts, snapped pictures of couples or families standing framed in a large pink, red and white heart hanging near the front door.

“I’ve been with White Castle for 17 years this time,”Rich said of returning to work for the Kentucky-based company.

Waitresses in red, pink and white shirts and decorated aprons circled tables taking orders. Customers were given specially designed menus with“Celebrate Your Love”on the cover, written in script above a single red rose on an unopened valentine card and bearing the date.

On the menu, which was also printed in red and black, was even a“Sweetheart Special”that offered 10 hamburgers, two fries and two large drinks for $10.69.

The menu served as a souvenir and had a free coupon for two free White Castle hamburgers with a return visit before the end of February.

“We’ve been coming here for three years,”said a smiling Jimmy Carey as he and his wife Nancy arrived.

Carey, a former Kentucky State trooper and member of Paul Patton’s executive security, grinned as he and Nancy took their seats in a booth with a vase of red and pink carnations.

“We wouldn’t miss this,”he said as they paused for a picture behind the heart-shaped valentine at the front of the restaurant.

Rich, official photographer in addition to his other duties, told the couple the photograph would be available on the White Castle website.

But what was to be a happy occasion turned into disappointment for one young guest.

Local realtor Bonnie Fint arrived with her daughter, Nikki Martin, and two grandchildren, Hailey, 6, and her sister, Addison, 3.

They were surprised to find they needed a reservation.

“We keep two extra tables for this type of situation,”Rich said, admitting those two tables were not decorated with the tablecloths, flowers, candles or napkins that adorned the reserved tables.

Seeing Hailey’s disappointment, he quickly grabbed a candle and napkins for the table.

But out of the mouths of babes, Hailey’s words surprised everyone seated around her.

“I want to‘res-er-vate’for next year,”she told the manager, as those seated around her laughed at her choice of words.

A smiling Rich went to the reservation stand and the young girl quickly gave him her name, spelling it for him, in fact.

“I want to res-er-vate for four,”she said.“Now did you write that down?”she questioned, amid more laughter from the diners.

Fint explained that Hailey had seen the ads for the special dinner and wanted her and her mother to bring Hailey and Addison.

“We didn’t know we needed reservations,”a smiling Fint said.

Hailey and Addison posed for several pictures in and around the heart.

“I’ll be back next year,”Hailey told The State Journal.

Tim Williams arrived in a black jacket with a tuxedo T-shirt underneath.

New employee Allison Rose said she thought that the departure from the normal atmosphere of customers coming in and ordering at the window and the staff wearing special outfits made for a fun night.

“I’ve only been here about three months,”Rose said as she smiled and delivered food and drinks to the tables.

“This is really different from our normal routine, but I am sure enjoying it and hope our customers are too.”
