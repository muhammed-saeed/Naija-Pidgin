 Fast food restaurants a quick,
 clean cure for expat blues 

 By WENDY GRIFFIN 

 An ongoing controversy at
 Honduras This Week is whether the paper should include
 reviews of restaurants that serve U.S.-style food when so
 many restaurants that serve traditional Honduran food go
 unreviewed. 

 There are many different
 types of readers of Honduras This Week. The National
 University and certain bilingual schools subscribe to the
 paper for their students. Many copies goes overseas, to
 foreigners interested in Honduras, as well as Honduran
 embassies and Hondurans living abroad. Perhaps the
 majority of subscription holders are foreign citizens
 living here. 

 U.S. Ambassador James
 Creagan recently pointed out that there are 12,000 U.S.
 citizens residing in Honduras. They work in development
 projects, bilingual schools, their own businesses or they
 are retirees. Most of these overseas Gringos share one
 thing: they get homesick. 

 The director of the
 bilingual school in Tela says the worst part of his job
 is dealing with foreign teachers who are suffering from
 culture shock. They cry, they want to go home, they want
 to quit. 

 Take the following test to
 see if you are homesick: read the menu at the Popeye&apos;s
 chicken restaurant in La Ceiba. Cole slaw, mashed
 potatoes, corn on the cob, onion rings, fluffy biscuits,
 southern fried chicken, cajun rice, sweetened iced tea,
 icy cold beer. If just reading the menu brings tears to
 your eyes and images of your grandmother on a Sunday
 afternoon, you are homesick. 

 I recommend eating a nice
 meal in a very clean fast food restaurant and writing a
 letter home while listening to soft music. It is much
 cheaper than going home, and on Monday you can get back
 into the thick of things here in Honduras. 

 But foreigners are the
 minority at the U.S. fast food chains in Honduras. When
 Burger King first opened in Tegucigalpa, people
 complained that they couldn&apos;t go there in their everyday
 clothes because the Tegucigalpa High Life went in heels,
 nice clothes and diamonds. 

 Maybe Hondurans go out to
 eat U.S. fast food like many of us go out to Mexican,
 Chinese or another exotic cuisine back home. 

 Popeye&apos;s is an adventure
 in southern U.S. cooking, with such treats as New
 Orleans-style gumbo seafood soup and pecan pie. But there
 must be something else that attracts Hondurans away from
 their staples of red beans and rice, even though Popeye&apos;s
 offers its own spicy new Orleans version of these foods. 

 Bay Islander Marthell
 Watler thinks part of the attraction of foreign fast food
 restaurants is that they are so family oriented. He
 wonders wistfully when one will open up in the Bay
 Islands so the islanders can take their children, too.
 Many parents will tell you that it&apos;s not the food that
 brings them to the fast food chains, but the play areas
 and kids meals. The Popeye&apos;s in La Ceiba has no
 playground, but it is right next to the movie theater. 

 Foreign fast food chains
 offer commodities that many Honduran restaurants do not.
 Popeye&apos;s and Burger King accept Visa and Mastercard, a
 benefit on a Sunday when you didn&apos;t exchange enough
 money, or your check hasn&apos;t come yet. Most of these
 restaurants also have clean restrooms. 

 Poorer Hondurans choose
 restaurants with different criteria than most tourists.
 My Tawahka friends love the places in downtown
 Tegucigalpa that have loud music and people selling
 cassettes tapes, sunglasses and gum constantly going by.
 They like the movement and say&quot;eating here has chispa .
 The chicken is great and it is cheap.&quot;They do not
 mind the lack of repainting and the absence of interior
 design. Instead, these factors reassure them that the
 food will be cheap. 

 Popeye&apos;s is well lit and
 decorated with interesting prints featuring New Orleans
 Jazz. You can see into the kitchen so that any doubts as
 to cleanliness are immediately gone. There is a no
 smoking section, a blessing to those of us with asthma.
 My Tawahka friends would probably dislike Popeye&apos;s as
 they disliked Burger King with its Art Deco decor.&quot;There&apos;s no movement here.&quot;But I heard every
 word a friend said, because there was no loud music. 

 There are also Hondurans
 who enjoy a nice clean decorated places to go. Popeye&apos;s
 has been open in La Ceiba for a year and the Honduran
 manager says there has been good acceptance from the
 public. The prices are within the range of middle class
 Hondurans. A chicken breast, small cole slaw, biscuit and
 soft drink sells for Lps. 25. The hours are also
 convenient, from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., so you can go after
 the movies. 

 Honduras is a place where
 you can enjoy many kinds of foods -- Garifuna, Bay
 Island, traditional Honduran, cuisine from Spain, India,
 Uruguay, China. And now you can enjoy food from the
 southern United States. 

 If hot fluffy biscuits
 that are even better than my grandmother&apos;s with a good
 hot cup of coffee do not cheer you up, maybe it really is
 time to go home. 
 
 
 
 
 This Week&apos;s Trivia Question 

 Q :
 Although Francisco Morazan and Jose Cecilio Valle
 are considered Honduras&apos; greatest patriots,
 neither had the opportunity of becoming this
 nation&apos;s first chief of state. Who holds this
 honor?

 ANSWER TO LAST WEEK&apos;S TRIVIA QUESTION 

 

 A: McDonald&apos;s, the world&apos;s biggest
 chain, opened a restaurant in downtown Tegucigalpa in
 1972, but the franchise soon went out of business. The
 modern wave of fast food chains began with the 1988
 opening of a Pizza Hut in San Pedro Sula. Other chains
 that currently have franchises in Honduras are Burger
 King, Popeyes, Wendy&apos;s, Taco Bell, Subway, TGIFriday&apos;s,
 Domino&apos;s Pizza and Little Caesars -- the most recent.

 Pupusas are Honduran, believe it
 or not 

 By RICARDO
 MADRID MARMOL 
Special to Honduras This Week 

 A pupusa looks like
 a sort of thick tortilla. Actually, it&apos;s corn flour mixed
 with white cheese, then formed into a tortilla and
 cooked. If your pupusa contains cheese only, it&apos;s called
 a pupusa de quesillo . If small pieces of crisp
 pork rinds are added to the corn flour mix, it&apos;s called a pupusa de chicharron . If it contains both cheese
 and pork, it&apos;s called a pupusa mixta . 

 Most Hondurans will tell
 you that the pupusa is part of the native cuisine of El
 Salvador because pupusa restaurants -- pupusaras -- can be found all over the place in that country. But
 according to the Larousse Encyclopedic Dictionary
 published in Paris 40 years ago, the dish is of Honduran
 origin. History is the cause of the misbelief that
 pupusas are Salvadoran. 

 During the 1950s and
 1960s, extreme overpopulation and economic crisis
 prompted 300,000 Salvadorans to immigrate illegally to
 Honduras. In 1969, thousands of them were deported by the
 Honduran government and many alleged that they were
 mistreated by Honduran officials. After visiting Honduran
 fans were attacked by Salvadorans at a World Cup
 qualifying soccer match in San Salvador in June of that
 year, the Hondurans became very angered and deported
 thousands more Salvadoran immigrants, who again alleged
 abuse at the hands of the Hondurans. 

 On July 14, 1969, the
 famous&quot;Soccer War&quot;began when El Salvador
 invaded Honduras and bombed Honduran airports. Although
 the war lasted only 100 hours, relations between the two
 countries remained strained even after the signing of a
 peace treaty. Nevertheless, when El Salvador burst into a
 civil war in the 1980s, thousands more Salvadoran
 refugees crossed the border into Honduras. 

 The Salvadorans are very
 industrious people. They have to be in order to compete
 and survive in a country 20 percent the size of Honduras
 with twice the population. When they went back home, some
 of these Salvadoran refugees took the Honduran pupusa
 back with them and made it a staple fast food item. 

 Back in Honduras, it used
 to be that if you lived in Tegucigalpa and you wanted to
 eat pupusas, you had to drive 15km out of town on the
 Southern Highway to a small cluster of roadside pupusa
 restaurants. Today, however, Edmundo Flores and his
 Pupusas Ricas restaurants allow you to enjoy the unique
 flavor of pupusas right downtown, served with cabbage
 salad and a spicy condiment made of onions, carrots,
 jalapeos, tomato, lemon and vinegar. 

 At Pupusas Ricas you&apos;ll
 also find Jos Colindres Davila, your bilingual host and
 manager, and numerous local and foreign clients who are
 satisfied regular customers. The menu includes all three
 varieties of pupusas, plus daily specials and Mondongo and Tapado soups on weekends. 

 For a culinary adventure,
 why not try Pupusas Ricas, located in downtown
 Tegucigalpa, just 30 meters west of the Arbolito
 landmark. 
 
 Did you know? 
 Honduran
 Curiosities 

 Although travellers
 worldwide are discovering that Honduras is full of
 natural beauty and cultural riches, few know the country
 also has its share of natural wonders. The following are
 just a few: 

 The Great Crab Race -- Every July and August in the municipalities of Esparta
 and El Provenir on the Honduran North Coast, thousands of
 crabs emerge from the sea and begin a long overland march
 to destinations unknown. Although a biologist might be
 curious about where the crabs are headed and why, locals
 facing hard economic times are less analytical of the
 phenomenon. Whether plucked up by hand or gathered into
 special traps, the crabs get a good price at the local
 market. 

 Magnetic Rocks --
 Just outside the village of Agalteca, near the
 municipality of Talanga in Francisco Morazan department,
 there is a group of large boulders and smaller rocks
 whose claim to fame is that they attract any object that
 contains iron or copper, including farming tools and
 machetes. 

 Guanisales Cave and the
 Tunnel of Braids -- Located within the hill of the
 same name, just outside of Marcala, La Paz, the
 Guanisales Cave is 20 meters long, 10 meters across and
 full of bats. Not far away on the same side of the hill
 is the entrance to the Tunnel of the Braids, whose floor
 is covered with yellow dust and where braids made of
 human hair have been found. Archaeologists believe they
 were Mayan. 

 The Bell Stone --
 This unusual stone is found in the Sensenti Valley along
 the road that connects the municipalities of Corquin and
 Sensenti. Made of a material that resembles marble, the
 stone resonates like a bell when kicked or struck. It
 plays a very important role in local agricultural
 activities. Because its tone can be heard over great
 distances, it is rung in the morning and the evening to
 mark the beginning and the end of the work day.

 Forest sprite looks after cattle
 and tries to woo women 

 Cows have their own special
 protectors in La Mosquitia folklore. (Photo by Eric
 Schwimmer.) 

 By WENDY GRIFFIN 

 Cattle are a very
 important part of Honduran culture. Not only could a book
 be written about Honduras&apos; relationship with cattle, at
 least one book already has. Regrettably, Honduran
 historian Leticia de Oyuela&apos;s A Century on the
 Hacienda is now out of print. 

 Honduras&apos; cattle ranching
 history began in the first days of the Spanish Conquest.
 By the 1540s, the departments of Colon and Olancho
 already had sizeable cattle herds. 

 According to the
 traditional religious beliefs of most Honduran Indian
 groups, every wild animal has its own spiritual owner.
 But cows are so much a part of Honduran culture that they
 are one of the few domestic animals that also have
 spiritual owners. The Miskito Indians believe the duende looks after both cattle and deer. 

 The Bay Islanders also
 associate the duende with cattle. People in the village
 of West End on the Bay Island of Roatan say they used to
 see this spirit creature around the corrals where they
 keep their cows. Today there are few cows left in West
 End, however, and duende sightings have stopped. 

 There are different
 versions of what these duendes look like. Most agree that
 they are short. Some Miskito stories say they appear as
 naked boys between the ages of eight and ten. Sometimes
 they&apos;re white, sometimes they&apos;re black. Spanish speakers
 usually report that the duendes are dressed in a large
 hat and red clothes. 

 The Spanish speakers of
 Trujillo also associate the duende with cattle. duendes
 reportedly try to get young girls to fall in love with
 them by boasting of their riches and inviting them back
 to their hacienda to admire all their cattle. 

 According to one legend,
 there was once a girl near Trujillo who liked to bathe in
 her house, rather than down at the river. One day, a
 duende came along and invited her back to his home to
 show her all of his wealth. She went with him, and
 returned home. As always, when it was time for her to
 bathe, she asked her mother to bring her water from the
 river so she could bathe in the house. But her mother had
 grown tired of hauling water for her daughter, and told
 her that if she wanted to bathe she would have to do so
 in the river. The young girl obeyed and went to the
 river. As she washed her hair, cows began to drop into
 the water with every drop that fell from her head. They
 were gifts from the duende, still intent on winning her
 heart. But because the mother had refused to let the girl
 bathe at home, all of the cows got away. They say the
 first time the duende gives you riches; the second time
 he takes you away forever. 

 When duendes are trying to
 get girls to pay attention to them, they cause problems
 for the other boys who want to be with the girl. But
 sometimes male duendes take the young men to teach them
 to be men, how to raise cattle, report Ladinos in
 Trujillo. 

 Cattle are not only
 associated with duendes, but also witches. Jogita Quioto
 Valerio of La Union tells the story of a man who was
 visiting his neighbor when night fell. The man wanted to
 go back home, but the woman said,&quot;don&apos;t go. There
 is a big cow in the creek between your place and mine. It
 will not let you pass.&quot;The man left anyway and soon
 found the huge, storming mad cow. The man threw a rock
 that hit the bull above the eye. 

 The next day when he saw
 his neighbor, she had a big cut above her eye, where he
 had thrown the stone. Later that night, again it became
 dark while he was at his neighbor&apos;s house. The woman
 said,&quot;don&apos;t go now. There is a big hog in the creek
 between our properties.&quot;The man went anyway. He saw
 the hog and cut it with his machete. The next day he
 visited his neighbor, who was in bed recovering from a
 machete wound in the same place where he had hit the hog.
 Then he knew that it was his neighbor who changed into
 these animals. Witches who can change into animals are a
 common motif in Ladino stories. 

 There are also female
 duendes, report the Miskitos. One man from Auka
 reportedly caught one. He had to feed her special natural
 uncooked foods. He also had to protect her from the eyes
 of his neighbors. When humans looked at her, it caused
 sores. Finally she died from these sores. 

 This story could be a
 metaphor for the struggle between the wild forest things
 in Honduras and human-brought things like cattle. Places
 like the Aguan River near Santa Rosa used to have dantos,
 monkeys, alligators and many other wild animals. Now this
 area and most areas where these animals lived have been
 cleared for cattle ranching. 

 Many fear that Honduras&apos;
 wild animals will suffer the same fate as the poor female
 duende.
