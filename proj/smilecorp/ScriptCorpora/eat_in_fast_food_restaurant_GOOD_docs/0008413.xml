Searching for position to employ the moving window algorithm I invented for exceptionally large population research. Willing to share patent with employer/company/npo willing to engage in initial investments and marketing expenses. This areal/regional profiling technique works best on populations 1 million and above if evaluating statistical significance is the goal, but is tested and validated for 40,000 and above groups as well. Applicable to demographic research, regional economic or consumer-product cost analyses (separate algorithm invented to more truthfull evaluate cost), areal-population point data analyses, product-utilization rates by region (i.e. large oil consumption data sets). Algorithm is encypted in all presentations, and is patent pending without any academic inclusion in the patent review process.

My most important accomplishment to date is: tested new applications for an old algorithm developed in 1997 for comparing two&quot;surfaces&quot;; applied algorithm to population age-gender differences measure (11/2004-2/2005 application discovery; retested for exceptionally large populations). Used this to define Regression to Means standards in National Population statistics for assessing exceptionally large (300M) individuals, using a small group (several million) population outcome. This method has applications to many or most future population analyses and mapping projects, for population N&gt;40,000, but especially 100,000; this method has no max N limit. Developed by applying normalization, moving window and standard frequency measure methodologies in a unique way so as to be able to statistically review exceptionally large N population pyramids (1M to 84M) alongside much smaller groups using standard statistical methodologies. This was successfully used to define age-gender sections with statistically significant differences in the distribution of people based on age and gender in 1-year increments, and in the unequal distribution of research topic defined frequency rates. Used for example to define specifically down to 1-year age increments when specific illnesses or medical conditions begin to impact people, tested and run on more than 100 major, costly, or rare, but commonly known medical conditions. This method can be applied to intergender, interregional, interpopulation, inter-ICD analyses of any and all statistical measures taken regarding health and disease. [ICD = International Classification of Disease used for population health analysis and modeling] This method (patenting process in situ) has tremendous applicability to testing any two populations or vastly different n&apos;s in relation to one another for between within groups comparisons for any population statistic in need of age-gender evaluation (housing cost, income, employed/unemployed, schooling, race/ethnicity groups, 1-year disease rates, etc.). Useful for prediction of Regression to Means outcome for theoretically large/full sized populations based on small to large sample populations. This method fully compensates and corrects for expected heteroscedasticity problems typical to exceptionally large population N analyses

I am also in the process of reformating and adding the 1993-2003 research/teaching materials to my 1997-2001&apos;Evolution of Chemicals in Plants&apos;textbooks; due to the popularity of this work, I believe the older versions are being sold for way too much by US and western Europe used book markets (up to $200) due to their scarcity.

Research: Mapping ICDs using the new US Population Health Grid Methodology
 Undisclosed.·Undisclosed. Applications for a new SAS False Cuboid (bivariate 3D histogram) Technique used to map national disease (ICD) stats under development. Techniques developed for presenting overall N and population density relative to ICD9 n and prevalences, with raw scores and coarsely to finely adjusted scores mapped. Undisclosable other population risk data to be tested as well. An additional stepwise process is under development for age-gender adjustments. Several major polygon-centroid approaches have been tested for the assignment of locations of data. For prototype of US grid maps, the grid used to cover the US measures 2750 mi max E-W (width) x 2575 mi N-S max; this rectangle produced a grid with cells of approx. 25 mi x 25 mi (lat-change related fine tunings are still in process). ICDs to be testing include those for diseases/conditions with known regional (SW US age-defined post-retirement age ICDs, Great Lakes area child-mother ICD associations determine using previous mapping techniques), or lat-long relationships (i.e. Cold-induced hemagglutination syndromes, heat exhaustion, MS), and conditions with cultural relations defined physiologically (ICD9 based African cardiomyopathy 425.2, Takotsubo 429.83 ), socioculturally and SES-related (V15.81 non-compliance), or culturally-bound syndromes (i.e. ICD9 729.2* infibulation, SUNDS).

Research: A SAS-based Disease Mapping Technique
 The 3D grid modeling formula developed for use of SAS to correlate the results for three measures per patient can be applied to the development of a simple grid-like layout of cases and their metrics. This serves as a substitute for SAS/GIS when SAS/GIS is not available. Since it produces maps fairly quickly, the lack of GIS related programming serves more as a benefit than a hinderance. The disadvantages to this technique is that it is not as easily used to produce anything beyond the simple 3D mapping process, such as a map used for developing intervention programs based on lat-long features or defining methods for interventions based on locations of facilities. The model this method produces serves simply as a 3D grid or surface projection of the results produced. Incidence and prevalence are usually the best mapped spatial epidemiological features using this methodology, although population and sociological features like population percentages and average age or family size may be mapped as well. The primary requirement for this method is having some form of lat-long measures to implement this process. These are used to define the base grid (2 of the 3 axes) on the 3D formulas employed in SAS. The z-axis in turn is treated much like elevation and the plane produce is evaluated the same as a land surface feature. ICD or disease mapping can be handled in this fashion by first producing the data for individual diseases and any metrics related to those diseases, followed by the development of a means to cluster or grid map this data. The SAS formulas developed naturally produce these grids; the only decisions made by programmers pertains to grid cell size and how these are measured. The SAS formula then defines locations for each ofthe patients, which naturally are placed upon the grid cell centroid. Cobbled (barred), contour and surface versions can then be p[riduced using this methodology, in order to uncover peaks of incidence/prevalence. Age-gender adjustments may also be made for each cell as a part of this process. Two techniques and two formulas were developed to produce these 3D outcomes. Dec 2011–

Research: National Age-Gender Acute/Chronic Diseases Study
 Undisclosed.·Undisclosed. We typically consider acute diseases to be significantly different from chronic diseases. Acute diseases are at times considered a precursor to the more severe chronic disease state of similar clinical appearance. Age-gender analysis should demonstrate specific differences between acute and chronic disease distributions. A number of disease types were evaluated for this relationship. Some diseases like acute versus chronic pancreatitis demonstrate absolutely no statistically significant differences in age-gender distributions. Diseases with ICD codes defined in order to define states did demonstrate staging, such as the various levels of chronic renal, liver, heart and lung diseases. Acute versus chronic did not demonstrate these notable differences suggesting a difference in severity between the two. The possibility that acute and chronic diseases of the same organ state lack these differences suggests that age is a primary determinant of risk and severity, regardless of the cause for acute versus chronnic disease onsets. Causes are multiple, but tend to effect the human body around the same stage in life. Nov 2011–

Research: 3D modeling of population health statistics: Cost Analysis
 Undisclosed·Undisclosed Developed 3D modeling formulas and methods in SAS and SQL for population health based predictive modeling of populations with specific age-gender profiles. Cuboidal, false cube, and surfaceplot techniques developed. Applied to cost-patient copay data as potential deterrent to health care. A unique relationship between cost and prevalence-incidence [PI] exists. Mortality reduces numbers of patients following peak age for PI of about 52-57. Surviving patients begin to accrue costs for continued health health. These costs increase exponentially and maximize at an age between 65 and 85 years of age for most companies and insurers. Cost and # cases are inversely proportional and demonstrate a fairly predictable stable relationship to which costs and risk can be assigned based on ICD type, age and gender. Location plays a small role in defining these outcomes when regions tested are large (multistate). Much smaller regions may demonstrate socioeconomically based differences in cost for long term care, as well as likelihood for survival into these older, high cost years. Nov 2011–
Dec 2011 
Research: National Age-Gender Population Health Study, By Regions with Potential Physiographic Influence
 15-24 regions of the US were identified based on a review of Census Bureau, NCQA and other Federal standards. Regions were evaluated and compared with the rest of the country for statistically significant Incidence/Prevalence differences. Temperature, climate, humidity, latitude, topography, and local land use type are expected to influence each of these disorders in some ways. Large regions were defined reducing likelihood for topographic infoluences, but regions defined by unique features such as lat, proximity to ocean, neotropical settings, were evaluated for specific diseases possibly linked to these settings. The folowing potentially regional diagnoses were evaluated: Cold-induced hemagglutination, lyme disease, stroke, heat exposure, exhaustion, and stroke, Raynaud&apos;s Syndrome, asthma, UR disorders. Nov 2011–

Research: 3D modeling of SIC population statistics
 Undisclosed·Undisclosed Developed 3D modeling formulas and methods in SAS and SQL for&gt;100 companies,&gt;6.5M patients, reclassifying them into Standard Industrial Classification derived groups. These groups were used to define types of population health risks expected due to very unique age-gender distributions that exist between different SIC groups. This in turn may be used for predictive modeling of population based on SIC class and specific age-gender profiles. (SIC methodology derived from Chemical Release Sites studies for the state of Oregon, ca. 1997-2006, in which SIC reclass was used to categorize chemical profiles of site chemical releases, see http://brianaltonenmph.com/3-gis-environmental-health/confirmed-release-inventory-cri-sites/a-sic-based-sites-classification-process/.)

Research: The frequency and prevalence behaviors of a controversial African-american cultural practice: infibulation and other female genital surgical practices
 Evaluated an exceptionally large US health database for a very rare medical condition ICD-9 entry. Genital manipulation practices involving male and female individuals was assessed for its age-gender distribution for a ten year period. Identified gender-specifc age differences in culturally defined male and female genital manipulation practices. For example, infibulation, labial reduction, and clitorectomy practices, 4 peak age groups were uncovered demonstrating several possible intercultural relationships with these unique procedures, two of which were commonly engaged in quite recently within US facilities. The highest risk groups of American citizenship age females were found to be 1-4 yo female infants/children and 30-37 yo mid-life women, many or most of whom were surgically modified in a US setting. This methodology defined four high risk age groups for which specific intervention procedures may be developed. Aug 2011–
Dec 2011 
Research: National Age-Gender Psychosomatic Syndromes and Health Prevention/Health Promotion Study
 Undisclosed.·Undisclosed. Utilized new SAS/SQLs to define age-gender distributions for a number of ICDs and Behavior related Health conditions with significant quality of life impacts on adults of the older working class age (45-54 and 55-64). These ICDs demonstrated very gender specific prevalence distributions, some with F onset 10 years after male peak age onset, a few with the opposite age effect. Male peaks were almost always in their 20s, female peaks almost always in their mid-40s. ICDs evaluation included Diabetes, Lower Back Pain, GERD, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Crohn&apos;s Disease, etc. Results suggests there is a universal age-gender relationship involved stress and personal disease management resulting in identical morbidity-mortality effects regardless of disease type for these specific types of diseases or disorders.

ICDs with Old Age specific onset include parkinsonism, emphysema, diabetic retinopathy, atrial fibrillation, hyperkinesthesia, some leukemias, brochiectasis, the various dementias, degenerative nerve disorders, renal failure and ESRD. Those with 45+ mid-age onset include Takatsubo syndrome, glaucoma, COPD, AMI, various prostate conditions, neuropathies, PAN, myasthenia gravis, tinnitus, lower back pain, psoriasis, menier&apos;s disease, dupuytren&apos;s contractions. Metabolic syndrome and numerous other early to mid-age onset diseases tend to display reductions in age due to mortality rates, and psychosomatic influences on these conditions. These include the well correlated diagnoses of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, fibromyalgia, GERD, IBS, Insomnia. Several disease with identical long term outcomes due to biological degenerative causes (early mortality) include chronic liver disease, heart failure, rheumatism. A number of age-limited diseases were also noted--those which demonstrate little to no prevalence as the population ages. These include fatal diseases, such as CLD, certain forms of heart disease, sarcoidosis, but especially migraine (65 yo cut-off). Jul 2011–

Research: Regional ICD-based Incidence/Prevalence Disease Research of the US: Age-Gender Modeling
 Undisclosed.·Undisclosed. 15-24 regions of the US were identified based on a review of Census Bureau, NCQA and other Federal standards. Regions were independently evaluated for prevalence/incidence for 160+ common high cost diseases. Specific regions were found to have specific age groups clustering, with SE, NE, Upper Midwest, Central SE demonstrating statistically significant differences in age-gender distributions. One region demonstrated high numbers of retirees, two others high child-mother counts and relationships at the family/household level. The southern half of NE was found to have people close to retirement age bearing high I rates mimicking those of the older age group situated in the SE. This methodology proposed for use in regional disease monitoring techniques. Jun 2011–

Research: National Statistics for Culturally-bound syndromes
 Integrative Population Health Modeling Undisclosed National Health Database company. Extremely controversial project. Analyzed well over 100 million people health dataset for Culturally-bound syndromes and medical conditions linked to specific ethnic groups. Developed innovative approach to modeling these diseases, even though many are exceptionally rare and not often reported. Age-gender distributions for related ICD-9 classifications for these conditions were analyzed, and prevalence curves developed for individuals diagnosed with these conditions; developed a unique series of formulas used to compare 1-year age-gender distributions to theoretical ICD-9 assignment for condition for individuals with ages provided by electronic medical records. Statistically analyzed validity for this ICD-9 class based on other applications for same ICD identifier. ICD-9 distributions do not match reported case age-gender distributions. Syndromes for which ICD-9 codes could be assigned were evaluated, including SUNDS, Takotsubo syndrome, African Cardiomyopathy, Factitious Disorder, Pibloktoq, Uqamairineq, and Demonic Possession.

Research: A new way to document and measure prevalence of shaken baby syndrome and other child abuse practices
 Undisclosed.·Undisclosed. Integrative Population Health Modeling Team. Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of severe child abuse were evaluated for the youngest age group. The rates for regional dislocation of elbow were found to be extremely helpful regional indicators of local infant abuse procedures. Due to their physical diagnosis nature, elbow dislocations are more likely to be reported or recorded than child abuse procedures involving children&lt;3yo such as shaken baby syndrome and battered child syndrome. Statistics developed for this methodology match 2005 national findings. Prevalence rates measures for elbow dislocations graphed in 1-year ranges for more than 100 million patients of normal age distribution for the US working class population were more useful in defining regional differences than actual abuse related ICD-9 entries placend in electronic medical records. This methodology also allows for statistical evaluations to be made per 1year age bracket. Methodology was also applied to other forms of child abuse identified by ICDs. This methodology is a continuation of the research process developed for the National Health dataset evaluated since 2010. Jun 2011–

Research: New Techology-New Chronic Disease Management Techniques
 Undisclosed employer/location. Integrative Population Health Modeling team. The 1-year Age-gender population techniques developed were applied to several chronic diseases in order to more accurately define specific gender and age differences related to the planning of intervention programs. Specific one-year age peaks could be defined for certain chornic diseases suggesting that age groups to undergo preventive health practices are substantially different across genders (i.e. MS, many heart diseases, schizophrenia). Other ICD groups evaluated demonstrated smaller gender differences (epilepsy), and others no age related difference in gender related incidence-prevalence findings (diabetes). These age-gender pyramids can be used to develop a more targeted intervention program. Jan 2011–

Research: National Age-Gender Acute/Chronic Diseases Study
 Undisclosed.·Undisclosed. We typically consider acute diseases to be significantly different from chronic diseases. Acute diseases are at times considered a precursor to the more severe chronic disease state of similar clinical appearance. Age-gender analysis should demonstrate specific differences between acute and chronic disease distributions. A number of disease types were evaluated for this relationship. Some diseases like acute versus chronic pancreatitis demonstrate absolutely no statistically significant differences in age-gender distributions. Diseases with ICD codes defined in order to define states did demonstrate staging, such as the various levels of chronic renal, liver, heart and lung diseases. Acute versus chronic did not demonstrate these notable differences suggesting a difference in severity between the two. The possibility that acute and chronic diseases of the same organ state lack these differences suggests that age is a primary determinant of risk and severity, regardless of the cause for acute versus chronnic disease onsets. Causes are multiple, but tend to effect the human body around the same stage in life. Aug 2010

Research: Design of a methodology for assessing Level 4 (clinical performance) and Level 5 (population health) impacts of Continuing Education programs targeting physicians, allied health care providers and health care administrators (GIS utilization)
 Biostatistics, Postgraduate medical education Denver, CO GIS utilization methods were developed in order to initiate methods for assessing population health features in relation to areal population health information for a Florida health care system with a well-defined managed care members pool. State and county health data are assessed in order to determine overall regional population health features, Census block and block group data are assessed for use in monitoring possible impacts of service location and gender-age-ethnicity to specific population health needs for the study region. Primary subgroups with medical needs are identified, and specific HEDIS and non-HEDIS (i.e. NCQA) institutional measures were defined for use in testing whether or not population and clinical performance changes took place. Whether or not these changes are statistically significant is also assessed using 2x2 chi squared analysis. Changes brought about at the patient-physician level in relation to the topics focused on in CE programs are then quantified by a similar approach. The overall goal of this project is to design education programs that meet local population needs in such a way that their impact can be measured. This will improve the ability of local programs to satisfactorily meet the needs of the local population as required by their overseers. This population health GIS research method may be used to demonstrate the kinds of improvements that take place at the local level, but also be used to quantify the most effective intervention techniques to be used on a per population/per special needs basis. Additional measures were taken of non-local service-related needs and provisions, such as the use of local cancer programs by non-local members or outside patients. Whereas state and county data help provide a baseline value for use in comparing outcomes for this project at large scale regional levels, the best means for quantifying outcomes locally was found to be defining specific areas with measurable outcomes. These areas require significant population loads, may be more block-group based rather than block-based, and may require that baseline values for each region be determined before assessing the region for changes in outcomes measured at some later date. For the most part, all measures were made using methods previously accepted in other NCQA programs performed by outside information sources or providers. All analyses are carried out using the standard 2x2 chi squared methodology applied based on typical NCQA and internal QA measures standards. Sources for medical data for this study include state and county datasets, census and TIGER files datasets, US population health study outcomes, and local patient records accessed according to HIPAA standards, making use of an intermediary, sufficiently trained in this form of data gathering process in order to avoid IRR problems.

Research: Improving Time-cost efficiency when implementing large population surveys. Mann Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA predictive modeling techniques.
 Biostatistics, Postgraduate medical education Denver, CO Tested the implementation of a Mann Whitney tool used to measure population change involving 5000+ respondent groups, with max group size = 33,000 for group 1 (pre) + group 2 (post) programs. Study demonstrated that surveys of 300 to 1500 are all that are needed to quantify population responses and measure the efficacy of an education program. Due to typical human response behaviors, researching large populations for responses does not demonstrate any significant change in improvements or overall outcomes based on the use of standard Mann Whitney and KW ANOVA pre-post measures. This was determined to be a phenomenon of respondent numbers and is highly dependent upon the ratio of response counts for the two survey outcomes. A ratio&lt;3:1 (#group 1:#group 2, or #group 2:#group 1) is the determining factor in measuring group changes, not absolute numbers once group 1+group 2&gt;300. When ratios are&lt;3:1 (or 1:3), variance in response patterns and statistical P (p) outcomes demonstrate greater changes in outcomes dependent upon small changes in population size. The minimal difference between a pre/post survey of 50 pre + post, with post responses ranging from&lt;20 to 15,000 response counts with identical response patterns, demonstrated no difference in final conclusions drawn about the overall success of a program. Final averages may vary slightly, but conclusions drawn based upon final P (p) values do not. Variances in response patterns when ratios are&lt;3:1 (or 1:3) become unpredictable, making this predictive modeling technique unstable and in need for adjustments in methodologies. Apr 2008–

Research: Predictive Modeling of Outcomes based on very low response counts.
 Biostatistics, Postgraduate medical education Denver, CO Typically, educational programs with exceptionally low response patterns cannot be easily evaluated using standard pre-post analysis techniques. This review began with the question: can larger group sizes with identical theoretical outcomes be used to predict the failure or success of an educational program. Outcomes for approximately 20 programs were evaluated using base data (n&lt;40 for pre or post group). The outcomes for these theoretically identical programs with identical outcomes were then compared, based on increasing sizes for respondent populations. This demonstrated that identical response patterns duplicated for much larger populations can be used to predict a program&apos;s outcome, assuming responses are representative of a typical human population and will undergo little change as numbers of respondents increases. (At a corporate level, this provides a better, more accurate outcome required for reports to grantors and education providers; at an academic level, this assumption is arguably problematic, and is dependent upon the homogeneityhomoscedasticity of human response patterns from one study population size to the next.)

Research: Design of an automated system for calculating statistical outcomes by comparing two datasets
 Denver Health·Denver Health Managed Care·Denver Health Quality Assurance·Denver, CO Standardized projects typically require identical analytic steps to produce their final reports. Examples of such programs include the NCQA measures and reporting requirements for quality assessment of managed care programs, reviews of populations served by PPO and non-PPO (POS, FFS) health insurance providers, and the typical Medicaid and Medicare subsidized health care/health maintenance programs. Due to these standardized measuring techniques, the calculation process can be automated for most of these programs. This enables time spent to consist primarily of data entry and report writing processes. In theory, the use of an automated data processing tool or system frees up time for more careful planning, presentation techniques and final reports to be developed. This also provides additional time for the development of prevention programs, with the goal of improving future outcomes of your studies as required by Medicaid, Medicare, NCQA, and other institutional overseers, and strongly advocated by various gatekeepers and HEDIS measure monitoring agencies and providers. The development of this analytic tools consists of the following sections or worksheets: readme; dataentry; datacopy; counters; data processors/recoders; statistical analyzers; outcomes summary page (text generated information), pasted information, and final reporting page. The most important worksheet in this methodology is/are the analyzer(s) (more than one may be needed). This worksheet has to include the most basic forms of statistical analysis (all of which are automatically calculated) such as 2x2 chi squared, an Exp-Obs chi test analyzer, a 2 x n chi squared matrix format, a median test and Hake&apos;s score calculator, a linest/slope analyzer if/when applicable, one or more t-Test and ANOVA pages, a matched pair producer programmed to recognize when this method may be used, Pearson&apos;s and/or Spearman&apos;s coefficient calculators, a KW ANOVA analyzer (if applicable), McNemar&apos;s and Cochrane&apos;s calculators, and sections devoted to standardized informative data such as means, standard deviations, max, min, variance, 95% dataset average, mode, etc., etc.; graphs are typically added at the beginning and ends of these reports or their appropriate sections. The purpose of the datacopy sheet is defined as a possible filtering, reassigned value, or reclassification agent. The report spreadsheet should be used to generate both a printable reporting page and an easy to use cut-and-paste display of information for inclusion into standard handouts that require this information at an institutional/company-based reporting level. This methodology is capable of cutting report development time down significantly, usually down to one-tenth the original work and time requirements. The use of this method provides significant improvements in project management-related analytic time commitments, speeds up productivity, and allows for continued updates and improvements in the work process to be made. In many cases, data entry may be undertaken by one individual, and reporting by another. The allows the analyst to spend more time further developing his/her research and analysis methodologies.

Research: A Hexagonal Grid Algorithm for Spatially Analyzing Epidemiologic Data (GIS)
 Community Health·Portland State University·Community Health Portland, OR/Denver, CO Traditional GIS grids make use of square cells, which have a nearest neighbor/proximity-induced error due to objects placed in the corners of each cell. To overcome this error, hexagonal grids are the best means to document space over specific locations when relating two underlying spatial features expressed as points. This spatial analysis technique was introduced by Walter Cristaller in 1933 (Die zentralen Orte in Süddeutschland. Jena: Gustav Fischer). By offsetting hexagonal grids and statistically manipulating these overlays, one can improve the resolution of the analysis method and approximate moving window or moving circle methods of spatial analysis. To produce a hexagonal grids algorithm, a specific series of recurring equations were used to define two series of nodes or centroids in alternating fashion. This project resulted in the development of a tool with which grid cell nodes and centroids can be defined based on predetermined cell edge size for distance plots, cell diameter/radius (for distance/area plots), or cell area (for areal plots). The result of this equation is the production of lat-longs required for the production of a hexagonal polygon grid map, that can be plotted over a research area. By incorporating the Theissen polygon equation into this process, centroids are converted into polygons and a final hexagonal grid is produced. Grids of various sizes were reviewed and applied to documenting the spatial distribution of toxic waste sites in relation to other point data such as census block centroids, public landuse/meeting sites data, neighboring site lat-longs, and cancer case data. By re-running this shapefile program 4 times one can produce several hexagonal cell grid maps that can be merged to form a much higher resolution end product. The spatial accuracy of this combined high resolution grid mapping technique was compared with resolution/spatial error of other traditional epidemiological spatial studies such as moving circle and moving window techniques. This sophisticated method of spatial analysis enables more helpful epidemiological studies to be performed without the problems attached to square grid analysis techniques or the limitations placed on users by moving circle/moving window programs. This type of control strengthens and fine tunes the outcomes of such studies and prevents the likelihood of error that can arise from other more traditional square grid mapping techniques. Jan 2005–

Research: The Fishkill Creek Watershed Study (GIS) for West Nile
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Fishkill, NY/Poughkeepsie, NY Approximately 25 miles of the Fishkill watershed were mapped using ArcView 3.2 GIS. The study area was defined using a 1.5 mile buffer area on each side of the river; this distance was chosen because it approximated the maximum range for the immediate or terrace 1 floodplain region along this lower Dutchess County river. Analyses were performed linearly along the river, as close as possible to its edges, and as a 1 mile transect drawn across a southeastern flood plain section which included both developed and undeveloped areas (housing developments, roads, field, oak-maple woodlands, wetland, and marshland ecosystems). This data was superimposed on DEM and topographic surface (SRTM) maps, and areas below 500&apos;elevation selected for future analysis. IDRISI tools were then used to develop a Slope and Aspect map; this was used to define regions of high and low west nile vector activity risk. Assumptions made: high exposure areas are less likely to harbor vectors, low exposure canopied areas with slope&lt;5 are most likely. All data was then imported back into ArcView and the final analysis completed using ArcView Spatial Analyst. Based on these initial steps, a risk map could be developed for use in identifying the best locations along the Fishkill Creek for total creek and floodplain transect studies. For the transect study, the following outcomes were obtained: 1) a trendline equation with Rsq = .998 for an exponential decay rate of vector species capture density based on trap productivity relative to distance from stream edge, 2) a trendline equation with Rsq = .953 for a linear decay rate of vector species counts based on trap productivity relative to distance from edge, and 3) a trendline equation with Rsq = .9999 for an inverse exponential decay rate of vector species biodiversity relative to distance from edge. For the linear study, a grid map was produced depicting risk across a floodplain surface based on 3D modeling outcomes. Further use of this map could be made by adding NLCD information to the project. Based on the NLCD legend, area class 33 (transitional) was highest risk when placed next to a waterway, pastoral fieldedge or deciduous/evergreen forest. Sep 2003–

Research: Identifying the source of an Aedes vexans Public Nuisance Swarm (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY In mid-August 2003, a public complaint was filed regarding a dense swarm of mosquitoes just outside the most populated portion of the largest city in the county. Inspection of the area failed to uncover the possible source for this public health nuisance. For remediation of this problem to commence, we had to document the source(s) of the swarm. As a result, traps were set approximately every 0.05 miles north, south, east, and west of the complainant&apos;s residence, with the furthest traps situated about 1.25 miles to the south, 0.5 miles to the east, and 1.0 miles to the north (the river edge formed the western boundary of this research area). Approximately 75 feet to the west of the complainant&apos;s residence was the Hudson River shoreline. After just two collections of trapped specimens (3 days into the study), a possible location for the source of this swarm could be proposed (the other side of the fence surrounding property owned by the city and monitored by subcontractees). Traps were then set around the immediate boundary of this property, resulting in the densest capture of Ae. vexans for the season (ca. 2000+ insects per day per trap). Field inspection revealed that the swarm was concentrated on a partially wooded setting, private property situated just east of complainant&apos;s residence and downwind from some fenced off private property. A city sanitary officer was contacted and entrance to the source location obtained. Source for the swarm was still not immediately identifiable, but opening a mancover in the center of this property exposed an Ae. vexans larvae/pupae-rich stagnant water pool. Grasses growing in the adjacent field edge had a slime-like covering suggesting a recent spill of sewage materials from an old late 19th C storage container situated within the adjacent building (just uphill from the cleaning facilities that dump decontaminated water into the river). Simple bar plots and density contours on the map show Aedes captures to be statistically related to the distance from this site, verifying the source for this swarm. Sep 2003–

Research: West Nile Surveillance: The Wappingers Creek Watershed Study (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health/Public Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY Approximately 26 miles of the Wappingers Creek watershed was mapped using ArcView 3.2 GIS. Along this creek, 20 trap site locations were set from 1999 to 2003. Due to distinct differences in upper versus lower watershed land use patterns, ecologic comparisons could be made between undeveloped and developed regions of these parts of the watershed. Outcomes were compared with a similar study engaged in along the Fishkill Creek. Species and number of mosquito captures were found to be 5 to 10 times greater in the lower portion of this study area than the upper portion; the highest densities of potential vectors were found halfway between the main river (Hudson River) and the main urban area (Wappingers Falls village). Comparing this with outcomes of the Fishkill Creek study, it can be concluded that broad floodplains with minimal slope change across a large area (1 mi x 1-2 mi) play an important role in vector species persistance and survival. Reasons for this relationship of surface topography to vector density have to relate to one or more factors. i.e. a) flat surfaces increase the possibility of tree growth and canopy maturation, b) flat surfaces provide the soil and topographic features needed for water stagnation and the puddling and wetlands development required by mosquitoes, and c) flat surfaces are reasons for increases in human population density due to human settlement behaviors, an ecologic process learned by mosquitoes which has impacts on future reproduction/egg-laying location processes. Unlike Fishkill Creek vector findings, the more urbanized Wappingers Creek setting consists primarily of Culex pipiens-restuans hybrid species and almost no Cx. pipiens. Until urbanization is replaced by farming rural community settings further upstream, this dominance in species patterns remains an important high risk west nile feature of the area. The Fishkill creek demonstrates a similar transition in species patterns, with Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. pipiens-restuans more naturalized in the lower heavily rural/sub-urban Fishkill Creek setting, converting to Cx. pipiens alone in the eastmost rural settings. In sum, the primary finding is: Culex pipiens-restuans favors urbanized regions, with species conversion to Cx. pipiens and some Cx. restuans in the most rural sections of the study region. The incidence of west nile positive findings in either host, vector or human populations may be directly related to this change in Culex species biodiversity. Aug 2003–

Research: Grid and Raster Imagery Applications to West Nile Surveillance (GIS/RS)
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR/Poughkeepsie, NY Small area analyses of a 150m x 900m area (2 forest-based homesteading properties) were performed of 12 mosquito trapping sites, with positive West Nile virus test results found for animal hosts, humans, and/or mosquitoes in this location. Focus was on landuse history, NLCD GIS data, vegetation patterns raster imagery (Landsat, AVHRR-derived, and other sources), and results of field work done on local hydrologic and vegetation/plant ecology data. Arc-polygon-based basemaps, gridmaps, elevation data maps, and raster images were overlaid, merged and then converted to rasters (vec-ras conversion) with greatly improved resolution (&lt;20 ft x 20 ft cells). This resolution was field-verified and the data then analyzed using IDRISI for identification of hydrophytoecologic systems, defined using non-supervised classification systems and supervised classification systems derived from field tests and photographs. Canopy/subcanopy and other vegetation features were related to surveillance findings and then correlated back to specific demographic, transportation, property line, and landuse data features. Seven vegetation areas were defined, enabling west nile ecology/vector-host activities to be related to NDVI-AVHRR-reflection based vegetation pattern information. Trend analyses were performed treating entire rasterized area like a 3D surface; this enabled high risk areas to be identified based on vegetation and demographic features. Species diversity and richness equations (IDRISI-based) were then attempted in order to relate vector activity to vegetation type (tree canopy) domains, with the goal of defining the most effective trapping locations and canopy requirements for high density vector sites. IDRISI was also used to define specific subgroups of these areas throughout the testing area defined by supervised classification methods. Steps taken in this analysis included resampling, reclassification, development of thiessen polygons for trap settings, biodiversity analysis, relative richness test, cluster analysis, subcomponent analysis of reclassed images, a texture analysis of foliage distribution for 8 classes of regions, development of linear, quadratic, and cuboidal surface models used to define disease/species trends for study area. Goodness of Fit measures were made of all trend modeling surfaces produced. Jul 2003–

Research: Field Investigation for Possible Vector(s) of a Local Malaria Case (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY/Rhinebeck, NY The onset of a malaria case was reported to County Health Department, resulting in concerns that a local disease nidus might exist. The source of the case was an international summer camp for high school and undergraduate college students from Western Europe, India, South America, Africa, the Soviet Union, and Asia. Field inspection revealed the most likely source for possible malaria vectors was a small circular pond/lake formed from a glacial ice melt several thousand years ago. This water body was considerably deep for its radial size (&gt;15&apos;depth, bowl-like, and ca. 70 feet diameter). The entire water body was shaded by a considerable amount of Acer and Fraxinus tree cover. Larva inspection of the lake along the entire shoreline revealed several Anopheles species: in particular An. quadrimaculatus, which is fairly common to this New York setting. Traps were set on each of four shore line locations around this pond, and specimens were collected for shipping to Walter Reed laboratories. Malaria-positive samples were not identified, suggesting the local malaria case was brought to the state from the victim&apos;s homestead in India. This was the second year a case of malaria was diagnosed in this summer camp setting. Jun 2003–

 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Rhinebeck, NY The documentation of a number of positive testing hosts (crow, corvus) and history of a local human possibly infected by local sources led to a review of the area&apos;s urban setting where the most recent + testing corvus was found. Since there were no significant stagnant water sources, underground culvert pipes situated along the roadway were suspected. To test these sites, traps were set in and around the small urban setting, with larva testing performed throughout the city (central village area) as well. The predominant species in culvert and settling chambers were Culex spp., suggesting possible origination of local cases from this water source, which often was found to remain saturated during the warmest days of the season. This finding led to testing of all culvert sites in or near heavily populated settings and settings with high risk populations for the remaining part of the year. No positive testing vector populations were uncovered. The positive testing corvus specimens identified in this region have traditionally been considered fly-ins. Jun 2003–

Research: Disease Surveillance related to a Positive Testing Human West Nile Case (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY One of the first documented positive testing human west nile victims in the county (2004) could not be linked by the epidemiologic surveillance team to a potential source for this west nile based on the travel history of the victim. This person (m&gt;65 yo) had no history of travel and for the most part was homebound. To uncover or rule out probable immediate, local origin, a series of traps were set around the individual&apos;s home. A small area map was developed and shapefiles produced of the home, yard and nearby landuse, drainage, and water features, using ArcView 3.2. This map was then used to observe and monitor the spatial behaviors of both hosts and vectors in this ecosetting. Six species of mosquito were trapped in the immediate area, with Uranotaenia sappharina (frog-dependent, non-human vector activity) and Aedes trivitattus found to be the predominant local species. Competition against the primary suspect carrier resulted in an uncertain outcome statistically, but suggests vector species biodiversity could have prevented the human infection from being of local origin. However, a pool of the possible vector species for this region, Culex (Cx.) pipiens-restuans, was found immediately adjacent to a woodlands swamp approximately 75 feet from the residence, suggesting possible transmission of this disease due to Corvus host-Cx. vector interactions. This specimen did not test positive for west nile and no positive testing culex species have since been identified. May 2003–

Research: Shoreline Distribution of West Nile-related Mosquito species along an Estuary (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY The Saltmarsh mosquito (Ochlerotatus (Aedes) sollicitans) is known to carry west nile in several urban regions situated along the Atlantic Coast near New York City. Whether or not this brackish water species resides further inland along the estuarine Hudson River, where west nile GIS studies were being performed, was uncertain to local public health and mosquito experts. For this reason, a GIS study of this aspect of west nile ecology was implemented. A series of traps were placed immediately adjacent to the 45 miles of shoreline along the Hudson River in Dutchess County. 43 traps were placed with the greatest distance between trap sites equal to 5 miles from its nearest shoreline neighbor; all traps for this study were placed with 0.25 miles from the shoreline; duplicate traps were set in many places to determine if small distance changes impacted species patterns in trapping activities. These traps had an average distance of 77 feet from the shoreline, with 7 significant outliers; each area had at least 2 traps set, one&lt;25&apos;and the other&gt;25&apos;from the shoreline. Fifteen highly successful test areas were found, with many of these areas bearing 2 or more sites in close proximity and with varying sun-exposure, surface microclimate settings. A total of forty-three trap sites were used for this study; trap types included CO2-black-light (85% of traps set and counted), non-CO2 gravid (12%), and a Faye&apos;s trap (3%). Variations in trap locations most frequently tested include: 1) proximity to water surface (&lt;25 feet and 50-100 feet trap placement), 2) presence/absence of field versus forest edge near water, and 3) transect-like trap placement of 3 or more traps situated from&lt;25 to&gt;500 ft from river edge along open space (for inland flowing swarm detection). The most detailed area used for this test also included use of a linear (north-south transect laid parallel to river&apos;s edge) and a grid pattern for set-ups (approximately 20 trap sites set in a 0.25 x 1.25 mile area). RESULTS: None of these trap captures contained the brackish water species Os. sollicitans. Inland versus shoreline trap capture revealed a tendency for Aedes trivexans to reside more inland than Ae. trivittatus. Transect analysis resulted in the detection of several swarm patterns in shorelines adjacent to 9 urban settings. For one of these settings, a grid system had to be employed to monitor the local swarm activity. Apr 2003–

Research: Applications of Photometry to West Nile Surveillance (GIS)
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR/Poughkeepsie, NY A hand-held quantum meter device (mfr. Spectrum Technologies) was used to measure sunlight penetration of shrub and forest canopies (photosynthetic photon flux) with the goal of relating light penetration features to vector activity. All 183 sites (trapped 2000 to 2003) were ecologically surveyed using a standardized 3 page form. Overall qualitative data entries focused on weather, temperature, humidity, hydrologic, and topographic features. Quantitative data focused on vegetation counts and photometric readings. Sites were then grouped/reclassified based on temperate, vegetation and canopy features for comparison of photometric readings in relation to trapping activity. Sites with&gt;600 uJoules (uJ= mmole per m per sec) represent fully exposed areas with ranges of sunlight varying from 600 uJ/s (cloudy skies) to 1500 uJ/s (summertime midday, overhead sunlight, no clouds); typical sunny days produced readings ranging from 900-1200 uJ. Sites with&lt;30 uJ are typically forest floor/subcanopy (i.e. conifer, heavy deciduous settings), with photometric readings as low as fluctuating 2-5 uJ at ground level (&lt;2&apos;elevation above ground surface). Productive sites were required to have&lt;300 uJ, with partial (speckling) to minimal light penetration (20-50 uJ); the most productive sites ranged from 30 uJ to 200 uJ. Sites with&lt;20 uJ produced little trapping activity and are perhaps non-productive due to need for vectors to migrate outward into more open areas at dusk and dawn for mating and feeding activities. In terms of methodology: all measures were made using several sampling techniques. Both grid (5&apos;x5&apos;cell) over a 15-25 foot surrounding area, and centroid-circle (var. 6-12&apos;radius) pattern techniques were employed. During a review of this data, the use of centroid data alone for correlation with species type and counts was found to be the least reliable method based on correlation matrix analyses of light measure:vector species counts. However, combined centroid-circle data was found to be fairly reliable, and was only surpassed slightly by correlations made using surrounding circle data alone. Even though grid data was also effective, the larger number of measures required to perform this type of measure, and the impact of surrounding vegetation and landforms of data gathering techniques, made it a less applicable and less reliable as a field testing technique. In several cases, transect (linear) measures were also taken from full-exposure to protected area to test out their usefullness. These outcomes were found to be very unreliable, providing little to no futher insight into overall vector activity and ecologic features. Second finding: several species types were found to favor high light exposure regions (&gt;450 uJ areas); none of these are known to be west nile carriers. Jan 2003–

Research: Depicting and Mapping the Evolution of Plantae with ArcGIS
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR/Denver, CO GIS was used to relate environmental and human/biogeography to taxonomy, evolution and secondary-tertiary metabolite chemistry. Spatial relationships are drawn between climate, topography, landscape patterns, hydrography, geomorphology, especiation, population density, phytochemistry, ethnobotany, and the history of plant utilization by nature and mankind. Reviewed more than 250 categories of plant use, based on 76 primary-secondary chemical pathways producing 300+ major phytochemical/ethnobotany/pharmacology groups. A basemap of the evolutionary tree was then related to traditional geographic basemaps of the study regions. A method was then developed and tested for automatically superimposing the evolutionary tree with ecologic base maps for research-related uses in the lab/office setting. Oct 2002–

Research: Density and clustering of dead crows in relation to demography and landuse patterns (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY To differentiate the spatial distribution of infected dead crows (west nile hosts) and uninfected dead crows, the density of crow sitings, reports and test samples gathered were evaluated using moving window point count and kriging techniques. Concentrations in heavily populated urban-suburban regions were found to be less likely to be spatially associated with positive species- or host-test outcomes than concentrations related to certain low population, rural/ecologic (mostly wetland) settings (Chi sq&gt;3.84, p&lt;0.05). This methodology made use of ArcView 3.2 Spatial Analyst in combination with several ArcAvenue extensions. Sep 2002–

Research: A Transcendentalist Interpretation of Epilepsy
 Portland State University·Geography/Public Health·Portland State University Complementary/Alternative Medicine Special Interest Group·Portland, OR What does transcendentalism have to do with epilepsy? Transcendentalism and transcendental beliefs form a basic part of the mindbody healing tradition. Documented causes and links between epilepsy, seizures, seizure control and alternative methods for seizure prevention such as biofeedback, suggest the application of certain aspects of neotranscendental thinking to the control of ongoing epilepsy may be influential, if not healing. In transcendentalism, one blames the psychological consequences of&quot;bad health&quot;on improper individual experience and its resulting thought processes, emotional consequences, behaviors and practices. In a transcendental sense, the lack of flexibility in establishing one&apos;s paradigm about the health state, itself, becomes a part of that illness experience and as a consequence begins to dominate in eliciting the changes to survive with epilepsy, much less any other chronic condition. As a consequence, one&apos;s future health experience and health status depend on one&apos;s own belief system regarding illness and its meaning. This interpretation in turn not only helps to explain why the epilepsy experience becomes more predictable and frequent at times, it also explains how and why mindbody behaviors utilizing emotional, mental, spiritual and psychic triggers can be effective at laying new paths to reduction in seizures. Ultimately, for one to deal with such a state, the&quot;illness&quot;has to become less a condition of the brain and body as regular medicine likes to interpret it, and more one of mind, brain, and the resulting human experience. This review of transcendentalism relates both the Pavlovian-like (perceived risk), biopsychological interpretations to the more community-social Eriksonian interpretation of illness as an important part of the life experience. At times, chronic conditions, states, illnesses and disease can be interpreted as an important part of the human experience route for one to take, pass through, and then leave behind as a part of the past. Unfortunately, not many people with chronic afflictions like epilepsy interpret their state of being in this fashion within western society. This transcendental belief model is not simply the practice of traditional transcendental practices popular since the 1960s. Rather, it is a new form of transcendentalism, in part defined by Eriksonian writers, the primary goal of which is to better define the different stages in life one goes through and succeed in taking those routes. By passing through these stages and at some point transcending the normal life practices, one is better prepared to experience a potentially lifelong illness. Or better yet, by experiencing whatever positive long-term outcomes come your way due to this medical state, such an interpretation of managing and eliminating a potentially long-term condition like epilepsy becomes possible. In contemporary medical, epidemiologic and public health journals, this statement is supported by numerous articles published on epilepsy and the&quot;learned hopelessness&quot;hypothesis for seizure-linked depression cases. By interpreting such experiences in all other aspects of epilepsy in this fashion, one&apos;s life can evolve into an example of exceptional human potential experience, rather than an example of learned hopelessness or helplessness.

Research: Classification of West Nile Mosquito Trap Sites
 Portland State University·School of Community health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY More than 100 sites were defined for mosquito trapping by May 2002. A survey tool was developed for describing these sites and then applied to new sites established during the first half of the trapping season (May to October). This tool was improved slightly and then used to document the chief human and natural ecological features for the remaining sites trapped since 1999/2000. By the end of the season, approximately 120 sites were reviewed, mapped and evaluated using ArcView 3.2 GIS. This practice of site surveying and mapping was continued throughout the follow trapping season, resulting in 183 sites by 2004. This survey tool collected information regarding land use activities, neighborhood/local demographic patterns, proximity to water body or stream and description of this feature, a local comprehensive vegetation survey (ecosystem type, plant lists by genus and species for all groundcover, medium height to tall herbaceous, shrubs, young trees, crown/forest cover trees, tree canopy descriptions and estimated height, degree of sun-exposure/shadiness, land surface/topography type, and local urban setting type, the type of property/landuse the trap was placed on, trap types used, and reason(s) for selection of site for trap setting. Photographs were taken for each site. Major classification of site type and site selection processes resulted in several classification systems with site types defined by overall landuse, overall population density, overall ecological setting and primary reason for selection of location. Examples of reasons given for each site selected, in relation to this classification system include: potential +testing vector site, dead crow site, +testing dead crow site, potentially +human case site, crow migration/gathering site, proximity to waterbody/wetland, proximity to confirmed larva site, proximity to other trapping site, proximity to +test site, proximity to specific high risk landuse (i.e. livestock/horse farm) area, proximity to specific high risk community (i.e. retirement center), adjacent to urban (heavily populated high risk) area, proximity to dumping site (with high number of breeding receptacles), follow-up on complaints site. Specific site types had high correlations with species-specific trap productivity, in particular all river- and streambound species and several woodland/waterbody-specific species. Some correlations could be found for the west nile vector species (esp. Cx. pipiens-restuans) and land use/trap site type. An informational database of all of this site classification information obtained from the survey, includes genus and species specific plant ecology information, was developed for linkage to future GIS activities and submitted to the local epidemiologist GIS expert.

Research: Identifying a positive testing vector site based on positive testing host data (GIS)
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY/Portland, OR Late in 2002, a series of positive testing hosts (crow/Corvus sp.) were found focused within a five mile area. Due to disagreements regarding the source of these host deaths, ArcView 3.2 was implemented with the goal of identifying a positive testing vector source. To accomplish this, aerial photography was obtained of the suspected region, and numerous traps set using positive host sites to define the boundaries of the study region. Trap information was evaluated spatially and a weighted centroid used to define the most likely site of origin for the positive testing species; this centroid was first based on counts of the 4 most likely vector species captured (Culex pipiens, Cx. restuans, Cx. pipiens-restuans, and Aedes japonicus), and later redefined based on the weighted centroid for two possible positive testing vector species (Ae. japonicus and Cx. pip.-res.). Traps were set as close to the wetlands area as possible, resulting in trapping of the first positive testing vector species (Cx. pipiens-restuans). This region was then treated in accordance with state requirements (Bacillus thuringiensis containing corn granules). During the subsequent spring, retention of infected members of the mosquito species through successful overwintering led to documentation of the first and earliest positive testing site for the state, demonstrating the possibility of continued survival of infected species within the local environment. This was followed by reapplication of the Bacillus thuringiensis biological treatment. Jul 2002–

Research: Applications of GIS to matching SIC data with Toxic release site-related chemical release data (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR Utilizing chemical and site chemical release dataset produced for all Confirmed Release toxic release sites in the state of Oregon, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) data was used to compare and reclassify site chemical release history for correlation of chemical type and toxicity, and degree of carcinogenicity with particular SIC-derived reclasses. 450 sites were evaluated, resulting in more than 200 unique SICs; these SICs could be reclassified into 45 chemical release patterns based on the listing of chemicals and chemical types for each site. Some sites with significantly different SICs nevertheless had nearly identical release patterns (i.e. gasoline or petroleum product spills). Other SICs of similar range in value could be reclassed into a single group due to similar need for chemicals in their industrial processes (i.e. many secondary wood product manufacturers, such plywood/lumber manufactured products versus laminated/particle board industries). Still other classes which seemed related upon first glance (electronics vs. computer electronics, or raw wood/lumber industries vs. pulp/paper industries), were provided with different SIC reclass ids due to distinct chemical differences. A flowchart and table defining the reclass methodology was developed and then applied to all of these sites. Using this reclass method, site chemical data was compiled and each chemical type reclassified into several different chemical grouping methodologies (an example of this classification into groups: simple organics (simple solvents), simple inorganics, metal-derived products, combined organic-metals, benzenics, phenolics, halogenated benzenes, polycyclic aromatics, and undefined hydrocarbons, gasoline and petroleum products). Other classification systems broke the major groups into subcomponents (i.e. petroleum product type as stated by EPA information). Bar charts for each site could be mapped using these classification systems, producing maps with site type and location and a bar chart depicting amount of toxins released for each given site placed directly on the map. This enabled a site selection process to be developed, for each major subclass in order to correlate site chemistry and toxicty data with given SIC classes. This reclass data was also averaged out to produce and average release type and amount per site, data to be related to sites with known SIC information but no known or documented chemical release history. A similar methodology was then applied to site with unknown chemical history, by relating documented paper industry-release data in the studies CRI sites to other similar SIC reclass sites (i.e. paper-industry sites) in the state lacking adequate chemical release information. The different SIC classes were compared for reasonable outcomes, with some SIC reclass systems being nearly foolproof and other SIC reclasses demonstrating little statistical validity to the correlation. These SIC&quot;signatures&quot;(bar charts) for each site could be mapped to predict possible exposure histories for given areas with unknown release history, based on the reclassified SIC id assigned and related chemical signature linked to each site. This was later used to identify those areas most exposed to specific chemical groups or compounds, such as simple benzene exposure, benzene-derived phenolic compounds exposure, halogenic aromatics chemicals exposure, heavy metal exposure, organic metal (esp. mercury) exposure, polycyclic aromatics group exposure, and general petroleum products exposure. Three equations were developed to assign a numerical value to site toxicity based on this chemical profiling methodology. Jun 2002–

Research: Development of Landuse algorithms for SPOT images (GIS/RS)
 Portland State University·Geography/Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR/Poughkeepsie, NY Algorithms play an important role in satellite imagery analysis. SPOT images differ from traditional Landsat images in that they consist of three bands and a panchromatic. This makes algorithms related to Landsat images (4, 6 and 7 bands, and visual color) less reliable for application to SPOT images. Several techniques were developed using the IDRISI program in order to strengthen the applications of LS algorithms on a SPOT image of Portland, OR. Techniques for differentiating dark water surface and dark manmade land/building surfaces were developed, followed by the application of supervised classification techniques in combination with specific formulas pre-tested using a collection of 1976 to 1993 Landsat images.

Research: Transect Analysis of Elevation-related Mosquito Population Features (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY Two of more than 80 trapping areas used for West Nile Surveillance were identified that contained the following topographic features: proximity to large or major tributary (stream&gt;20 feet across), neighboring pools, marshes, swamps and/or wetlands, significant or complete canopy coverage, significant changes in elevation (slope&gt;15 degrees), and significant, continuous trap production. One site was located next to a large meandering river, situated in a large woodlands area (&gt;10 mi across in one or more directions), and between two sizeable rural communities (one on each side of the river). The other site was situated in an area with steeper terrain, a more dispersed community with houses adjacent to the water on just one side of the stream, and evidence for numerous crow deaths with at least one specimen testing positive for west nile antibodies. Transects led from riveredge to mountainbase, and up the terrain to the final hillcrest or first predominant mountaincrest, each approximately 300 feet elevation above the water surface. Traps were set approximately 30 to 50 feet apart by foot, with elevations changing approximately 15 to 30 feet in height between neighboring traps. Traps were set at least twice a week in late July, August and early September. Speciation differences were notable between low elevation and high elevation traps. Aedes trivitattus was dispersed throughout study region, with Ae. vexans and Culex pipiens-restuans seen occupying upper terrace ecosystems, in level settings, not close to the streamedge. The results of this GIS were mapped using a DEM, to demonstrate pocketing on land surfaces associated with vector pooling places. Uranotaenia sappharina, a frog-dependent species, could be found both on stream edge and specific points away from the stream edge. Anopheles punctipennis preferred sites on hills, away from stream edges. Jan 2002–

Research: Transformation of Common Belief
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR/Denver, CO The evolution of medical and pharmacological beliefs, theories and traditions, in relation to the pursuit for the best regimens pro temp. Different cultural and knowledge-based settings provide different reasons for the acceptance or the refusal to accept a given health-related claim. Whether or not an herbal medicine is adopted for use depends solely on scientific literature and the publishing/dissemination of a theory for action considered credible to various populations. Scientific reasoning form an important part of this belief, even though the science is later found to be inaccurate. Many of the current reasons for therapeutic effectiveness assigned to herbal medicines are based on similar reasoning and social or professional acceptance patterns. The changes in reasoning, logic and professional/scientific theory underlying professionally and socially accepted remedies are reviewed, from 16th century reasoning to contemporary 21st century reasoning.

Research: The Ecology of leukemia in Oregon (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR The state&apos;s database of reported leukemia and lymphoma cases (ca. 2500 and 1500) was address-matched and mapped using ArcView GIS 3.2. Unmatched cases were then assigned true addresses or US PO box location based on database address information. These cases were reviewed for clustering by major class [leukemia (aml, cll, cml, aml, etc.) vs. hodgkins/non-hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma], all 5-digit disease classification code-related subclasses, and by child/non-childhood cases information. Temporal relationships were not reviewed due to short lifespan of database. Clusters were identified using demographic (census block and block-group levels) information, isoline mapping techniques, varying Gi-related cluster analysis techniques, spidering and monte carlo statistical modeling. Cases were related to Superfund, superfund applicant, confirmed release and non-confirmed release sites information provided by EPA. Site data was analyzed for toxicity patterns possibly related to case clusters. Jan 2002–

Research: Development and Testing an Algorithm used to define risk and toxicity of a Chemical Release Site (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR NIH, CDC, AMA, American Cancer Society, CERCLIS, NIOSH, and EPA have each developed their own unique methods for evaluating chemical history, chemical release safety, site toxicity, human health risks, animal risks, and carcinogenicity for each chemical release site. For each of these measurement methods, the numeric value assigned to a site is based on release history and site chemical testing outcomes. Each of these algorithms serves to assign a numeric value or ranking to a site, meant to be interpreted as a risk indicator. For this study, a series of new algorithms were developed, and used to produce an integer value designed for use as an indicator of site toxicity and carcinogenicity based on each of these separate measurement methods and chemical database review for each chemical and release site. With this formulas, sites could be evaluated based on chemical class, subclass, toxicity of subclass, carcinogenicity of subclass, carcinogenicity type based on EPA/NIOSH assigned risk level values, method(s) and amount(s) of exposure, and likelihood of uptake and biologic breakdown following exposure. In the end, these three equations were developed for use in reevaluating each site for subsequent comparison through the use of GIS. Each formula serves as a sensitive indicator for a particular set of environmental, toxicological, or carcinogenecity features. The purpose of developing these equations was to be able to more fully assign a risk value to a given site and relate this risk value to given human demographic features, local environmental features, and EPA, NIOSH and CERCLA-assigned risk values already in use for each site. The entire state&apos;s chemical data and site severity indices were then compared with national statistics of the same provided by CERCLIS. With this methodology, the most toxic sites, based on a numeric classification system could be identified and mapped for later correlation with particular cancer types. Since each of these points has an assigned chemical type and risk datum, a contour/isopleth map could be developed for each chemical type and risk level for each urban region/industrial and the entire state.

Research: Identification and Ethnobotanic study of a Mohegan Shaman&apos;s Sacred Site
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR/Rhinebeck, NY Local ethnohistory stories resulted in the identification of a shamanic site used as recently as the early to mid 1700s by one or more Mohecan groups. The unique geomorphology and glacial till content of this site suggests it existed at least as far back as the end of the most recent glacial period in New York history (ca 4000-6000 yrs ago). Due to its island community-like nature, the ecology and lack of human disturbance of this site allowed its eighteenth century vegetation features to remain a part of the local ecology. Several unique if not rare plant medicines mentioned in mid-18th century botany notes by Jane Colden were found on this site. Land ownership history of this sacred site was determined (area protected due to wetlands location). The unique underlying topographic-, and philosophical reasons for this use were documented and photographed. Jan 2001–

Research: Spatially Defining High Risk areas for West Nile (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Poughkeepsie, NY Population features were related to trapping locations. Each trap site used from 1999 to 2002 was revisited and surveyed for several demographic, landuse and vegetation-related features using a 3-page standardized ecologic survey tool. Census block data was used to locate high risk group population clusters defined as M/F age&gt;65. Through the use of business directories, site visits and travels to trap sites, other high risk sites were identified and related to results of trapping and dead crow clustering patterns. Based on local features, sites were identified as one or more of the following for crow behavior: roosting/waypoint, aggregate/mating, nesting or feeding sites. More than 40 types of demographic/topographic features for these sites were identified and catalogued. Census blocks/residential settings with high concentration of 65+ residents were identified. Highest risk areas were established based on landuse patterns, positive vector/host test results history and density and actual human case histories. Sep 2000–

Research: The evolution and history of MindBody health traditions
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University &quot;Transformation of common belief&quot;(TOCB) is the hypothesis that states a culturally- and/or personally-defined belief system is responsible for a large part of the medical system we believe in and plays an important role in forming the psychosomatic and scientific bases for many of the healing processes we adhere to and live by. This TOCB concept is commonly taught in the current pharmacology/pre-pharcmocology and medicine/pre-medicine/pre-allied health series of classes provided by this university. TOCB is reviewed across numerous cultural settings and time, focusing on the tradition and philosophy of healing practices and the sickness/disease experience based on cultural interpretations. the following steps were identified as essential components of this evolutionary process. The evolution of the ancient Greek to Renaissance ideas of the four humours and great nerve (sympathetic nerve) theories could be related to later evolved theories focused on autonomically-and emotionally-induced somatic changes. These were again transformed into Colonial Science interpretations based on Boerrhaave&apos;s teachings with an increased emphasis in emotions and beliefs, to early American emotions and nerve energy-derived theories (brunonianism), to redefined vital force/energy field based theories of the 1800s (&quot;galvanic&quot;and&quot;electric&quot;vital forces), early to mid 1900s (autonomic and psychosomatic), and modern theories (electric field, psychoneuroimmunological, quantum energy). This study and resulting course teachings trace the history of acceptance of acupuncture and other alternative ideologies into Western medicine, the history of the influence of epidemics on increased social acceptance of alternative medical beliefs, and the history of refinement of these theories due to scientific discovery.

Research: Socioeconomics history, health, and cultural status for several Southeast Asian populations in Portland, Oregon
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Southeast Asian Health·Portland, OR Community health; cultural anthropology; epidemiology; socioeconomics. A review of community activities engaged in by local in-migration Cambodian and Vietnamese populations. A survey (30 questions) was developed for on-campus distribution to Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and Hmong students (Vietnamese in-migrants of indigenous Chinese descent) and then redistributed in a traditional Laotian church setting. Focus group activities were engaged in at a Laotian cultural dinner gathering; six Laotian individuals (age 20 - 30 yo, bilingual) and one Laotian MSW group leader were interviewed for inclusion as part of the ethnographic research portion of this project (Qualitative analyses). Survey data was then analyzed using SPSS. Other qualitative research data was analyzed using closed and open methods for text content analysis. Cultures were compared; differences in socioeconomic history and population health histories and status (esp. TB and SUNDS histories) were discussed. Several unique culturally-bound syndromes and/or medical concerns were uncovered. Sep 2000–

Research: Breast Cancer Screening Programs and Socioeconomic Status (GIS)
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR Statewide demographic data and breast cancer screening, incidence, prevalence and mortality data were mapped using standard ArcView 3.2 Geographic Information System (GIS). 2000 Demographic data was evaluated at a block and block group level. Some areas were evaluated using median income data and GINI testing. Many areas had to be identified or verified as low income/high risk based on additional field work and additional local demographic research and knowledge. Spatial analyst was used to define frequencies of screening activities in given regions, including numbers and types of people screened, and type of facility/program providing the screening program. This was then related to areas where severity of cancer type and related mortality outcomes were found to be significant statistically and/or administratively. The two highest risk regions were defined for the state: a heavily populated urban setting in the Northwest corner of Oregon and a rural population located in the central-east portion of this state.

Research: A Traditional Geographic Interpretation of Epidemiological Transition
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR/Denver, CO Merging traditions: Demographic and Epidemiological transition theory and changes in landuse patterns defined by geographers, 1930 to 1970. Approximately 2500 articles (most published in medical magazine/journals ca. 1780-1880) on medical geography, medical climatology, medical topography, etc., were reviewed, analyzed and catalogued regarding the various geographic reasons provided by authors for disease and epidemics prior to the recognition of the&quot;germ&quot;theory during the late 1880s/1890s. This microbial theory-based reasoning was found to be preceded by numerous theories of similar intent, ranging from the description of animalcules to other microorganisms also noted globally in numerous medical writings and texts (ca. 1790-1850). Primary physical geographic reasons for diseases were also documented and found to be quite numerous within US borders and across all Eurasian cross-cultural boundaries. The 19th century Soviet Union influences on this epidemiologic topic was found to be most impressive, although not well recognized in modern health geography writings. This is supported by the sizeable number of articles and texts cited in the late 19th and eaerly 20th century medical bibliographies published by the Surgeon General&apos;s office. Soviet writings constituted in one of the largest collections of articles and books published on this topic in the National Archives. Jan 2000–

Research: Idiopathic Epilepsy (Idiopathic Complex Partial Seizures)-A Culturally-Bound Syndrome?
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR Medical Anthropology, Complex Partial Seizures, Psychosomatic disease and medicine; mindbody healing. Culturally-bound syndromes (i.e. Inuit pibloktoq and Native American preshamanism) were compared with western medical teachings on epilepsy and other recurrent seizure syndromes. Certain commonalities between the different syndromes across cultural boundaries suggest cultural behavior related to social, family, and professional medical and government input play large roles in determining long term outcomes for such conditions. This is evidenced by distinctive changes in incidence, mortality and long term outcome/recovery rates documented by WHO data, epsecially across US-Mexican borders and between certain neighboring African countries. Much of this evidence is related mostly to simple and complex partial epilepsy syndromes, and does not apply to seizures brought on by well document genetic and physical (injury or chemical based) causes. The most popular theory for behavioral change regarding disease history and diagnosis that can be related to this finding is the theory of learned helplessness published in many medical journals.

Research: Applications of 3D modeling of Watersheds to Environmental Disease-related Risk Assessment Modeling
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR DEMs were used to develop algorithm/formula needed to produce an artificial land surface mimicking the DEM model. Purpose of project: develop a way to measure waterborne disease and predict high risk areas based on an ever-changing land and water surface lacking constant elevation above sea level features. IDRISI GIS was used. A Remote Sensing Algorithm could be developed by a series of ras-vec/vec-ras conversions performed in order to mimic linear patterns across a grid/ras elevation surface. Each grid cell of the former linear object (river elevation) was related to tangential contours and specific heights above nearest water level defined. regions for exposure to waterborne disease were defined based on elevation above most proximal portion of river, not absolute above-sea level elevation data. This was related to riparian disease ecology and local wetlands/peririparian ecology and local environmental chemical features (esp. soil) in order to define most probable locations for microorganisms to be naturally established. Focus was on specific salinity and pH requirements of Asiatic Cholera, but ecologic requirements for other important waterborne species were considered as well such as Vibrio parahemolytica and Salmonella intermedia. Resulting maps/images defined those locally populated regions most likely to experience initial exposure to disease and their satellite communities most likely to be exposed, in sequence. Hierarchical and nonhierarchical maps and flowcharts were developed, demonstrating the flow of triggers related to disease migration and the various natural and human ecological reasons known to exist for disease onset or return.

Research: Oregon State Toxic Release Sites Mapping (GIS)
 Portland State University·Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR ArcView/ArcGIS-IDRISI32 GIS project. Developed spatial statistics formula from a combination of EPA, AMA, and NIH equations used to predict exposure severity and need for monitoring. Developed contour/isopleth modeling technique depicting potential exposure to individual chemicals, chemical groups, toxicity groups and SIC-defined chemical classes based on toxic release site chemical release data. Mapped more than 4000 standard EPA release sites reported since 1985, including 12 Superfund, 83 Superfund Applicants, 75 dumpsites, 7 watersheds, 24 mining/military test sites, 1 military chemical agents storage facility, 453 Confirmed release inventory sites (cris), 2273 toxic release inventory (tris), and 980 historical (cleaned) sites; database developed for 60K chemical reports, including chemical amounts and concentration information for 198 chemicals identified by EPA as important, their byproducts, and biological (microbial) end-products. Outcomes compared with CERCLIS data on US, by state; companies reviewed based on SIC data, site/corporate age and release amounts; SIC groups reclassified (merged) based on chemical types and groups, and levels above or below EPA standards; 6- to 15-bar histogram depictions were developed for each chemical class or group and applied to GIS, producing maps for 47 such&quot;fingerprints&quot;across the state; chemical fingerprints were then used to relate document chemical presence for site based on SIC-related histories and/or identify causative factors for local medical histories, and/or for prediction of chemistry of sites with known SIC history but no documented chemical testing history in the state or EPA database. DEM applications were then applied to one urban/suburban region. Jan 2000–

Research: Cross-culturalism and Health: an important part of the Early American Experience
 Portland State University·Community Health/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR/Denver, CO We typically think of cross-culturalism during colonial times as the introduction of technology, new inventions and religious teachings in exchange for art, music and other unique parts of the Native American lifestyle. In fact, medical knowledge and discovery was exchanged in both directions, along with the beliefs in heath and healing methods typically practiced by each of these cultures. Unusual exchanges of information do exist in the historical documents but are rarely reviewed and covered as such by academicians. Some of the most important examples of these cross-cultural exchanges are reviewed, including the incorporation of children&apos;s playing cards and other European products into an indian medicine bag, the sale of Iroquois baskets and sassafras at a 1647 Dutch farmer&apos;s market in New York, the introduction (naturalization) of new medicinal plants to the New World as early as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries by Viking explorers and missionaries, and the development of metis, French-Indian, French-Dutch, Christian-Indian, curee-shamanic, Creole, and other multicultural healing faiths during colonial and early post-colonial years. Similarly, disease migration patterns must be interpreted as two-directional events, with natural vectors and carriers residing at both ends. Examples include Measles and Small Pox, which were exchanged for intestinal tapeworms from Africa, Yellow Fever from the tropics, and Amoebic Dysentery from South America. Sep 1999–

Research: Overland Trail Demography
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR Immigration records were kept at several locations on the overland trails, including several jump-off sites, government-operated forts, an Oregon toll station, and the site for obtaining land grants. Records were also kept of the arrival of settlers by several local newspapers and by government-requested local censuses produced throughout the late 1840s and early 1850s. This demographic information was reviewed in relation to Oregon Trail migration and medical history documents. Retrospective counts of the migration produced by immigrant families as part of their attempt to document trail migration history were also reviewed, along with data provided as part of the land grants records and late 19th/early 20th century genealogical histories. This research enabled important trail population conclusions to be drawn about family types and size, number of children per family and per team, and the morbidity/mortality conclusions that could be drawn from this information. Based on these conclusions, the most treacherous, dangerous and endemic/epidemic prone sites along the trail were identified. (For details, see Thesis appendix). Two disease areas were defined: an asiatic cholera region dependent on climatic, meteorologic, hydrologic, pedologic and human population features, and a dysentery region defined primarily by topographic and climatic features.

Research: Hudson Valley Medicine: ca. 1500 to 1870
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR Between 1500 and 1700, the Hudson valley tradition of living changed considerably from indigenous culture to an early Euro-american/indigenous culture. This multicultural history gave rise to numerous forms of medical care and practices, including adaptations of certain portions of traditional Native American philosophy and medicine and other colonial cultural beliefs into the most commonly accepted professional medical philosophies and regimens for the time. The Hudson Valley history of medicine is unique in that it includes both Dutch and English traditions, to which numerous other European traditions were added including Irish, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Moravian, Germanian, Scandinavian, African, and South American. In addition, the various forms of local Native American traditions of healing were vastly different across Iroquois Indian nation and local non-Iroquois tribal settings. This ethnic diversity gave rise even more diverse religious faiths for the region, including the first documented evidence for a Jewish physician practicing Ashkenazi and natural theological (pre-Hassidic) medicine in the New World ca. 1735. A collection of unique vade mecums, personal diaries and journals, recipe books, local newspapers and locally published medical books, local late 18th/early 19th C medical association meeting notes, and some of the first American medical trade journals in this country provide important insights into this aspect of regional colonial and post-colonial medical history, 1740-1820. This research analyzed the evolution and changes which took place during these early stages of development of American medical practice. Many of these changes are attributed to Dutch influence and the Dutch political and sociocultural support of multicultural living practices. These political and social setting made the Hudson Valley one of the most influential regions of the Colonial/early post-colonial medical practices, impacting medical tradition and philosophy in this New World for decades to come. A materia medica with notes on the philosophy of medicine during this time period was developed. Jan 1999–

Research: The Utilization of Herbal Medicine and Nutritional Supplements by Athletes
 Portland State University·School of Community Health·Portland State University Portland, OR The herbal medicine/nutritional supplement marketplace was reviewed and types of products developed and ingredients used databased for analysis of recipe content and absence/presence of scientific and non-scientific validation of labelling claims. A number of products were found to have allied health sciences-backed claims and potential validity, with most products bearing based based more on scientific pharmaconutrient theory and speculation at the professional and paraprofessional level. Products with highly supported claims bearing medical and pharmacological support were rare. The most common claim: utilization of steroidal substitutes (esp. pre-human steroid, steroidal alcohols) for purported human steroid effects. The most common unsupported claim: the use of diuretics in weight loss management. The most reputable claims: utilization of certain stimulants with founded pharmaceutical effects (ephedra, yohimbine, and caffeinics), and certain nutrients with purported nutriceutical effects such as L-carnitine, Coenzyme Q, and certain amino acids.

Research: Development of an Algorithm for explaining and predicting local elevation/watershed-linked disease patterns
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Denver Developed equation used to predict high risk areas relative to elevation above closest water surface, applied across an ever-changing topography and surface elevation measurement. Equation is based on waterborne disease- or toxin-spread behavioral patterns and may be applied to all but one stream classification type based on local physiography.
Ras-Vec/Vec-Ras conversion process for DEM/grid/ras files developed, followed by application of two equations which define routing patterns based on quad and cubic trend analyses. A 3D surface model was developed demonstrating impacts of topography, peririparian surface features, and elevation above sea level 2D surface slope features on direction of migration of waterborne disease agents or toxins. Elevation accounted for 75% to 88% of disease behaviors, whereas surface topography accounted for just 12% to 25% of the disease migration behavior. High risk areas for potential toxin/disease spread were identified using this model. Jan 1999–

Research: Oregon Lyme Disease Ecology (GIS)
 Portland State University·Community Health/Public Health·Portland State University Portland, OR Key Words: GIS, Borrelia, Ixodes, Chrysotile. The ecology of Borellia was reviewed in relation to local rodentia habitats and ecology. The most common vector, Ixodes, was reviewed in relation to the various natural setting of the states of Oregon, Washington and California. Population, land use, human occupational and recreational land use habits, and physiographic features were mapped in relation to disease behaviors in the state and nearby states, defining a well-defined natural boundary for lyme disease diffusion based on one or more spatial features. The most likely physical feature responsible for preventing intrusion of Ixodes into southwest Oregon was determined to be related to the Chrysotilic formations. Features possible preventing disease diffusion across these regions include lizard population history (has a natural anti-borrelia agent), plant history (lack of rodent-feed suppresses vector behaviors), and some undefined water-geologic-soil chemistry relationship with Ixodes and/or borrelia.

Research: Circumpolar Native American cultures: Inuit identity and Nunavut (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR The circumpolar region of the earth is a distinct geographic region, with its own unique climate-based cultural behaviors and socioeconomic cultural survival activities. This work included a review of the history of Inuit (Eskimo) culture in the US and Canada, and a comparison of Inuits with other circumpolar groups in Russian and Northern Europe. The impact of foodways and history on the development of Nunavut&apos;s borders were reviewed, with boundary selections shown to be based primarily on the ecology and spatial distribution of locally harvested natural resources (esp. Ceta and Bos ecology). Data from maps of Nunavut were entered into GIS and used for presentations and analysis of Nunavut politics in relation to biodiversity and natural resource availability.

Research: Predictiing Biological Soil Content using Proximal and Remote Sensing (GIS/RS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR A narrow multiband (2 nm) soil proximal sensing sensor was used to document surface soil features for Antarctic periglacial exposed soils. Two periglacial, peririparian soils were compared and found to contain distinctly different wavelength readings across several portions fo the bands. Excluding the impacts of mineral/rock type, it was found that three specific peaks could be isolated and reviewed (430, 520 and 540 nm). These peaks were found to be related to algal photochemical conent, in particular the presence of xanthophylls and chlorophylls. The possible impact of proanthocyanogenic was also reviewed. In the infrared range, overall distribution of peaks was significantly greater and more complex for soils demonstrating possible photochemical content. In sum, even though the two antarctic steams upon first glance and subsequent macroscopic testing appeared quite similar, proximal testing of soil reflectivity demonstrated distinct differences in these two soils, possible due to algal disintegration and implied water or peririparian algal blooms in nearby river or soil features.

Research: Oregon/Overland Trail Medical Geography (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR Health Geography, Disease Ecology, Spatial 
Epidemiology. Reviewed and identified all possible causes for numerous&quot;cholera&quot;epidemics along the overland trails, 1842 to 1853, ranging from mineral water- and food-induced cases, to giardia, listeria, cryptococcus, potentially cholerotoxic E. coli, and carcass-derived salmonella-intermedia induced opportunistic dysentery cases; mapped Mountain Fever (Rocky Mtn tick-fever) distribution, and local weather and other environmental features relative to elevation. With few exceptions due to population density features, vibrio cholera, amoebic dysentery and shigellic dysentery were ruled out. A new east-west route for Cholera diffusion not previously mapped by 19th century epidemiologists or medical geographer Gerald Pyle (1979) was discovered through the study of shipping documents and local newspapers in and around the US-Mexico border.

Research: A GIS Application for Monitoring Mushroom Harvesting by Wildcrafters (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR GIS developed for monitoring mushroom ecology and impacts of harvesting by local wildcrafters. Economically, the most important genera were (one or more species of): Cantharellus (Chantrelle), Laetiporus (Sulfur Polypore), Pleurotus (Oyster MR), Boletus (Bolete), Hericeum (bears Tooth), Morchella (Morel), and Clavaria and allies (Club Fungi). Most important medical species: Ganoderma oregonense (Oriental and local Naturopathic medicine use). Most endangered species based on habitat, ecology and marketplace activity: Boletus smithii and possibly Hericium abietis, H. coralloides and H. erinaceus. Risks of overharvesting Oregon white truffles (Tuber oregonense and T. gibbosum), Oregon brown truffles (Leucangium brunneum), and Oregon black truffles (Leucangium carthusianum) remain uncertain.

Research: Disease Diffusion Modeling (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR Gerald Pyle&apos;s Disease Diffusion Model (first published description, 1967) defines the disease propagation process as a result of human population and transportation features. This model relies primarily on public transportation methods to facilitate the spread of contagion, and human population density as the means to define places where the disease is most likely going to reinitiate an epidemic or spread of disease to new victims. A number of modifications to this pattern may be made based upon documented epidemiological behavior patterns dependent of other factors beside simple human population density. A review of Asiatic Cholera epidemiological patterns demonstrated that population density, although it plays an important role in the propagation process, is not the primary reason this epidemic spread the way it did throughout the 19th century. Whereas transportation routes and heavily populated areas played important roles in determining where this epidemic erupted, once a small scale area analysis was performed, it was demonstrated that this disease typically did not initiate in the most densely populated regions. In fact, a reversed hierarchical diffusion process prevails worldwide for asiatic cholera, when we define this hierarchy based on population density features in combination with socioeconomic status. As documented in hundreds of articles published in the medical journals, certain subpopulation groups were mostly likely to catch the disease throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Their infection by vibrio facilitated its dispersal throughout the remaining urban areas, including populations previously thought to be&quot;immune&quot;to cholera or exempt from becoming infected. The most important part of this reversed hierarchical feature in urban settings is the absence or presence of low income communities. This was demonstrated by the formation of disease niduses in low income communities, regardless of ethnic background. The primary factors responsible for this spread of cholera were identified as undernourishment, tight living quarters, poor water supply, unhealthy toilet/outhouse habits, unsanitary living and waste disposal conditions, and improper or non-sanitative medical treatment and disease prevention practices. This study updates Pyle&apos;s cholera maps to present a more accurate depiction of cholera diffusion across middle and north American regions, differentiating cholera onset brought on by natural ecological means (waterborne disease onsets) from epidemics due primarily to human-to-human contact (human population diffusion methods of spread).

Research: The Economic and Cultural Geography of Sassafras
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR The ethnobotanical history of Sassafras albidum of North and Middle America was reviewed. The economic history of this important New World medicine has long been forgotten since the reduction in popularity of herbal medicines during the mid- to late twentieth century. The history of this important plant medicine was reviewed as an important piece of Native American history, followed by studies of the impact of sassafras as a newly discovered medicine on both European and Euro-american medical and pharmacal histories. By the turn of the seventeenth century, the journals, diaries and recounts of travellers and explorers indicate that since the discovery of sassafras and its documentation during the 1590s by Nicolas Monardes due to his expedition into Middle and South America, sassafras became a highly valued panacea in European culture. Its popularization by English royalty matriarchs during the late 1590s led to its popularization as a remedy for syphilis, resulting in the development of a highly productive drug industry in which Sassafras was gathered and sold in throughout the European marketplaces as the cure for syphilis. This popularization led to the development of an industry in which explorers searched for alternative sources for this medicine along the southern North American coast and into New England, due primarily to the monopolization of this market by the developers of New Spain, its primary source. During the next century, this popularity somewhat diminished, subsequent decades, but Sassafras nevertheless remained a highly popular New World herbal medicine to local marketplaces. With time, its use as a treatment for syphilis changed, as it became more popular and highly marketable as a blood tonic. This latter use for Sassafras remained the reason for its success throughout the nineteenth century., and the reason for its replacement by other more manageable herbal industries with similar tonic effects and tastes throughout the next century (i.e. birch and root beer sodas). By the twentieth century, its value as a flavorant remained an important part of non-allopathic pharmacopoieas and fodd industry uses for this botanical. By the 1960s, its popularity was diminished by findings of a possible link between safrole, its primary phenolic flavorant, and the possible development of liver cancer in rats test for exposure-carcinogenesis risk. The use of sassafras as an herbal remedy has since remained mostly a small scale cottage industry, and for the most part is excluded from any large scale herbal medicine industries due to FDA-related regulations.

Research: Asiatic cholera interpreted during the 1800s as an environmentally-induced disease
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR More than 1000 articles pertaining to Asiatic cholera published between 1815 and 1865 were reviewed and catalogued for environmentally-related causative factors cited by the authors. These causes were classified and analyzed to determine the complexity with which human and natural environmental causes were cited. Such causes included special zooa- and non-zooa-related research topics including mammal and pest (early vector/carrier) ecology, weather and climate, solar activity, topography, land elevation above local water surfaces, slope and aspect conditions, vegetation features, hydroecologic setting (marsh, peri-lacustrine, per-riparian, etc.), soil type and chemistry, geology (calcium and non-calcium rich landforms), subterranean hydrochemistry, the absence/presence of local gas/air-forming waterbodies, formations, and soils, and local alkaline/saline water geography. The earliest American John Snow-like published medical geographers of the century were identified. The first description of a disease/cholera&quot;nidus&quot;(disease nest or birthplace) published in a medical journal was identified. Jan 1997–

Research: Monitoring airborne plume waste dispersal from two major chemical manufactories (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR/Vancouver, WA A local paper manufacturer and aluminum products manufacturer were historically documented as high-volume toxic waste and plumage producers. These two sites were then monitored for their individual as well as combined effects on the local environment. A method was developed for the implementation of a geographic information system to relate waste production and dispersal patterns to types of human, wildlife and natural resource (soil/water) exposure that might ensue. Monitoring sites were selected based on GIS-related ecological, vegetation canopy, topography, landuse, population density, seasonal and daily wind patterns, and openspace features. Plumage dispersal was noted to converge over several protected wetland and wildlife habitat areas. Jan 1997–

Research: The Geography of Wildfires
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR An investigation of the history of massive widlfires in Tillamook, Oregon, 1915 to 1950. This landscape was compared with those for other massive wildfires areas documented in the Eastern and Central United States, Europe, Asia, Central and South America, and Australia. Specific climate and weather patterns and surface geomorphology/biogeography features were identified as high risk factors for the development of the most destructive wildfires. Methods for monitoring and remotely sensing these features were discussed. Jan 1997–

Research: John C. Fremont&apos;s Travels and Medical Topography/Climatology (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR Travel information: 1842,1843 (excluding winter months), Missouri to Oregon/California. More than 500 observation locations and encampment sites were identified based on diary entries. Barometric pressure, precipitation, temperate, and elevation data obtained from Fremont&apos;s 2 volume 1850 diary publication was related to USGS Map data published around 1990. Data was entered in GIS and used to produce a map of Fremont&apos;s expedition and a surface model of temperature/climate changes along the overland routes taken. This was then related to Asiatic cholera ecologic history, demonstrating the presence of a natural barrier to disease diffusion across the Rocky Mountains during the early and Mid-19th century.

Research: The effects of population density of vibrio diffusion during the 1860s epidemics in the Netherlands (GIS)
 Portland State University·Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR The diffusion of Asiatic cholera in the Netherlands induring the 1860s represents one of the only epidemics monitored spatially for which elevation plays a minimal role in the overall local diffusion process. Morbidity/mortality data provided by medical journal articles published at this time were related to GIS basemaps in order to demonstrate the pivotal role population density in large urban areas play on this disease diffusion process. Due to canal-related shipping routes, the influx of Asiatic cholera victims at this time resulted in a traditional disease diffusion process controlled largely by population size and density. Socioeconomic impacts were minimally represented in this study due to poor income-related data. Jan 1996–

Research: The Geography of 19th Century Complementary/Alternative Medicine
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Eclectic, Homeopathic, Physiomedical, Botanic, Thomsonian and Church-based medical school information and journals were evaluated at a local library (ca. 1790-1880 publications). Nearly all of these journals list the medical schools then active within their profession. Twice a year, these journals published the list of graduates from these institutions and often included their town and state of origin. This data was gathered and then evaluated for school distributions in relation to medical journals, on a per sect basis from 1800 to 1860. The diffusion of CAM influence was then evaluated demonstrating the expected hierarchical diffusion patterns. Religious backgrounds for some areas influenced the teachings of a number of these institutions. A number of urban settings were found to demonstrate nearest neighbor political effects within the medical profession, with one major town bearing regular medical schools and its twin urban location schools professed in one or more of the popular alternative medical practices then taught. Most of these urban settings established hospitals, which due to their primarily church- or religious group-sponsorsips, typically established clinical wards available to patients of all available medical sects for the time. The political history of this interdenominational clash for medicine was reviewed, uncovering several political tactics commonly employed by allopathy to improve their representation in this politically unstable profession.

Research: The Rights of the Shaman
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR The Rights of Native American/American Indian groups has long been a popular topic in the academic world. In recent years, this has once again become an important topic internationally due to the impacts of industrial nations on developing nations and their cultural settings. These changes have led to a number of UN gatherings, publications and social movements regarding indigenous intellectual property rights and indigenous cultural rights. This study is an overview of these social issues, with emphasis on several new concepts and legal rights being posed regarding indigenous rights. For the most part, these sets of rights tend to focus on: cultural and religious practice rights, integrative medicine rights, intellectual property rights (i.e. knowledge of botanical medicine uses), human genome rights (human genome project), and natural resource allocation rights (biodiversity and utility patent rights). Possible actions that may be taken by some of these ethnic groups are discussed, with example to past successful applications and recommendations for future applications with regard to natural resources utilization.

Research: Interpretation of a late 19th C Iroquois Prayer Stick/Medicine Club
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR A late 19th C Iroquois Prayer stick, yellowish to brown in color, made of a hard wood (maple? ironwood?), removed by artisan from a young 1&quot;diameter tree base; root crown consists of a 4&quot;spiney burl. Entire club is 17&quot;long, 4&quot;wide at burl, 1&apos;dia at base, with 5&quot;long area at end of shaft for holding this instrument during cermonial performances. Shaft contained numerous knots and bumps from carved off branches, and is fairly straight otherwise. Artist&apos;s rendering on handle includes a carved and dyed map of a fairly straight stream flowing or river across a plains-like region, with spattering of dark brown resin/paint depicting bison, and red paint/resin-based colorant used to fill carved streambed. Icons adjacent to&quot;stream&quot;represent shamanic tipi (with small stream between this tipi and the remaining encampment), main encampment tipis surrounded by oval wall or barrier, south of stream bank is entrance to fortressed encampment, guarded by 2 animals (possible beaver). The river (flowing left to right toward burl) is painted (resined) red and dark purple, suggestive of Red River reservation(?). Other lines (paths) lead (leftward) to burl end, suggestive of foothills or mountain range. Burl has five major root bases that are carved into raven bills and faces. Lines/paths from the encampment lead to sections between these crowbills, progressing further (up into the hills for ceremonial purpose?) and finally toward the tips; these resemble paths going up the base of a series of mountains; scene resembles map of river heading westward, possibly across the northern Great Plains, along which bison survived and migrated into and out of the mountains. Another angled face of the shaft, just below edge of burl (to upper left of camp drawing) contains 4 icons symbolizing (in sequence, away from burl, high to low) sun-moon, prayer stick in hand with arrows (&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;; depicting conversation to and from prayer stick), man&amp;woman couple, four-spoke medicine wheel (bottommost iconograph). A fifth icon is placed at other end of shaft (5&quot;from end, just above handle portion, far lower left portion of stick); it consists of a prayer stick in hand and arm (lower and partial upper), to left are&apos;&lt;&lt;&lt;&apos;arrows (carved in wood) radiating towards earth (&quot;earth&quot;symbolized by 3 squiggly dark blue lines/carved); lateral lines/carved and dyed, appear symbolic of soil, appear below the water lines and are of multiple colors (symbol for harvesting/ecologic prayer made to earth/environment).

Research: Missionary Medicine
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR The history of new World and US Christian missions and missionology. Reviewed cultural and ethnic interpretations of health and disease, relating philosophy to medical practices engaged in and interpretations of natural events, including illness. Sects reviewed include late 16th C. Roman Catholic Canades/New France missions, 16th and 17th C Micmac missions, 18th and 19th C. Colonial North American Moravian missions, 19th C. Hudsons bay company-related US-Canadian Missions, 19th C. Midwestern missions, 19th C. Pacific Northwest and Vancouver-Canada missions. Materia medica, foodways, healing faiths, individual and public health practices, religious influences on healing practices, shamanic beliefs, and domestic health culture reviewed and catalogued. The most important outcome of this lengthy review was the relationships drawn between traditional missionary medical practices and beliefs and the earlier practices noted in the New France writings: the concepts of sanative healing promoted by the late 16th C. Nun&apos;s hospital in Canada (New France) and subsequent practices of the same by missionaries enabled links to be established between Native American and European religious philosophy, to such an extent that the progress of certain missions could be better understood. Those most effective at producing Christian Indians during the later colonial years (18th C), i.e. the Moravian Mohegan Missions in Pennsylvania and New York, are the best demonstration of this historical cross-cultural impact.

Research: Distribution Patterns of Great Plains Flora along the Overland Trails
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR/Grand Island, NE Evidence for the environmental impact of the overland migrations of ca. 1845 to 1860 are readily noticed due to distinct vegetation patterns noted in studies of the Great Plains. These distribution patterns were related to ethnobotanic and ecologic history. Several unique human ecology features were uncovered due to impact of human migration across this region. Certain Polygonum spp. esp. P. persicaria, distributed in very close proximity to the trail in spite of significant climate and weather patterns changes across these states, remain in these locations due to the long term impact of human migration on local ecology. A Cleome sp. found to demonstrate diffusion eastward, suggesting its passage back to populated regions in Missouri may be due to its popularity as a herb of medicinal value following its mid-19th C discovery and publication in the medical literature. More recent impacts were noted by the presence of other species in the wild which are typically bound to urban settings, such as the introduced Aesculus spp. and Ailanthus glandulosum; these demonstrate a classic radial diffusion pattern around the most heaviliy populated urban settings. Due to Russian in-migration in the middle 19th C, accidental seed and domesticed food crops were introduced along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, including Chenopodium and other Caryophyllidae tumbleweeds; these demonstrated three locations for introduction to the Great Plain, primarily at its northern end. A Platte River Rumex species was often mistaken in historical writings as an Armoracia; the harvesting of a Euphorb species (Croton) was often mistakenly interpreted as a food-related note rather than a medicine. Finally, the distribution of a Eupatorium species was found to be linked to the large number of infant deaths noted in western Nebraska due to accidental milk poisoning. All distributions of ethnohistorical importance were mapped and databased. Mar 1994–

Research: History of Naturopathy
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Oregon is one of 6 states in the US that allows for state certification of naturopathic physicians. This is due to the existence of one of two accredited schools of naturopathy in the United States (the other sschool is in Washington). This study begins with the history of the Oregon School since its birth in 1956. The history of its ND program and student-faculty populations were reviewed. The politics of non-allopathic schools locally is discussed, along with numerous political actions taken by the school of naturopathy to keep the profession afloat, such as the development of its Seatlle, WA branch in 1973, the co-sponsoring of its pre-med programs and required science curriculum by several midwestern colleges, the inclusion of Oriental medicine into its program in 1982, the development of a systems science approach to teaching in 1988, and the conversion of the Oriental College of Medicine to its own alternative medical school program by 1989. The history of naturopathy since the coining of this term as a medical profession in New York is covered. The separation of naturopathy from chiropractics in 1933, as taught by the Oregon School of Chiropractic Medicine is also discussed due to the underlying political turmoil which led to the establishment of naturopathy as its own unique profession with a distinct degree title (ND, no longer MD). This study includes a review of naturopathic professions by the State DA in Utah, 1956, in which a complete review of the history of the profession in the US is detailed, including reports of visits to all Naturopathic schools then active in the United States.

Research: Epilepsy, Creativity and Genius
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR/Denver, CO A metaanalysis of literature on creativity, genius and epilepsy. The relationship between epilepsy and creativity has long been a topic of argument in academia. The association between cases of epilepsy and IQ, academic performance, and various types of skills testing has for the most part been questionable at best. In general, a test of this association between a condition or illness such as epilepsy, and genius or creativity, is greatly hindered by its variety of physical and psychological causes, the numerous social networking models that can result from a seizure condition, the varied lifestyle-related issues people with epilepsy have to face, the range of personality profiles they can exhibit and the impact of combined genetic, physical, neurochemical and behavioral influences on each epilepsy case profile, are the primary reason a study of this type of syndrome or medical condition is questionable at best. Putting genetics and the physical attributes related to the seizure-related living condition aside, the behavioral, psychological, sociological and cultural aspects of the epilepsy lifestyle do have impacts on living and learning skills expressed by people with epilepsy. When people with epilepsy of just idiopathic or relatively undefineable or unknown cause are reviewed, results demonstrate stronger relationships between psychological and social behaviors of people with seizures, that in turn become more likely to impact life goals and long term personal choice-related outcomes. A common theory for creativity and genius defines a particular form of this expression as the result of overcoming personal limitations. Whether or not these limitations are the cause for this outcome, or are simply a means for the body to learn new skills and endurance steps to take in performing certain tasks, is uncertain. What we do know is that people with chronic life conditions like epilepsy, tuberculosis (common in 19th C), MS, ALS, psychiatric illness, and even sensory-impairment become well known once they are identified as creative high achievers. Illness or chronic condition has its own impacts on life changes and performance. Social interpretations of this part of life also has its impact on personal goals and achievements. With epilepsy and several other neurological/neurochemical-related medical states, it is possible there are normal activities within the central nervous system at play in producing the overachieving scientists or highly creative artists and writers. Their over-activity (a physiologic cause for this end state) in combination with the ability to focus this hyperactivity (the psychological, cognitive cause for this end state), may perhaps be the cause for creativity and productivity of people with seizures, MS, and other neurologic conditions. This relationship is more easily observed, studied and the results analyzed and criticized when people with idiopathic epilepsy are the focus of the study for seizure victims. Oct 1992–

 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR The first graduates of early hydropathy schools in the US made their way to the Oregon Trail as early as 1849 according to reviews of trail diaries and research published by trail diary experts. This review of several Oregon Trail women trained in hydropathy related their knowledge and experiences with those of Oregon Trail physicians. Unlike traditional doctors, Oregon Trail hydropaths were experts in documenting trail climate, weather patterns, water conditions, livestock fatalities, and overall family health status. By concentrating on good nutrition and healthy living, in particular the practice of sanitary cooking and water use conditions, many were able to avoid fatalities experienced by other wagons.

Research: Triomancy in Early 19th Century New York Medicne
 Portland State University·Chemistry/Geography·Portland State University Portland, OR Between 1790 and 1800, the yellow fever epidemics striking New York City and parts of the Hudson north of the city were intrepreted as theological events, initiated by the wraths of God and the like. Even the most non-Christian settlers came to interpret this recurring epidemic as a sign of poor living habits and and inappropriate human behavior. A review of early sermons publisehd during this time in the New York and lower New England area contained undeniable testimonials, influential not only on churchgoers, but also their neighbors not active in the traditional church setting. Over the next few years, yellow fever became known as the triennial or three-year fever. By 1849, this term was linked to yellow fever as far away as Louisiana. Both triophilics and triomancers came to respect the yellow fever as a sign of dissatisfaction expressed by the powers above. Since its cause was not known (and would not be known for another century), this theory for yellow fever continued to gain inpopularity and even gave rise to particular branches of healing faiths devoting to healing the triunal cause for this recurring epidemic disease and its deaths. The consequences of this unique socially-designed branch of medical philosophy and tradition had immediate and long term consequences, many of which became published confessions printed in medical books and journals. This study reviews the birth, rapid growth and maturation of trine-based medical theories, including many such theories still found in the professional literature today. Included in this review are examples of trine-based pharmaceutical recipes, techniques for performing complete medical care, and trine-based methods for healing patients common to 19th century allopathy and its alternatives, Jan 1991–

Research: A chemical comparison of three Xanthoxylum herbal medicine products
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Xanthoxylum species are popular for their berberine-related alkaloids. Three species (2 American and 1 Chinese) are common to the US herbal medicine market. Their physicial state and chemical content were compared to determine whether or not they had similar chemistries, a most common requirement for shared medicinal use according to contemporary scientific thought. The Oriental species is sold in a moldy, fermented state, a requirement for its preparation for use as a Chinese medicine. This preparation greatly changed its underlying alkaloid chemistry, almost tripling the diversity of alkaloidal end- products and by-products. This also had the effect of broadening its potential physiological effects. The two American species demonstrated a simpler alkaloidal chemistry, and produced lower concentrations in extractions produced using the same test solvents for each series of speciments. Sep 1990–

Research: The Evolution of Plant Compounds: Fixed Oils as an Example
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Plant Seed Oils or Fixed Oils present a fairly easy-to-understand relationship between chemical type and diversity and phytoontogeny. Angiospermae in particular present a classic lignose to herbaceous conversion of fixed oils from C8 and C10 forms to moderately developed (and unbiquitous) C12 through C14 forms, to highly developed C16 to C22 forms. As part of this evolutionary process, we find the development of specific enzymes required to diversify oil chemistry, in particular the development of double bonds and even vinyl (triple bond), tricylic and pentacyclic containing oil products. The polyacyl/polyacetylene sysnthesis pathways and their end products are related to the placement of each oil class in an evolutionary tree. Medium chain oils are found to be most common in most plant subclasses, with short-chained fatty acids more common in tropically-developed orders/subclasses, and long-chain fatty acids with unique forms and unique end and side groups more likely to be found in highly diversified, highly evolved plant families, orders, and subclasses.

Research: A Classification of Bitter Compounds in Plants
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Bitter-tasting plants are commonly used as phytomedicines. However, important chemical differences exist between these various plants due to the agents responsible for their bitterness. This review identified more than 25 distinct chemical classes responsible for the bitter flavor in plants, ranging from simple non-toxic complex tannins and iridoids, to selectively toxic phenolic derivatives such as quinine, to the highly toxic secologanin-Phenylalanine alkaloids and reversed triterpenes. This evolution of bitters as feeding deterrents in plants demonstrates several parallel pathways developed due to different chemical pathways. These developments took place at different times in plant evolution and diversification, with the earliest examples of pharmacologic complex pseudotannins by coniferae, filicidae and perhaps gnetae, complex tannins by hamamelidae, steroidal alcohols by filicidae, pharmacoactive biq bitters by archaic Magnoliidae et seq., reversed triterpenes by Dilleniidae-Rosidae base lignose populations, and bitter sesquiterpene lactone and iridoid derivatives by Asteridae.

Research: Isaac Marks (c. 1725-1777), a Colonial New York Jewish Physician
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR/New York, NY Dr. Marks practiced Medicine in colonial New York from 1730 to 1777. Most likely of London Ashkenazi Judaic descent, his practice included tradition Jewish health and disease prevention practices together with some of the earliest natural theologic teachings of Baum Shem Tov and local Dutch Boerhaavian medical traditions. Dr. Marks&apos;s lifestyle constrasted greatly with the few dozen other Sephardic Jewish families in New York during this time, representing one of the earilest examples of Judaic medical practice engaged in as a part of New World colonial history. Much of Marks&apos;s history is interpreted based on the writings of his apprentice Dr. Cornelius Osborn (1722-1783) and a small collection of financial and legal documents found in the local historical archives of the Dutchess County Historical Society.

Research: Glycyrrhetinic Acid content of locally marketed herbal medicines
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Several types of Licorice Root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) products were obtained from local herbal medicine marketplaces and tested for glycyrrhetinic acid content. This phytosteroid, common to the highly popular licorice root available in both American and Chinese medicine forms, exerts a mineralocorticoid effect on the human body, resulting in one or two Addison&apos;s Syndrome-like cases reported each year to the local teaching hospital. Other endocrine-like effects were suspected as well, including glucocorticogenic, anti-glucocorticogenic, estrogenic, antiadrenergic, and anti-androgenic (anti-testosterone) effects. This resulted in the recommendation that warnings be required by all local herbal medicine packaging agents. Aug 1989–

Research: Local Herbal Medicines rich in hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR Professional disputes regarding pyrrolizidine toxicity surfaced amongst local herbalists and licensed, accredited naturopathic physicians in Oregon beginning around 1989. This led to misrepresentation of the hepatotoxicity of&quot;Coltsfoot&quot;when one local herbal medicine specialist published a trade journal stating that western coltsfoot (Petasites sp.) lacked the hepatotoxicity associated with pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Traditionally, the eastern coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), since it is in a distinct Asteraceae/Compositae subfamily or tribe, has been considered non-toxic or significantly less toxic than the western Petasites. In addition, past and present chemical research outcomes for these two species supports the claim that eastern Coltsfoot is less toxic than Western coltsfoot due to pyrollizidine content. Evidence also supports the conclusion that European tribes of herbal medicines related to Petasites demonstrate a significantly higher pyrrolizidine content and variety than North American garden and escaped varieties. Most important to this finding is the relative high hepatotoxicity associated with Comfrey (Symphytum) and other Boraginaceae herbal medicines due to similar alkaloid content. The most important herbal medicines in the Pacific Northwest regarding pyrollizidine intoxication are members of the Senecio genus, in particular the Mexican herb gordoloba (Senecio longilobus and close relatives). These species are contain cyclic pyrollizidines and Senecic acid derivatives known to be highly toxic. Several cases of intoxication due to misuse of this herbal medicine were recently noted in the medical literature and are expected to erupt locally as well in the future. Jul 1989–

Research: Phytochemotaxonomy
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR The Evolution of Plant Form and Chemistry in relation to Natural Products Development. Thorne&apos;s and Dahlgren&apos;s classification systems and several early alkaloid and flavonoid chemotaxonomic-derived systems were compared and merged to produce an evolutionary sequence more fitting of Farnsworth&apos;s findings on metabolic pathways modeling. Basic mass-energy-time relationships were related to the evolutionary process and basic chemical diversification techniques utilized by plants. The Law of Mass Action was then applied to physical, strucutral and chemical features of plants, demonstrating that throughout the evolutionary process, plant physical make-up exists in balance with chemical make-up. Chemical evolution in plants follows three simple rules: 1) chemicals evolve from: simple to complex (simple monoterpene to iridoid), small to large (i.e. increasing lignin and cellulosic polymers, lignose to herbaceous sequence in evolution), one to many (ie. monomers to dimers/bis molecules, seed oil fatty acids, monoterpenes (C10) to diterpenes (C20)) or triterpenes/sterols (C30+), unbranched to branched (esterified seed oils), single to multiple bonds (i.e, saturated to unsaturated Dilleniidae C20s), one pathway to combined pathways (terpenoid-amino acid product mergers), 2) chemical changes towards increased chemical complexity usually take place at the expense of certain reductions in other recurring physical structural features, in this way energy for the production of one substance is diverted into pathways required for the production of another substance (for angiospermae, lignose and mildly toxic species, evolve into much smaller, non-lignose, highly toxic or selective species), and 3) chemical evolution takes place in such a way that later products are typically more selectively toxic and therefore more effective in evolution pathways and more useful as natural products/medicines. The most effective end-products are at the end of the evolution sequence in current time and/or exist in very old (evolutionarily speaking), well-developed plants that are still in existence.

Research: Investigation of the alkaloidal halflife (potency shellife) of a popular herbal product: Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis)
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Portland, OR This popular, highcost herbal medicine is sold in numerous forms, ranging from tincture and fine powder forms to complete taproot (radix). Its most important constitutent, hydrastine, is a highly unstable benzylisoquinoline (biq) alkaloid due to a tertiary 5C-N ring formed over and sharing all but two elements with its three 6-member ring substructure. The loss of that ring results in the compound hydrastinine, a biq with different pharmacological attributes according to the contemporary Merck Index and Materia medicas. This greatly modifies the potential value of hydrastis products, in particular those in powder form. This study demonstrated an approximately 3-month halflife for hydrastis, resulting in UV SW-detectable hydrastinine detected using simple TLC techniques. Different hydrastis products were evaluated to determine logevity and potential value of hydrastis products based on drying technique, raw product storage, preparation, end-product storage, and other typical herbal medicine preparation and marketing processes.

Research: Frullanoside intoxication of local tree climbers and cutters
 Portland State University·Chemistry·Portland State University Chemistry Professor Al Levinson·Portland, OR Unusual cases of type 1 immune reaction occur amongst workers who as part of their job requirements have to scale trees and cut their trunk in sections midway above the ground. These workers are typically exposed to bark, wood, lichen and liverwort dust as part of this work experience and are typically not advised of the dangers of exposure to dust particles produced by the local liverwort frullania. The toxicity and chemical make of frullania was investigated, revealing a series of sesquiterpene lactones (fruallnosides) were responsible for this immunotoxicity, induced through pulmonary intake of fine dust particulates onto bronchial and bronchiolar surfaces. Masks were recommended for protection against this type of exposure. Evidence of a genetic reason for this toxicity was non-conclusive, suggesting all tree scalers might be at risk. Jan 1987–

Research: A mechanism for the formation of Long Island Iron Concretions (Indian Paint Pots)
 SUNY Stony Brook·Earth and Space Sciences·SUNY Stony Brook MOLINS·Stony Brook, NY The formation of Iron Concretions (Indian Paint Pots) on Long Island is due to a combination of historical landform events in combination with local climatic and meteorologic history and local vegetation history. The Indian Paint Pots of Long Island are unique in that many have a center or nucleus that is rich in very fine iron oxide powder. This powder is typically yellow to deep red in color, and has the ability to pass through all standard soil screens (min. 120 to 200 mesh). Reduced concretions typically lack this Fe-II and Fe-III oxidized powder, typically have a coarse and sandy internal surface, and at time contain well-preserved fossilized materials such as cross sections of plant branches or 1cm long twigs, each measuring 0.2 to 3 cm in diameters. Due to these findings, it has been theorized that iron dissolution and passage into deeper strata, followed by exposure to organic material, might result in aggregation of iron-rich materials to the surface and areas around negatively charged organic debris. As iron-based materials, either solubilized or non-solubilized, pass through the various substrata of sand layers, chemical change progresses and larger materials are filtered out. This enables the smallest particulates to aggregate in specifically-defined chemical/electrophilic areas. Following accumulation of thes position iron-based particulates and/or crystallized solutes, subsequent oxidation-reduction actions can then take place in the fairly porous sandy soils surrounding this material. In this way, well-defined oxidation and reduction layers form around the nucleus of the concretion area, leading to collection of the oxidized iron powders and nearby fusion of sand particles. These events require several thousand years to take place and innumerable percolation events, resulting in sand-rich layers underlying Long Island soil layers where the necessary redox reactions required for these events to take place occur. The most active redox layers tend occur at least one meter below the C-zone subsoil layer, and may be even deeper given the right combination of percolation-aeration events. These prime events are directly linked to the formation of Long Island as a gravel and sand-based moraine formation, well-documented as the result of two distinct glacial events. Sep 1980–

Research: Use of a Birth Control/STD Student Health Services Clinic
 SUNY Stony Brook·Psychology·SUNY Stony Brook EROS·Stony Brook, NY Utilization of the on-campus birth control counseling/STD testing Gynecology/Birth Control clinic was monitored and statistically reported on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Results indicated peaks in utilization occur approximately 5 to 6 weeks into each semester, with pregnancy rates not impacted by counseling or peer-based educational services. Gynecological visit patterns remained active for pill use, education and prescription-filling visits, followed by increases in pregnancy testing, and abortion counseling visits. Pregnancy rates remained stable at about 15-25 pregnancies per semester (1-2 per week average, 6-8 per week peak), with gynecology/counseling visit rates ranging from 75-100 per week, for a population of approximately 30K (male and female) undergraduate and graduate students.
