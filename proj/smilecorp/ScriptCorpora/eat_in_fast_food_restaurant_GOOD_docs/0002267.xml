fast food industry
 Working at a fast food restaurant comes along with a stigma. People tend to believe that those who work in fast food restaurants can&apos;t do anything better. They assume people working at fast food &apos;s are stupid and uneducated, or they simply look down upon them because these jobs have become known as &quot; dead-end job s .&quot; The &quot; dead-end job &quot; assumption is unfair to fast food employees. A so-called &quot; dead-end job &quot; is what people describe as low-wage labor that people tend to become trapped in. While fast food workers may not be making great money, very few of these workers intend to stay in their positions at these restaurants. Many students take on jobs at fast-foods because they are convenient and can work around their schedules. Some use the money they make toward an education, and most have goals that do not at all include the fast-food world. Why then, does the stigma remain? Perhaps it is because it has been coined as a social prejudice, and people are afraid to disagree. Parents tend to dissuade their children from working at fast- food restaurant s as the stigma of these jobs creates conflict in their social lives. Someone working at a fast- food restaurant is bound to face torment either by their peers or adoles

 The employees hold responsibilities that can be just as important as any other part-time position. James said he tried to remain calm as he had been taught that &quot;the customer was always right&quot; but when the boys started teasing him for being uneducated he became furious as this was most certainly not the case. This forces the companies to continually train new employees - also resulting in a constant flow of inexperience, whereas the customer views the fast food restaurant as &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;uneducated&quot; because most of the workers have begun their jobs there fairly recently. I really think that most people think along the same lines, and it&apos;s a little sad. Fast food employees are always marked as being rude and crap, but more then likely it&apos;s because of some rude customer. &quot; -Ana, 21It is obvious to see that the general feeling about the fast food industry and those who work there is negative. To find that they are harassed and treated rudely for no reason beyond the social stigma that stands as a mystery to many, is a social injustice that is immoral and unjust. It has been found that these restaurants also try to stop these employees from forming unions by either cutting back hours or firing the fed-up employees. Working at a fast food restaurant does not mean you are stupid or lazy. While I may not find working at a fast- food restaurant to be glamorous, I was horrified to hear that employee&quot;tms deal with the kind of treatment James went through that night. For the older people I almost always assume something went wrong in their life or they&apos;re too lazy to get a good job, which means I automatically have a lower opinion of them.
