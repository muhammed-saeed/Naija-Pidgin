Different than your average fast food restaurant.

Provided by Judy&apos;s Book 

No burgers? No problem! The allure of Arby&apos;s is how different the restaurant is than other fast food joints. The food seems fresher, and there are several low-fat options on the menu. There are several locations in the FM area now, so there&apos;s always one within easy driving distance. Check it out if you&apos;re in the mood for a different fast food experience!
