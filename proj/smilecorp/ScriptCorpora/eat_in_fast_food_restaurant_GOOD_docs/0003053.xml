No one said fast food had to be burgers or fried chicken. Fast food can be exotic, spiced with flavors from faraway lands. That was my experience at Curry in a Hurry , where I recently enjoyed a fast and affordable lunch with my friend Gail.

Curry in a Hurry is located in the high 20&apos;s on the East Side of Manhattan, in a neighborhood some people call Little India. There are shops selling Indian spices and clothing, plus five or six low-cost Indian restaurants. This one has a counter just inside the door where you give your order.

Ours included crispy meat samosas, turnovers filled with spiced hamburger meat. They were delicious. We also had chicken pakora, which were mildly spiced chicken fritters. I was told their bright orange jackets came from the use of turmeric, an Indian spice.

For our main meals Gail had the tandoori platter &quot;A&quot; (there is also a tandoori platter &quot;B&quot;) which had succulent tandoori chicken, sheekh kabab (spiced meat patties), basmati rice, naan or paratha bread and a green salad. It was a feast and all for $8.99. My vegetarian platter came with a choice of two vegetables and the same sides as Gail. It was $8.50. I had the saag paneer consisting of cottage cheese cooked with spinach and spices, and eggplant with potatoes. Both

were delicious and filling.

There is a full selection of non-alcoholic drinks, including mango lassi which is like a mango milkshake. Very refreshing!

If you need a cab, you won&apos;t have to go far since cabbies have made Curry in a Hurry their place to go for lunch.

 Curry in a Hurry is located at 119 Lexington Ave , at 28th St, (212) 683-0900. They are open daily for lunch and dinner. Visa, MC, AmEx, Disc, DC are accepted . They have free delivery, minimum order of $10.
