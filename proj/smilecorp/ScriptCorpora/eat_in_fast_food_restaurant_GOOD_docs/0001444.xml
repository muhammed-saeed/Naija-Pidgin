 Cookie Thief 
 I don&apos;t know if I mentioned this before, but a few weeks back, the day before one of my pod mates and team members went to have surgery, I ordered freshly baked Tiffs Treats for our pod. 
 There&apos;s a long table/studio top like piece of furniture that runs the length of the pods in our office (mine has 7 people in it) and there&apos;s an unwritten rule here that food/treats/goodies/items on the end nearest the hallway is free for the taking. If it&apos;s not on the end (ie. you have to walk all the way into the pod to take said item) then it&apos;s not free for the taking, it&apos;s for pod members only. This is because pods do things like Friday breakfast, or bring treats for someone&apos;s birthday and it&apos;s a pod celebration, not an office celebration (there&apos;s like 700 people here, so that&apos;s not unreasonable). 

 Anyway, if you can&apos;t tell from reading my blog, I&apos;m a stickler for rules and routine. I really dislike when people don&apos;t abide by rules, especially in the office. So there&apos;s this guy. I think he&apos;s a director and he&apos;s been here awhile, yet twice now he&apos;s come all the way back into our pod for treats. Not to talk to anyone, he has no business being here, yet he came and took MY Tiff&apos;s Treats that I bought for MY pod-mates and yesterday he came and took cookies that MY pod-mate had bought for OUR pod. Not him. Not his pod. 

 Rude. I am anti bad manners and &quot;rule&quot; breaking. It might even be different if he asked, but he never does. I&apos;m sorry, what entitled you to walk into my pod and take the food I purchased for my pod? Nothing, that&apos;s what. Get your own treats, mister.

 Don&apos;t Get Your Car Remote Wet 
 Last night at Camp Gladiator we were halfway through when a crazy rain storm rolled through. We grabbed our things and dashed for the bridge making it just before the heavens opened. We repositioned ourselves under the bridge, but at one end (the end I was at) the wind was blowing the rain underneath the bridge and we were getting soaked! So, I moved again. 
 I&apos;m always paranoid about leaving my purse in the car, and definitely about leaving it in the car unhidden but I figured since I was working out right next to the car, it would be fine. Then we left the parking lot. Then the paranoia set in even though, lets be honest, who would break into a car in the middle of a torrential downpour in daylight? Anyway, I thought I should go and check that it&apos;s locked and that I really didn&apos;t care if I got wet. I looked around for my keys and I couldn&apos;t see them. I&apos;d left them where I&apos;d originally set up my mat which was now pretty much a giant puddle. My keys were in a puddle. 

 I grabbed them and ran into the rain, pressing the lock button and hoping that was enough. After the workout was over and the rain had stopped I walked back to my car to leave. I kept pressing the unlock button but nothing was happening. I stook there, freaking out a little, because my spare car key was inside my purse, in the car. My phone was inside my purse, also in the car. What was I to do? Then I noticed the magical hole called a &quot;lock&quot; where you can insert said key and unlock the door. DUH. (And obviously, when I ran back in the ran to lock it, nothing would have happened because the remote was dead). Has it really been that long since I&apos;ve had a manual lock car? I felt super dumb. But I think it&apos;s pretty safe to say the remote is dead. Good thing I have a spare one! Who knows, maybe it&apos;ll dry out. Posted by Bubblymuppet at 11:07 AM 1 comment: Email This BlogThis!

 WIAW #26 
 Happy WIAW! I kinda slacked on the picture taking this week, but here&apos;s what we&apos;ve got! I tried a few new things this week: Gingerberry kombucha and some Kind plus bars, plus one of my favorites, Guava Goddess. All are winners! 
 
 I had a couple treats this week - it&apos;s so hot I NEED cool, frozen eats!! Also I bought a watermelon =D 
 I had strawberries with frozen coconut milk, blueberries with frozen coconut milk and fro-yo with kiwi, blueberries, popping bob and some yogurt chips!! And the watermelon was perfectly juicy and sweet. Love it. 
 
 I&apos;ve been branching out and eating more shrimp, not something I&apos;m really fond of, but this: 
 Shrimp with some pineapple-pepper salsa and avocado. Really good. So good, I&apos;ve had it three nights in a row!!

 Guilty Pleasures 
 I used to have a motto - &quot;I don&apos;t feel guilty for my pleasures.&quot; I still think that&apos;s pretty much true because why should you feel guilty about the things you enjoy? Are you embarassed by your likes? Is that what that is supposed to mean? I suppose there are some things that I can think of that wouldn&apos;t broadcast around (like the fact I watched all the season of Jersey Shore, except the current one) but the things I really enjoy or are passionate about, I don&apos;t mind sharing. That being said, here are some of my &quot;guilty&quot; pleasures. 
 I like to sit alone on the couch watching TV with a pint of ice cream and eat the whole thing. If 9pm could be my bed time every night, I&apos;d love it. If I could wear yoga pants and comfy shirts everywhere, I would. I tend to think of all my CW shows - Gossip Girl, Vampire Diaries, Supernatural - as guilty pleasure shows. I don&apos;t think anyone my age goes around professing their love for the CW! I guess shopping can be added to this list, because I shop even when I shouldn&apos;t! On one hand I don&apos;t feel bad for spending my hard earned money, because I feel this is the time of my life when I can because I don&apos;t have a husband or kids or a house to look after, but on the other Designer labels. I guess this really is a guilty pleasure. I love buying designerlabels, especially on sale. Best feeling ever! Buying endless amounts of makeup that I&apos;ll probably never really use. I like playing with different things and experimenting, but I always end up with just a couple favorites and everything else is abandoned. Chocolate. Chocolate is always a guilty pleasure of mine.  
 Do you have any guilty pleasures? Secret ones? Not so secret ones? Posted by Bubblymuppet at 2:32 PM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Random Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
