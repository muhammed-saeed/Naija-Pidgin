 Fast food is the term given to food that can be
prepared and served very quickly. While any meal with low
preparation time can be considered to be fast food, typically the
term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with low quality preparation and served to the customer in
a packaged form for take-out/take-away . The
term &quot;fast food&quot; was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.l,b.

Outlets may be stands or kiosks , which may
provide no shelter or seating, or fast food restaurants (also known as quick service restaurants ). Franchise operations which are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs
shipped to each restaurant from central locations.

The capital requirements
involved in opening up a fast food restaurant are relatively low.
Restaurants with much higher sit-in ratios, where customers tend to
sit and have their orders brought to them in a seemingly more
upscale atmosphere, may be known in some areas as fast casual restaurants .


History
 

The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with
urban development. In Ancient Rome cities had street stands that sold bread and wine. A fixture of East Asian cities is the noodle shop. Flatbread and falafel are today ubiquitous in the Middle East . Popular Indian fast food
dishes include vada pav , panipuri and dahi
vada . In the French-speaking nations of West Africa , roadside
stands in and around the larger cities continue to sell—as they
have done for generations—a range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled
meat sticks known locally as brochettes (not to be confused with the bread snack of the same name found in Europe ).


Pre-modern Europe
In the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population
living in insulae , multi-storey
apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for much of their meals.
In the mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack
and cooked vegetables and stews later in the day at a popina , a simple type of eating establishment. In the Middle Ages , large towns and major urban
areas such as London and Paris supported
numerous vendors that sold dishes such as pies , pasties , flans , waffles , wafers , pancakes and cooked meats. As in
Roman cities during antiquity, many of these establishments catered
to those who did not have means to cook their own food,
particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers, they could often
not afford to rent housing with kitchen facilities or even to buy ,
and in English cities like Coventry and London,
price controls on meat pies were enforced. Travellers, such
as pilgrims en route to a holy site , whether rich or poor, were also among the
customers.


Modern era

United Kingdom
 In areas which had access to coastal or tidal
waters, &apos;fast food&apos; would frequently include local shellfish or seafood , such
as oysters or, as in London, eels . Often this seafood would be cooked directly on the quay or close by. The development of trawler fishing in the mid
nineteenth century would lead to the development of a British favorite fish and
chips partly due to such activities. 

Owing to differing availability of ingredients and tastes, until
the Great War , British fast food had
considerable regional variation. Sometimes the regionality of dish
became part of the culture of its respective area.

The content of fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens ) or wildfowl commonly being used. After World War II , turkey has been used more frequently in fast
food.

A particularly British form of fast food is the sandwich , popularised by John Montagu , the fourth Earl of Sandwich in 1762 when he
wrapped dried meat in bread so as not to interrupt his work or his
gambling (accounts vary). The sandwich has similarities in other
cuisines and cultures such as the filled baguettes popular in France . Despite its wide appeal and consumption in the UK, it is only in
recent years that the sandwich in its various forms has been
considered to be fast food, initially being promoted as such by
niche chains such as Subway and Pret a Manger .

 As well as
its native forms, the UK has adopted fast food from other cultures,
such as pizza ( Italian ), Chinese noodles , kebab , curry and various other forms of fast foods
come from other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations . and further
afield. In some areas imported fast food has become part of
both the local, and British culture in general.
More recently healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have
also emerged.

A 2008 study was conducted worldwide counting the number of fast
food restaurants per person.The UK has claimed this title with Australia second and the United States
third. England alone accounted for 25% of all fast food. In the
United Kingdom the most popular restaurant was McDonalds, with
Burger King and KFC its only rivals


United States
 In 1867,
Charles Feltman, a German butcher,
opened up the first Coney
Island hot dog stand in Brooklyn , New York
City , though the origin of the term is in
dispute. The World&apos;s Columbian Exposition ( Chicago 1893) and
the St. Louis World&apos;s
Fair of 1904 are credited with mass promotion of a number of
portable foods, including the hot dog , the ice cream cone , cotton candy and iced
tea . 

 The
&quot; diner &quot; concept dates back to 1872, when
Walter Scott of Providence , Rhode
Island outfitted a horse-drawn lunch wagon with a simple
kitchen so that he could bring hot dinners to workers. 

 The
modern history of fast food restaurants in the United States is often traced to July 7, 1912 with the opening of
a fast food restaurant in New York City by Horn&amp;Hardart . Their Automat was a cafeteria featuring prepared foods behind small glass windows and
coin-operated slots. This was patterned after a Horn&amp;Hardart Automat that had opened in Philadelphia in 1902. Numerous Automat restaurants were
quickly built around the country to deal with the demand. Automats
remained extremely popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The
company also popularized the notion of &quot;take-out&quot; food, with their
slogan &quot;Less work for Mother&quot;.

As automobiles became popular and
affordable following the First World War, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The
American company White
Castle , founded in 1921 by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in Wichita , Kansas in 1921, is
generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet and
first hamburger chain, selling hamburgers
for five cents apiece. Walter Anderson had built the first
White Castle restaurant in Wichita in 1916, introducing the limited menu , high volume, low cost, high speed
hamburger restaurant. Among its innovations, the company allowed
customers to see the food being prepared. White Castle later added
five holes to each beef patty to increase its surface area and
speed cooking times. White Castle was successful from its inception
and spawned numerous competitors.

Franchising was introduced in 1921 by A&amp;W Root Beer , which franchised its
distinctive syrup. Howard Johnson&apos;s first franchised the restaurant concept in the mid-1930s, formally
standardizing menus, signage and
advertising.

Curb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in
the 1940s when carhops strapped on roller skates .

 Today the United
States has the largest fast food industry in the world,
American fast food restaurants are located in over 100
countries. 


On the go
 Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers, often with a &quot;drive-through&quot; service which allows
customers to order and pick up food from their cars; but most also
have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the
premises.

Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten
&quot;on the go&quot;, often does not require traditional cutlery , and is eaten as a finger food . Common menu items at fast food
outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas , hamburgers, fried
chicken , French fries, chicken
nuggets , tacos , pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream , although many fast food
restaurants offer &quot;slower&quot; foods like chili , mashed
potatoes , and salads .


Filling stations
Many petrol/gas stations have convenience stores which sell
pre-packaged sandwiches, doughnuts , and hot
food. Many gas stations in the United States also sell frozen foods and have microwaves on the premises in which to
prepare them.


Street vendors and concessions
 Traditional street food is available around the world, usually from
small operators and independent vendors operating from a cart, table, or
portable grill. Common examples include Vietnamese noodle vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands and
New York City hot dog carts . Turo-Turo
vendors ( Tagalog for point point)
are a feature of Philippine life. Commonly, street vendors provide a
colorful and varying range of options designed to quickly captivate
passers-by and attract as much attention as possible.

Depending on the locale, multiple street vendors may specialize in
specific types of food characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic
tradition. In some cultures, it is typical for street vendors to
call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play music, or engage
in other forms of &quot; street theatrics &quot;
in order to engage prospective customers. In some cases, this can
garner more attention than the food itself; some vendors represent
another form of tourist
attraction .


Cuisine
 Modern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared
in an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard
ingredients and standardized cooking and production methods. It is
usually rapidly served in cartons or bags or in a plastic wrapping,
in a fashion which minimizes cost. In most fast food operations,
menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central
supply facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they
are reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying ) or assembled in a short amount of
time. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality,
and is key to being able to deliver the order quickly to the
customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the individual
stores.

Because of commercial emphasis on speed, uniformity and low cost,
fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to
achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve
freshness.


Variants
Although fast food often brings to mind traditional American fast
food such as hamburgers and fries, there are many other forms of
fast food that enjoy widespread popularity in the West .

Chinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular.
They normally offer a wide variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has
normally been fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice , or meat . In some
cases, the food is presented as a smörgåsbord , sometimes self service . The customer chooses the size of
the container they wish to buy, and then is free to fill it with
their choice of food. It is common to combine several options in
one container, and some outlets charge by weight rather than by
item. Many of these restaurants offer free delivery for purchases
over a minimum amount. Many types of sushi ready to eat Sushi has seen rapidly rising popularity in
recent times. A form of fast food created in Japan (where bentō is the Japanese equivalent of fast
food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice served with raw fish . The most popular kind in the West is rolls
of rice in nori (dried laver ), with filling. The filling often
includes fish, chicken or cucumber .

Pizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with
chains such as Domino&apos;s Pizza , Sbarro and Pizza
Hut . Menus are more limited and standardized than in
traditional pizzerias, and pizza
delivery , often with a time commitment, is offered.

 Kebab
houses are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East ,
especially Turkey and Lebanon . Meat is shaven from a rotisserie , and is served on a warmed flatbread
with salad and a choice of sauce and dressing. These doner kebabs are distinct from shish kebabs served on sticks. Kebab
shops are also found throughout the world, especially Europe , New
Zealand and Australia but they
generally are less common in the US. Lamb shish kebab Fish and
chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United Kingdom,
Australia and New
Zealand . Fish is battered and then deep fried.

 The Dutch have their
own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal often
consists of a portion of French fries (called friet or patat) with
a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany
French fries is mayonnaise , while others
can be ketchup or spiced ketchup, peanut sauce or piccalilli . Sometimes the fries are served with
combinations of sauces, most famously speciaal (special):
mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and chopped onions ; and oorlog (literally &quot;war&quot;):
mayonnaise and peanut sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and
chopped onions).

The meat product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a deep fried skinless minced meat sausage ), and
the kroket (deep fried meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs ).


Business
In the United States alone, consumers spent about US$110 billion on
fast food in 2000 (which increased from US$6 billion in 1970). The National Restaurant
Association forecasted that fast food restaurants in the U.S.
would reach US$142 billion in sales in 2006, a 5% increase over
2005. In comparison, the full-service restaurant segment of the
food industry is expected to generate $173 billion in sales. Fast
food has been losing market share to
fast casual dining restaurants, which offer more robust and
expensive cuisines .


Jobs and labor issues
 

As the number of fast food restaurants proliferated, so did job
opportunities. Today, approximately 2 million workers are employed
in the areas of food preparation and food servicing including fast
food in the USA. With the advent of such a large workforce , the franchisee now faced two issues
that could sap profit from the fast food restaurant franchise and
expose the owner-operator to significant liability and financial
loss. The first is controlling labor costs as
these costs are crucial to a fast food restaurant franchisee&apos;s
profits. The second, employee lawsuits; an ever-growing phenomenon.
Fortunately, the fast food operator is able to control costs and
guard against employee lawsuits with the same tool.

First the issue of labor costs. Employees are the backbone of the
fast food industry. Proper training is crucial to the orderly and
quick service customers expect. Yet, employee turnover can be as high as
200% per year. With such a turnover, owner-operators of franchise
and non-fanchise restaurants have the daunting task of constantly
training an entirely new workforce. Policies and procedues need to
be explained to each new employee. For example, sanitation is
crucial as is knowing how to act in a robbery situation. Break and
clocking-in policies must be observed. With the constantly changing
workforce, an owner operator using an effective employee manual can
quickly train new employees on what is expected of the employee and
what the general practices and procedures are of proper employee
conduct.

The second issue facing all employers and especially fast food
restaurant owner-operators is the steady increase in employment
practices lawsuits. The restaurant industry with its high emotional
content is a frequent target of discrimination claims. About 500
employment practices lawsuits are filed in the United State
everyday. Many employers believe that the greatest legal threat
that companies face are employee lawsuits.


Globalization
 McDonald&apos;s in Moscow In 2006, the global fast food market grew by 4.8% and reached a
value of 102.4 billion and a volume of 80.3 billion transactions.
In India alone the fast food industry is growing by 40% a
year.

McDonald&apos;s is located in 120 countries and on 6 continents and
operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide. On January 31, 1990
McDonald’s opened a restaurant in Moscow , and broke
opening day records for customers served. The Moscow
restaurant is the busiest in the world. The largest
McDonald’s in the world is located in Beijing , People&apos;s Republic of China . 

There are numerous other fast food restaurants located all over the
world. Burger King has more than 11,100
restaurants in more than 65 countries. KFC is
located in 25 countries. Subway is
one of the fastest growing franchises in the world with
approximately 31,129 restaurants in 90 countries as of May 2009,
the first non-US location opening in December 1984 in Bahrain . Pizza Hut is located in 97 countries, with
100 locations in China. Taco Bell has 278
restaurants located in 12 countries besides the United
States.


Criticism
Fast food chains have come under fire from consumer groups , such as the Center for Science in
the Public Interest , a longtime fast food critic over issues
such as caloric content , trans fats and portion sizes. In 2001, Eric
Schlosser&apos;s investigative work Fast Food Nation provided Americans
with a detailed look at the culture of fast food from rangeland to
the range top. In 2002, Caesar Barber attempted to sue a number of fast food restaurant chains for making
him obese. The suit never went to court. Social scientists have
highlighted how the prominence of fast food narratives in popular urban legends suggests that modern
consumers have an ambivalent relationship (characterized by guilt)
with fast food, particularly in relation to children. This guilt is
projected onto processed food, where bizarre tales of contamination
and lax standards are widely believed.

Some of the concerns have led to the rise of the Slow Food , or local food movements. These movements seek to preserve local cuisines and
ingredients, and directly oppose laws and habits that favor fast
food choices. Proponents of the slow food movement try to educate
consumers about what its members considers the richer, more varied
and more nourishing tastes of fresh, local ingredients that have
been recently harvested.


Health issue
 

According to the Massachusetts Medical Society Committee on
Nutrition, fast food is especially high in fat content, and studies
have found associations between fast food intake and increased body
mass index (BMI) and weight gain. A 2006 study fed monkeys a diet consisting of a similar level
of trans fats as what a person who ate fast food regularly would
consume. Both diets contained the same overall number of calories . It was found that the monkeys who consumed
higher level of trans fat developed more abdominal fat than those fed a diet rich in unsaturated fats . They also
developed signs of insulin
resistance , which is an early indicator of diabetes . After six years on the diet, the
trans fat fed monkeys had gained 7.2% of their body weight,
compared to just 1.8% in the unsaturated fat group.

 The
director of the obesity program for the Children&apos;s
Hospital Boston , David Ludwig , claims
that &quot;fast food consumption has been shown to increase calorie
intake, promote weight gain , and elevate
risk for diabetes&quot;. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention ranked obesity as the number one health
threat for Americans in 2004. It is the second leading cause of
preventable death in the United States and results in 400,000
deaths each year. About 60 million American adults are classified
as being obese with another 127 million being overweight . Health issues associated with obesity
causes economic despair regarding health care. According to a 2003
study conducted by RTI
International in North Carolina , the cost of health care in America is said to
increase by $93 billion a year, mainly from Type 2 diabetes and heart disease , both associated with
obesity. 

Excessive calories are another issue with fast food. According to
B. Lin and E. Frazao, from the Department of Agriculture, states
the percentage of calories which attribute to fast-food consumption
has increased from 3% to 12% of the total calories consumed in the
United States. A regular meal at McDonald&apos;s consists of a Big Mac , large fries, and a large Coca-Cola drink
amounting to 1430 calories. A diet of approximately 2000 calories
is considered a healthy amount of calories for an entire day (which
is different depending on several factors such as age, weight,
height, physical activity and gender).

Besides the dangers of trans fats, high calories, and low fiber,
there is another health risk, food poisoning. In his book &quot;Food
Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal&quot;, Eric Schlosser
describes in gross detail the process of meatpacking. Meatpacking
has become one of the most hazardous jobs in America, with the risk
of injury being 3 times higher than any other factory work. The
meatpacking factories concentrate livestock into large feedlots and
herd them through processing assembly lines operated by poorly
trained employees increase the risk of large-scale food poisoning.
Manure gets mixed with meat, contaminating it with salmonella and
Escherichia coli 0157:H7. E. coli 0157:H7 is one of the worst forms
of food poisoning. Usually spread through undercooked hamburgers,
it&apos;s difficult to treat. Although antibiotics kill the bacteria,
they release a toxin that produces hurtful complications. About 4%
of people infected with E. coli 0157:H7 develop hemolytic uremic
syndrome, and about 5% of children who develop the syndrome die. E.
coli 0157:H7 has become the leading cause of renal failure among
American kids.

In a research experiment done by Pediatrics, 6,212 children and
adolescents ages 4 to 19 years old were examined to find out some
information about fast food. After interviewing the participants in
the experiment, it was discovered that on a given day 30.3% of the
total sample have reported to have eaten fast food. Fast-food
consumption was prevalent in both males and females, all
racial/ethnic groups, and all regions of the country. Children who
ate fast food, compared with those who did not, consumed more total
fat, carbohydrates, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Children who ate
fast food also ate less fiber, milk, fruits, and non-starchy
vegetables. After reviewing these test results, the researchers
concluded that consumption of fast food by children seems to have a
negative effect on an individual’s diet, in ways that could
significantly increase the risk for obesity.
