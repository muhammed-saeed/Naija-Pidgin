 Microsoft 
Microsoft Corporation is a public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system (OS) market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of OSs. The ensuing rise of stock in the company&apos;s 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. Microsoft would come to dominate other markets as well, notably the office suite market with Microsoft Office.

 Break-even Analysis (Accounting) - Definition - How to Calculate - www.subjectmoney.com 
 Order: Reorder Duration: 0:51 Published: 19 Oct 2011 Updated: 11 Jul 2012 
Author: Subjectmoney www.subjectmoney.com http The break-even analysis simply determines the number of sales that it takes for a company to break even. There is a net present value (NPV) break-even point and there is an accounting break-even point. In the example below we focus on the Accounting Break-Even point. Accounting Profit Break Even-Even Point (Fixed cost + Depreciation)/(sale price - variable cost) = Break-Even point In this equation you would plug in the numbers and then solve for (unknown quantity to sell). This would be you dood bicycles decided to purchase an automatic bike making machine that cost $100000 with a life of 5 years. They figured that they can sell their bicycles for $400, their variable cost per bike is estimated to be $100 and their fixed cost per year was only a rent payment for their building that is $24000 per year. Assuming they are using the straight line depreciation method, how many bicycles would dood bicycles have to sell to break even? ($44000)/($300) = 147 bicycles must be sold to break even. http://wn.com/Break-even_Analysis_Accounting_Definition_How_to_Calculate_wwwsubjectmoneycom 
 (Kansas) Dust In The Wind - Sungha Jung 
 Order: Reorder Duration: 3:37 Published: 22 Jan 2011 Updated: 10 Jul 2012 
Author: jwcfree Sungha www.sunghajung.com arranged and played&apos;Dust in the wind&apos;by Kansas.&quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;is a hit single released by the American progressive rock band Kansas in 1977. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of April 22, 1978, making it Kansas&apos;only top ten Billboard Hot 100 charting single. The 45-rpm single was certified gold for sales of one million units by the RIAA shortly after the height of its popularity as a hit single. More than 25 years later, the RIAA certified gold the digital download format of the song, Kansas&apos;s only single so certified as of September 17, 2008.[1] Written by Kerry Livgren, it was one of the band&apos;s first acoustic tracks; its slow melody and melancholy lyrics differ from their other hits, such as&quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;and&quot;The Wall&quot;. The guitar part is played by two guitarists on six-string guitars, one in standard tuning and the other in Nashville tuning, in unison to create a chimy sound similar to a twelve-string guitar. The song&apos;s instrumental bridge contains a distinctive and highly memorable melodic line and harmony for violin and viola played by Robby Steinhardt. Kansas also released a live version of the song on their album Two for the Show. http://wn.com/Kansas_Dust_In_The_Wind_Sungha_Jung

Find yourself! ***If You Enjoy It Please COMMENT&amp;RATE*** A video to Regina Spektor&apos;s&quot;The Call&quot;from The Chornicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian Soundtrack. This song means a lot to me, and it was important that it was uploaded on this day, May 26th. May 26th is the one-month-left mark of my 7th Grade year, and as a kind of tribute to it, I&apos;ve uploaded this video to this song. This song, I feel, mirrors my 7th Grade year. It&apos;s perfect, and I hope you all enjoy it. LYRICS: REGINA SPEKTOR- THE CALL It started out as a feeling Which then grew into a hope Which then turned into a quiet thought Which then turned into a quiet word And then that word grew louder and louder Till it was a battle cry I&apos;ll come back When you call me No need to say goodbye Just because everything&apos;s changing Doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s never been this way before All you can do is try to know who your friends are As you head off to the war Pick a star on the dark horizon And follow the light You&apos;ll come back when it&apos;s over No need to say goodbye You&apos;ll come back when it&apos;s over No need to say goodbye Now we&apos;re back to the beginning It&apos;s just a feeling and no one knows yet But just because they can&apos;t feel it too Doesn&apos;t mean that you have to forget Let your memories&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; http://wn.com/Regina_Spektor_The_Call

 Simon&amp;Garfunkel - Cecilia 
 Order: Reorder Duration: 2:55 Published: 28 Feb 2010 Updated: 10 Jul 2012 
Author: kylecrazyford &quot;Cecilia&quot;is a song written by US musician Paul Simon. It was first recorded by Simon and Garfunkel for their 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water. When released as a single, it reached #4 in the US charts. The single did not chart in the UK, despite being released as the follow-up to Simon and Garfunkel&apos;s number one hit&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. The&quot;Cecilia&quot;of the title is generally interpreted as being a capricious lover, causing both anguish and jubilation to the singer. However, another interpretation[1] is that Cecilia might refer to St. Cecilia, patron saint of music in the Catholic tradition, and thus the song might refer to the frustration of fleeting inspiration in songwriting. St. Cecilia is mentioned in another Paul Simon song,&quot;The Coast&quot;(from his 1990 album The Rhythm of the Saints):&quot;A family of musicians took shelter for the night in the little harbor church of St. Cecilia.&quot;The song&apos;s recording is also quite funny. The Song&apos;s foundation was a percussion track in the house Paul was renting on Blue Jay Way in LA. Paul and Art slapped their thights, Eddie Simon thumped a piano bench and a friend strummed a guitar with its strings slackened to the point of atonailty. Roy Halee did the rest. http://wn.com/Simon_Garfunkel_Cecilia

There is a net present value (NPV) break-even point and there is an accounting break-even point. In the example below we focus on the Accounting Break-Even point. Accounting Profit Break Even-Even Point (Fixed cost + Depreciation)/(sale price - variable cost) = Break-Even point In this equation you would plug in the numbers and then solve for (unknown quantity to sell). This would be you dood bicycles decided to purchase an automatic bike making machine that cost $100000 with a life of 5 years. They figured that they can sell their bicycles for $400, their variable cost per bike is estimated to be $100 and their fixed cost per year was only a rent payment for their building that is $24000 per year. Assuming they are using the straight line depreciation method, how many bicycles would dood bicycles have to sell to break even? ($44000)/($300) = 147 bicycles must be sold to break even. 3:37 (Kansas) Dust In The Wind - Sungha Jung Sungha www.sunghajung.com arranged and played&apos;Dust in the wind&apos;by Kansas.&quot;... published: 22 Jan 2011 author: jwcfree (Kansas) Dust In The Wind - Sungha Jung Sungha www.sunghajung.com arranged and played&apos;Dust in the wind&apos;by Kansas.&quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;is a hit single released by the American progressive rock band Kansas in 1977. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of April 22, 1978, making it Kansas&apos;only top ten Billboard Hot 100 charting single. The 45-rpm single was certified gold for sales of one million units by the RIAA shortly after the height of its popularity as a hit single. More than 25 years later, the RIAA certified gold the digital download format of the song, Kansas&apos;s only single so certified as of September 17, 2008.[1] Written by Kerry Livgren, it was one of the band&apos;s first acoustic tracks; its slow melody and melancholy lyrics differ from their other hits, such as&quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;and&quot;The Wall&quot;. The guitar part is played by two guitarists on six-string guitars, one in standard tuning and the other in Nashville tuning, in unison to create a chimy sound similar to a twelve-string guitar. The song&apos;s instrumental bridge contains a distinctive and highly memorable melodic line and harmony for violin and viola played by Robby Steinhardt. Kansas also released a live version of the song on their album Two for the Show. 3:21 Regina Spektor- The Call I didn&apos;t intend to offend anyone through piecing together this video-- may you no long... published: 26 May 2008 author: Alec0209 Regina Spektor- The Call I didn&apos;t intend to offend anyone through piecing together this video-- may you no longer feel the need to make this a point of discussion; gay + black + white + straight, absolutely everyone: you&apos;re in this video, and more importantly you&apos;re in the music.

It was first recorded by Simon and Garfunkel for their 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water. When released as a single, it reached #4 in the US charts. The single did not chart in the UK, despite being released as the follow-up to Simon and Garfunkel&apos;s number one hit&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. The&quot;Cecilia&quot;of the title is generally interpreted as being a capricious lover, causing both anguish and jubilation to the singer. However, another interpretation[1] is that Cecilia might refer to St. Cecilia, patron saint of music in the Catholic tradition, and thus the song might refer to the frustration of fleeting inspiration in songwriting. St. Cecilia is mentioned in another Paul Simon song,&quot;The Coast&quot;(from his 1990 album The Rhythm of the Saints):&quot;A family of musicians took shelter for the night in the little harbor church of St. Cecilia.&quot;The song&apos;s recording is also quite funny. The Song&apos;s foundation was a percussion track in the house Paul was renting on Blue Jay Way in LA.

 Point of sale ( POS ) (also sometimes referred to as Point of purchase ( POP ) ) or checkout is the location where a transaction occurs. A &quot;checkout&quot; refers to a POS terminal or more generally to the hardware and software used for checkouts, the equivalent of an electronic cash register .

A POS terminal manages the selling process by a salesperson accessible interface. The same system allows the creation and printing of the receipt .

 History [link] 

 Software prior to the 1990s [link] 
 McDonald&apos;s POS device by Brobeck 
Early Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) were controlled with proprietary software and were very limited in function and communications capability. In August 1973 IBM announced the IBM 3650 and 3660 Store Systems that were, in essence, a mainframe computer used as a store controller that could control 128 IBM 3653/3663 point of sale registers. This system was the first commercial use of client-server technology, peer-to-peer communications, local area network (LAN) simultaneous backup, and remote initialization. By mid-1974, it was installed in Pathmark Stores in New Jersey and Dillard&apos;s Department Stores.

One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald&apos;s Restaurants . [ 1 ] It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor. Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customerâfor example: [2] Vanilla Shake, [1] Large Fries, [3] BigMacâusing numeric keys and a button for every menu item. By pressing the [Grill] button, a second or third order could be worked on while the first transaction was in progress. When the customer was ready to pay, the [Total] button would calculate the bill, including sales tax for almost any jurisdiction in the United States. This made it accurate for McDonald&apos;s and very convenient for the servers and provided the restaurant owner with a check on the amount that should be in the cash drawers. Up to eight devices were connected to one of two interconnected computers so that printed reports, prices, and taxes could be handled from any desired device by putting it into Manager Mode . In addition to the error-correcting memory, accuracy was enhanced by having three copies of all important data with many numbers stored only as multiples of 3. Should one computer fail, the other could handle the entire store.
 ViewTouch POS widget-driven touch screen GUI 
In 1986, Gene Mosher introduced the first graphical point of sale software under the ViewTouch trademark on the 16-bit Atari 520ST color computer. It featured a color touchscreen widget-driven interface that allowed configuration of widgets representing menu items without low level programming. [ 2 ] The ViewTouch point of sale software was first demonstrated in public at Fall Comdex, 1986, in Las Vegas Nevada to large crowds visiting the Atari Computer booth. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the USA and Canada.

 Modern software (post 1990s) [link] 

In 1992 Martin Goodwin and Bob Henry created the first point of sale software that could run on the Microsoft Windows platform named IT Retail . [ 3 ] Since then a wide range of POS applications have been developed on platforms such as Windows and Unix. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems. Cost of such systems has also declined, as all the components can now be purchased off-the-shelf.

The key requirements that must be met by modern POS systems include: high and consistent operating speed, reliability, ease of use, remote supportability, low cost, and rich functionality. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (2009) per checkout lane.

 Hardware interface standardization (post 1990s) [link] 

Vendors and retailers are working to standardize development of computerized POS systems and simplify interconnecting POS devices. Two such initiatives are OPOS and JavaPOS , both of which conform to the UnifiedPOS standard led by The National Retail Foundation .

 OPOS ( OLE for POS) was the first commonly-adopted standard and was created by Microsoft , NCR Corporation , Epson and Fujitsu-ICL . OPOS is a COM -based interface compatible with all COM-enabled programming languages for Microsoft Windows . OPOS was first released in 1996. JavaPOS was developed by Sun Microsystems , IBM , and NCR Corporation in 1997 and first released in 1999. JavaPOS is for Java what OPOS is for Windows, and thus largely platform independent.

There are several communication protocols POS systems use to control peripherals. Among them are

 EPSON Esc/POS UTC Standard UTC Enhanced AEDEX ICD 2002 Ultimate CD 5220 DSP-800 ADM 787/788 HP. 

There are also nearly as many proprietary protocols as there are companies making POS peripherals. EMAX, used by EMAX International, was a combination of AEDEX and IBM dumb terminal.

Most POS peripherals, such as displays and printers, support several of these command protocols in order to work with many different brands of POS terminals and computers.

 Industry [link] 

 Retail industry [link] 
 Main article: Retailing 
The retailing industry is one of the predominant users of POS terminals.

A Retail Point of Sales system typically includes a computer, monitor, cash drawer, receipt printer, customer display and a barcode scanner, and the majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader. It can also include a weight scale, integrated credit card processing system, a signature capture device and a customer pin pad device. More and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use and a computer is built in to the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units liberate counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, gift cards, gift registries, customer loyalty programs, BOGOF (buy one get one free), quantity discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions such as pre-planned promotional sales, manufacturer coupon validation, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.

The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. âBack-officeâ computers typically handle other functions of the POS system such as inventory control, purchasing, receiving and transferring of products to and from other locations. Other typical functions of a POS system are to store sales information for reporting purposes, sales trends and cost/price/profit analysis. Customer information may be stored for receivables management, marketing purposes and specific buying analysis. Many retail POS systems include an accounting interface that âfeedsâ sales and cost of goods information to independent accounting applications.

 Hospitality industry [link] 
 Main article: Hospitality 
 Hospitality point of sales systems are computerized systems incorporating registers, computers and peripheral equipment, usually on a computer network. Like other point of sale systems, these systems keep track of sales, labor and payroll, and can generate records used in accounting and book keeping. They may be accessed remotely by restaurant corporate offices, troubleshooters and other authorized parties.

Point of sales systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry, particularly in the fast food sector. In the most recent technologies, registers are computers, sometimes with touch screens. The registers connect to a server, often referred to as a &quot;store controller&quot; or a &quot;central control unit.&quot; Printers and monitors are also found on the network. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.

Newer, more sophisticated, systems are getting away from the central database &quot;file server&quot; type system and going to what is called a &quot;cluster database&quot;. This eliminates any crashing or system downtime that can be associated with the back office file server. This technology allows 100% of the information to not only be stored, but also pulled from the local terminal. Thus eliminating the need to rely on a separate server for the system to operate.

The efficiency of such systems has decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders.

Another innovation in technology for the restaurant industry is Wireless POS . Many restaurants with high volume use wireless handheld POS to collect orders which are sent to a server. The server sends required information to the kitchen in real time.

 Hair and beauty industry [link] 

Point of sale systems in the hair and beauty industry have become very popular with increased use of computers. In order to run a salon efficiently it is essential to keep all appointments, client, employee roster and the checkout in a system where you can create performance reports for. The nature of salons and spas vary depending on the setup of the business and products offered in addition to the business. This is why POS comes along with most salon software .

 Restaurant business [link] 

 Restaurant POS refers to point of sale (POS) software that runs on computers, usually touch screen terminals or wireless handheld devices. Restaurant POS systems assist businesses to track transactions in real time.

Typical restaurant POS software is able to print guest checks, print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation, process credit cards and other payment cards, and run reports. In addition, some systems implement wireless pagers and electronic signature capture devices.

In the fast food industry, registers may be at the front counter, or configured for drive through or walk through cashiering and order taking. Front counter registers take and serve orders at the same terminal, while drive through registers allow orders to be taken at one or more drive through windows, to be cashiered and served at another. In addition to registers, drive through and kitchen monitors may be used by store personnel to view orders. Once orders appear they may be deleted or recalled by &quot;bump bars&quot;, small boxes which have different buttons for different uses. Drive through systems are often enhanced by the use of drive through wireless (or headset) systems which enable communications with drive through speakers.

POS systems are often designed for a variety of clients, and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs. Some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement. In some cases, POS systems are sold and supported by third party distributors, while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor.

Wireless systems consist of drive though microphones and speakers (often one speaker will serve both purposes), which are wired to a &quot;base station&quot; or &quot;center module.&quot; This will, in turn broadcast to headsets. Headsets may be an all-in-one headset or one connected to a belt pack.

 Hotel business [link] 

POS software allows for transfer of meal charges from dining room to guest room with a button or two. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.

 Hardware Stores, Building Supply, Lumber Yards [link] 

POS software for this industry is very specialized compared to other industries. POS software must be able to handle special orders, Purchase Orders, Repair orders, Service and Rental Programs as well as typical Point of Sale Functions.

Special equipment is usually needed because of the environment that the Point of Sale System is exposed to. Wireless Devices, Battery Powered Devices, all in one units, and internet ready machines are typical in this industry.

 Checkout system [link] 
 A Checkout in a Mexican supermarket. 
A checkout system generally involves the following components:

 General computer hardware General computer software Checkout hardware Checkout software Miscellaneous store hardware 

Because of the expense involved with a POS system, the eBay guide recommends that if annual revenue exceeds the threshold of $700,000, investment in a POS system will be advantageous. [ 4 ] 

POS systems are manufactured and serviced by such firms as Fujitsu , IBM , MICROS Systems , Panasonic , Radiant Systems , and Squirrel Systems (see the point of sale companies category for complete list).

Point of sales systems in restaurant environments operate on DOS, Windows or Unix environments. They can use a variety of physical layer protocols, though Ethernet is currently the preferred system.

Checkout hardware generally includes a credit card reader, a receipt printer, a cash drawer , a barcode scanner, and a PIN pad with integrated card swipe.

 Accounting forensics [link] 

 Tax fraud [link] 
 Main article: Automated sales suppression device 
POS systems record sales for business and tax purposes. Illegal software dubbed &quot; zappers &quot; is increasingly used on them to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes.

 History [link] 

Both dan le sac and Scroobius Pip worked as solo artists before forming this duo, dan le sac as a laptop musician, DJ and promoter, Scroobius Pip as a spoken word artist.

David Meads began writing poetry in about 2005; he adopted the pseudonym &quot;Scroobius Pip&quot; from Edward Lear &apos;s poem, The Scroobious Pip . In a 2010 interview with Beatdom , Meads explained why he chose the name: &quot;I loved the story. It&apos;s about a creature that doesn&apos;t know what it isÂ ...By the end [of the poem] he realises that he is simply The Scroobious Pip. He doesn&apos;t fit into any one category and can just be his own creature.&quot; [ 2 ] 

In 2006 Scroobius Pip undertook his &quot;Relying on the kindness of strangers tour&quot; which took him round the UK in a Toyota Space Cruiser performing in various venues and also saw him doing street performances outside gigs for the likes of Buck 65 &amp; DJ Shadow .

The duo formed in 2006 after dan le sac booked Scroobius Pip to play at a gig he was promoting at the Fez Club (now Sakura) in Reading, around this time dan le sac started remixing Scroobius Pipâs solo album No Commercial Breaks , a selection of the remixes form the core of their debut album Angles but the band didnât garner any commercial success until they wrote the original song &quot; Thou Shalt Always Kill &quot; at the end of 2006. Although it is commonly thought that Rob Da Bank of BBC Radio 1 gave the band their first radio play, it was actually John Kennedy of XFM London , the band sent a demo CD to John Kennedy in December 2006 and he played it on his Xposure show within 2 hours of receiving it. [ 3 ] 

&quot; Thou Shalt Always Kill &quot; was re-released in 2009 with additional vocals by Pos Plug Won ( Posdnous ) of De La Soul . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 2007 the duo released 2 singles on Lex Records , &quot; Thou Shalt Always Kill &quot; and &quot;The Beat that my Heart Skipped&quot; but it wasnât until early 2008 that they signed for Rob da Bank âs Sunday Best record label and released their debut album Angles ; the album was later released on Sage Francis âs Strange Famous Records in the USA and Traffic in Japan.

On Christmas Eve 2007, whilst still unsigned, the duo released a free download of &quot;Letter From God To Man&quot; which includes a sample of Radiohead &apos;s &quot; Planet Telex &quot;. To promote this, the duo created and posted a spoof video on YouTube showing the pair auditioning for The X Factor in front of Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. A montage of clips of judges&apos; comments are added to their profanity-laden performance of what Scroobius Pip says is &quot;&apos;It Ain&apos;t No Fun&apos; by Snoop Dogg , featuring Warren G , Nate Dogg and Kurupt .&quot; The clip, titled &quot;Le Sac Vs Pip Letter from X-factor&quot;, was featured in &quot;The 10 Best Clips of the Month&quot; in the October 2008 edition of Q magazine ., [ 6 ] [ 7 ] the video also included a voice over from Zane Lowe .

They have also appeared on the BBC&apos;s Sound , NBC&apos;s Last Call with Carson Daly , with Scroobius Pip appearing by himself on the BBC&apos;s Newsnight Review and Setanta Sport Channel, he has also been interviewed and performed live on Stephen Merchant &apos;s show on BBC 6 Music . [ 8 ] 

They spent 2009 recording their second studio album, The Logic of Chance which was released in March 2010, preceded by the single &quot;Get Better&quot;.

In September 2011 Scroobius Pip released his second solo album Distraction Pieces through the label Strange Famous Records (USA) and Scroobius Pips own Speech Development Records (UK). It debuted at #35 in the UK album charts.

[ 5 ]

 Early life [link] 

Lyte was born Lana Michelle Moorer in 1971. Raised in Brooklyn , Lyte began rapping at the age of 12. Two of her brothers later formed the hip-hop duo, Audio Two , which later helped to collaborate on Lyte&apos;s records. Lyte recorded her first song, &quot;I Cram to Understand U (Sam)&quot;, in 1986. Lyte had originally written the song in 1984. The song, about a relationship that fell apart due to the protagonist&apos;s lover&apos;s crack addiction , got her notice from First Priority , who signed Lyte in late 1987. Soon after she was signed with Atlantic Records by its VP Sylvia Rhone .

 Musical career [link] 

Her first album, Lyte as a Rock , was released in September 1988 and was noted for the hit &quot;Paper Thin&quot; and the battle rap, &quot;10% Dis&quot;, which was a response from then- Hurby Azor associate Antoinette . Both rappers released battle records against each other. Lyte followed her debut with 1989&apos;s Eyes on This , which spawned the hits &quot; Cha Cha Cha &quot; and &quot;Cappucino&quot;. Both albums were notable for Lyte&apos;s uncensored lyrical matter. Lyte sweetened up a little on 1991&apos;s Act Like You Know , noted for its new jack swing sound and the hit single, &quot;Poor Georgie&quot;. Lyte&apos;s fourth album, 1993&apos;s Ain&apos;t No Other , became her first to reach gold status and was notable for her first top 40 pop hit, &quot; Ruffneck &quot;. Lyte became a featured artist on hits by Janet Jackson and Brandy in 1994.

Two years afterwards, Lyte&apos;s fifth album, Bad As I Wanna B , featured production from Jermaine Dupri and Sean Combs and featured the hits &quot; Keep On, Keepin&apos; On &quot; and &quot; Cold Rock a Party &quot;, which featured then up-and-coming rapper, songwriter and producer Missy Elliott . This album was her first with East West Records and became successful after the aforementioned singles became big hits with &quot;Keep On Keepin&apos; On&quot; peaking at the top ten and &quot;Cold Rock a Party&quot; peaking at number-eleven. It was her second gold album. Her 1998 follow-up, Seven&amp;Seven , however, wasn&apos;t as successful and she left East West by the end of the decade. Lyte released the independently produced record The Undaground Heat featuring Jamie Foxx , in 2003, notable for the song, &quot;Ride Wit Me&quot;. The single was nominated for both a Grammy and a BET award.

 Acting career [link] 

Lyte has been featured on television as herself on such shows as MTV Unplugged , In Living Color , Moesha , New York Undercover , My Wife and Kids , and Sisters in the Name of Rap . She has also acted on TV as a character (not as &quot;MC Lyte&quot;) in such shows as In the House , Get Real , Half&amp;Half , and The District .

Her first acting role was in 1991, an off Broadway theater play entitled Club Twelve, a Hip-hop twist on The Twelfth Night alongside Wyclef Jean , Lauryn Hill and Lisa Nicole Carson .

In 2007 Lyte joined the cast of MTV&apos;s Celebrity Rap Superstar [ 3 ] and coached Shar Jackson to a hip hop mc victory in a mere 8 weeks. During that same time Lyte hit the road in between shooting and joined The Roots for a nationwide VH1 House of Blues Tour.

She has also recently opened Shaitel, a Los Angeles boutique that specializes in accessories from belts to sunglasses. &quot;We sell a mixture of new and vintage [items],&quot; explains Lyte. &quot;We also have a few signature pieces that are done just for the store. We boast to bring a little New York flavor out here to California.&quot; [ 4 ] 

In February 2006, her diary, as well as a turntable , records , and other assorted ephemera from the early days of hip hop, were donated to the Smithsonian Institution . [ 5 ] This collection, entitled &quot;Hip-Hop Wonât Stop: The Beat, The Rhymes, The Life&quot; is a program to assemble objects of historical relevance to the hip hop genre from its inception. [ 6 ]

It was first recorded by Simon and Garfunkel for their 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water. When released as a single, it reached #4 in the US charts. The single did not chart in the UK, despite being released as the follow-up to Simon and Garfunkel&apos;s number one hit&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. The&quot;Cecilia&quot;of the title is generally interpreted as being a capricious lover, causing both anguish and jubilation to the singer. However, another interpretation[1] is that Cecilia might refer to St. Cecilia, patron saint of music in the Catholic tradition, and thus the song might refer to the frustration of fleeting inspiration in songwriting. St. Cecilia is mentioned in another Paul Simon song,&quot;The Coast&quot;(from his 1990 album The Rhythm of the Saints):&quot;A family of musicians took shelter for the night in the little harbor church of St. Cecilia.&quot;The song&apos;s recording is also quite funny. The Song&apos;s foundation was a percussion track in the house Paul was renting on Blue Jay Way in LA. Paul and Art slapped their thights, Eddie Simon thumped a piano bench and a friend strummed a guitar with its strings slackened to the point of atonailty. Roy Halee did the rest. 2:13 Imagefilm Firma Binder Tuttlingen JetztFilmProduzieren Imagefilm Firma Binder Tuttlingen Regio TV - Ihr professioneller Produzent fÃ¼r: Imagefilme, Arbeitgeberfilme, Produktfilme, Vertriebsfilme, Messefilme, JobportrÃ¤ts, Schulungsfilme, Dokumentationen, point of sale TV, business TV, TV&amp;Kino Spots, Animationen und Internetvideos. 4:03 5788 I Ah Maytah Rd - Lake Winnebago waterfront For Sale scottroh1969 5788 I Ah Maytah Rd - Lake Winnebago waterfront For Sale Custom built spacious home on a huge lot on Lake Winnebago.
