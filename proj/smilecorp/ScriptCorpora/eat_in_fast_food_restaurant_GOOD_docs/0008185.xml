Reasons why fast food restaurants are responsible for America&apos;s obesity epidemic

Fast food restaurants have been around since the early 1900&apos;s, since the first Horn&amp;Hardarts in 1912. White Castle followed, with their first restaurant in 1916, and A&amp;W Root Beer in 1919. In the 1930&apos;s, 1940&apos;s and 1950&apos;s McDonalds, Burger King , KFC and many more fast food restaurants came. Each came with their own specialty food item. KFC came with the best tasting fried chicken , known in a restaurant. McDonalds came with the Big Mac and their special sauce and so on down the line each fast food joint had it&apos;s own special item. Along with fast food restaurants popping up in every mall and every corner, so has obesity. Soon to follow the explosion of fast food chains popping up everywhere, obesity hit like wilsfire in its path. This has caused many to point their fingers to say fast food restaurants are responsible for the obesity epidemic. Why are fast food restaurants responsible for America&apos;s obesity, or are they really?
 
According to the WHO&quot; World Health Organization &quot;, fast food restaurant foods are classified under the &quot;eat least&quot; category. This is because these food have very little nutritional value. In addition, fast food restaurants tend to serve foods higher in fat, sodium, and sugar. Making these foods a part of your regular diet adds pounds and evidence is showing that where fast food restaurants go, obesity follows.

In the quest to be the best, fast food chains were beefing up advertising and pinching on the quality of their ingredients, to offer their foods cheaper than the competition. Buying lower grade meat, some made from soy, some more fattier, than others, they cut out a lot of nutritional value and raised the sodium and sugar levels. While you can&apos;t knock a business for trying to offer their product as cheap as possible to beat the competition, standards still need to be met.

When it comes to America we are the land of the free as well as the land of plenty. Given the freedom to do as we want, we have gotten wrapped up in an error of &quot;on the go&quot;. Everywhere you look American&apos;s are multi-tasking on the go. Drivers are text messaging and talking on the phone while driving. Patrons are at stores making their transactions with a cashier while on the cell phone . Parents are working on their laptops while watching their kids ballgames. This is no exception, when it comes to eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner. America eats on the go more than any
