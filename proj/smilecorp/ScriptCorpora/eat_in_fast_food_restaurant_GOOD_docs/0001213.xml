Weight Loss Surgery Is the Easy Way Out

 ​US News&amp;World Report recently noted that gastric bypass surgery not only cuts your appetite but also might reduce your desire for high-fat foods. Over the years, I&apos;ve had friends who have suffered through gastric bypass or lap band procedures. They&apos;ve all shed weight as if they had made a pact with Satan -- quickly and what appears to be easily.

People applaud their weight loss and congratulate them on how thin they&apos;ve become and how good they look.

Not I.

I don&apos;t like cheating and I don&apos;t like short cuts, especially (at least) when it comes to such a big thing (pun totally intended).

My weight has yo-yoed during the years. I&apos;ve been normal weight, thick, chubby, and obese. When I was at my heaviest, 250 pounds, I did the unthinkable. I cut my calories to less than 500 per day and began exercising two hours daily. Guess what? I also lost weight as if I had a pact with &quot;he who must not be named.&quot; (Oh, wait, that&apos;s Lord Voldemoort; I mean the other guy.)
 
It was difficult, especially at first. But every day I -- and my will -- grew stronger. And after three months (in which I lost 80 pounds), I was very, very proud of myself.

How can I be proud of someone who takes the easy route? Someone who decides that having a surgeon cut them open and rearrange or modify their insides is easier than eating less and exercising more? It&apos;s just lazy.

And if you&apos;re too lazy to cut calories and exercise, you don&apos;t deserve to be skinny.

Before I get a ton of comments about how some people are so obese they don&apos;t have a choice -- chill , please. You&apos;re the type of person who enables drug addicts and criminals. I have the Learning Channel. I&apos;ve seen those shows about the heaviest people on the planet, including Manuel Uribe from Mexico , who weighed more than 1,000 pounds and was dubbed &quot;the Fattest Man on Earth.&quot; He began losing weight by exercising and cutting down on eating. Sure, his exercise consisted of doing arm circles while lying in bed, but it burned more calories than lying there eating tacos.

And if the fattest man on Earth can say no to food and yes to exercise, so can all of the self-indulgent, overweight, spineless jellyfish who take the easy way out.

Listen lady, worry about your damn self. Who are you to tell someone they don&apos;t deserve to be skinny ha.. what are you a child. Now I think everyone has there own opinion but sometime people just need to think about others and step into there shoes. This is just an example of an ignorant being who has lack of knowledge
 
Why not have that diligence to begin with should wait until the problem is created then trying to reverse it . you have to work your whole life to be able to retire not just part of the time. you can&apos;t drive your car for 20 years without doing any thing to it then expect some miracle part to fix it.Its Called preventative maintenance. When I was in high school in the eighty&apos;s there were 3 fat kids in the entire school Now I think it&apos;s 3 skinny kids in the school You arent popped out of your mom&apos;s ass as a little pig try doing something about it before it happens
 
Oh do you just wake up 1 day and say where&apos;d my genitals goI can&apos;t. see them you get a blue ribbon for finishing the race first not sneaking around behind the bleachers to the finish line. key word here is on limited food intake you do it or the surgery does it it&apos;s the same thing. if I drop d off on the desert island with rice and water and came back in 2 months you would have lost weigh. fact. it&apos;s like running your credit card up to the max knowing all of that you&apos;re going to have to pay the balance someday but you don&apos;t want to pay it back you wanna file bankruptcy chapter 11 accountability the other key word which no 1 in this case has any of
 
Sorry meant to say the bypass is definitely NOT harder than diet and exercise.
 
The fact that it doesn&apos;t last forever proves why it is the easy way out.  I think people get upset because of the word easy.  Is it completely fun and easy to have the bypass?  No.  I don&apos;t think anyone thinks it&apos;s a great time but when you compare it to the discipline and hard work required for diet and exercise, it is easier.  It may not be easy but it is easier.  If it wasn&apos;t easier then why do it in the first place?  There are very few people that physically cannot lose weight.  Most people don&apos;t monitor their calories and claim they can&apos;t lose weight while they cover a salad in ranch (which is about 100 calories per tbsp).  In the end there is no easy way out when it comes to losing large amounts of weight unless you have the weight physically pulled out of you but the bypass is definitely harder than diet and exercise.  If you disagree, you&apos;re lying to yourself.
 
Hate to break it to you but the gastric bypass is far from the easy way out. I had a gastric bypass 3 1/2 years ago and lost over 200 pounds. Was it easy? HELL NO!!!! It is just as much a struggle as trying lose the weight without the surgery. The one thing that does help is that your stomach is fuller faster. I still struggle with finding enough protein to eat and keeping track as to when I need to eat next. Yes, every 3 hours. I still go to the gym 4-5 times a week, that has not changed since before my surgery. Have I tried any other means of taking off the weight? ABSOLUTELY!!!! I have tried slim fast, diets from my doctor&apos;s which consisted of V8 juice, lots of salad and a frozen lean cuisine for dinner. Did the weight come off? NO Why? because there are not enough calories to take any weight off. When you deprive your body of the needed calories it hold on to every piece of food and drink you put in your mouth because it goes into starvation mode. I have even tried other weight loss pills and just using the watching what I eat and writing everything down and exercise and where those things may have worked at first and I did take off 57 pounds but all that weight came back and brought friends. I have even hypnotism, which I will tell you is a waste of time and money. Sometimes gastric bypass is the only thing left that can help you and that is the route I chose for myself. DON&apos;T prejudge people without knowing ALL the facts!!! I was told that if I did not do the surgery then I would be dead within the next 20 years. Was I ready for that comment? Absolutely not, I am still young and I had a life to look forward to. I most certainly did not want my life to end that quickly. For those of you who decide to put something down like the gastric bypass surgery you need to really think twice and realize that what you are saying is COMPLETELY wrong. For those people who gained back their weight after surgery or even lost their lives it was because they did not follow the doctor&apos;s instructions or take their vitamins like they were supposed to. Gastric Bypass is not for everyone! But, it has HELPED me and not given me&quot;the easy way out&quot;. I have worked very hard to get to where I have and neither you or anyone else will change my mind or make me feel guilty for what I have decided to do for myself. I didn&apos;t have this surgery for neither one of you or for society and how they viewed me as being obese. I did it for ME!!!! I am currently no longer a diabetic, I know longer have high blood pressure and I do not have sleep apnea. It all went away within a year of my surgery. My doctors are very proud of me and loves the fact that I am much healthier than I EVER have been in my life!
 
Yes we all know Two out of Three American adults are overweight or worse. The issue of weight on wellness has become an epidemic. 
It is usually a well thought out decision for those who receive the surgery.

It does not matter HOW they got to such a position
Blaming serves no purpose

We need to work together&amp;concentrate on FINDING A SOLUTION
IS THERE A SOLUTION?
You decide~Here is a short video~
http://www.mymangosteen.com/fresh/product/favao_video.asp

Here’s the issue: The problem is comprehensive, and the solutions are not. We gain weight when we lead increasingly sedentary lives and eat bigger portions of less-healthy food.

We all know this is linked to
~our addiction to sugar 
~genetics
~technology/internet/email
~lifestyles learned as children

It does not matter whether you just had the surgery or are contemplating one,
Neither is easy to have gotten to that point.
~My heart goes out to you~&lt;3
Even with counseling, that is not enough support.
Your results need to be SUSTAINABLE.
Read my Google blog on a solution for those of you serious on making a change
https://sites.google.com/site/favaoxango/

Many of my friends have had, or are thinking about this major event.
Every decision is based on their weight
They need our support no matter what they decideMost loose a chunk of weight in the first month.
Some are not diabetic any more.
Others experience hernias&amp;had to return to surgery
Another friend developed problems with her thyroid&amp;vertigo.

We celebrate your successes&amp;it saddens us loved ones who watch you develop additional health issues. that seem to be triggered by the stress the surgery puts on ones body

If this post helps even one person ~(because I know people are hurting out there and looking for answers)~what a blessing.

Bottom line is. You have a goal, Hurray! Don&apos;t try to do it alone
Surround yourself with those that support and celebrate your successes
You will not only reach your goal much faster,
but will be able to sustain it for the rest of your wonderful life!!
It is possible~

you are a horrible person.....
 
I will add that for some people, weight loss surgery is the right choice, especially if they have tried everything else for years and their life is at risk. I just think many people who do get it should make really sure that&apos;s what they need to be healthy first.
 
Women should eat a minimum of 1200 calories per day, men a minimum of 1500 calories per day. 500 calories a day is a VERY dangerous level and could have permanently damaged you. 

I agree that most people who get weight loss surgery probably don&apos;t need it and should choose an option that doesn&apos;t involve mutilating their insides. After all, what weight loss surgery does physically is usually to make someone&apos;s stomach smaller, controlling their portion sizes. You can, as you mentioned, do that by choice alone without self-mutilation. 

Anorexia (and be honest, 500/day fits into that category), is even worse for your health than being overweight, so I think it&apos;s horrible for you to advocate such a low level of calories.
 
WLS is for lazy fat people who are too lazy to go on a diet and exercise. What these ads don&apos;t tell you is that even with surgery, you still have to diet and exercise to lose the weight and keep it off, so what&apos;s the point of having someone scrambling your insides? People just want a quick fix because they have no willpower, no self control whatsoever. Is risky surgery really worth losing 40 pounds so you can fit into a bikini? These doctors don&apos;t tell you about the possible side effects and risks of WLS, because all they care about is your $$$$. If your too lazy to get off your ass and lose weight the RIGHT way, then you&apos;re pathetic.
 
Um, cutting your calories down to FIVE HUNDRED and exercising TWO HOURS a day is obsessive, and definitely eating-disorder behavior. Not to mention, it would also be described as&quot;the easy way out&quot;by those who lose weight slowly and healthily. 500 calories a day is practically starving yourself and I would definitely call that cheating. 

That said, I actually agree with you that gastric bypass is an easier way out than losing weight the good old fashioned healthy way. But YOU, who did something possibly even less healthy than surgery, are a giant (no pun intended) hypocrite.

This is really best article on weight loss. This kind of weight loss surgery are useful but not always the first choice. We can loose weight by doing hard exercise and doing regular and strict diet.
 
As we know, we cannot instantly switch from being overweight to slim. Between these two states we need to take many small steps such as habits needing to be changed, decisions and choices have to be made, lifestyle changes need to be implemented, and various stages of progress to be achieved. If we begin a weight loss program with the attitude that we have to, or are going to shed those unwanted pounds, we may be bogged down by a sense of frustration and anxiety until we eventually reach our weight loss goal.
 
I lost 230 lbs without surgery and I&apos;ve kept it off for over 10 years. I am always happy for anyone who sheds vast amounts of weight, and I regularly follow the weight loss stories of people who lose both with and without surgery. It&apos;s not as easy as you think for those people who do opt for surgery. They still have to make drastic lifestyle changes to keep that weight coming off and to maintain their losses. They have to be very dedicated to better health. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t get the surgery but I certainly don&apos;t look down on people who do choose that route. Either way, the important thing is just to take action today. Somebody might be reading this right now feeling completely overwhelmed by the prospect of losing 100, 200, 300 lbs. Don&apos;t be afraid. You can do it.
 
Hey Lynnda, how about an giving her an interview?
 
You need to grow up and stop hiding. What are you afraid of? Can you come up with a better line than calling people a cyber bully. Do you even know what that means?
 
WLS patients eat very healthy and are monitored closely. We meet with our surgeon, nutritionist, and nurse very closely the first year after surgery. 

As for psychology many of us have had to go through a psych evaluation and sessions with a therapist before getting approval for surgery. 

Many of us have gone years waiting for approval. If we don&apos;t do what&apos;s required by our surgeon we do not get the surgery.
 
Angie, they are a coward.
 
Any surgery can be dangerous.
 
Its lack of knowledge on the subject. You hit the nail on the head. Hard up for traffic that we should not have even given her.
 
What makes you think bariatric patients never tried diet and exercise? I had to show proof to my doctor what I had tried to lose weight. Surgery is a last resort for many people. 

Next you&apos;ll say that homosexuals chose to be gay and the ones that have gender reassignment took the easy way out.
 
Amen on the statement,&quot;You may loose weight on you own (500 calories a day), but most time the people gain it back and more. I guarrantee&quot;Her Majesty&quot;will gain it back. She is ruining her metabolism and losing MUSCEL. Um, wonder if she is still on that 500/day calorie diet and exercising 2 hours a day? In a short time, I&apos;d like to hear from her and say like Dr. Phil,&quot;How&apos;s that working for ya?&quot;
 
Let&apos;s digress for a moment. With all due respect to your friend, you said she was&quot;..fat but very healthy&quot;? Well if fat is healthy why did you bother to starve your self on a 500 calorie a day diet? Why didn&apos;t you remain&quot;fat&amp;healthy&quot;? All surgeries involve risks. Why undergo any surgery, unless you are about to die- imediately! Your freind saw a chance to take a leap of faith or just do something that works. If Clementina was your good friend, then you owe it to her not to sensationalize her death to promote your career or biased opinions, but to investigate why this surgery has been sucessfully utilized by some very industrious and intelligent people.
 
Thanks, softshooz. And I applaud you. Lots of people find it hard to do what you do every day; it ain&apos;t easy.
 
I know people don&apos;t do it for applause, I guess that sounded like a gross overgeneralization. And I wasn&apos;t looking for people to praise me for working hard. It just seems some of the time people think that it&apos;s easy to be &apos;average&apos; weight when in reality it does take hard work and determination.  I think there is a segment of people who do the surgery for the wrong reasons and then want people to admire them and their &apos;achievement.&apos; 
I guess sort of like the prodigal son.
 
Hi,

Thanks for sharing your story with me. I appreciate the fear you must have felt having your loved ones die around you. I also lost my grandmother to diabetes and I was the sun in her sky. I adored her. 

What I mean by&quot;easy&quot;is that it kick starts the weight loss into high gear and forces you to eat proper portions. I know that any surgery is difficult. Also, I am more against those who don&apos;t take it as a serious decision, those who just jump on it for cosmetic purposes, and don&apos;t even exercise after WLS -- and there are many.

I don&apos;t mean to downplay your situation; I&apos;m speaking about others who do not care about their health, only about their appearance. And I think you&apos;re right -- short cut may be a better term to describe what I think. 

I wish you the best and I am glad that you are no longer at risk for those various illnesses. You sound like a very nice, decent person.

God Bless,

Ily
 
Here&apos;s my response: http://notjustaface.blogspot.com/2011/08/alleged-easy-way-out.html
 
Ily,

I just listened to you on BTV and I have to give my back ground story, since you gave your drug dependency history.  Every obese person has their own private reason for choosing surgery.  My reason was I saw my grandma die of a hernia surgery infection.  She had a hernia because she was overweight she was overweight her entire life.  She worked jobs on her feet all her life and had to lug her weight around causing the hernia. My mom suffers from thyroid disease but isn&apos;t terribly overweight.  My father has heart disease.  I was 16 years old when I saw him have his first heart attack at the age of 45 years old.  My older brother was 26 years old when he died in 1988 suddenly.  He was 6&apos;3&quot;and only weighed 300 lbs.  He wasn&apos;t terribly overweight but it was enough to shorten his life.  He had a wife and 2 little boys and a little girl on the way  My sister died at the age of 43 in 2003.  She fought her weight for years and when she turned 40 she was diagnosed with epilepsy, high blood pressure and sleep apnea.  She left behind a husband 2 adult children and 2 minor children.  That is why I chose WLS.  When I turned 30 my hormones went hay wire.  I wasn&apos;t overweight until 30. In a 2 month period I gained 20 lbs and from then on I just got bigger and bigger.  I tried different diets and exercise until I reached a max weight of 300 lbs.  When my sister died it was totally unexpected and I was in my mid 30&apos;s and I reallized if I didn&apos;t do something I was going to die young like my siblings. 2 years ago I started looking into the weight loss surgeries.  I went through the support groups and the psychiatric therapy and it freaked me out so I decided to back out and try the whole diet and exercise again.  I cut my portion sizes and I got up to jogging 2 miles a day and I did this daily faithfully for a year and I lost nothing!  Not 1 pound.  So I went back into the program and asked more question and talked to more people who had it done and watched what the post ops were eating and it looked so hard and til the day I went into the surgery I was so terrified it would not work.  I&apos;m now 42 years old and it is the best decision I have ever made.  I&apos;m 6 months post op and 86 pounds lighter.  I can now run 4 miles a day and bike 10 miles a day with no pain.  I think what you said that burned everyone&apos;s butt is you saying the surgery is the&quot;easy way&quot;.  On the radio show you used the word&quot;short cut&quot;I think short cut is more acceptable because without my shortcut I probably wouldn&apos;t live to see my grandchildren or even long enough to lose my weight.  The&quot;easy way&quot;though? I don&apos;t think so, weight loss surgery is not easy.  It takes a couple years to get approved and you have to go through classes and support groups and see all sorts of doctors and get food stuck and get sick cause you ate something you weren&apos;t ready for or sick cause you ate that last bite.  Not easy at all.  I&apos;m glad I did it.

Let me guess, you&apos;re another person who knows next to nothing about bariatric surgery. I see.Oh and there are only 2 wrong directions when it comes to weight loss. That includes not at all and in an unhealthy fashion. But if you come up with another wrong way to do it, let me know. And since she lost weight healthily, this does NOT include bariatric surgery.
 
Congratulations on your success Softshooz... you&apos;re right, things like that get overlooked. But, I didn&apos;t do this for applause or accolades, I did this for my health. Plain and simple.

@YourBrain:disqus 
 - many of us do this, even though it is hard work, because&quot;it works&quot;. As simple as&quot;eat less, exercise more&quot;sounds... statistics show it does not work for the long term... especially for those who, for whatever reason, have gotten to the point where they&apos;re considered morbidly obese. Even the gentleman Ily talked about has continued to struggle had regained some weight in recent years.

yes, dealing with the life after choosing to have surgery is not always easy, and at times it&apos;s a lot of work. But the long term results have made it worth it, at least for me.

And I would agree that some people over-reacted, the name calling and such was not needed.
 
What a sad&quot;little&quot;person you (pun intended)
 
http://lindaeaves.com - I enjoyed hearing you on the BTV radio show. Interesting discussion.
 
I too am glad she wrote what she did without having to sugarcoat everything.
Amzaing how P&apos;Oed some people got about her opinion.  I for one always hate it when people applaud those who have lost huge amounts of weight. I work hard all the time to maintain a healthy wieght; eating right, active lifestyle.  Nobody ever applauds me.
 
I listened to the show, it was really enlightening because you were part of it.

Some topics that I want to address though in this very long comment.. to your question of why can&apos;t people do it by themselves and maintain as others can? The unfortunate statistics show that the reason people cannot maintain on their own (once they reach a certain point, 20lbs to lose and maintain is a different animal than 100lbs) is that they are&quot;normal.&quot;Our biology actually conspires against us to regain every time we lose.. We diet ourselves fatter- everything from hormones (not estrogen/testosterone).. hormones directly involved in cravings and hunger, metabolisms change, so much more- not even addressing food addiction. Regarding food addiction, as a person that kicked a drug habit cold turkey (kudos to you)- could you have done that if someone told you that you needed to use a tiny amount every day, but not too much? With food addiction, that&apos;s exactly the kind of white knuckling that&apos;s involved in dieting.. whether it&apos;s a daily thing, or just when stress pops up it doesn&apos;t matter-long term the overwhelming majority can not control this, and they regain, many times ending up with more excess weight.Statistically, MORE than 95% of people that lose a significant amount of weight cannot maintain it long term.. when the vast majority cannot, what makes it even sensible to condemn a medical intervention that improves the odds of maintaining a normal weight long term? It does not guarantee keeping it off or even losing it all, far short actually - but it greatly expands the odds more in favor of the patient maintaining a healthier weight range for life. WLS requires participation from the patient, i.e. diet&amp;exercise.  Yes, it&apos;s not&quot;natural&quot;however, please, please do some studying on obesity. There is so much info out there to broaden your understanding of this subject that I&apos;m sure hits home with you directly. FYI, exercise does nothing for lose skin, if you get to a certain size, you aren&apos;t going to escape it without other painful surgeries for reconstruction- far riskier and more painful than WLS to boot. But, even plastics post WLS aren&apos;t always cosmetic.. many times they are to return the body to a normal appearance or function.. not to&quot;improve upon&quot;a normal structure- the definition of reconstructive vs cosmetic surgery.
 
Thank you Ms. Goyanes. For have the guts to say what you personally feel, unlike so many other writers that just write what the masses want to hear.  I personally do not think this article was written to get traffic for the site, if that was the case she could have written about so many other things. If you read Fuming Foodie, you will notice that Ms. Goyanes is an extremely opinionated person. But HELLO it is called FUMING Foodie for a reason. What did you expect a sugar coated article. Of course not, and if you did go to a dictionary and look up what the word fuming means. The Miami New Times is a newspaper that gives their writers the freedom to say what they truly believe unlike so many other newspaper. and if you don&apos;t like it, then read something else. Don&apos;t spend your precious time banging your head against the desk and screaming profanity at your computer screen because Ms. Goyanes just called you a spineless jelly fish. Then pounding your keyboard to write some idiotic comment about how she is a complete idiot, she deserves to be fat forever, she has sex with her dad, all this makes you come off as a complete loser with no live. Why not take a minute... breathe and then write a well educated response. And if I may say so what in this article is not well researched? Everything I thought that might have been misinformed in her article was in fact correct. Yes she believes that surgery is cheating. It is. There is no argument to that, it gives you that jump start that you would other wise not have. And so many people are saying that surgery isn&apos;t the easy way out. OH REALLY? Then why are so many people resorting to surgery instead of the old school diet and exercise if surgery is so darn hard? If surgery really is so hard then don&apos;t do it. You can&apos;t, want to know why, because you have no will power so you resort to the EASIEST escape route... SURGERY. So yes surgery is in fact the easy way out because it forces you to eat a little bit and to exercise. And about your other, for lack of a better word, concern about a 500 calorie diet, as long as you visit your doctor and he gives you the okay a 500 calorie diet is perfectly fine. And juicing is in fact good for diabetics because it keeps their sugar at a normal number. As long as you aren&apos;t just drinking fruits (a lot of sugar) and you drink a lot of juiced vegetables too. So do i think that Ms. Goyanes was a bit over the top mean... well yes she was but that is what makes this article a classic Fuming Foodie bit. Mean insults combines with WELL researched information and a whole lotta controversy makes for a fun read. Just what Ms. Goyanes is known for providing.
 
Your ignorance is showing (and by ignorance, I mean that you are not as educated on the topic as you seem to think). Yes, studies are showing that some patients regain weight after surgery. Studies also show that patients regain weight after dieting. In fact, a dieter is more likely to regain weight than a bariatric patient, and is more likely to gain additional weight.

Bariatric surgery is NOT &apos;a copout to dieting and a healthy way of losing weight,&apos; it is a tool in the process. Surgical patients that don&apos;t adopt and stick with a healthy diet and exercise routine are the ones that will fail, just like non-surgical dieters. 

And there&apos;s a reason why surgery is not an option for the majority of overweight people - it&apos;s not an appropriate tool for everyone. In order to qualify for surgery with a reputable surgeon, the patient generally must be morbidly obese (which is going to be 100+ pounds), must have a demonstrated history of failed weight loss efforts, and must be suffering from co-morbidities associated with their weight - diabetes, heart disease, stroke risk, etc.
 
Comparing WLS to amputation is a ridiculous analogy. And someone who replies as &apos;a reader&apos; to someone that has signed their name has no business referring to anyone else as a cyber bully, btw.

Really, so if someone cut off their arms and legs to lose weight, people should be supportive of that? Think before you write. Not all ways of losing weight can be acceptable. You should not be a cyber bully, btw.
 
It&apos;s true about it being a painful procedure, also one that has not proven to be permanently successful. Studies are showing that the patients can regain the weight after some gastric bypass surgeries. It&apos;s not painless.  But it is a copout to dieting and a healthy way of losing weight. Personally, I think that if more people had psychotherapy with a good psychoanalyst, the reasons for their overeating would come out and can be worked on.
When people want to insulate themselves with extra pounds, there has to be some inner reason.
 
I hope Mama Cass&apos; spirit doesn&apos;t decide to hant you for insulting her like that. Grow up, stop being such a cyber bully. You are not in the playground anymore.
 
Do you know there is a God? He doesn&apos;t like people making curses. No need for that. Take the time to go teach your parents what they should have taught you about respect and Freedom of the Press. Maybe you can all learn together. And Freedom of Speech means to appreciat that privilege, not become a cyber bully like you throwing curses.
 
Don&apos;t tell me. Your parents never taught you any manners.
 
You know, I had a very good friend, a sweet person, who lost weight by doing the gastric bypass. Her name, if you want to look it up, was Clementina Brown. She died after suffering a lot of abdominal pain. She left two children behind. Of course, her death is debatable, but she was fat, but very healthy, active, she has this done, and some time later, suffers this horrible pain, goes to the ER, where they tool forever to see her, and dies. I believe that was a direct consequence from her gastric bypass surgery.
Gastric Bypass is a dangerous procedure, and the doctors performing the surgery are making a lot of $$$$ every time a&quot;spineless jellyfish&quot;has the procedure done.  It&apos;s not because they care about poor fatties. 
Thank God there are many good doctors out there who care about their patients and outnumber the others who don&apos;t.
Research is showing that patients are gaining back the weight they lost from gastric bypass surgery, by the way, so maybe it&apos;s not the permanent quick solution either.
 
What an intelligent individual you are. You persisted, and met your challenge head-on and won. I admire you because instead of taking the easy way out, having a bypass done, you had the discipline to do the right thing.
 
As a dedicated gym rat, I&apos;m all up for putting the time in the gym, but I&apos;ve only ever heard about diet and exercise (thought I&apos;m no expert on the subject, nor have I met anyone who&apos;s gone through it) being part of the deal when a person commits to one such surgery because from what I&apos;ve always heard portion and food type have to b meticulously measured and planned in order for the surgery to b ultimately succesful. It seems to me to b the more painful way out, but at least it would b a way out. Truly being spineless and self indulgent would be to remain obese or overweight and to continue stuffing tacos down the pie hole &apos;till you&apos;re big enough to b a body double for that guy in the movie Seven (eek. Gluttony was it?) Anyway, that&apos;s just my take on it. :) Everyone&apos;s road to fitness is different, what&apos;s important is to take it. :D
 
I think you did it in reverse. Instead of&quot;healthy eating, daily exercise, and most importatly working on the HEAD(the why&apos;s of why I got fat)&quot;according to your own quote, YOU SHOULD HAVE HAVE STARTED WITH WORKING ON YOUR HEAD(AS TO WHY&quot;S YOU GOT FAT) AND WOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED THE SURGERY.
 
You&apos;re very welcome and I appreciate the fact that you all had me on the show. Sometimes people just have to agree to disagree, but the fact that we were able to have a mature and open discussion about our different viewpoints is one of the beautiful things about living in a free country. God bless and thanks again for the opportunity to respond to all your comments. Great show.
 
Yeah.  You tell her.  I am 4 years, 3 months and 130 pounds out.  Each and every day I watch others eat what I used to eat.  I think-there goes me.  I see little kids that are living how I lived as a little kid-overweight and in bad health.  I feel so much better.  I would not be alive today.  It makes me so mad to hear people talk about others like she has.  It is none of her damn business what others do.  I hope that her attitude did not cause someone to reconsider having surgery and die.  It will be on her.
 
Amen.  She could not survive what we have to go through each day.
 
You are stupid and don&apos;t know what you are talking about.  Gastric bypass is NOT the easy way out.  I still have to work to lose weight.  I have yoyoed so much in the last 50 years, that metabolism is shot.  When I had this surgery, it was a choice between having it and dying.  I believe I would rather have the surgery.  It was a very hard decision until I found out I had already had a&quot;silent&quot;heart attack.  It is much less expensive to have the surgery than be on insulin because of diabetes.  If most people had had lived healthier lives, most would not have to have heart bypass surgery.  Are you going to say they are lazy too.  Some have had to have the heart surgery just because, not because they did anything wrong.  If you got up to 250 pounds, I guess you were just lazy too.
 
Who in their RIGHT mind decides to that the HARD WAY OUT?!

Why drive your car when you can walk? Driving is the easy way out of getting from one location to another. 

Why use a computer to blog when you can write with a chisel on a rock and HOPE people will see it?! Worked for the 10 commandments at least! Computer blogging is the&quot;easy way out&quot;for writing.

Inventions are there to make our lives easier, and WLS is just one more way to make our lives easier. It does NOT eliminate our need to watch what we eat, or our need to exercise. I think The Biggest Loser and other weight loss reality shows have proved that to us by show casing people who HAVE already HAD WLS and FAILED!!

WLS is a tool, to help keep us motivated and to help with portion control. Just like treadmills are tools to help us exercise in the comfort in our own home instead of going to a gym and sometimes embarrassing ourselves.

I used to think WLS was&quot;the easy way out&quot;, until I found myself at my heaviest weight and everything else failed. For 3 years I&apos;ve been able to finally keep the weight off. It is by no means&quot;easy&quot;. There is so much I can not do, like I did before. But there are so many more new things I can do now I wasn&apos;t able to do before I had surgery and lost the 150lbs.
 
Ily,

Thank you for joining our radio show tonight to discuss..  We are obviously going to disagree on some issues but I thank you for being open minded and listening to our stories and for offering us your thoughts and opinions as well.  I look forward to reading your follow up blog post.

If anyone would like to listen to the recorded content of our discussion with Ily Goyanes - it will be posted to www.bariatrictv.com in the next few days.

500 cals a day WTF!!!! oh thats healthy.....NOT!!!
 
I have not had surgery and yet you offend me! I  am losing weight slowly every inch and every pound. I am  a little envious of my friends that drop the weight as if it is melting off, I am happy for them as I watch them step out into the world, zip line across a canyon, swing in a swing,  rejoice as their twin goes from being unhealthy to healthy or go some where they would never had gone, alone. How do you judge their right for happiness by your own method getting smaller? Have you ever even read anything about this community you label and slam so harshly?I have heard their stories and I understand they took a path that lead them to a life saving decision. Because of people like yourself insurance companies will not help people help themselves. White knuckle weight loss. You claim you found the willpower. I once found your kind of willpower. I stayed thin for decades. I now suffer from bone loss and brittle health and I am not so worried about thin now. I am just hoping for healthy. Starving or extreme weight methods will make you yo yo. It is matter of time. I have many friends, and a family member that&quot;Had the easy way out&quot;to quote you. They are tougher then nails, braver then I have ever known and stronger then a Redwood tree. Not only do they take verbal abuse from being obese, but are constantly slammed for having a life saving and life changing surgery. I have not seen one yet that could be called lazy. They lose the weight, they make healthy food choices or like myself suffer for it., and like myself, they educated themselves to keep themselves healthy and just like me ( and you)  they can gain weight back if they aren&apos;t careful. They exercise because- at last they can move as they wish. They also are a wonderful community and don&apos;t discriminate against other people who struggle the day to day of the weight battle. They don&apos;t hold it against me because I am not having surgery. They don&apos;t think I have no will power because I am taking the weight off so very slowly. I can&apos;t understand how anyone that lost weight can not rejoice for those that do- by any method. Bulling  should be a crime. Some day it will be on the law books as a hate crime. You have outed yourself as a bully. Time to put the teasing of the chubby kid to bed, for good! Time to stop discriminating again people because they do it differently then you! Reporter open your mind.

Deep inside most of us, in a part we infrequently access, is that little bitty part that says,&quot;I know I cheated and took the easy way out.&quot;That&apos;s the part that society has trained us to feel, we, the bariatric patient.Have you read this?  
http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/shortorder/2011/08/weight_loss_surgery_is_the_eas.php

I read it and had my two programmed responses.  First and quickest,&quot;OMG, I totally cheated&quot;.  Then, the second one I have developed pre and post-op.&quot;It&apos;s totally not cheating, they don&apos;t understand how hard it is.&quot;Honestly, 12 months out, my real answer lies somewhere between the two.  

Why if someone is successful, does everyone else have to attribute it to cheating?  And WTF is cheating anyway???  Did I copy someone else&apos;s answer to weight loss?  It&apos;s it only cheating if there is a winner?  Or a high scorer?  Do they call people cheaters if they are last place???  And when did this become a competition??  Don&apos;t we wish health and wellbeing on all of human kind???  Are people in UN refugee camps cheaters because they found government sponsored shelter?  I mean, honestly, it&apos;s ridiculous.  This woman who wrote this piece is a little hostile about a game that I would argue NONE of us signed up to play.  Does it only count if you work harder than someone else?  We only deserve to be skinny if we follow her rules?  Am I ranting???

Where&apos;s my answer?  I was smart enough to know I needed help (notice the word HELP, not CHEAT).  I readily admit that I was not as good as our writer here at establishing my own limits.  It&apos;s like saying a recovering alcoholic is a cheater if they go to AA instead of kicking their addiction at home. 

My sister and I once had a conversation like this - only it was honest and constructive.  My sister is thin - but thin because she works her BUTT off at it.  She teaches fitness classes, sometimes twice a day, and regulates the hell out of her eating.  She admits to a moderate exercise addiction.  And when I was banded, she really didn&apos;t want to talk to me about it.  She would grimace at the mention of the changes in my life.  But then one day, I just asked her,&quot;Why do I feel like you are not supporting me here?&quot;And you know what, she answered - honestly.  She told me that she was essentially jealous - that she worked so hard every day and she wished that she did not have to work so hard.  SO THAT&apos;S IT FOLKS - to the outsider, it seems easier than dieting and exercising.  We insiders, however, know that it is not guaranteed and it is not easy.  We all still have to work, only we had to have surgery and had to endure the struggle of obesity to get the surgery.  

If cheating means that when I work, I get results - then so freaking be it.  I CHEATED!!!!!!
 
You really need to educate yourself better regarding weight loss surgery. Wls is definitely NOT the easy way out. You still have to change your diet and exercise, or you will not lose the weight or you will regain everything you&apos;ve lost. Wls is not for everyone and obviously not for you, but for some people it is a life saver. Wls is not cheating and its not easy. You are not the first one to bash wls nor will you be the last. I&apos;m just saying....GET EDUCATED so you don&apos;t sound ignorant. Blessings.
 
You mentioned you have a history of Yo-yo dieting.  Sooo in a year or two when you regain that weight that you&quot;worked so hard for&quot;- and you will!  I hope we do not hear your spineless, self indulgent whinning all the way over here!
 
As the&quot;Rob&quot;in question that wrote you... I have not seen your response. I&apos;m pretty sure I included my correct email address... but if you could forward it to me again at rob-at-formerfatdudes-dot-com I would appreciate it.

And I will add I was not offended. After the things I&apos;ve been through, offending me is not an easy thing to do. Even so, that&apos;s not the point. Nobody has the right to not be offended, especially by another&apos;s opinion.

My beef here is that while the author has been more than willing to address replies to countless others on her previous postings, the one post that seems to have stirred up more conversation than her last dozen or so posts combined continues to be ignored.

I could see if everyone replying here was simply coming in and calling her names, shouting for her head on a platter... and while there are a few responses I see as possibly over the top, the vast majority of the responses here have been very civil.

I believe many of us here are simply hoping for, asking for a dialogue.&quot;We&quot;(those of us who have had weight loss surgery) are used to the need to educate others. Many of us have embraced that role. 

And for the record, here is the MW definition of bigot:

a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance 

Now I am not calling Ms. Goyanes a bigot... I don&apos;t know her well enough to come to that conclusion... but the tone of this article was bigoted. It showed a definite tone of intolerance without regard to the facts.I appreciate you willing to step in here and start a dialogue, and as a regular contributor to the BariatricTV radio show on blogtalkradio tonight that Lynnda Shepherd invited Ms. Goyanes to... I would extend you the same invitation.
 
It is almost as if he wasn&apos;t reading the same op-ed piece that we all have been... To say that her comments were not bigoted i.e. prejudiced/intolerant/narrow-minded, is throwing water in the face of many readers. Chuck:Aside from her name calling which is there for anyone that can read.. saying that taking charge of their health under the care of a medical professional is lazy and they don&apos;t deserve to be skinny?? Is she really suggesting this is a vanity operation akin to a brow lift? Sorry Chuck, but her entire post is bigoted and purposely inflammatory. I agree with Taunia, by your comment above, you have shown that the Miami New Times is standing behind the opinions of a very troubled person. Explaing away obvious bigotry is something no one in your readership should tolerate.
 
Hello Ms Goyanes,

We will be discussing this blog post, as well as rebuttals posted within the community, this evening on our show  http://www.blogtalkradio.com/bariatrictv.  Show starts at 9pm Eastern

Damn you really need to get a life and stop hating on people !!
Yeah I took the easy way out due my muscular dystrophy in my back that would not allow me to bend over nor walk a block without being in pain.. 1.5 years out and I am Running now , I feel better and my Health is much better , My MD will never go away , But now I have it under my control ! it no longer control&apos;s me, so blow that up your ASS !
 
Dear Chuck, 

I&apos;m unsure if you saw MY response to this article?  I wrote and published an opinion piece that can be found here:

http://www.viewshound.com/health-fitness/2011/8/rny-gastric-bypass-surgery-the-easy-way-out-im-so-

Rob is a friend of mine, and I was quite impressed with his letter to you.  While my article responded with factual information, it was admittedly emotionally reactive (and full of snarkiness) as well.  Rob was extremely level-headed and rational in his letter to you  (which he made public), and I was take the liberty to copy and paste here for reference:

http://formerfatdudes.com/2011/08/in-the-news-the-easy-way-out/
 I realize the Fuming Foodie piece by Ily Goyanes is an opinion piece, but it is very disturbing to see such … well… bigoted views about the obese being put out there yet again by someone who is clearly mis-informed about the benefits as well as the effort undergone by those who have had weight loss surgery.As others have pointed out, this piece smacks of “sensationalism”, as a piece that was merely written to drive traffic to the site, maybe boost the author’s standing with your publication?Of her many other blog posts that have received responses in the single digit amount, she has taken the time to respond to the readers. This post has over sixty responses and counting and neither she nor anyone on your staff has bothered to address the issues raised by those responding.Again, this seems to speak to an attitude that you are simply looking for page hits and care nothing about the impact of what was written.I hope your publication and the the author take a closer look at this situation, and very soon.I invite you to do a little research, there are a number of blogs out there written by folks, like myself, who have had weight loss surgery – we’re pretty easy to find. But I also strongly recommend you and the author visit obesityaction.org, the site for the Obesity Action Coalition, an organization dedicated to fighting the stigma of obesity such as exhibited by this poorly written blog piece.Thank you for your time.
I have just read YOUR response - as the EDITOR of Miami New Times - and I am BAFFLED.  First, I fail to see how your location, or Rob&apos;s, has anything to do at all with his letter to you.  Next, are you aware that your response reflects on the entire publication?  If so, I think you&apos;ve completely discredited the Miami New Times in the matter of one poorly-written paragraph.

To defend Ily Goyanes piece is to completely exclude a population of readers who have taken measures to better their health, myself included.  I find&quot;Fuming Foodie&apos;s&quot;article to be highly offensive and inaccurate on many levels.

Let me ask you:  as the EDITOR, did you take time to to do what Rob requested?  That is, do a little research on the FACTS AND STATISTICS, perhaps visiting the Obesity Action Coalition website?  If I am to go by this response alone, I would venture to guess that the answer to that question is no.  

In fact, I&apos;m not sure you are aware of how many people this article has bothered and just how far-reaching the negative responses are in only a matter of days.  If you were, my guess is that your response to this would be much, much different.

After reading that article and your defense of it, I have absolutely no interest in reading anything else in your publication.  I personally feel it speaks volumes on the credibility of the authors, and your publication.

Sincerely,
Diva Tauniawww.divatauniablog.com
 
I beg to differ. Calling a group of PEOPLE&quot;self-indulgent, overweight, spineless jellyfish who take the easy way out&quot;and&quot;You&apos;re the type of person who enables drug addicts and criminals. I have the Learning Channel.&quot;does indeed reflect a mind-set that is bigoted. 

She was not addressing an ISSUE that &apos;concerned&apos; her, WLS, indeed had she written an article that showed she had done some research, learned about the fears and the hard work that is involved after weight loss surgery, she would have probably written an entirely different blog. What she did do was act as judge and jury of the PEOPLE who had WLS and not about WLS itself. 

I have not had WLS, but I found her blog so mean-spirited and devoid of any understanding of what WLS entails, that your comments make no sense. This is not about people not being able to talk openly about issues that concern them, it is about someone who wrote a deliberately inflamatory blog about the PEOPLE who had the surgery and the fact that you, and others, can&apos;t see that is sad indeed.

A commenter named Rob from Minnesota just sent a note responding to this blog item. I returned the following response: 

Rob,As a born Minnesotan, I naturally take offense kinda easy. But your letter particularly bothered me. Of course, we take complaints and comments seriously. I don&apos;t feel Ily&apos;s post was bigoted. She has struggled with something that a lot of us have. The issue struck a chord. That&apos;s it. Neither she nor New Times have anything against any particular group, yours included.  I wish you well, I really do. I just wish we could all talk as openly about the issues that concern us.  CESChuck StrouseEditorMiami New Times
 
Wow, it surprises me how immature you are. Like many of the commenting people have said, why is what you want to call&quot;the easy way out&quot;a bad thing?&quot;Diets&quot;-especially juice fasts,I believe, are for people who are a few pounds over their goal weight but only need to lose a few pounds for something such as a special event. People who are overweight by a significant amount need something that works. weight-loss surgery happens to be it for some of us. It is a tool, and it still requires that you make permanent lifestyle changes such as a good diet and exercise. Because, if you don&apos;t, you will most likely find every pound you lost and maybe even more. Now please, keep your rude and childish comments to yourself and do research before you decide to bash a select group of people.
 
That you think weight loss surgery is&quot;easy&quot;shows your ignorance about the reality. As a person formerly extremely fit and normal weight who became bedridden with acute nerve damage in my back I became an ideal candidate for a weight loss surgery before I ended up in a wheel chair and dead at an early age. I had the vertical sleeve gastrectomy and sorry lady there is nothing EASY about it. I follow a less than 30 carbs, more than 60-80 gram of protein diet, exercise every day at least two hours now that 60 pounds is off and I can be in the water, drink 3 liters of water, all of it. You need to do the work, the surgeries are only a tool. 

In addition your attitude of derision towards the mrbidly obese people who desperately search for a resolution to their lifelong battle with obesity is chilling. Where is your compassion? Many obese people suffer from insulin rated metabolic syndrome and the things you seemingly found so easy to do don&apos;t come easily for them, nor do they tend to work.

I am just glad I am not a friend of yours, not with that nasty streak you have, and your lofty standards of behavior.
 
Have you undergone this procedure?  No?  Then you&apos;re not qualified to make that judgement one way or the other.  Newsflash Einstein, even with surgery one has to count calories and exercise.  It&apos;s an aid, not a miracle.  There are no easy ways out. 

If you don&apos;t like surgery.....simple solution, don&apos;t have it.  But don&apos;t judge what you don&apos;t know.  You know what they say about people who assume, they make an ass out of you, and well...you.
 
One would think, being a member of not one but two minority communities (Latino and GLBTQ), the author would not be such a bigot.
 
Insurance won&apos;t cover the surgery for you? I&apos;m sorry. 
Good luck on your starvation diet.

Ms. LLY I know you personally and know how you had sex with your father and how your mother beat you and how overweight and ugly your parents are and your children turned out to be huge cows ect but to make that everyone elses problem that is wrong. you have fought obesity all your life along with your family and you will all continue to reap what you sow. You of all people know what it is to have a messed up life. You have had 3 abortions is that not a tool also mmmm??? I call that an easy way out if you ask me. Your abusive behaviors and mouth have got to stop somewhere. Now you have sorned the wrong people I would be afraid to be caught out in public at anytime and you will need to look over your shoulder everywhere now how sad you opened your mouth one to many times my dear and I warned you
 
Thats my Sally well said as always!!!! I guess I am just appauled by her name calling ect. So immature and disgusting. It is like who raised her the wolves.. It is very obvious to me she had horrible family values
 
Although I agree with what your saying I don&apos;t agree with fing things or people off that makes you no better then LLY GOYANES when you say things in those words but I do agree and like the way you state You keep fighting your body and I will sit by and live my life healthy and happy. Easily. very good choice of words on your part with that phrase
 
I can&apos;t believe your comments...so judgmental. It&apos;s one thing to have an opinion but to degraded someone&apos;s choices...shows stupidity and a closed mind.
 
I don&apos;t think this ranter (&quot;author&quot;) is at all interested in an INFORMED discussion about WLS.  Anyone with two forefingers and a computer could easily do a google search and find hundreds of credible sources of info on WLS. No, Ily seems to be either envious (couldn&apos;t afford it maybe; or maybe your insurance wouldn&apos;t cover it) or a miserable person, or both.  I wonder if your&quot;friends&quot;who had bypass and lapband would still be your friends if they knew you thought of them as&quot;spineless jellyfishes&quot;.  Kudos to you for losing 80 lbs, but you are woefully prideful about your success - remember, pride comes before destruction!  If this was a stunt to get more traffic on your page, it may have worked temporarily, but I doubt in the long run.  Who wants to read something written by an ignorant, uninformed, bigoted pseudo-journalist??
 
I think you have the right to your views on weightloss.. I don&apos;t agree with them 100% but that is ok as well at least you are not calling bad names like this woman did in her article that is uncalled for and very immature at its best.
 
For many morbidly obese people, weight loss surgery may be the ONLY realistic alternative for achieving a long, healthy life. Repeated worldwide research (which you obviously did not take the time to study) provides irrefutable evidence that body weight is largely a function of genes — just like height or a family propensity for cancer. These genes help regulate appetite and metabolism. People prone to obesity seem to gain excessive weight easily, while finding it difficult or impossible to lose it. That&apos;s why diets almost always fail and why WLS is currently the only viable weight loss option for many morbidly obese people. Most people can lose no more than 5-10% off their&quot;natural&quot;body weight by exercising and eating wisely. Decades of diet studies show that more than 90% of people who lose weight by dieting gain it all back within 5 years. Of course there are exceptions, but when you are speaking of general rules, the majority of people who are able to lose more than 10 percent of their body weight and keep it off are people who have had weight loss surgical procedures.
 
When you have:
 
Taken a year of your life to educate yourself on the good, the bad and the ugly about weight loss surgery; 
 
tried every conceivable method of weight loss for 25 or more years to lose weighte only to gain the loss back and more; have a family history of heart disease and diabetes and are terrified of going down the same road; 
 
worked relentlessly on your own&quot;head battles&quot;that contributed to your genetic propensity to obesity; 
 
had your primary care physician agree with your well thought through decision to ask for this life changing procedure and had your health care provider accept you into their nationally recognized bariatric program that requires even more education, psychological counseling, nutritional guidance and physical preparedness before being released for surgery whether it takes you a month or a year because they acknowledge the long-term savings for them in obesity-related complications and promote preventative health care ... 
 
when YOU are physically, emotionally and spiritually prepared to spend every waking day of the rest of your life attending to the nutritional and physical needs of your surgically altered body to avoid malnutrition
 
When YOU, my friend, have done YOUR research .... then come back and restate your opinion that weight loss surgery is the easy way out to the hundreds of thousands of people in this country alone whos lives have been saved by weight loss surgery procedures.  
 
Thank you ...

In late July, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) declared Obesity a disease state. Quote: “Thus, multiple therapeutic interventions may be necessary 
 lifelong to delay or reverse obesity in patients. Certainly, current 
 efforts have not prevented the proliferation of obesity in the US 
 population as well as elsewhere. Additional interventions and 
 alternative approaches are clearly necessary.”

Multiple. Therapeutic. Interventions. Including but not limited to: Education, obesity 
 management, including behavioral, nutritional, pharmacological and 
 surgical.
Education being number one on the list. Advice like&quot;Push away from the table fatso and hit the gym.&quot;is completely insulting and exactly why so many with the disease of Obesity are afraid to seek care and end up dying. Let&apos;s stop the bickering, disrespect, and instead collaborate on strategies to move towards wellness to reverse this effects of this disease.
 
I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but you should really get your facts straight before you make comments about something that you obviously now VERY little about.  I am having a very hard time understanding how you can say that having your guts rearranged is&quot;easy&quot;.  I had RNY gastric bypass almost four years ago, (down 150 lbs btw) and it was not like I woke up one morning and thought,&quot;Gee, I think I&apos;m going to have my stomach cut to the size of a roll of quarters and my intestines rerouted in order to lose weight.  That seems like it will be SUPER easy!&quot;Having surgery changes your entire life.  Not only do you change your eating and exercise habits, you have to change the way you view the world.  You have to accept that people now treat you in a different way.  Being thin is supposed to be normal, but I STILL feel like the odd woman out when I carry my water bottle around everywhere, wear cardigans when everyone else is wearing tank tops, and ask for a box at a restaurant after eating only 1/8 of my steak and four bites of veggies.  This is not easy to accept that people still see me as different even though I am now supposed to be&quot;normal&quot;, but it is something that I work on every day of my life.  

Basically the bottom line is this, people make choices every day that others do not agree with, but it is their life and they live with the outcomes.  You choose to eat 500 calories and work out two hours a day, (btw I find that insane and unhealthy, but hey more power to ya), whereas I choose to be happy about having surgery and gaining a new outlook on life even with all the changes that it has come with it.

Happy eating, or not eating as your case may be!

I don&apos;t get it!  Ignorant idiots cry and whine because they don&apos;t like looking at fat people but when fat people try to do something that improves their health and helps them to look better they bitch about that too!!!  Jeez, jealous much?!?  Do some research before you spout this crap because you obviously know nothing about weight loss surgery or the people who go through with it.
 
Well, you&apos;ll be happy to know that I wrote an article in response to this that will probably generate a ton of new traffic for you.  You won&apos;t be happy to know that I was incredibly snarky, because you deserve it with those comments.  Happy reading!  http://www.viewshound.com/health-fitness/2011/8/rny-gastric-bypass-surgery-the-easy-way-out-im-so-?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=achievement&amp;utm_campaign=article
 
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.
 
It&apos;s not taking the easy way out... people who have the surgery need to learn how to eat all over again, just how you would teach a child... Good for you losing weight on your own but some others need some help. and they have medical issues that the surgery is a better option for them. You still have to watch what you eat, and work out just like any other person dieting or making lifestyle changes... So really how are patients who have the surgery spineless jellyfish? is it because they want to get healthy just like you? or the fact they need help achieving weight loss.. people diet for years and lose weight and gain tons back. are they spineless because they don&apos;t want to go back to yo-yo dieting???
 
And how is that diet working for you?  Not so good, huh?
 
I think it&apos;s interesting how there&apos;s this perception that at your highest weight you&apos;re the only one who has lived through the hell that brings with it.  For you, it was 250 lbs.  For me, it was 365 lbs with a BMI of 66.

I can&apos;t tell you how thankful I am that I found out that there isn&apos;t just one form of weight loss surgery - but there are many.  Some a good thing - some, not so much.

I had the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (also known as the DS) with Dr. Aniceto Baltasar in Alcoy, Spain 9 years ago.  I was wheelchair-bound, had congestive heart failure, out of control diabetes, stroke level hypertension, severe obstructive sleep apnea, to name a few.  My doctor had given the opinion I might live another 6 months without drastic intervention.  And so drastic intervention (along with quite a lot of what can only be described as divine intervention as well) was taken - and my life was spared.

I wish I could somehow give the gift of a few days of the beauty and thrill of a few days of what it is like to be a DS post-op.  Blessings so amazing it&apos;s really pretty hard to catalog.  Suffice it to say the wheelchair went away, the congestive heart failure went away, the hypertension went away, the diabetes went away, the sleep apnea went away - along with 240 pounds.

I guess I could be angry with you, but I&apos;m not.  I&apos;m just incredibly humbled and awed by the fact that I was given this amazing gift and blessed so incredibly richly.

Here&apos;s a great article by Dr. Mitchell Roslin from Lenox Hill Hospital in NY.  http://livingthedslife.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/revisions-%E2%80%93-does-the-patient-fail-the-procedure-or-does-the-procedure-fail-the-patient/
 
You are entitled to your opinion, and so am I, in my opinion, I think you are an idiot. I bet if you told that to a WLS patient to there face you would get slapped.

Yes, if anyone burns more calories than they consume, then you will lose weight. But can you keep it off for the rest of your life. For some it&apos;s a huge struggle and ultimately becomes a last resort. I have struggled my entire life and have been successful in the past but like many other people who have&quot;dieted&quot;, the weight creeps back on you and you end up heavier than you were when you were before. 

WLS is no easy way out. It was the hardest choice I have ever made and has been way harder than any starvation diet and work out till I pass out routines. It&apos;s very ignorant to place your opinion on something you know nothing about because you personally have not experienced it yourself. That&apos;s like saying strawberries are the best fruit in the world when you have never tried one.

WLS patients still diet, excercise, and live the heathy lifestyles that they should, now the only difference is that they have an extra tool to help them succeed for long term. It has been proven that it nor only saves lives, but is a CURE for obesity related diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. :)

People are changing there lives for the better and want to achieve healthy lifestyles and want to live normal, active lives. It doesn&apos;t matter how you get there, but anyone who achieves there goals do deserve applaude and praise because it is a great accomplishment!!! :)
 
WELL SAID JUDI JO!!! How DARE this person think it&apos;s the EASY way out!  Nothing easy about it Miss Self Righteous.  urrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
 
Weight loss surgery is NOT the easy way out!  I had a gastric bypass surgery in May and I  count every calorie I put into my mouth (I eat approximately 1000 per day), make good food choices, and exercise 2 hours a day.  This is not in any way easy!  Weight loss surgery is simply a tool that helps me with portion control. When I don&apos;t count calories and exercise, I don&apos;t loose weight.  By the way, having a surgeon cut me open and rearrange my digestive system was not easy either.  I was in the hospital for 5 days and had complications that required a surgically placed stomach drain that I had to carry around for a month.  I was in excruciating pain immediately following the surgery and even now if I overindulge, I&apos;m in so much pain that I feel like I&apos;m dying for about an hour. I don&apos;t expect every person with a weight problem to make the same decision that I did, but don&apos;t say that I&apos;m lazy and took the easy way out.  You have no way of knowing whether or not this is the easy way, because you haven&apos;t taken it!
 
Talk to me in about 5 years when you have not only regained your 80 pounds you have lost through&quot;diet and exercise&quot;but probably are closing in or past 275 instead of just 250. Statistically, you have a 98% chance of regaining your weight and more by 5 years. Good luck to you..
 
Too funny -- I was about to post the exact same thing.  Yes, author -- stop using tools!  And, while you&apos;re at it, if you have a clogged artery, don&apos;t get an angioplasty!  It&apos;s&quot;cheating&quot;to use medical advances to fix serious health problems after all, isn&apos;t it.

And, if you could see how great I look, 3 years post-Band, after watching what I eat and working out 3-4 times a week, I think you&apos;d be even more of a hater than you already are.  Jealousy is a powerful demon!

BTW, losing weight slowly and steadily with the band (I lost just under a pound a week on average during my weight loss phase) is a hell of a lot more healthy than going on a completely unsustainable 500 calorie diet. It&apos;s also a hell of a lot more sustainable.  And I&apos;m speaking from experience -- that was my go-to diet for a few years, but I always gained all the weight back and more the second I went off those starvation rations.  This is so much better.  And you know what?  It IS easier than doing just diet and exercise alone.  It&apos;s actually possible and sustainable.

Enjoy your decision to stay fat or suffer on 500 calories!  I&apos;m off to the beach later today!  This is the first time in my entire life that I&apos;ve been able to feel amazing in a bikini and I&apos;m going to enjoy every minute of it.
 
I think the poster was saying that dieting has a 5% success rate, not WLS.
 
WLS has only a 5% success rate?  I don&apos;t think so.  Where are you getting your stats for this?
