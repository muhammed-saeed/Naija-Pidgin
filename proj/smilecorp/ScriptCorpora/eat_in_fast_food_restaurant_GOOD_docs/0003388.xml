 Super 8 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:57 pm Posted In: Movies 
This is a sci-fi movie written and  directed by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. It is a typical summer movie and a very Spielberg movie. JJ Abrams directed the very succesful Lost TV series.

 Super 8, set in late 1970′s in Lilian  a fictional small town in Ohio.   It is about a missing alien being hunted by the US Air Force. The alien escaped from a train wreck while being transported.

The movie starts with a scene in the town’s steel mill showing their accident-free days in a billboard coming to an end. One of their employees, the wife of one of the town’s officer met an accident and died.  They have a son together, Joe Lamb which is one of the main characters in the movie. A few months later Joe and his friends stumbled upon the train wreck when they were“filming”a home-made horror movie in the train station. During the filming, the transport train crashes, their abandoned camera ( a Super 8 which is a staple of many American families at that time for home recording) captures something. That something escapes and hides and you don’t see it physically until late in the movie.

This is an alien movie but the alien only has a supporting role. Nobody among the characters in the movie stand out as a performer; there are so many subplots. Elle Fanning (sister of Dakota) stars as Alice Dainard, a spitfire and the love interest of Joe Lamb. She played the femme fatale in the home-made zombie movie the kids are filming.

Watching Super 8 is like watching the movies made by Spielberg during the 70′s and 80′s. Movies like E.T., Close Encounter of the Third Kind, Jurassic Park, Jaws, etc. Abrams has made a movie very similar to Spielberg’s. JJ Abrams should stop aping Spielberg and creating his own style. Super 8 is a nostalgic recreation of E.T. , Gremlins, Polthergeist, etc. Like Spielberg’s movies Super 8 is a popcorn entertainment.

If you like to watch the sci-fi movies made by Spielberg, have Netflix send these movies to you or watch them online. Don’t waste your time and money on Super 8.

 Polka Polish Restaurant 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:55 pm Posted In: Food, Dining&amp;Cuisine 
Polka is a restaurant featuring Polish cuisine. It is a small restaurant with home-cooked ambiance.

Address: 4112 Verdugo Road, Los Angeles, CA 90065

Decor: The restaurant is located in a small strip mall. The decor is like your grandmother’s dining room with mismatch furniture and decor, it is a mess.  The walls and cabinets  are full of knick knacks. There’s a lot decor items with Polish heritage hanging on the wall. It is very homey. Don’t mind the decor, their food is heavenly. From the outside, you would never know this is a gem.

 

 

Their meal includes a salad, soup, main entrée, and desert. Drinks are extra. I ordered the Kura which is a chicken breast, marinated and sautéed with onions. It came with steamed vegetables (beans, carrots, pea and corn) and mash potatoes.. The chicken is very moist, tender and tasty. The soup cabbage and it is very creamy, have never tasted a soup as good.The salad came with sesame dressing. The Kura is mind blowing. The portion size is sizable. The food is very filling, so don’t go to Polka if you are not super hungry.

Other items on their menu includes Kielbasa (Polish sausage),  Golabki (stuffed cabbage), Gulasz (beef stew), Pierogi and Watrobka (chicken livers with onions and garlic). The soup and dessert change everyday.

The service is wonderful (the waitress is actually the owner). As soon as you are seated, the server (who is very friendly) takes order for your drink and back in a few minutes to check if you are ready. The restaurant is small so during weekends, you need to place a reservation as it can get crowded which is not surprising, their food is really great. Parking is also a problem as the place is in a sketchy and small strip mall.

Their price is not very cheap but the food is very hearty and left very satisfied and would  definitely return. The restaurant was featured once in the Howser’s California Adventure TV program.

If you love home-cooked Polish food, Polka is the place. This is a no-frills and quaint Polish restaurant with home-cooked food and great service.

 X-Men 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:52 pm Posted In: Movies 
This is the fifth installment of the movie series and stars James McAvoy as a telepathic and Michael Fassbender as Erik/Magneto and Kevin Bacon.

Like the first installment, this latest installment starts with a scene in the Auschwitz concentration camp then the movie settles in  the 1960′s during the Cuban missile crisis. It turns out the crisis was hatched by the mutants. In the opening scene Erik which grows up to become Magneto is being terrorized in order to tap his super power capabilities. Using World War II scenes specially Nazi death camps like Auschwitz is absurd if not distasteful.

The film tried to explain the origin of X-Men and also Magneto’s pointy helmet/mask. The helmet was invented by the Russians to prevent telephatic mind-reading.

Michael Fassbender acted his part very well as Magneto and James McAvoy also has his moments as the telephathic Professor X. He is a nerdy professor of genetics at Oxford and lives with Raven, the blue mutant in a castle. They grow up like sister and brother and recruited by the CIA to track down the evil Shaw. Kevin Bacon is also very good as the villain. He engineered the Cuban missile crisis in order tp dominate the world.

The movie starts in Auschwitz then moved to New York, England, Argentina, Las Vegas, Miami, Moscow, Virginia. If you think the second installment is bad, this is worst. It is combination of  political metaphor and eye candy.

Unless you are a fan of comics movies, wait for it when it comes out in DVD.

 Panda Express 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:18 pm Posted In: Food, Dining&amp;Cuisine 
Panda Express is a chain of casual fast food restaurant offering American Chinese food. It is the largest fast food offering Chinese food in the US.

Panda Express offers a variety of Chinese food including the most common Chinese entrée’s like Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, fried rice and Chow Mein (noodles) and other stir fried entrée’s. They claim they do not use MSG. They are based in Rosemead, California (a Southern California city in the San Gabriel Valley).

 

 

 
 

Their restaurants have typical fast food ambiance with Oriental decor, brightly lighted with strong bright colors like red and orange, clean and looks very commercial. It is not the typical one store/family owned Chinese place. The location I visited has a clean rest room, water, soap and paper towels are available.

The taste of most of their entrée’s are not very authentic Chinese food. The food taste a little bit Westernized. It is not terribly bad but not good either. Their egg roll doesn’t like an egg roll should be. You can tell it has been frozen, you can taste more the oil it was fried in than the flavor of the egg roll itself. The mushroom chicken is quite tasty though. The orange chicken is dry. Their chow mein is one of the best chow mein I have tasted.

Portion wise, they don’t really give you that much food. If you are buying half chow mein and half rice, they only give you one scoop each which is not much. If you are on diet and on portion control, Panda Express may be good for you.

 

 

I have been visiting their Rancho Cucamonga and Ontario locations for quite some time. They are busy most of the time, there’s almost always a line during dinner. This is probably due to the lack of staff at the counter, they have one cashier and one taking the order. Sometimes the store manager is at the counter helping. At the Rancho Cucamonga location, I never see a store manager last that long. Every so often they have a new store manager.

If you are in a hurry and want convenient Chinese fast food, they are okay. It is not PF Chang but then Panda Express is fast food restaurant in a strip mall or food court in a mall.

 Sprouts Farmers Market 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:15 pm Posted In: Shopping 
Sprout’s Farmers Market is heaven for those into organic, natural and non-GMO products, vitamin&amp;supplements and health conscious shoppers. It is privately owned Arizona-based chain of specialty grocery stores. Sprouts stores are smaller than typical supermarket; similar to Trader Joe’s and bigger than Fresh&amp;Easy. They have stores in California, Arizona, Colorado and Texas.

The bake goods section is marvelous and full of healthy baked goods. They have all kinds of healthy bake products; whole grain, unbleached flour, etc.

 

 

 
 

The natural vitamin and nutritional supplements section has the most items I have seen and has everything you could ever look for your well-being. They are insanely well stock.

 
 

For a store selling organic&amp;natural products, their prices are cheap. Their natural and fresh produce price is much cheaper than conventional grocery stores and comparable to club stores without buying in bulk. Not only produce but also everything else. Their fresh produce is really fresh.

 

 

Besides produce, fruits, nuts and grain in barrels and natural snacks, they also sell natural shampoos and bathroom items.

Sprout’s looks like a farmers market. They sell similar items to Whole Foods  but the ambiance is not corporate and their prices are not Whole Foods prices. They are down to earth. Their service is top-notch too. Their staff is very helpful and they offer free advice on their products.

For the health-conscious, quality conscious shoppers, this is your place. You can bought natural, non-GMO, organic products at very cheap prices.

 Chick-Fil-A 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:10 pm Posted In: Food, Dining&amp;Cuisine 
Chick-Fil-A is a fast food restaurant chain offering chicken entree’. This is not a California institution but I will review it anyway. The chain is based in the South.

For this review, I visited their Upland California location; located at Colonies Crossroads along the 210 freeway. I went there on a Saturday lunch time and the place is packed mostly with families who are on a weekend dine-out.

 

 

I ordered the Charbroiled Sandwich. It is a grilled white chicken meat with lettuce, a slice of pickles and a few slices of tomato and a bun.

The chicken taste is good, not very salty or tasteless and it is moist. The meat is moist probably because it is soaked in salt water. You can tell the meat has been cooked/grilled , frozen then reheated at the store. The lettuce and tomato are fresh. The sauce is optional and is given on the side. For the sauce they gave me Honey Roasted BBQ sauce. The ingredient label indicates it contains vinegar and roasted honey. I can taste the vinegar but not the roasted honey, just sweet and a bit sour.

Besides chicken burgers/sandwich, they also offer salads, wraps, side items (criss cut fries), desserts (cheesecake, lemon pie, and fudge brownies), drinks and fruit cups. Drinks available are fountain drinks and freshly squeezed lemonade. They have breakfast entree’s and kids’meals.

 

 

The decor is typical fast food with generic, mass produced chairs and tables but I would say the decor is a little bit more upscale than the usual fast food chain. The location is bright, well lighted and airy.

Pricing is similar to other fastfood chains. Considering quality of their food, the prices are cheap

The location I visited is generally clean with a letter grade of“A”from the State of California. The men’s room is clean with handsoap, paper towels and water.

Based on my research on the internet, Chick-Fil-A takes religion seriously. They incorporate religion in their business like closing their stores on Sundays.

Generally, Chick-Fil-A is okay but does not come close to In-N-Out Burgers. If you like pultry, Chick-Fil-A is for you.

I may try the breakfast items on my next visit.

 Thor 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:06 pm Posted In: Movies 
 Thor is an action sci-fi, adventure movie starring Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman and directed by Kenneth Branagh.

King Odin rules over Asgard and has 2 sons Thor and Loki. Another realm, Jotonheim is inhabited by Frost Giants in which the arrogant Thor attacked. This runs afoul of the King and vanishes Thor to Earth.

Thor is a cocky Norse warrior but was stripped of his powers as a god and exiled to earth and live as a human. He got exiled to earth because of his arrogance and an ill-advised excursion to confront Laufey, a Frost Giant. Although he retained his flowing locks and his tendency to boss people around him. He landed in new Mexico and met Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her colleagues.

The movie is a light-hearted tale devoted to the interaction of Thor with a couple of out of the ordinary scientists Jane Foster and Eric Selvig and their funny assistant Darcy Lewis (which provided comedic relief) and turns into his effort to retrieve his hammer. His hammer was lodged by King Odin in a stone in the desert which is to be extracted by the right person. This story is like the Excalibur of King Arthur.

I went to see the 3-D version.The visuals are breathtaking but without it, the movie is trash. There was no lightning thunderbolt, not enough flying projectiles. There was no reason to make this movie in 3-D. It lacks a certain spark.

From start to finish, Thor is always in battles and one of the finest skirmish unfolds in a thin ice shelf in the land of Frost Giants.

If you are not a fan of Marvel comics, this movie is not for you this is definitely only for fans. Unlike Spider-Man or Iron Man, Thor has no appeal to general audiences. It has no depth at all, just goofy live action comic book.

Natalie Portman is likable in this movie and was able to deliver a couple of laugh lines. Anthony Hopkins as King Odin also did well. Although the movie is a Norse myth, they could have done away with the British accents; Scandinavian accent would have been more suitable.

 Panera Bread 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:04 pm Posted In: Food, Dining&amp;Cuisine 
Panera Bread is a chain of“casual fast food”restaurants. Casual fast food is a new category in the restaurant industry; it is a cross between fast food and sit-down restaurant. In this category, you order your food in a counter and your order will be delivered to your table. Usually the decor and ambiance is that of a sit-down restaurant.

For this review I visited their La Verne (along Foothill Blvd.) and Rancho Cucamonga (also along Foothill Blvd.), California locations.

 

 

DECOR: Have you gone to new housing developments and look at their model homes? This is how their decor looks like. It looks like new housing model homes with mass-produced artworks hanging on their walls.

FOOD: Panera Bread is both a cafe and bakery. On the bakery side, they have bagels, artisan breads from ciabatta to sourdough, pastries, muffins, scones, sweet rolls, cookies and coffee cake. The cafe has sandwiches, panini, salads, soups and hot entrée.

I went to their restaurant for a late lunch to avoid the crowed. Ordered their half sandwich special called“You Pick 2″which came with a half sandwich (smoked turkey breast), soup (cream tomato). With a small fountain drink, my order came a little bit under $10. The sandwich is very good and the soup is good as well but the sandwich is too small. At $10, it is way expensive.

Their menu lists“You Pick 2″special comes with a cup of soap, half cafe sandwich and half cafe salad. The half salad wasn’t included in my order. The order taker did not asked what kind of salad I like. Did she forgot? I don’t know.

STAFF/SERVICE: My order was delivered in less than 10 minutes. The order taker at the counter can be a little bit more friendly.

CLEANLINESS: The restaurant is generally clean and orderly. They have a letter grade of“A”from the state of California. Their restroom is clean but the fountain drink area needs some housekeeping. The trash is almost overflowing and the counter needs to be wiped clean.

Overall, their food is good but it is too expensive for a cafe. The restaurant is Zagat rated and they list the nutritional content for each item.

 San Manuel Indian Bingo&amp;Casino 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:02 pm Posted In: Fun&amp;Entertainment 
San Manuel Indian Bingo&amp;Casino located in Highland, CA (San Bernardino County) is your typical Vegas style Indian casino.

The casino building is relatively new. They used to be small but they have expanded to a 2 story building. The first floor is where the card table games and slot machines are and the second floor are more slot machines and bingo hall.

They have hundreds of slot machines; from penny machines to dollar machines. Every slot machine you can find in Las Vegas casinos are in San Manuel. Some of the regular slot machine players I talked to say the slot machines in this casino always never gives out money. Every now and then somebody wins big but not many.

For the card games there’s black jack, pai-gow (Chinese poker), mini baccarat, three and four card poker. Their black jack tables have 6-deck shoe and 6-deck continues shuffling machine. Like other card games in other casinos, it is hard to win. I heard card games are designed for players to loss.

There’s one crap table and uses cards instead of dice.

There are several options for dining. The food in their fast food restaurant (called Tuto’s) doesn’t look appetizing. The Asian food looks greasy, the Italian doesn’t look very appetizing either. I tried their buffet restaurant instead. There are several food choices from salads, Chinese/Asian, Mexican, Italian and carving station. The food is okay but not great. Overall, dining at San Manuel needs to improve.

 

 

The thing that I hated most is the smoke. Smoking is allowed in this casino. Although there are non-smoking tables for card games and a dedicated non-smoking section, the smell of cigarette smoke is overwhelming.  I stayed in the casino for almost 2 hours and by the time I went home I practically smelled like an ash tray.

One good thing with San Manuel is their staff. They have very nice and friendly staff. The card dealers are very friendly; they stay cool even when losing players get mad at them. Although it’s not the dealers fault that the players lose, they still remain cool and friendly. That is amazing. I guess you need to have thick skin in order to be a casino card dealer.

 The Beaver 
 by Napoleon on  July 1st, 2011 at  4:00 pm Posted In: Movies 
The Beaver is a comedy drama starring Jodie Foster and Mel Gibson. Jodi Foster also directed the movie, it is her first directorial job in more than 15 years. It is about a depressed, eccentric man who finds hope in a beaver puppet that he wears on his left hand.

Mel Gibson plays Walter Black and Jodie Foster as his wife Meredith. Walter Black is an executive of a toy company he inherited that is in the brink of failing. He is a hopelessly depressed individual with his personal and career life in shambles. Walter decided to end it all but things begun to change when he came across an old beaver puppet in his trunk. He pops the puppet in his left hand and communicates solely through the beaver like a ventriloquist with a British accent and turning it into his own brand of therapy. Meredith went along when she saw that their youngest boy Henry is bonding with Walter. The other son, Porter, is not as accepting as the mother and younger brother.

There is also a subplot in the movie with the son Porter getting involved with a classmate. The classmate is the class valedictorian but she is not capable of writing her own valedictory speech for the graduation ceremony. She hires Porter to write her valedictory speech. Porter earns money on the side writing papers for his classmates. Porter and the girl got involved and went to dates.

The movie is not dark or funny enough to be interesting. It is a tidy movie, a bland drama and comedy and slightly provocative. It is not entertaining at all. A movie about a depressed and suicidal family man turning his life into a ventriloquist with a beaver puppet in his hand to solve his demons sounds ridiculous. Mel Gibson is one of the most controversial actors in Hollywood and has been in trouble lately. He made this movie with a lot of baggage and I don’t think The Beaver redeemed his reputation as a major actor in Hollywood.

The Beaver is supposed to be dark and funny but you will be disappointed if you are seeking a dark comedy. It looks like an indie movie or a movie made for television or an extended pilot for a quirky drama/comedy for cable TV.
