OPA Edmonton Review

It&apos;s been awhile since I ate here - but I remember enjoying it so much - that I wanted to make sure that I wrote a review.
When we first moved here, I was out with a friend and it was noon - lunchtime. Yes, our stomachs were growling.
She mentioned that people had recommended OPA! Slovaki of Greece to her and that she&apos;d really been wanting to try it.
Since Greek food is definitely one of my favorite cuisines, I was more than excited to try this restaurant out.
We both thought the food was delicious...not bad for food court food at the West Edmonton Mall.
I ordered a Greek Style Burger - which I think was added to their regular menu for just a limited time.
 
It was really good. The Greek burger was served on a pita with a Greek sauce and a variety of vegetables - lettuce, red onions, tomatoes...sorry can&apos;t remember what else - but it was good and really fresh! You&apos;ll just have to take my word for it!
My friend ordered fries with her meal - and only until after I tried them did I realize how good they were. Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and jam packed with flavor.
 
No wonder OPA! Fries are famous!
Would I go again? Definitely, this Greek restaurant did not disappoint (of course, don&apos;t expect upscale, authentic Greek restaurant food - but for fast food and the price - it&apos;s a good deal!)
And of course, the moral of the storey is - don&apos;t wait to write a restaurant review!
