More information about the various

 Crew
 Member: 

The job of a crew member
 in McDonalds is no
 different from that in most
 other fast food
 restaurants, and crew
 members are tasked with
 most of the work to be
 found in a McDonalds
 restaurant. As a crew
 member, you will be
 expected to work both in
 the kitchen making food and
 at the counter taking
 orders from customers. In
 addition, other duties a
 crew member might be
 expected to perform are
 manning the drive-thru
 counter, operating cash
 registers, cleaning,
 cooking burgers and other
 food items, and any other
 task that might be assigned
 to you. As a crew member,
 you will most likely earn
 close to minimum wage, but
 with hard work and
 determination, there are
 many opportunities for
 advancement to a management
 position.
 
 Management: 

A capable management
 team is required to provide
 guidance during the rush
 hour periods of breakfast,
 lunch and dinner. In
 addition, managers must
 also provide motivation for
 other employees and tend to
 more complex customer
 service issues when they
 come up. Assistant
 managers, shift leaders and
 restaurant general managers
 form the management teams
 at McDonalds restaurants.
 No matter what your
 managerial position might
 be, your responsibilities
 will include hiring fresh
 workers, completing
 administrative work,
 organizing work schedules,
 training new employees and
 serving as the point of
 communication with the
 corporate offices and
 owners of the franchise.
 Managerial positions
 require more experience and
 qualifications than
 entry-level positions, and
 you should have either a
 diploma from high school or
 prior experience in the
 food and beverage industry.
 As a manager, you can
 expect your salary to fall
 somewhere in the range of
 $20,000 to $40,000
 annually, depending on the
 exact position and
 location.
 

The workers hired by McDonalds are made
 up of a diverse group of people, and if you
 are enthusiastic and have a ready smile,
 then there are a great many part-time
 employment opportunities open to you at
 McDonalds. Stay at home moms, high school
 students, college undergraduates and many
 more are all groups from which McDonalds
 employees often come from. The breakfast,
 evening and overnight shifts, in
 particular, are always in need of workers
 willing to work at such hours.

 Employee Benefits: 

Among the benefits enjoyed by employees
 at McDonalds are paid on-the-job training,
 flexible working hours and opportunities
 for advancement. These benefits come on top
 of competitive salaries and hourly wages.
 Of course, benefits also differ according
 to job title. Most qualified workers
 receive a comprehensive package of benefits
 and professional associates and even their
 families will enjoy benefits such as a
 401(k) plan, healthcare benefits,
 insurance, paid leave.

 
 
 THE COMPANY: 

 McDonalds History: 

The McDonalds Corporation began in 1940,
 and has since become an international fast
 food chain spanning the globe. In the
 beginning, McDonalds was a company that
 specialized in hamburgers in San
 Bernardino, California. The first mascot of
 the company was named Speedee, who was a
 chef with a hamburger in place of a head,
 and was meant to embody McDonalds’commitment to speedee service. After some
 time, Speedee was replaced as mascot by
 Ronald McDonald the clown. McDonalds counts
 the various large fast food restaurant
 chains such as Burger King, Subway, KFC and
 Pizza Hut among its competitors.

The menu at McDonalds includes a variety
 of foods besides hamburgers. Chicken
 sandwiches, cheeseburgers, french fries,
 soft drinks, breakfast foods and desserts
 are all part of the regular McDonalds menu.
 Following recent health trends, McDonalds
 has also added healthy items to its menus
 such as salads, fruit and various
 wraps.

 Financial Position: 

The McDonald’s Corporation is publicly
 incorporated, and its shares trade on the
 New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
 MCD. Each day, McDonalds restaurants around
 the world serve an average of 60,000,000
 customers, with its 2010 annual
 revenues exceeding $24,000,000,000. In
 order to meet customer demand, McDonalds
 restaurants around the world employ a total
 of more than 1,500,000 associates.

From its humble beginnings in
 California, McDonalds has expanded to a
 global giant with restaurants in over 120
 nations worldwide. The number of McDonalds
 restaurants worldwide is now greater than
 32,000, with thousands of McDonalds
 restaurants across the Europe alone.
 McDonalds is noted for pulling its store
 management from within, with more than 75%
 of its restaurant managers starting off as
 shiftly or part time
 employees.  More McDonalds Financial

 Local Involvement in the
 Community: 

McDonalds is committed to being involved
 in local communities, and the organization
 provides support to many sports programs
 for youths and also gives to a large number
 of charitable organizations. McDonalds also
 has its own charity–the Ronald McDonalds
 House Charities–which provides for basic
 healthcare for more than 100,000
 underprivileged children every year.

 Environmental, Health, and
 Safety Awareness: 

McDonalds is also committed to reducing
 its waste and energy emissions year on
 year, and its restaurants all make use of
 products made from recycled paper and will
 be working towards eliminating the use of
 products made from polystyrene. In
 addition, McDonalds does not purchase any
 beef that has been raised in pastures that
 have recently been deforested, in order to
 discourage deforestation and preserve the
 world’s forests.
