Descendents

Give Their All
 
 Features Timeline Apr 2004
 By Sam Sutherland For a band that once claimed they couldn&apos;t sell out a telephone booth, the Descendents have had a mighty impact on the world of punk music. The predecessors of pop-punk as we know it today, the band&apos;s influence on popular music cannot be underestimated. Still recording and touring after more than 25 years, the Descendents have stayed relevant through a complete dedication to All, a concept celebrating the satisfaction that comes with the achievement of one&apos;s best. Eventually, the group would pay tribute to this ideology with a new band name: All. Conceived during they heyday of L.A. punk rock in the late 70s, the Descendents cemented themselves as a perennial group of outsider losers. With songs honouring the joy of farting and eating mixed in with songs about pop-punk&apos;s most cherished of topics girls the band has always strived for immaturity and fun. Even today, with spouses, kids, doctorates, record labels, and recording studios, the band remains committed to the same simple kind of fun they found while fishing and eating fast food in Hermosa Beach in 1978. Coffee, food, and girls. Meet the Descendents.

 1978 
Through his part-time job at a tackle shop in Hermosa Beach, California, (owned by the father of Black Flag/Circle Jerks singer Keith Morris), Bill Stevenson meets Frank Navetta. Bill is excited by the songs Frank has been writing, and between fishing and school, the two begin to play together with Bill on drums and Frank on guitar. After joining forces with bassist Tony Lombardo, the band begin playing shows in the South Bay area, a growing punk community that would give birth to the Germs, Minutemen, and X. Looking back on it today, Bill says &quot;Even if one person came to see us, we thought we were the coolest thing in the whole world.&quot;

 1979 
The band continue to experiment with their sound, even playing a few gigs with a female vocalist. For the most part, however, Frank and Tony trade-off vocal duties, and the group&apos;s first release, the seven-inch Ride The Wild, features one song by each of them. With a distinctly surf-y sound and much longer songs than the ones the Descendents would come to be known for in the future, Ride sells about 500 copies at the teenaged band&apos;s high school. Milo Aukerman, a &quot;huge dork&quot; who attends the same school as the group, becomes the Descendents&apos; number one fan, convincing Bill to drive him to watch the band practice every single day.

 1980 
While watching the band practice, Milo is coaxed into singing by Frank. Initially petrified, Milo claims &quot;I can&apos;t sing.&quot; Frank insists that he &quot;just fucking do it!&quot; Despite his reservations, Milo grows into his role as the band&apos;s front-man, slowly easing himself into the songwriting process. Bill continues to work part-time as a fisherman, along with another local punk, Pat McCuistion. Probably the only L.A. punks involved in commercial fishing, they stay out on the water until all hours, night after night, a regimen that takes it&apos;s toll on Bill. While Pat indulges in speed to keep his energy up, Bill turns to caffeine: Enter the Bonus Cup. The beginning of the Descendents&apos; reputation as a coffee-driven band, the Bonus Cup consists of Bill dumping all the coffee grounds he possibly can into a mug of water and stirring. Several years later, the Descendents would become one of the first bands to sell a coffee mug as merchandise, offering the Bonus Cup, an official Descendents coffee mug, to their eager, caffeinated fans in 1985.

 1981 
The first release from the new line-up comes out on Greg Ginn&apos;s (Black Flag) label, SST. Fat consists solely of songs about food, a subject insisted on by Pat, considered the band&apos;s unofficial fifth member. He believes that the band should be writing songs about the things that they actually care about not girls, but fishing and food. Containing such gems as the 16-second &quot;I Like Food,&quot; the Descendents pledge to &quot;turn dining back into eating.&quot; The group became known for songs like &quot;Wienerschnitzel,&quot; which extols the virtues of ordering from a fast food restaurant. Labelled &quot;food rock&quot; by many, the band is quite happy with the characterisation of their music. In fact, there are many songs about food that don&apos;t even make it onto the EP. &quot;It was just what we were into at the time,&quot; recalls Bill now. &quot;Artist validity would have been the last possible thing we would have used to drive us.&quot;
