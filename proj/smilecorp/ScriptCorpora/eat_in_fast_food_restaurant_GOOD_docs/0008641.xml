Lasan Eatery, 1355 Stratford Road, Hall Green, Birmingham.
 
 By Paul Fulford Mar 27 2008 
 
 
 
WITH its open plan kitchen, funky colour scheme and walls covered in photographs of Indian street scenes, Lasan Eatery sets out its stall as an unfussy and buzzy place to eat.

The aroma of spice and barbecued meat waft through the air to set tastebuds tingling in anticipation.

It&apos;s a sort of &quot;lite&quot; version of Lasan - the St Paul&apos;s Square restaurant that&apos;s probably my favourite Birmingham curry house.

Those who have eaten at Lasan will recognise many of the dishes that appear on the Eatery&apos;s menu, but the decor and atmosphere are far removed from the stylish understatement of the city centre establishment.

And though it&apos;s tasty and good, the food at the Eatery doesn&apos;t quite match the sophistication of its big sister either.

Which isn&apos;t really a criticism - Lasan Eatery doesn&apos;t set out to provide a fine dining experience.

I visited last Thursday evening with my wife and two sons and had a thoroughly satisfying meal.

The poppadoms we ate were crisp and properly seasoned and came with zingy chopped onions and a gloriously rich bowl of yoghourt spiked with chillies.

The excellent bhoti kebab that I ordered next combined tender and succulent smoked lamb that had been marinated in yoghourt and mustard oil. The spicing was feisty.

Lynn&apos;s palak tikki - cakes formed from potato, spinach, paneer and mushrooms - won a nod of approval.

Likewise Murray&apos;s adraki seekh kebabs formed of minced lamb flavoured with nutmeg and cloves.

Ewan, though, was unimpressed by his potato balls stuffed with brie, thinking the dish too spicy.

The two veggie main courses I ate were probably the stars of the show.

Brenjal salam combined slices of meltingly soft aubergine with a smooth peanut, poppy seed and yoghourt sauce that had a real zest about it.

Better still was lau khurchan - a combination of grated Indian marrow, onion, tomato and scrambled egg that mixed varied textures and an array of flavours to extraordinary benefit.

Elsewhere on the table a lamb biriyani, chicken curry and spicy sea bass dish were appreciated. All this was mopped up with the help of a couple of chappatis and a naan.

A bottle of fruity red wine, a couple of beers and two soft drinks were also included in a bill that was, I thought, reasonable.

Lasan Eatery might be less elegant than her big sister, but she&apos;s got her own brand of sassy charm.
