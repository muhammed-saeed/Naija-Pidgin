 &quot;It takes the parents of a child to raise a child and a community to support the family in doing so.&quot;

OUR HOMESCHOOL STYLE:
 I would describe our homeschool style as &quot;eclectic&quot;, but with a large emphasis on a Charlotte Mason education, a Classical, timeline approach to History, &quot;notebooking&quot;, and the largest emphasis on training our children to love Jesus and become His disciples.
