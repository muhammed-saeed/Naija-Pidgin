Seth Roberts’Shangri-La Diet in detail
 SethRoberts.net | Visit Seth Roberts’web site 
Seth Roberts (pictured below right) is an associate professor in the Psychology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He is known as a promoter of the technique of self experimentaton to generate hypotheses and to test the hypotheses generated—in other words, he uses himself as a human guinea pig. One of the things that Roberts has developed using this technique is a weight loss system that he dubs the Shangri-La Diet . Although Roberts says that friends and acquaintances have used the Shangri-La Diet successfully, in the end it comes down to one guy doing something that he thinks caused and helped maintain weight loss.

 

Because of the intense interest generated by a news item in the CalorieLab Calorie Counter News that briefly mentioned the Shangri-La Diet, we have read read all available information on the diet in order to revisit it here in more detail. Roberts has set forth varying versions of the diet, and some of his explanations are not entirely clear to us, so this summary may not be completely accurate. Roberts wants to publish his findings in a diet book and has decided to limit further public explanations of the diet for now, pending publication of the book.

 Disclaimer: We are not recommending this diet. On the face if it, if you had to cook up the ultimate stereotype of a wacky fad diet for use in a comedic novel or film, the Shangri-La Diet would fill the bill. While we’re not necessarily saying it won’t work, the one-man lab rat nature of its development is far from proof of its effectiveness. And it suffers from the key flaw of most fad diets, in requiring a lifetime of somewhat unnatural behavior (e.g., calorie restriction) that, even if you yourself can maintain, will eventually drive the people around you crazy. On the other hand, if you are on the verge of deciding to undergo bariatric surgery, it might be worth a try before permanently modifying your body.

 

 The theory in a nutshell 
 
 
 Set point: Roberts believes in a“set point”theory of weight control: at any given time, your body wants to be a certain weight, and it will increase or decrease feelings of hunger and its metabolic rate in order to achieve that weight. Any attempt to modify your weight away from your current set point will meet with failure, or at least will be very difficult to achieve and maintain. Roberts compares the set point to the temperature setting for a thermostat .

 Taste-calorie association: The set point idea is not new, but Roberts extends it by claiming that the set point can be modified by diet. This is the second part of his theory: the“taste-calorie association.”Roberts believes that the“tastiness”of the food you consume controls your set point. Specifically, tastier food raises your set point (i.e., makes your body want to get fatter), while bland food lowers your set point (i.e., makes your body want to adapt to being leaner).

CalorieLab also has an extended interview with Dr. Roberts ,
a review of the book by early adopter Stephen Marsh.
