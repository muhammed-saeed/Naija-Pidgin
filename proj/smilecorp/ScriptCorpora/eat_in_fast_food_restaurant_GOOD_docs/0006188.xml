The Pekin Daily Times and Pekin Hospital have teamed together to create a contest called Personal Downsizing Weight Loss Competition.

This year 44 teams—each consisting of five men and women—are pitted against each other with hopes to shed pounds and body mass.

Contestants began weighing in on Jan. 25 in Pekin Hospital’s Wellness Center and will continue until the final week of competition on May 19.

Participants are encouraged to weigh in each week. Each week they weigh in, their names will be entered into a drawing to win a $100 gift card at the end of the competition.

Monetary prizes will be awarded in four categories: individual with the most pounds lost, individual losing the highest percentage of weight, teams who lose the most combined weight in pounds, and team losing the highest percentage of weight.

Team“Fast Food Fatties”consisting of Bonnie Peak, Alina Kramer, Jenny Gray, Jamie Driskell, and Rebecca Price are all fired up to begin their quest to lose the most weight.

The team chose their name from the realization that they ate too many meals from fast food restaurants containing high amounts of calories and fat.

Now they are looking into the future not only to win the competition but to change their eating habits, shed pounds, and to become healthier.

“Our eating habits were so bad,”said team captain Jenny Gray. The week before the competition the team held a“Binge Week.”Every day for a week they ate lunch at a different fast food restaurant.

“Rebecca said we had to go to Monical’s before we started our diets so we ordered three large pizzas and bread sticks. Four of us ate every bit of it. We ate so much we felt sick. Rebecca ate the most!”said Gray, laughing.

Four of the team’s members work at Pekin Hospital in the Patient Accounting Dept. and the fifth is a sister.“It helps that we work together. We encourage each other. We don’t hesitate to tell each other to‘put that down,’either, said Kramer.

The team no longer eats lunch at fast food restaurants.

They carefully monitor the food they eat, have deleted the high calorie snacks they brought into the office to munch on during the work day, and take the stairs instead of the elevator. Veggies and salads have become a staple in their lunch bags.

 The women decided to use the diet or means to lose weight that was best for them. Some are using low carbohydrate diets, some portion control, and some count calories and fat grams. They have all began an exercise program that best suits their needs and lifestyles.

 The women decided to use the diet or means to lose weight that was best for them. Some are using low carbohydrate diets, some portion control, and some count calories and fat grams. They have all began an exercise program that best suits their needs and lifestyles.

The women say the biggest obstacles they face include the fact that they sit at a desk for most of the day and it is hard to get out in the winter. These issues make an exercise program a must in order to lose the pounds they desire.

“My personal goal is to lose 54 pounds. That would bring me back to where I was before I gained the extra‘baby weight.’That would be a healthy weight for me. I have been exercising one hour a day using Bodypump, which is cardio and weight lifting plus toning at the same time. I use an elliptical and do Wii dancing, too. I used to use the gym all the time but I got busy and got away from it. I find you just have to make time,”said Gray.

Gray says that she feels that her family will start eating healthier because she does. The menus for meal time will change by using simple changes. She plans to use whole grains with flax seed, consume less fat by baking and broiling instead of frying, and using salsas instead of other fatty condiments. Crystal Light and water will be substituted instead of the high calorie sodas. She says that birthdays and holidays are the hardest but plans to become creative to become healthier.

“The hardest thing for me to avoid is breads, pastas, and Starbuck’s Caramel Macchiato coffee. I can’t pass it up so I just don’t go there anymore. I love those things! Starbucks will miss me.

“This competition goes beyond losing weight. It is important for my health and as you get older it becomes harder to lose those extra pounds. Now is the time for me to make lifestyle changes,”Price said.

Price, like many others, finds it hard to find the extra hours to exercise. She works full time and has three active children.

“I do not find the time until late at night. I exercise one hour, three times a week. I use the Wii program,‘Just Dance.’It is a great workout program,”said Price.

Team member Bonny Peak says that she can’t wait to be able to go shopping after she loses her desired amount of weight.

“I want to be able to buy something bright, cheerful, and fashionable,”she said. She said working as a team makes losing weight much easier. However, she finds healthy food much more expensive.“But it is worth it,”she said.

The team members have decided to treat themselves to a spa day at the end of the competition as a reward for their hard work.

Linda DeFrates, director of The Wellness Center, says the best advice she gives participants is to consume less and burn off more calories.

“It is very difficult to lose weight. It takes work, commitment, time and effort. They must learn to choose the foods they eat and not be swayed. They can go to any restaurant but be prepared to choose. They must also exercise. It is important to lose body fat but they need to keep muscles toned as well,”she explained.

According to DeFrates, the best time to weigh yourself is the first in the morning. Using the same scale each time is also beneficial to record your progress properly. She says that losing weight and eating healthy benefits most everyone.

Healthy eating habits encourage a healthy body by helping to control cholesterol levels, heart health, diabetes, and blood pressure to name just a few.

She goes on to say that food temptation is everywhere.

“We reward ourselves with food, especially for celebrations, holidays, and events such as the Super Bowl. However, this program is a good one and gives them incentives to try. I would like to see rewards for long term weight loss. It is important to maintain weight loss and not yo-yo back and forth. It needs to be a lifetime goal,”said DeFrates.
