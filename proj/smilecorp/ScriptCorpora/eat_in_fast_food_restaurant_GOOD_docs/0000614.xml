 Kev O. said: &quot;We were wandering around LA for most of the day and ended up in Chinatown.  All I can say is this was a great way to end our day.  There was no wait (late Friday afternoon) for a table.  The vegetable fried rice was excellent.…&quot;   read more»

Japanese fast food, are you kidding me?! I&apos;ve been chowing on Yoshinoya since I&apos;ve been in the WOMB folks (seriously, ask my Mom). I can&apos;t kick the habit but the food here is so freakin good! The Yoshinoya in South Gate is a brand new one in my hometown. It&apos;s clean, fast service, plenty of the delicious red ginger that I am oh so addicted to as well...and the t-shirts are cute. They are still to buy in my to-buy list. It&apos;s the best tasting sauce with steam rice coupled with super thin strips of sauteed beef. What more could you need from life?!

I seriously love &quot;Yoshinoya!&quot;  The food taste is addictingly delicious.

I&apos;ve seen many food network shows because I love all types of food.  One of my favorite shows is &quot;Bizarre Foods.&quot;  I love this show because they show all kinds of exotic foods from all over the world.  You&apos;ll be amazed what people eat elsewhere that people don&apos;t eat here.  The term that they use is &quot;acquired taste&quot; to describe some of the foods&apos; tastes.  Very, very interesting. However,  because I find the show very entertaining does not mean that I&apos;ll actually eat the food.

Now we went to this particular location today and was served order #126 at 12:42p.m.  What they served was definitely an acquired taste.  Barbecue chicken with a side order of salad with maggot dressing.  The salad was packaged and served separately.  So we checked our geography and found that that maggots is not necessarily a desired food in South Gate.  We went to attempt to return the salad bowl in exchange for a more topographically correct salad bowl.  Well,  the cashier did not take our request lightly and appeared offended that we were not au courant with what they serve.  Instead,  the cashier (female name will not be mentioned)  advised us that the food was pre-packaged and insisted that, if we did not crave  that salad,  then we should seek elswhere to indulge in.

Very good advise Ms. Cashier lady.

Although the food is good and i usually go here for the cheesecake I do not like coming here for the food. I have only been 3 times and all 3 they get something wrong with my order. So needless I will be returning for there desserts only.

After passing this chain of restaurants for over 5 years since visiting California on various occasions, and now residing here, I stepped into a Yoshinoya and had to experience it for myself. I ordered a large spicy chicken bowl, and it came in a rectangular styro box. The chicken was overcooked, covered in a brown sauce with a little bit of barely detectable spicy kick, and the veggies were in this yellowish sauce, with both chicken and vegs over a bed of rice. Rice was cooked okay, normal, but this taste did not tickle my palette. I know it&apos;s supposed to be fast food, but I expected more. Food cooked blandly sloshed in sauce doesn&apos;t count as good Asian fast food in my book; this quality borders on frozen food style. Disappointed. This kind of Asian fast food makes Panda Express a 5-star by comparison!

even though I didn&apos;t go to this very one, and I went to a Yoshinoya in Maywood, this was close enough, and I didn&apos;t want to add a whole &apos;nother restaurant entry, since I didn&apos;t know the street address, and there were NO yelp reviews for any restaurants in Maywood, CA or in Bell, CA.. which I find strange, right, with Maywood being a free WiFi zone city wide.
