 Description: Gone are the day of the old expensive and heavy salad spinners. A new product called Spin ‘n Stor is the latest craze for salad lovers across the nation.

How Does Spin &apos;n Stor Work?
Simply place the freshly washed salad greens and/or herbs in the Spin &apos;n Stor bag, hold the top closed and vigorously spin the bag in a circular motion. The water collects in the unique Spin &apos;n Stor &quot;reservoir&quot; at the bottom of the bag and can be poured out neatly.

It&apos;s just spin, drain, and store, and no more wasted paper towels. The Spin &apos;n Stor removes the hassle of taking the traditional spinner apart, washing the parts and then trying to find space for it. It&apos;s everything traditional salad spinners are not.

 Happy Mother&apos;s Day From Supergoat
 
 
 
New Laloo&apos;s Bambinis 90 calorie ice cream sandwiches
 

 
 Description: Call it the other white milk, but goat’s milk is actually the milk of choice for many. In fact, 72 percent of the milk used throughout the world comes from goats – and with good reason. Not only does goat’s milk taste great, it as close to a perfect food as possible in nature with a chemical structure that is amazingly similar to mother’s milk. Goats are good for the planet, too. Their smaller size means that goats literally leave a smaller carbon “hoof” print making them earth-friendly. 
Mom and her “kids” can enjoy this super food in a variety of delicious forms: there are many varieties of goat cheese or chevre, and the dairy and freezer cases hold many more goat’s milk products: ice creams, yogurts, kefirs (similar in taste and texture to drinkable yogurt), cream cheeses, butter, and many more. This Mother’s Day or any time of year, encourage Mom to get her goat on with delicious good for you and good for the planet goat’s milk foods! Super nutritious goat’s milk has 15% more calcium, 25% more vitamin B6, 47% more vitamin A and is higher in minerals than cow milk with fewer calories.
