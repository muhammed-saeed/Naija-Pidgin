Review 2 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 06/29/2012 By proudmommyo2 4 out of 5 I absolutely love it! I received this as a gift and although i haven&apos;t been able to use it yet my son hasn&apos;t made his arrival yet i love all the features in one. They only thing was that the instructions were not very detailed and the pictures show with the steps keep making me mess up but it was in the end still pretty easy to put together.

 Looks super cute and sturdy 
 , 06/28/2012 By Tina88 , Yakima, Wa 4 out of 5 I love this bassinet ! The only complaint I have is that on the side of the carrier, it has two stickers giving a product description that do not come off easy!! I have tried to peel it off but only have gotten frustrated. However , I&apos;ve had a lot of compliments on the bassinet because it looks so nice! Recommends this product?

Review 4 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 06/23/2012 By montecarloss72 , Savannah, Ga 3 out of 5 I really love this bassinet, and the only reason why I gave it 3 stars is that when I put the battiers in for the light, sounds, and movemet for the bed area it would not work! :( After my hubby worked with it for over an hour we finally got the light and sounds to work, so it&apos;s not getting good conncetion for the movement not to work, and for the price I paid for this it should not be an issue! I think it should have had an option for a AC plug in as well so this would have not been an issue! Other than that I love it! Recommends this product?

Review 5 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 Great Product! Amazingly helpful! 
 , 06/20/2012 By mustang27 , Kansas City, MO 5 out of 5 I bought this Bassinet as a gift for my sister who just had her first child. Assembly was quick and easy. She cannot say enough great things about this bassinet. The top portion of the bassinet disconnects easily and quietly allowing my niece to remain asleep as we maneuver around the house with her asleep in her bed. The features on the Bassinet are awesome and have proven to be soothing for the baby, and the mattress firmness was just right. We did however find that sheets are hard to find for this Bassinet. Every feature on this product is handy and helpful. Recommends this product? Yes Age: 25 - 34 Gender: Female Ownership: 2 - 7 weeks Usage: Every day Share this review: + 1 point Thank you!

Review 6 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 06/19/2012 By miamiparenting , Miami, Fl 4 out of 5 I Loved this bassinet it is everything i wanted to.. i just had my second baby 2 months ago and i had an old bassinet which he hates so i decided to buy this one , which i got to say he LOVE sleeping on it!
i love the fact that you can detatch the bassinet and move it around if needed, love the features it has the night light on the side is so useful specially when i need to breastfeed and take him out n the middle of the night.
I also love the fact that it was wheels and also u can hide them and just rock the bassinet which i do all the time.
I also like the fact that on the back of the bassinet it brings like a mesh opening from inside out so the baby gets some air and can breathe as opposed to other bassinets which do not have nay air flow on the back..
my son LOVES the vibrations and music it brings and it also reclines! what else could u ask for?! the only down side of this bassinet for me was the canopy it sticks with velcro on the sides and its inconvenient and not so stable but its nothing that would stop me from buying it because it works fine i just would&apos;ve loved for it to slide instead of getting it attached with Velcro. overall i would TOTALLY recommend this product if you have a newborn having 2 different ones they do not compare to this one and the price is amazing for all the features this bassinet brings, it is a very stable, pretty, comfortable for baby and parents bassinet..

Review 7 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 Amazing Product 
 , 06/15/2012 By hometrainer , Atlanta 5 out of 5 At first I wasn&apos;t sure about this bassinet because of all of the ruffles (I&apos;m not a ruffly type person). But the functionality of this thing is completely amazing! It is a bassinet that the top pops off to become a carrier. As a carrier, you can raise the back to become an infant chair. You can vibrate the seat, play sounds or music, turn on a night light and have the cover overhead with toys or not have it there. Underneath the carrier is a changing table that seems just great with a plastic covering. The bassinet can rock, or you can pull the wheels out to roll it. Or you can lock the wheels so it doesn&apos;t rock or roll. You can also use the attachment to slide under you own mattress to turn it into a cosleeper. It has 8 different height settings to make sure it can be level with your bed. Ironically I&apos;ve decided the ruffles don&apos;t look that bad either, even for me. I can&apos;t imagine finding a product with more features, especially for the price. My baby is due in a few weeks and am so happy I made this purchase. I feel like I can have her fall asleep with me in bed and then I can still take her downstairs without having to even move or disturb her. Recommends this product?

Review 8 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 Love it!!! 
 , 06/15/2012 By MarisaM21 , Greenfield, MA 5 out of 5 The first thing I noticed is the pretty patterns that you don&apos;t see in the pictures! The second thing I noticed is that there is a lot of velcro, which worried me at first, but everything does get secured. It&apos;s very sturdy, and I was able to put it together by myself within an hour, 7 months pregnant :)
The only thing I don&apos;t like is the light, it&apos;s LED so it&apos;s pretty bright, but I&apos;ll be fixing that with some colored tape! I haven&apos;t used it yet for my baby, but I tested it out with my friend&apos;s baby and he absolutely LOVED the sound and vibration features. I also really like how the wheels lock, and can be moved under so it can rock as well.
Overall, i&apos;d definitely recommend this to anyone :)
WEIGHT LIMIT IS 17.5lbs, or whenever they start rolling over, for anyone who is asking, it says it on the outside of the box it comes in. Recommends this product?

Review 9 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 Great bassinet 
 , 05/29/2012 By Nudirection100 , Maryland 5 out of 5 Ordered this online at Walmart after hearing my coworker rave about it, paid 97 cents for shipping to home, and it was delivered very quickly in 2 days, just before the baby came. I have now owned this for 2 1/2 weeks and put the baby in it every night to sleep. Love it, has nice soothing music and background sounds. Like that the bassinet is portable from room to room. The mattress is nice and thick enough, mattress cover washes easily. Color is neutral, looks great. Great product. Recommends this product?

Review 10 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 Great, Sturdy, Fully Functional Bassinet 
 , 05/28/2012 By kacey7285 , Durango, CO 5 out of 5 I would say that most of the negative reviews for this product were false. They must have not even opened the box, nor really tried to set it up. It was a bit larger than I had first thought it would be, which is nice though. One downside in my opinion would be the wheels. They seem a little too small for the bassinet, therefore on carpet it is hard to&quot;wheel&quot;it around while the baby is in it. I&apos;m sure on tile or hard flooring it would be fine. Other than that I would say that it is a nice Co-Gender color, perfect softness mattress, plays sounds. (Could not live without this function as well as the vibrating option) It&apos;s can be high up enough that my cats don&apos;t even try to jump in, as well as low enough to be perfect for a bedside sleeper! Overall I rate it a 5! Recommends this product? Yes Age: 18 - 24 Gender: Female Ownership: 2 - 7 weeks Usage: Every day Share this review: 0 points Thank you!

 Awesome for the price 
 , 05/22/2012 By OOArmyWifeOO , US Army Storck Barracks, Germany 4 out of 5 I had one of these with each of my children so when I got pregnant while stationed in Germany it was a must have. It was shipped here quickly and all of the parts work. The light is helpful and the music is great along with the vibration option. It&apos;s very sturdy, can wheel around, and I love the fact that it comes off of the base so I can carry my sleeping baby around the apartment without having to wake her. The changing table isn&apos;t very stable, but I don&apos;t use the changing table anyways. I keep the base in the living room and when I go to bed I&apos;ll bring the top to put next to the bed so I don&apos;t have to walk around to get her to feed her or change her and this way there is less crying to wake up the other kids. Great buy for the price as long as you aren&apos;t looking to use the changing table part. Recommends this product?

Review 12 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 This product has me torn 
 , 05/17/2012 By email81 , Tennessee 3 out of 5 I used this bassinet for both my children from birth to 9 months of age. I loved how portable the bassinet was. I often took it to Grandma&apos;s or other places I knew we would be long enough for the baby to want a nap. All of the other features were great as well. Now for the bad: You can only wash the fitted sheet for the mattress. The rest of the bassinet you have to wipe with a damp cloth. This was a frustrating chore to keep the bassinet looking decent through two babies and their blowouts and vomit messes. Even with all of the extra effort to keep it nice it still ended up not looking like it should. This drawback had me often puzzled as to why they would do this. Since, the bassinet was so difficult to keep clean it has me torn on how to review it. The bassinet would have been perfect if they would have made it easy to clean. I would have given it 5 stars then. I can not give it less than three stars since the bassinet and it features were still good. So, my reccomendation would be to decide if you could deal with a bassinet that will end up looking dingy or worse because you can&apos;t half clean it like you should just because the features are great. : Walmart.com Recommends this product?

 Broken twice 
 , 05/11/2012 By Lollypopmonster 2 out of 5 Orders this product two times both times they were broken and had to return it. First one the battery section wouldn&apos;t work and the second one had a broken piece. Loved the look and multi function potential but after two attempts we have decided to go with a different one.

Review 14 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 05/02/2012 By MAOFFIVE , Greeley, Colorado 4 out of 5 Overall the bassinet was easy to assemble, I did this while my husband was at work. I am still unsure whether I like how the carry me part fits on top of the changing table. I havent used it yet because my daughter hasnt been born. The straps seem to be ok but I would prefer it snapped in more securely. Recommends this product?

Review 15 for The First Years - Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Baby Bassinet 
 Truly All in One! 
 , 05/01/2012 By HisSemperFiCherryPie , FPO 5 out of 5 This was very easy to assemble. My favorite aspects are how sturdy it seems and the fact that it&apos;s height-adjustable. The only thing I dislike about it is the stickers the manufacturer uses. They are next to impossible to peel off and have left a great mess (they&apos;re plastered up both sides of the bassinet handle). Otherwise, love it! Our baby hasn&apos;t arrived yet to try it out but I&apos;m pretty confident it will serve us well. Recommends this product?

 Awesome Bassinet 
 , 04/19/2012 By JOMEBRE , SOUTH DAKOTA 5 out of 5 I bought this bassinet for my little girl mainly because of the portability. The fact that you can have the whole bassinet or just the top portion to carry around or even the changing table when you have the top bassinet off is an incredible feature. Along with the soothing sounds and vibration! I wouldn&apos;t have opted for any other bassinet! As long as your going to spend this much money i wouldn&apos;t recommend looking any futher - very much a great all in one value! :) Recommends this product?
