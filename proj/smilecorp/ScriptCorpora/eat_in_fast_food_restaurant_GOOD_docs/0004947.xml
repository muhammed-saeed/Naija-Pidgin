 By Hilary Meyer, EatingWell Associate Food Editor 

The last hotel I stayed in had an awesome breakfast buffet. Yogurt, fruit, granola, eggs, bacon... you name it, they had it. And like a consciously healthy eater, I loaded my plate with fruit and yogurt and daintily added 2 strips of bacon.
Even though I work as an associate food editor at EatingWell Magazine, and spend a great deal of time in our test kitchen developing healthy recipes, I can&apos;t deny my love for bacon. But seeing the white juicy veins of fat running between the layers of &quot;meat&quot; and curling up around the ends of each glorious strip tells me that bacon is something to enjoy in moderation. That&apos;s why when we develop recipes in the EatingWell Test Kitchen that use bacon, we use it sparingly.

I&apos;ve got bacon&apos;s nutritional profile memorized: 1 medium strip of bacon has 43 calories and 1.1 grams of saturated fat. I also am aware that the American Heart Association recommends limiting intake of saturated fats to less than 7 percent of daily calories. (That&apos;s 16 grams, if you&apos;re consuming 2,000 calories.) That&apos;s because saturated fats raise levels of LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol in the blood, damaging the heart and arteries, triggering inflammation that may eventually leading to a heart attack or stroke. Hmmm. That bacon&apos;s not looking so good after all.
 9 &quot;Bad&quot; Foods You Should Be Eating 

Fast-forward a couple of hours and I&apos;m starving. My husband and I ended up at Chili&apos;s and he suggested splitting an order of the Shiner Bock BBQ Ribs. Not that I thought ribs are a health food, but I was shocked to learn that a full order of those succulent ribs has 1,750 calories and 29 grams of saturated fat. So, if I were to order and eat that dish by myself, it would have the same amount of saturated fat as 26 strips of bacon. I could have cleared out the entire tray of bacon at breakfast for what I would have gotten from those ribs. (By the way, I ended up ordering salmon.)

That got me thinking how funny it was that I would never consider having more than 2 strips of bacon on my plate at breakfast, but I would certainly (unknowingly) entertain the thought of eating a dish that had the saturated fat equivalent of 15, 20, even 30 strips of that smoky goodness. So like some people carry around tip calculators, I&apos;m carrying around my own mental bacon calculator--that is, I&apos;ll be figuring out how many strips of bacon fit into the meal I want to order and if the answer results in a giant heap, I think I&apos;ll pass and look for something better. Or better yet, make it healthier at home.

Here are some menu items at a few popular restaurants and how much bacon you&apos;d have to eat to get the same amount of saturated fat, plus some healthier alternatives and recipes you can make at home.

It&apos;s genius to be able to count the calories on the menu and highly disciplined of you to reject the obviously sumptuous sounding dishes. I have a thing for bacon too and I&apos;m also reducing since I found out that they contain &apos;nitrites&apos;, which are really harmful to us! Thanks for the graphics to help us &quot;see&quot; better.

 klbrz 167 Fans 11:09 PM on 04/08/2011 Maybe it&apos;s just me (been known to happen), but the person who wants to order the chicken and shrimp carbonara at olive garden, is just not going to be happy with the venetian apricot chicken. If those were my two choices, I&apos;d have to go with the carbonara, sans the chicken and shrimp (a carbonara dish is *almost* too rich with just pasta, no need to pile on all that other stuff), or go home. The pizza substitutes seem okay, but the example of, no, I&apos;ll take the salmon, not the ribs, is a little unrealistic, also.

I guess I don&apos;t eat out as much as others (maybe once or twice a month), because I don&apos;t really understand these kinds of articles that say don&apos;t eat this yummy fattening thing from this restaurant, order this bland, uninspiring pile of yuck that you will leave half of. When I eat out, I tend to not worry about calories or fat, etc. It&apos;s supposed to be a treat, not another exercise in guilt. Then again, if I ordered the ribs from Chili&apos;s, I know there would be plenty of leftovers for another meal or two. That&apos;s a lot of food. klbrz: Maybe it&apos;s just me (been known to happen), but the http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/klbrz/how-many-slices-of-bacon-is-your-dinner_b_846354_83801467.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

 erricoeg 5 Fans 01:47 PM on 04/08/2011 What a funny idea! I think the best thing you&apos;ve said here is that you will try to make it healthier at home. The simple truth is that there are lots of foods that are not so good for us when they are prepared with fillers, preservatives, and highly processed that we can make at home and have them be both better for us and better tasting. I work hard on my blog to demonstrate that being healthy doesn&apos;t mean being deprive all the time. And yes, those two strips of bacon aren&apos;t going to be the end of your waistline.
