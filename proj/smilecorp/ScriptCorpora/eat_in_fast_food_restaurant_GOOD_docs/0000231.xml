For a business in the middle of nowhere, with no customers, you would expect it to be clean. I stopped by here to take a break from that brutal drive from the bay to L.A., there were NO other customers from the time I pulled in the driveway until 45 minutes later as I was leaving, yet the tables and floors were dirty. There were about 4 tables that still had trays and food on them, they were there when I walked in, no one cleaned them while I was there, and they were there when I left. This bugs me because the employees had NO other customers, seriously, NO other customers. Other than the dirty tables, the customer service is really good; friendly people, fast service. Now if we can just figure out how to get them to clean those tables off....

Parking...................................5/5
Food.......................................5/5
Atmoshpere..........................1/5(dirty)
Service...................................5/5
would I go there again?.....Maybe, I RARELY eat fast food, but it is a LONG drive to LA.

Not my first choice of where to eat, but I got a Super Star improvised with mushrooms. I hadn&apos;t been to Carl&apos;s in years, and it was just as I remember it: sloppy sandwich, fragile bread, and regretful feeling after eating.

I used to stop here regularly on drives up and down the state, but have stopped since pledging to be healthier and for the sake of saving time.

The place is usually crowded, which is good because then the food is fresher. The floors usually pretty dirty which I guess you can expect when there&apos;s a lot of foot traffic.

I always get the jalapeno cheeseburger. Yummmmm... one of my favorite burgers.

I always end up taking a potty break here too before hitting the road, and I&apos;ve come to accept the fact that before I step foot into the bathroom I need to roll up my pants so as not to get wet stuff on the bottom of them.

Wet with what?

I&apos;m not quite sure. By far one of the filthiest restrooms I&apos;ve been in. I recommend going in AFTER you&apos;ve had your food so it doesn&apos;t affect you meal.

For the first time ever I received a $6 burger freshly prepared.  HUGE jump in quality.  If only it weren&apos;t a one-time fluke! :(

Thank gawd they finally got a new supplier of fries!

But I gotta dock the company a star cuz this was the second CJ visit in a row (two different locations) where the drink dispensers were in shambles and dispensing soda water in lieu of non-caffeinated options.  Check the syrup, goddamnit!

Not a bad place for a quick lunch while cruising I-5 in the Central Valley. The restaurant was clean, and kept at a nice temperature (compared to the furnace that was the outside world). I opted for a special order (adding pineapple to a BBQ Chicken Sandwich), and hey look.. it&apos;s only 30 cents more! Sweet.

However, the people behind us ordered a Teriyaki burger, and apparently the sticker-meisters who tag the wrappers confused our orders, since i ended up with a pineapple-on-burger, and some other lady got my pineapple-on-chicken. so we swapped rather than making the kitchen remake our food.

Oddly enough, at one point during our meal, it seemed that all the road-tripping families had disappeared, leaving us in a dining room of traveling seniors. Still, better than trying to eat while driving.

BBQ Chicken Sandwich + Grilled Pineapple = good. i&apos;ll see if my local Carl&apos;s Jr. can put it together for me sometime. +1 star for the special order easily made, but -1 star for the mix-up.

Yes, it&apos;s on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. Yes, there are a lot of people who come through on an hourly basis. Yes, it&apos;s a fast-food restaurant....but oh, man. Man, oh man.
Dirty tables, floors, kitchen areas, and for the first time in my life I was truly sorry to have seen my food being made. Do yourself and your family a favor and soldier onward, this is one place to avoid like the plague.

Honestly I feel like all of the Carl&apos;s Jr&apos;s are on the same scale, but the best thing about this one is that no-one is ever here making me wait 10 minutes before ordering (like Inn-N-Out right up the street).  Get&apos;s my vote for wait time.

Of all the Carl&apos;s Jr. that I have been in my day, this one in Kettleman City had to be the worst.  After filling up at the gas station next door, we decided to go in for some last chance dinner on our way up north.  Luckily we had some coupons in the car for some buy one get one free burgers, and a free chili fry.  After we ordered, i walked into the dining area to look for a seat.  The place was empty.  Maybe 2 other people eating.  But out of maybe 20 tables, I managed to find 1 that was clean enough to sit down at.  By no means were they understaffed, since i saw a bunch of employees hanging out behind the cashier.  Spilled sodas dripping on the side, cold fries smushed on the ground, the trash cans overflowing with garbage,...It truly looked like a crime scene.  CSI!
