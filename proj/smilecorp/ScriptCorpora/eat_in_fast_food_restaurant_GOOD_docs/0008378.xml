 Industry Survey: How Much Does it Cost to Open a Restaurant? 
 
Our members are always asking,&quot;How much does if cost to open a restaurant?&quot;

As part of our ongoing effort to answer this question, we responded by asking 
each of our members to share their unique experiences with regard to their startup 
costs. We received more than 700 responses from a variety of restaurants. Of course 
no two restaurants are the same, and the cost per square foot to open a restaurant 
varies greatly depending upon a litany of factors such as service style, decor, 
size, and location. Nevertheless, we were able to uncover a number of statistics 
that can be useful when planning your startup .

In an earlier survey, &quot;How 
Independent Operators Finance Their Restaurants&quot; , the focus was on the various 
methods that restaurateurs employed to raise money for their startup, irrespective 
of service style, theme, size, or location. This segment of our Industry Surveys 
reveals more detailed statistics.

The report below shows the collective responses for all respondents. While this 
information is beneficial, more meaningful comparisons can be made by reviewing 
the results of only those restaurants that more closely resemble your own concept . 
To help you, we have filtered the responses and prepared summary reports for the 
following areas:

 Service type (full service, limited service, bar, 
 etc.) Geographic region Tenant space vs. Free-standing building New construction vs. remodel 

 



We have other tools to help you determine the cost of opening a restaurant .
