 Tuesday, Goodby Borders! 
 Where will I buy my books without Borders? Waahh!! 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

A month or so ago, Borders, Books and Music announced the closing of all its stores.  My heart broke when I heard the news.  I spent almost 20 years of my life enjoying Borders; and now, my favorite bookstore will close sometime around the end of September.  First, they took a hit when internet book seller, Amazon.com, grabbed a hunk of market share from the brick and mortar stores.  Then, Borders took a bigger hit when they entered into the e-reader business too late.  As Amazom.com posted more proprietary e-book sales than paper copy sales and Barnes and Nobles (B&amp;N) grabbed another hunk of market share with their proprietary e-books, Borders went to sleep at the wheel.  They just could not recoup the market share, even though they offered e-readers that would allow users to purchase their e-books anywhere, unlike B&amp;N or Amazon.

I originally worked part-time for Borders in its heyday, when Sue C. walked up and down a check-out line that snaked around the store at Christmas.  She gave out free cookies to customers patiently (most of the time) waiting their turn to check-out.  Everyone always commented how fast the line moved, no matter how long.  I believe all stores should use a similar one-line process to check-out customers, and soon noticed other retailers and banks lining up their customers in a similar fashion.

As a part-time employee, we could check out 2 books every 2 weeks, similar to a library, and received a 30% off discount on most purchases.  That policy spurred employees to read and gain valuable knowledge about the books we sold.  Somehow, I always found time to read a book, even though my part-time work at Borders supplemented a full-time career.  I loved the reading groups, the children’s storybook time on Saturday mornings, and the entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights.  I loved the casual dress atmosphere and the way that most people really cared about each other, regular customers and employees alike.

I gave up my part-time job when I married in 2002, but I never gave up Borders.  I spent many hours in the cafe’ drinking a pot of mambo tea and reading through a pile of books to pick the perfect one.  I expanded my repertoire from romance and Sci Fi fantasy into travel, history, and literature.  I spent many hours in the music section, listening to all sorts of music genre’s and learning about different artists in my search for the perfect CD to purchase.  During my college years, I cherished my Monday afternoon’s spent reading at Borders.

My favorite seats lined the wall of windows, and I would watch rain fall or sun shine while I whittled away a Monday morning or afternoon.  If the seats were all occupied, I would move to a window seat as soon as someone got up to leave.  I gave out Border’s gift certificates as gifts and encouraged my family to do the same for me.  I occasionally drug my husband to Borders with me, but he just could not stay as long as I wanted to stay.  After an hour or so, he wanted to make his purchase and go home.

Last Christmas, I worked at Border’s in the evening for one last time.  The HR manager, Lori, told me that times changed, but I felt a little sad.  The sales figures no longer required them to hire that many extra people for the holiday season, much less train them for a week.  The lines no longer snaked around the store, and no one needed to appease waiting customers with fresh cookies from the Cafe.  Local musicians no longer played in the Cafe on Friday and Saturday nights.  The “info” desk morphed into an e-reader station with self-serve computers and employees primarily there to sell e-readers.

Uncertain whether or not Borders would survive after Christmas, I still paid $20 to upgrade my basic Border’s Rewards card to a plus version.  I hoped they would pull a rabbit out of the hat.  In retrospect, I wonder if their decision to sell non-proprietary e-readers came about to assure customers they could still buy e-books, if the company did not survive.  Sadly, even that question is moot.  I can only tell you I now have a big hole to fill, and I will dearly miss my Border’s family.

 Sunday, Week 10 Healthy Challenge Highlights 
 Apples–more healthy than apple fritters! 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

Affirmations:

 I love the energetic and sexy way my body feels when I eat healthy, regularly exercise, and maintain a healthy body weight! I welcome and enthusiastically accept unlimited abundance! 

Best Exercise Moment:  60 minute walk at the park.  The day was still relatively cool, especially along the riverfront.  I repeated my affirmations and turned the time into a sort of walking meditation.  After the walk, I found a shaded picnic table and enjoyed a cool breeze while I wrote a little in my journal.  A squirrel distracted me the whole time I tried to write.  It wanted nuts or something under the picnic table, and no matter how many times I tried to shoo it away, the squirrel returned close enough to give me a beseeching stare.  After about a half hour, I reluctantly gave up my table, but not before I invited someone sitting in the sun to take over my shady spot.  Take that, you cheeky little squirrel!

Best Healthy Food Choice:  egg beaters, fat free cheese, mushrooms, and onion omelet.  My little omelet contains cholesterol free protein with two micronutrient super foods – mushrooms and onions.  It’s quite tasty, as well!

Worst Healthy Food Choice:  the apple fritters from Dunkin Donuts.

Challenges:  My willpower against one of my favorite cravings, apple fritters, caved this past week.  First, I treated myself to a fritter before an after hours meeting.  Then, I bought one and blew the health out of my otherwise healthy lunch.

At 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning, my sugar plummeted.  I saved a lot of the chocolate chip cookie (it was very big) I ordered Friday night, but then polished it off in an eating frenzy.  When my sugar plummets, I panic and eat whatever sugar laden food I can get my hands on until I start to feel better.  Unfortunately, my body does not need that much sugar to make it feel better, but I do not have the presence of mind to stop and wait for my body to catch up.  Saturday morning, my home glucose meter registered 210, instead of my usual 120-130.  Aarrgghh!

Lessons Learned and Moving Forward:  I must always say no to apple fritters, no matter how appealing they seem.  I must continue exercising, but be more careful about the glyburide (one of my diabetes medicines) at night.  I want to get my body off of glyburide, but it is a catch 22.  I have to eat less and exercise more in order to take less medicine, but I don’t know how much less to maintain a healthy blood sugar.  Hence, my low sugar reaction in the wee hours of Saturday morning.  Then, I eat too many calories compensating for the low sugar reaction, which makes it very difficult to lose weight.

 Sunday, Beware the Coupon Scandal! 
 Cut Coupons. Recycle Newspaper. Repeat. 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

In the end of July, I walked to my car after work and noticed a flyer on my windshield.  Normally, those flyers become irritating fodder for the recycle bin, but this one excited me.  It advertised daily promotional specials for the month of August at a nearby and newly renovated McDonalds, where I purchase food at least a couple times a month.  I particularly noted one promotion touting free burgers for a year to the first 100 customers who purchased something there at 11 a.m. on a particular Friday.  I marked my calendar!  At 10:58, a co-worker and I, along with several other patrons, waited the last two minutes to make our purchases and receive our punch cards.  Everything went well until redemption time the next week; when I felt overcome with something akin to post-traumatic stress disorder from yet another disappointing “coupon” experience.

First, I learned that a year’s worth of free burgers meant once a week versus every day – still worth my effort.  Then, I learned that I could only redeem the burgers on Fridays, which is my compressed day off every other week.  The gas consumed driving to that McDonalds from my house would easily consume the money saved on a free quarter pounder with cheese.  Maybe, I could share the card with a co-worker, so at least someone would enjoy the free burger on my Friday off.  I scoured the redemption coupon, but could find little on it that clearly indicated users could only redeem it on Fridays.  This incident joins the ranks of several coupon experiences that make me rethink the marketing ploys (e.g. coupons, rebates, etc.) used to influence my purchasing decisions.

After their introduction and a short heyday many years ago, rebates – the coupon’s cousin – took the redemption hassle factor to a new level.  Marketing experts know rebates entice shoppers; however, they also know most shoppers do not redeem rebates.  Manufacturers mandate unique, sometimes complicated redemption requirements.  Stores run out of forms or make consumers stand in another customer service line.  In many cases, the value of the rebate just does not justify the redemption hassle factor.  Point-of-sale (POS) technology helped rejuvenate rebates because many stores now program registers to automatically print rebates when the cashier scans the appropriate product, although programming errors still occur.  Personally, I only redeem rebates worth more than $5 and then the value better be worth the effort (e.g. $50 phone rebates, etc.).

POS technology does much more than print rebates.  A store can couple POS programming with a loyalty card to track individual purchases and offer register coupons tailored to that customer.  That marketing strategy turned sour for me when stores began distributing more than just coupons.  First, stores gave out printouts advertising other companies.  In addition, stores now distribute “advertisements” that look like coupons.  Twice now, my local grocery store duped me into buying multiple quantities of an item because they gave me a register printout that looked like a coupon.  In fact, the printout advertised shoppers would receive a specific coupon after they purchased specific products.  The bold print led me to believe I would receive a coupon worth a certain amount for purchasing two of the item.  In fact, shoppers needed to purchase a much larger quantity to get that coupon value.  It took me, the cashier, the customer service employee, and the department clerk to finally figure out the fine print, which meant no coupon for me.

Quite a while ago, most stores stopped doubling all coupons in favor of doubling them only up to $1.  I still appreciated the discount.  Now, more companies than ever require multiple purchases before consumers may redeem their coupons.   I disparage over purchasing multiple quantities of an item for my small family of two.  I must consider two important elements before I cut out those coupons – 1) Will I consume perishables before the expiration date; and 2) Do I have adequate space to store the large quantities?  I throw away many coupons for items I would try, if only the coupon allowed me to purchase just one package.

I buy a Sunday paper each week for the news, the store advertisements, and the coupons.  Lately, I’ve heard many manufacturers provide coupons through virtual coupon warehouses on the internet and on their own web sites.  Virtual coupons help companies cut mailing and printing costs.  I receive coupons through e-mail all the time, but I have to say I resent companies cost shifting their coupon printing costs (e.g. paper, toner, etc.) to me.  Although I have yet to move the bulk of my coupon foraging to the internet, I may give the internet a try.  Soon however, I may just stop letting coupons influence my buying decisions.  I may take back the precious two hours I spend each Sunday sorting, cutting, and maintaining coupons.  Then, marketers, manufacturers, and stores who transformed this simple concept into one evoking post traumatic stress syndrome can kiss my business goodbye!  Already, I feel more empowered!

 Saturday, Week 9 Healthy Challenge Highlights 
 Mushrooms–A Micronutrient Powerhouse! 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

Affirmations:

 I love the energetic and sexy way my body feels when I eat healthy, regularly exercise, and maintain a healthy body weight! I welcome and enthusiastically accept unlimited abundance! 

Best Exercise Moment:  The 60 second workout that was on Dr. Oz’s program Monday, August 8, 2011.  The expert on his show reiterated the point that exercise gives cumulative benefits.  You don’t have to perform 30 minutes of exercise all at one time each day.  The cardiovascular benefits will accumulate, if you perform three 10-minute, two 20-minute, or thirty 60-second workouts, as long as you elevate your heart rate.  I shared her routine with my healthy challenge cohorts at work.  I like the thought that I can supplement an exercise routine by performing this 60-second workout during my breaks at work without getting all sweaty, which stops me from participating in lunch-time workouts.

Best Healthy Food Choice:  The squash/corn/zucchini/onion/mushroom vegetable medley I made for last Sunday’s dinner.  Twice this week, I added a half can of beans to give it extra protein and ate a bowl for my dinner.

Worst Healthy Food Choice:  Arner’s dessert.  They are famous for their yummy desserts, but my taste buds seem to be changing.  I no longer enjoy extra sweet desserts.  In my typical Libra fashion, I narrowed my choices to two and let the waitress pick the best one.  She picked the apple-walnut cheesecake, which was extra delicious and not too sweet.  Then, she thoughtfully gave me an extra “sliver” of lemon meringue pie (my other choice).  I found it way too sweet, but felt obligated to eat everything.  The restaurant gives very healthy portions, and I cannot begin to imagine the sugar and calorie content in the two pieces of pie I ate.  At least, they do not make their desserts with trans-fat.

Challenges:  I still struggle eating out and fitting in exercise.  However, I believe my food choices have improved, since I researched the nutritional values of my favorite restaurants.  I still enjoy Dunkin’ Donuts bagel sandwiches, but skip the meat to reduce calories.  The egg gives me plenty of protein, and I enjoy my sandwich without condiments.  I continue to enjoy a favorite chicken and portabella mushroom dish from Applebees that only contains about 500 calories.

Lessons Learned and Moving Forward:  Each year, my workplace offers an incentive to employees, who participate in a specific wellness program.  Employees who perform all the program’s required elements in the course of a year receive a $200 bonus.  I signed up this year and received my initial health screening (one of the elements).  I fall into the chronic condition category, so my participation involves a little extra effort than the more healthy participants.

I struggle with cholesterol medicine because it debilitates my muscles, weakens me, and leaves me with little energy to stay active.  I’ve tried 4 or 5 different cholesterol lowering medications over the years.  In my mind, the side effects, including the weight creep that comes from reduced activity, far outweighs the cholesterol lowering benefits.  I would rather live a shorter life full of energy and strength, than live a longer sedentary life with no energy or strength to perform the activities I love.  I stopped taking the cholesterol medications and worked on my diet.  I incorporated much more fish and plant-based protein in my diet, as well as high-fiber fruit and vegetables.

I can happily report all the screening tests proved the effort to incorporate healthier habits into my life have not been in vain.  My cholesterol numbers ranked at the top of borderline high, but the good (66) versus bad (148) cholesterol and TC/HDL ratio (3.6) were exceptionally good.  My triglycerides (120) were also well below the top range of normal.  My fasting glucose level was surprisingly good at 126 (I have diabetes), especially since I inadvertently did not take my glyburide medication the night before.  Fortunately, I never developed high blood pressure, and those numbers were normal, as well.

I plan to continue paying attention to my diet and making a large quantity of at least one healthy vegetable dish on the weekends to quickly reheat or reinvent through the week.  Adding canned beans to a vegetable dish adds protein and fiber without high fat content.  I plan to continue fixing fresh fish for Sunday dinners and preparing some other meat for my fish-phobic husband.  I plan to continue choosing fish and lower calorie fare when we eat out at restaurants.  Hopefully, my cluster of small, consistent and sustainable changes will not only translate into better numbers on my health screenings, but also translate into small sustainable weight loss.  At the end of the day, I love the energetic and sexy way my body feels when I eat healthy, regularly exercise, and maintain a healthy body weight.

 Sunday, Affirmations–A Dangling Carrot! 
 Dangle a carrot, create an affirmation, and motivate yourself to succeed! 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

According to Webster’s II New Riverside Dictionary, “affirmation” is the noun version of the verb “affirm,” which means “to declare positively.”  Remember when you had to write an “I will not” phrase over and over on the board in elementary school whenever you did something wrong, like chew gum (e.g. “I will not chew gum in class, etc.)?  In theory, you would write it enough that you would never want to commit that infraction again.  I make those types of statements all the time when it comes to my top two sources of angst – 1) a lifelong struggle with physical health; and 2) a recent financial crisis.  I affirm all the time, “I will not eat fattening food!  I will exercise more!  I do not need another shirt, no matter how good it makes me feel!”  Apparently, I chose the wrong affirmations.  Modern day experts in the “law of attraction” (i.e. like attracts like) purport using negatives and the future verb tense in affirmations may do more to reinforce unwanted behavior than to bring about meaningful change.

Wording our affirmations in the future tense (e.g. “I will…,” etc.) may assert that one day – but not now – we will perform the desired activity; and wording our affirmations in a way that includes the negative behavior (e.g. “I will not eat…,” etc.) makes the negative behavior dominate our thoughts.  On the other hand, the best affirmations use positive language to affirm the desired behavior in a way we can believe and embrace.  For instance, “I am” statements affirming future behavior feel dishonest to me.  I cannot believe and embrace an affirmation that says, “I am a healthy, vibrant woman living life at my goal weight.”  Although my goal is to become that person, I have a long way to go before I achieve that end.  Therefore, saying “I am” that person feels like a lie.  Instead, I should say, write, and visualize a more embraceable affirmation like, “I imagine myself as a healthy, vibrant woman living life at my goal weight.”

I find a correlation between the law of attraction, the principles of karma, and a certain common statement deep rooted in my personal belief system – “What comes around goes around!”  As I mentioned earlier, my personal battles span more than achieving better physical health.  My husband and I are going through a terrible financial crisis since his business failed.  In the beginning, I focused on the negative, and it seemed to “attract” hits from all sides.  For a short time, I had to bring back my old friend, “worry time,” where I allocated a certain amount of time each day to wallow in my worries.  Once the time was up, I put them aside and got back to the business of living life.  My husband “worried” with me, but he had a harder time letting go once the time was up, especially since we incessantly received bad news on someone else’s time schedule.  That approach lasted a couple weeks before we put a plan in place and changed tactics.

My husband and I must work towards ending this crisis, while keeping our health and ability to work intact.  Otherwise, we will bring on problems from which neither of us may recover.  I want to live a successful life; but we need much less to survive.  I refuse to let the ignorant opinions of others, even family, steal the joy from my life.  I refuse to let this situation steal the hope from my life.  I fully believe my husband and I will recover from this setback and one day thrive again, but only if we let karma deal with those who harmed us.  We must focus our energy on activities and thoughts that will take us from a baseline and bring back our joy and success in life.  As Suze Orman said in her recent PBS special, Suze Orman’s Money Class , “ People first , then money, then things!”

I already keep a diet journal.  Moving forward, I will begin each daily entry in the journal by writing, saying, and imagining the following two affirmations:

 I love the energetic and sexy way my body feels when I eat healthy and regularly exercise. I welcome and enthusiastically accept unlimited abundance. 

The experts recommend limiting affirmations to no more than two at a time until those changes become a reality.  Then, move on to other, more pressing issues, as needed.  I agree, especially when making big, lasting change, which tends to come from a whole lot of effort.  We can only do so much at one time.  Remember the immortal words of young Miley Cirus, “It ain’t about how fast I get there; it ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side.  It’s the climb!”  I intend to climb, baby!

 Saturday, Week 8 Healthy Challenge 
 A Restaurant Meal 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

Affirmations:

 I love the energetic and sexy way my body feels when I eat healthy and regularly exercise. I welcome and enthusiastically accept unlimited abundance. 

Best Exercise Moment:  Dancing at the wedding because I love to dance.

Best Healthy Food Choice:  Applebee’s has a dinner under 500 calories that includes chicken with a mustard sauce, onions, and mushrooms; plus roasted potatoes and a vegetable medley.

Worst Healthy Food Choice:  chocolate cheesecake

Challenges:  I still struggle to get enough exercise and to eat healthy.

Lessons Learned and Moving Forward:

I am going to apply another element to the law of attraction and write two affirmations in this journal each day – 1) concerning healthy eating and exercise; and 2) concerning wealth.  I have a lot to say about affirmations, so I will save the bigger discussion for a dedicated post on my blog.

This past week, I researched the nutritional value of the menus at some of my favorite traditional and fast food restaurants, so I could make healthier choices when my husband and I eat out.  We eat dinner out a lot because of our schedules, and I got quite a wake-up call.  Every restaurant uses atrocious amounts of sodium in their food.  Most restaurant menus also contain extremely high caloric content, with very few exceptions.  One whole meal can easily contain over 1,000 calories or more, not counting appetizers, deserts, or calorie containing beverages.  Some restaurants advertise certain offerings as low calorie, but you have to read the fine print.  The baked potato may not come with any kind of topping to moisten or flavor the drab tasting spud; the salad may not come with any dressing, cheese, or croutons; and the sides are not interchangeable with anything else.  I can understand the calorie count would change if the sides changed, but the meal’s caloric content should reflect how the meal is advertised in the menu.  I think one way I can minimize the impact of a high caloric dinner is to make extra healthy, low calorie breakfast and lunch choices.  Then, either choose something from the low calorie portion of the menu or eat half my meal.  Even appetizers contain a lot of calories and salt.  I haven’t figured out what to do about the salt content in restaurant meals.

 Thursday, The Mid-Twenty Life Crisis? 
 
Don&apos;t jump out of the pan into the fire!
 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

Over the weekend, I listened to one of my favorite internet music stations play one of my favorite young recording artists and learned a new phrase.  This artist lamented about going through his “mid twenty crisis.”  Another talented singer recently took her life at 29 by overdosing on drugs.  She may not have been in her mid twenties, but I think suicide qualifies as a crisis.  It seems the tabloids are full of rich, famous people going through some sort of mid twenties crisis.  I thought back to my mid twenties and pondered whether I could equate my life with the level of crisis I might experience today at 50.

In my mid twenties, my career started to blossom.  I worried about performing well at work; establishing credibility as a supervisor of much older employees; and earning enough money to live within a comfortable budget.  In my mid twenties, I bought my first non-clunker car – a candy apple red cougar with a v8 engine that beat out everyone at the red light and earned me a few speeding tickets.  In my mid twenties, I hadn’t needed to see a doctor since high school.  My body easily recovered from all sorts of strenuous physical activity, and my metabolism kept me at a relatively healthy weight with little effort.  In my mid twenties, I expected to one day marry the man of my dreams and have children.  Although I suffered from the usual self-esteem issues, I had hope for my future.  I also had time.

I read an article that said people in their 40’s and 50’s are the least happy of all the age groups.  Maybe that accounts for so many people going through the more noted “mid-life crisis.” At times, I yearn for my 20 year old body, if only I could keep my 50 year old wisdom.  I worry about aging parents and siblings; grown up, yet still-dependant step-children; grandchildren; a lower metabolism; lost muscle and bone mass; succumbing to the debilitating complications of diabetes; and suffering a heart attack similar to the one that killed my father at 44.  I no longer quickly recover from even moderate physical activity without a hot shower and a bottle of Tylenol.  My belly is no longer flat.  I worry about financial setbacks because I have little time to recoup the loss before I retire.  Like many people my age, my hope tends to lie with my family’s next generation.

I cannot begin to understand the complexity that fame and riches brings to the life of a person in their mid twenties.  I can only envision the opportunities.  Although I might additionally recommend good security and a little extra domestic help, my advice to a rich and famous twenty something involves the same elements I would give someone of more modest means.  Find a calling you love, surround yourself with wise advisors, listen to their wisdom, and enjoy your life as it unfolds.  Take advantage of the time you have to build a good, happy life full of hope.  Save the life crisis for later.

 Tuesday, Having a Heat Wave! 
 Dried grass from a heat wave. 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life! 

A heat wave embroiled Delaware all last week and will continue for some time.  Here and there, the temperature dipped below 90 degrees, but the humidity regularly spiked the heat index to well past the 100 degree mark.  While my husband enjoyed a reprieve from mowing the brown fragile grass, it begged for some nourishing rain.  The rain poured down one night last week at our home in Kent County, but New Castle County still waits for some relief.  Extreme heat ruins crops, buckles roadways, and brings on a stench that could easily overpower front line waste management workers.  In the summertime, these hearty souls deserve the title of front line waste management “warriors.”

Every time I stepped outside the cool confines of home or work last week, I wondered how human beings survived the summer heat before air conditioning or fans.  Our hearty ancestors managed to subsist not only without the mechanical comforts afforded by electricity, but with the hot, layers of clothing decorum required they wear.  Men wore full suits and undershirts in stifling heat; women wore cummerbunds and long gowns; and more affluent gentlefolk even wore wigs.  No wonder women often succumbed to “the vapors” and carried around scented sachets to mask the stench.  Then, people tossed their waste outside windows or in trenches along the road where it rotted and reeked until a good rain carried it away.

I bet people whooped with joy when that engineer of old invented the first modern day sewer/septic system, although I do not envy the people who live near the landfills and waste water treatment plants of today.  Every day, I pass the Cherry Hill landfill on my way to work and thank the good Lord I do not live near that ever increasing pile of rotting garbage.  On many summer days, the odor wafting over the highway reeks so bad I turn off the air conditioning and keep the windows closed until I pass.

Maybe one day an industrious inventor will expand on the concept of carpet powder and plug in fragrances to develop eco-friendly odor eliminators for landfills and waste water treatment centers.  Perhaps, we can employ the same helicopters used for dropping water or fire retardant powder on wild fires.  Perhaps, we can employ the same powerful fan technology used to fly jets.  An industrial sized sprinkle of powder here, a jet fan enhanced plug in there, and everyone could enjoy the scent of lavender or cotton linen, instead of rotting garbage.  In the meantime, I want to send out a big THANK YOU to all the waste management “warriors,” who save us from the pestilence, disease, and stench our ancestors endured.

 Saturday, Week 6 Healthy Challenge (7/16/11-7/22/11) 
 
Shopping and a good belly laugh with my sis - burn calories, burn!
 
 ~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life 

Best Exercise Moment:  Shopping for 2 hours in the mall with my sister.  We stopped at Pier 1 to try on some cool Mardi Gras’ masks!  We walked, we tried on clothes, and the time flew by as we shared a rare afternoon together.  I also discovered the fast food restaurant, Chick-fil-A, makes refreshing freshly squeezed lemonade with diabetic friendly Splenda .

Best Healthy Food Choice:  I sprayed a glass bowl with olive oil spray, added some egg product, onions, and mushrooms.  Then, I micro-waved the mixture until the eggs cooked while I toasted some pumpernickel bread.  I used healthy spread and a piece of non-fat cheese to assemble my own breakfast sandwich.

Worst Healthy Food Choice: ½ a sub and potato chips.  My husband and I planned to eat at home, but all of the bread he liked (he doesn’t like pumpernickel bread) was moldy.  He wanted to bake a pizza in the oven, but I hate using the oven in the heat of summer.  I use recipes that will work on a grill whenever I cook.  In the hot months, indoor ovens use gas energy to cook and then use extra electricity to cool down the heat displaced in the house.  We decided to share a sub, which probably offset the energy cost of using the oven, given today’s gas prices.  It just did not help my calorie and cholesterol lowering goals.

Challenges:  Exercising in this heat! Delawaresuffered through a heat wave that traveled here from theMidwest, where it killed dozens of people.  At one point,Minnesotaexperienced a dew point in excess of 80%, which made the heat index soar to temperatures comparable to some hot spots inIndia.

Lessons Learned and Moving Forward:  This week proved stressful in many aspects of my life.  We had another event occur in our ongoing financial crisis; the heat made spending time outside unbearable; and a dear friend I hadn’t seen in some time finally succumbed to cancer.  It broke my heart to realize so much time passed since I saw her family and that it took a tragedy to make that happen.  Her son is around my age, and he has a wonderful family of his own.  Her daughter lives far down south and turned her life from one of a troubled youth to one that follows a more spiritual path.  She gave a moving eulogy I’m sure made her momma smile with pride up in heaven.

This may sound a bit morose, but I’ve come to the realization that I’ve reached an age where I will lose more and more of my loved ones to declining health and age.  I read somewhere that people in their 40’s and 50’s are the least happy of all the age groups.  Then, happiness levels grow through the 70’s.  I think older folks may become happier as they create a new, simpler lifestyle that focuses more on spending quality time with people and less on acquiring more things.  Retirement may help, as well.  A well-planned retirement may open opportunities to perform fulfilling new work, travel, or reconnect with family.

 Saturday, Week 5 Healthy Challenge Highlights 
 Exercise is key to a healthy lifestyle! 
~ Rant, Commiserate, and Laugh at Life!
 
Best Exercise Moment:  I really enjoyed riding the exercise bike on Monday night.  I wonder if my stressed-out mental state sabotages my daily resolve and commitment.  When I get home from work, I just want to curl up on the couch and watch “The Ghost Whisperer” reruns on ION television.  I need to figure out a short transition activity that will better help motivate me to exercise.  While I wait for my husband to arrive (we carpool), I need to exercise, prepare for the next day, and figure out dinner plans before we head home to Kent County.  We usually get home around 9 p.m. and then spend a little time with my parents before we go to bed.  If I cut out TV, I would save some electricity, fit in exercise, and probably get on the road a little earlier.  We try to wait until after rush hour, anyway.

Best Healthy Food Choice:  The delicious sautéed spinach, onion, mushroom, beans, pumpkin seed side dish/entree I prepared last Sunday.  The dish contained most of the “gombs” (greens, onions, mushrooms, beans/berries, seeds) – the micronutrient super foods Dr. Fuhrman recommends – and reheated well.

Worst Healthy Food Choice:  Hamburger, french-fries, and chocolate frosty for lunch.  I need to get back on my healthy lunch wagon.  I keep healthy peanut butter whole wheat crackers and oatmeal in my office and usually bring an apple and carrots.  I have no excuses except maybe boredom, and that is a poor excuse.

Challenges:  Eating out at restaurants still remains my biggest challenge; although, I have been choosing more fish entrees when we eat out. Delaware’s hot, humid heat-wave last week did not help motivate me to exercise.  The heat just drains the life out of me and crushes my motivation to work out.  I love spending time outside, but I just cannot stand the heat.

Lessons Learned and Moving Forward:  I liked Dr. Oz’s suggestion to order a dinner “entree” from the appetizer menu and then add a healthy vegetable side dish.  This week, I will try that suggestion whenever we eat out.  This weekend, I want to brainstorm 15 minute work-to-home transition activities that will help motivate me to exercise after work.  Perhaps, I can plop down on the chair and perform a visualization meditation that shows me enjoying exercise and making good food choices.  I also want to build more movement into my day by taking mini walk-breaks instead of just sitting at my desk all day, especially when the weather is good.
