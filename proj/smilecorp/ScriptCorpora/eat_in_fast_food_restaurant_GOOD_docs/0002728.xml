 Yes they will most likely require an interview. On the positive side of things fast food places will almost always hire ANYBODY.. so be your self... be positive about the job, and hard working and you will have yourself a job.

People tend to down play the fast food industry, but it is a very fast paced environment. There is also almost always ways to move up the work ladder and a lot of money can be made for a store General Manager.

GOOD LUCK
