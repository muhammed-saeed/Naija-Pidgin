Husband wanted to trying something different for dinner.  The chicken was nasty and the hamburger was dry.  And Oh my god the restroom!!!! So dirty, if that is how they keep the costumers restrooms just think about the kitchen!!!! We will never be back... Gave one star because you can&apos;t give less!

Great spaghetti...

This rating is for the spaghetti which is very sweet, has hot dog pieces in it, and also cheese.
Also try the mango peach baked pie.
I haven&apos;t tried any of the other items on the menu.

Grew up in NY so I never had Jollibee till I came to SD.....This really isn&apos;t that five star fast food joint but it will grow on you. Its the first time I&apos;ve ever had hotdog in my pasta and really isn&apos;t all that bad. Fried chickens pretty good and definitely better than KFC....

Jollibee.  I wonder why Hometown Buffet&apos;s H.T. Bee hasn&apos;t served your mascot with copyright infringement papers yet!!!  I want to see H.T. Bee stroll across Mira Mesa Boulevard and hang out across the street at Jollibee just to see if folks get nervous that trouble is about to jump off or something...

From the paroxysms of delight that greeted the opening of these franchises in the US from their native Philippines, you would have thought that they were supposed to be something more special.

I dunno.  Perhaps, the best word for it was &quot;meh&quot;.

I went to Jollibee with my cousin and 5 kids in tow.  She really wanted to go and bring the kids to check it out.  I got the ChickenJoy Treat A (6 pcs. of chicken, 3 rice, 6 peach mango pies) and a bunch of Yumburgers and fries.  For 7 people, the bill came to some $40 but we had a coupon that my cousin got that took $10 off.  Still, it seemed a bit high to me.  I could get a lot of KFC or In N Out for $40.

Anyway, there was supposed to be gravy with the chicken?!?  We got none of that.  I just had it dry with white rice on paper plates.  I wanted some soy sauce, BBQ sauce, teriyaki sauce, ketchup... some vinegar would have been nice.  I snagged the tomatoes from one of the kid&apos;s Yumburgers just to have something on the side.  Hell, anything but plain white rice and white meat chicken.  I looked around and nobody else seemed to mind.  The Treat A package was $21 all by itself.  A bit of a price gouge in my opinion.  KFC gets you a lot more for your dollar.  It wasn&apos;t that the chicken was bad, it just wasn&apos;t $21 good.  Yes, Virginia.  There was chicken but alas there was little joy.

Napkins.  I never even saw a single napkin dispenser in the whole joint.  Not one!!!  I had to ask for some and got about 3.  Am I supposed to go back to the bathroom and snag a roll of toilet paper or something?

A look at the online site&apos;s menu after the fact vs. what I found available was quite enlightening.  They have a really limited menu compared to what you see available back home in the Philippines.  The menu here makes the spartan food court menu at Target look like Dave&amp;Buster&apos;s or something by comparison.  Burgers, fries, drinks, chicken, spaghetti, dessert.  That&apos;s it.

One thing unavailable here that was listed on the site really piqued my interest though...  Tuna pie, anyone?  Hmmm?!?  I can&apos;t imagine walking up to the teenage girl at the counter and enthusiastically grilling her about the tuna pie.  Not even I am that bold of a smart-ass to try and get away with it with a straight face and sincere, inquisitive tone.  Is it HOT?  Is it FRESH?  Does it taste GOOD?  Alas, no erotic (and/or potentially arrestable) conversations were to be made this day.  There was one pie and one pie only though.  The infamous peach mango pie.  This is the way McDonalds used to do it before they gave in to the potential for getting sued.  Deep-fried with a thin crispy crust encasing a molten fruit-filling within.  I can recommend that wholeheartedly.  Damn, I wish McDonalds went back to the old ways.  I promise not to sue...

Anyway, the burgers and fries looked OK but no more substantial than your standard fast-food joint versions.  The nieces, nephew and their friends made no complaints.  I think their version of cheese fries was some nacho combo special creation of bacon bits, cheese, fries, and tortilla chips.  Didn&apos;t try it because I left it for the kids.  The baby sure seemed to like it though.  It looked like something that Dad would have scrounged up out of the kitchen for the kids to snack on while watching Disney Channel after school or something. That is, if Dad didn&apos;t really know how to cook other than frying and microwaving.  You know... &quot;Hmmm.  We don&apos;t quite have enough chips.  OK, I&apos;ll fry up what&apos;s left of the fries and throw the chips on top of that.  Uh, got some bacon bits...  Oooh, score!!!  Cheese sauce!  Kids, snack time!!!  Dad made something special for you!  Cheesy fries el deluxo!  Dad&apos;s special recipe!&quot;

OK, for the experience, it&apos;s was alright.  Nothing special, nothing memorable, probably not the best value either.  It&apos;s like going to one of the Six Flags amusement parks just to tick if off the list so you could say you&apos;ve been to them all.  The staff were nice but you could tell that they were slightly embarrassed by being interrupted by the sound of the blender just behind the counter while I gave my order.

If not for the Philippine connection, I don&apos;t think this place would have survived this long.  We walked into a nearly empty restaurant but when we left, our table got snapped up quick.  Somehow, as we were eating, the Jollibee filled up with older ex-Navy retirees with their baseball caps emblazoned with the name of the ship they served on and their wives.  Were it a bit chillier, no doubt they would have broken out the baseball jackets and US Navy sweatshirts.

So, should you go?  Yeah, sure.  Might as well try it.  Is it essential?  Maybe not.

I&apos;m FIlipino.  I&apos;ve been to the Philippines and experienced the legit Jollibee experience.  This is nothing close to what it is in the Philippines.  They thought the success in the Philippines can equate to success here with these Jollibees.  Not really.

I go here for their 2 for $10 deal.  You get two entrees to choose from, two drinks, and two dessert pies.  I usually get the 2 piece Chicken Joy with rice and gravy.  I think it&apos;s the most worth it.  As for the other things on the menu?  I could care less.  I&apos;ve tried their cheeseburger for a dollar.  It&apos;s not meat.  I can tell you that right now.

This was my first visit to a Filipino fastfood restaurant.  I had read about them and I always wanted to try one out to see what the fuss was all about.  I walked into this location at about 12:15pm, and I was surprised there were only a few customers.  The first thing I noticed was loud music that was kind of annoying.  It was a hot day, and I wanted to eat inside.  Oh well, let&apos;s get to the menu...

I did not feel like a hamburger or sweet sphegetti, so I ordered Palabok Fiesta, thin white noodles with a sort of sweet sauce with ground meat on top.  A few small boiled shrimp and hard boiled egg slices were added to the top of this.  The portion was small for $5.  It was premade and I would say room tempurature.  This dish was different but I did not care for it.

I also ordered a couple pieces of freid chicken $4.  The server said they only had white meat and it would take 15 minutes for dark meat to come out.  I prefer dark meat when eating fried chicken, but I did not want to wait, so I said yes to the white meat.  Then the server said the white meat was more expensive, $6 for 2 pieces.  I looked at the menu and there was no mention of this, but what the heck, white meat it is.  It was served with 2 small containers of gravy.  The gravy is mandatory since the chicken was either over cooked or sitting under heat lamps too long.  The meat was dry and not worth the extra $2.

The last thing I tried to order was a taro root/boba curshed ice drink.  Another server said they were out of that since the delivery truck did not arrive that day, so I changed to the onyl other boba drink, a green coconut flavor boba iced drink.  The drink was fine, but the boba was overcooked and had no flavor.  I like my boba al-dente and lightly sweetened.

So I was a bit disappointed.  Maybe I should give Chow King just down the street a try.

ive only been there twice.  the chicken joy and spaghetti is a novelty, you have to try it at least once.  but dont go in thinkin your gonna get kfc or regular itlaian pasta, its definitely flip style.  ive been to jollibee more times in the PI, and its better there.  but unless you can jump on a trans pac flight at your leisure, this will have to do.
actually, the whole experience is a novelty, so go for the experience, and if you want the whole effect, stand by a diesel bus as it gets goin while your eating, close your eyes, and bam!  your in manila

Why 2 stars? It&apos;s uncreative fast food that&apos;s why. The chain looks like a winner but it fails to add something different. I mean seriously it not for everyone. I do like the food, the idea, and the uniforms but just the fact that the menu is so plain. It&apos;s the kind of food you could be making yourself at home and saving a couple bucks. I think the chicken is way overpriced. They pretty cool drinks. Other than that I must admit that I am a little too lazy to make spaghetti with hot dogs. When I&apos;m not, I bet I can make 10 times better than this place.

I don&apos;t know if things have changed but when I was at Jollibee last, I found it creepy that there&apos;s an enormous picture of Aga Muhlach about to munch on some chicken. Not too crazy about the chicken. They&apos;re not dry but the chicken is too oily for me most of the time. I do have to say, their spaghetti is really good! It&apos;s one of my favorite things to order!

Their service is good, usually it is fast unless they need to fry fries.  Their spaghetti is pretty good.  I love their mango pie!  Their hamburgers are not bad, but I&apos;m not a fan of their chicken.  Their ube smoothie is delicious too!

Jollibee is one of my new favorites -- basically because I can get coupons at http://Restaurant.com .  They server burgers, but shouldn&apos;t be compared to McDonalds.  They serve chicken, but shouldn&apos;t be compared to KFC.  They are a unique cultural take on fast food.

I&apos;m not Filapino and not very partial to exotic food.  However, I really like the fried chicken (Chicken Joy).  It is comparable to Church&apos;s, more than KFC.  Very crunchy crust.  Their standard servings are legs and thighs and it is plainly marked on the menu board that white meat is charged at a higher rate.  They don&apos;t have bargain packs like Church&apos;s or KFC or Popeye&apos;s.  You just get a two or three piece plate with chicken or a meal with a couple sides.  It&apos;s a little more expensive than the Chicken Chains, and as mentioned, tends to be overdone or scorched by heatlamps if it isn&apos;t during rush hour when they keep making fresh chicken.

My wife loves the palabok (no, she&apos;s not Fil either).  So we get the &quot;Treat B&quot; which is six pieces of chicken, a big plate of palabok and some fruit pie deserts.  The take out containers here are not cardboard -- they are high grade plastic re-sealable.  The Chicken bucket is like a child&apos;s sand bucket and reusable.  The palabok plate is like a pie dish with a tupperware cover, and wonderful for leftovers.

My wife gets three meals out of the palabok and I get two meals out of the chicken.  Total cost -- about $30.  Not bad for four or five meals.

The service is not tip-top, and the dining room is bare-bones.  But the food is a good value.  I give it an average grade -- three stars.  It isn&apos;t lousy, but it&apos;s nothing terrific.  It is different, though, and a nice change of pace from Carls Jr, Jack In The Box or your other favorite fast food.

Cheap Filipino fast food. Chicken&apos;s actually good, though I&apos;d argue the skin is a little too crispy for my taste. Fries were good, too. Little salt, little oil. Just the way I like it. Not too much to find wrong about this place, although I will admit that they filled my friend&apos;s burger order longer than my chicken meal order.

They suck.  I had bought a couple certificates from http://restaurant.com and now Jollibee has decided they no longer want to honor the certificates.  Then the dumb@ss guy named JANBI that is the manager or supervisor there said he would try to honor the certificate, which requires him to call the number on the certificate.  JANBY came back and lied to me and said that the certificate didn&apos;t work so he couldn&apos;t honor.  I found out later that it did work, but he lied about it.   Anyway, their chicken is overpriced and is not as good as all of the other chicken places in Mira Mesa like Wings-n-things, KFC, popeyes, chowking, el pollo loco.

I&apos;ve eaten here a number of times in the past, but this situation made me decide to never eat here again.  Besides, their food is not good... it&apos;s ok depending on what you get.

The only really excellent this is the Chicken joy.  I like the crispiness of their chicken.  I don&apos;t ever really order anything else.  Service is decent.  Setting is decent.  Food is okay.  But it&apos;s fast food and you can always find better.  But it&apos;s probably one of the only fast food Filipino places that you&apos;ll find in Mira Mesa that serves burgers and fries too if that&apos;s what you&apos;re going for.

Eh.  Nothing that great here.  Granted, I&apos;m not filipino, but I do like filipino food.  This is not it.  Yes, it&apos;s a chain store in the PI, but you can find much better food in the area for the price.  The palabok is waaaay overpriced and too soupy.  The fried chicken is just ok.  And I can make the same spaghetti at home.  The service is friendly and I realize this is more of a comfort food, but we still probably won&apos;t be going there again.
