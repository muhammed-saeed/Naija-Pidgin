Khayyam Traditional Restaurant: Best Restaurant in Town
 
 Helpfulness
 JohnniOmani   547 reviews 
This place is located about a few hundred metres south of the Khayyam metro station and this incredibly decorated restaurant is an oasis surrounded by the chaos of Tehran. This is a 300 yr old mosque and it was restored within the past few years. The food is not cheap but worth every rial and you can try any Persian dish ranging from dizi to eggplant. It was my favorite restaurant in Iran.

Shandiz Mashad: Just shashlik
 
 Helpfulness
 TheWanderingCamel   2572 reviews 
Just a simple place, no menu, shashlik is all they serve at this restaurant - lamb, beef or chicken. You&apos;ll be served a salad, rice, lots of wonderful, freshly made bread, yoghurt and a drink along with your meal. Bring you appetite - the shashlik is huge.

 Favorite Dish: Five lamb chops on a sword - now that&apos;s what I call a shashlik!

You can find rice and some kind of spaghetti if you like...its on the main road of VAli Asr. The place looks fine the prices are fair and the service seems clean..

 Favorite Dish: due to my stomach problems the only thing I could dare to eat was a spaghetti and lots of french fries :(
My friend told me that the kebabs were ok..But generally you should tell them to have your meet well done...
TRY &quot;sefiran&quot; ( a kind of sauce) on your rice...

There are hundreds of restaurants in Tehran, few of which are actually
bad, and at weekends it&apos;s often a good idea to make reservation. There are
many very good, even luxurious restaurants in the far north of Tehran,
right up to the foothills of the Alborz, but they are very expensive and
very difficult to get to from the center without private transport.
Tehran also has some excellent cake shops and confectioneries. Mally of
the best are owned by Armenians, and the greatest concentration is in
Ostad Nejatollahi Street This is also the place to buy pistachios or
luxury foods. Almost any food not forbidden by Islam can be found in
Tehran and other major provincial capitals. Many foreign food restaurants
or restaurants catering to foreigners advertise in Tehran Times. look out
for any new ones. Before going to any restaurant, have a look at the
following list of some famous Iranian foods:
Chela Kabab-e Kubidel,
Stakes of minced meat and onions broiled on coal fire, assorted with
broiled tomatoes, served with rice. sumac, onion, and bread.
Chela Kabab-e Barg
Stakes of tenderized fillet meat broiled on coal fire, served together
with rice, sumac, pickles, onions. and bread.
A chicken cooked with ground nuts
in sour pomegranate juice, eaten with rice.
Jujeh Kabab
A delicious meal of broiled chicken assorted with various pickles.
Baqali Polo
A tasty meal of rice, beans and dill leaves cooked with lamb.
Tah Chin
A tasty dish of rice and lamb cooked with yogurt and flavored with
saffron

Restaurant Tandoor: Great curries
 
 Helpfulness
 TheWanderingCamel   2572 reviews 
If your taste for Iranian food is beginning to pall and you&apos;re looking for something spicy, the Tandoor Restaurant at the Hotel Safir could be just what you are looking for. Good Indian cooking, fresh and full of wonderful flavours, is the order of the day here. There&apos;s a nice little patio for summer evenings.

 Favorite Dish: Four delicious courses of meat and vegetable curries (the chicken jalfrezi is excellent), rice, dahl, chutnies and a big jug of freshly-squeezed lemon juice for 3 cost just $27.

Hezardastan: It was all delicious!
 
 Helpfulness
 TheWanderingCamel   2572 reviews 
You go downstairs, below the street and enter a warm and inviting space and you know you are in for a treat. There are western style tables and chairs but the place to sit is in one of the traditional booths, with cushions and carpets to sit on and a cloth in the middle for the food to come. And what delicious food it is. Make sure you bring your appetite.

 Favorite Dish: Kufteh Tabrizi - delicious meatballs made from rice and lamb with a filling of prunes and almonds, cooked in and served with a fragrant broth
Fesenjan - an aromatic stew of chicken and walnuts flavoured with pomegranate and cardomom
Great salads and as always in Iran, perfect rice, yummy (torshi) pickles and the best bread.

Many to choose from: Darband
 
 Helpfulness
 kiwigeo   81 reviews 
Darband is one of the few places to go out and eat outdoors in Tehran. All restaurants serve similar food which is not of a good standard, but there is little choice.......Really, you are paying for the marginally less polluted, greener northern Tehran suburb location.

 Favorite Dish: Try a kebab!

This restaurants will be te perfect place to eat cheap, intereact with locals and if you&apos;re in a hurry you can easily get away in as soon as you eat due to the easy and fast way they will give you the food.

 Favorite Dish: As a vegetarian, I dont eat meat obviously, so Falafel along with kilo yogurt some rice and beans soup make a tasty meal. The prices are so low. For maybe all this you will pay about 10000Rials, about 1 euro. The 1 kilo yogurt costs 700Rials.

Zeitoon Restaurant: Vegetarian alternative
 Nourin   82 reviews 
This is the hotel restaurant of Ferdosi Grand hotel on Ferdosi/Mesri streets in southern Tehran, which serves a great salad buffet for 2800 toman per person without other orders from the menu. The best place to go if you&apos;re vegetarian and tired of less than tasteful falafel served in most fast food places.
