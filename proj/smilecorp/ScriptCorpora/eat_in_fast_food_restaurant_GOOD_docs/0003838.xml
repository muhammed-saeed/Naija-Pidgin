McDonald&apos;s Employee Took Credit For Filming Brutal Beating In Baltimore Fast Food Joint

UPDATE: McDonald’s fires worker who videotaped brutal attack. 

A McDonald’s worker has taken credit for filming and uploading to YouTube the latest viral video to capture a brutal assault at a fast food restaurant.

 The employee, identified as Vernon Hackett on social network accounts, posted the video clip to his YouTube page earlier this week. According to his Facebook page , the 22-year-old Hackett, pictured at right, has worked for McDonald&apos;s since September 2009   .

The April 18 assault, seen below, took place at a McDonald’s location on Kenwood Avenue in Rosedale, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb. According to the Baltimore County Police Department , a 14-year-old girl has been charged as a juvenile in connection with the assault, while charges are pending against an 18-year-old woman. “The incident remains under investigation and the State’s Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case,” added investigators.

Police said the assault victim &quot;appeared to be having a seizure&quot; when officers arrived at the McDonald&apos;s at around 8 PM. The victim suffered cuts to the mouth and face during the attack and was transported by medics to Franklin Square Hospital for treatment, according to a police report (click to see page 1 and page 2 ).

The police report identifies the victim as 22-year-old Chrissy Lee Polis, who appears identical to Christopher Lee Polis, whose rap sheet includes convictions for disorderly conduct, property destruction, and prostitution, according to court records. The civil rights group Equality Maryland has identified the McDonald’s victim as a transgender woman.

Polis told police that she was walking to the restaurant’s bathroom when she “got into a verbal argument with two black females” who “began punching her in the face with their fists and pulling her hair.” A female bystander told cops that when she tried to break up the fight, the suspects punched her in the face, which “caused her to become disoriented.” Police noted that the woman, who declined medical treatment, had “redness around her right eye which is consistent with someone punching her in the face.” 

A manager at the Rosedale McDonald’s said she was “not allowed to speak to a reporter.&quot; In a corporate statement this afternoon, McDonald’s said it was “shocked by the video from a Baltimore franchise,” and called the incident “unacceptable, disturbing and troubling.” The firm added, “We are working with the franchisee and the local authorities to investigate this matter.”

 As seen above, in a Facebook posting, Hackett contended that the woman seen getting beaten in the video was actually a man &quot;dressed lik a woman&quot; who got into a confrontation with female patrons when he refused to leave the women’s bathroom at the Baltimore-area eatery. Hackett claimed that the victim faked a seizure and, when cops arrived at the restaurant, “he got right up.”

In other Facebook messages sent Friday by Hackett (see below), he acknowledged filming the fight, denied the victim was transgendered, and claimed he had “No Hate For Anybody…No Matter Tha Gender/Race Or Sexual Preference.” Hackett exchanged messages with Facebook users who wrote him to express anger about the video and his gleeful play-by-play.

 Hackett did not reply to TSG messages sent to his Twitter and Facebook pages, which he subsequently deleted late this morning. He also has deleted his YouTube channel.

 Submitted by ashyd on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:32. Just so you know i am white. I dont care if the person getting beat or is doing the beating is white, black, mexican what ever. It does not take 2 people to beat up one, especially when the one getting beat is not fighting back. It takes a real peice of trash to beat someone like this repeatedly, and an even bigger peice of trash to stand there and watch it, film it, and throw it around the web like its funny and something to be proud of. Oh yea, and one more &quot;white&quot; comment. If 2 white guys/girls were beating a black person like this, filming it, laughing about it, and encouraging it with a resturant full of blacks, they would most likely be beat to death, shot, or killed in some way. On top of that, idiots like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would jump into it and MAKE it a racial thing, and try ad make white people look bad as always.....this is pure down sickening!!! Submitted by JustPlayin on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:40. My sentiments exactly. Submitted by TheReelTruth on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:16. IMO boycott mr Vernon Hackett from any job ever. He is truly what is wrong with this situation laughing the whole time and warning the black girls to run cause the VIC is really hurt. Vernon Hackett needs to be charged Seinfeld him NOW please. You warn a criminal to escape while laughing at the VIC.. YEAH show him what its like to be the VIC. BOYCOTT VERNON HACKETT FROM WORK! HE IS A UNSAFE EMPLOYEE.................... Submitted by JustPlayin on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:38. Actually Vernon Hackett unknowingly did something good. By following his blood lust instincts and taping this savage beating rather than helping the victim out, he gave all of us a front row seat into just what happens when white people piss off the wrong black people in a mostly black area. I work in a very black area and frequently go out for lunch where I am the only white person. I definitely get looks but I never feel threatened. I honestly don&apos;t know if I will after seeing no one other than a F_ING OLD LADY being the only person to try to stop this beating. Unbelievable. Can someone organize a march outside this McDonalds just like the Rev and Jesse would do ?? Submitted by mountainmamawest on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:15. Can they not teach those worms to dial 911? No one deserves to be beaten in any way. One day they will run into someone like me 5&apos;3&quot; and 85 pounds who has studied martial arts for 40 years. I wish I could find those 2 B*^(#es. I would teach both of them what that felt like. 
I have watched a lot of videos through the years and never got angry at one yet before this one. One day it will be race against race and that time is coming soon. When the whites quit funding the welfare kids for them they will be too weak from hunger to beat someone.
Remember your time will come stupid.
Time to boycott McDonalds and let them have their greasy fries to get even fatter than they already are. Submitted by Letsgetthisstarted on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:36. ...and how! Submitted by Arturo_Vandelay on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:07. And it doesn&apos;t matter if the victim was male, female, black or white. Assaulting anyone 2 on 1 and continuing to hit them when they are on the floor is a crime. Race hate, sex hate, random hate. Who cares. People who commit assaults belong in jail for the protection of ALL of us. Who knows who their next victim is? Your mom, your kid, grandpa. Hopefully it&apos;s the camera &quot;man&apos;s&quot; mommy. Submitted by Arturo_Vandelay on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:08. The manager and cameraman has to go. Close the store. The manager biching that his customer was &quot;bleading on his *** floor&quot; ought to seal the fate of that store and it&apos;s employees. Businesses have a responsibility to provide a safe environment for their patrons, not protect criminals by just worrying about their floor and making sure the criminals avoid the police. Thank God Arizona allows those of us that don&apos;t gang up on defenseless women to carry weapons. This is a nice reminder as to why I carry mine pretty much everywhere. Submitted by SandMan on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:12. Hey Vandalay, I know what you mean. I live in the general area where this crime occurred. My business often takes me into &quot;Indian Country,&quot; as the slang goes, but when I do, I can assure you I am always geared up for safari. I am not naive enough to think I can prevent violent attacks on my person, but I can tell you, there WILL be a demonstration of lethal resistance, should an assault occur. Submitted by Arturo_Vandelay on Fri, 2011-04-22 23:20. I live in a mostly Hispanic neighborhood, and as one of very few whites I could be worried, but I&apos;ve never had any trouble, and the one black guy who lives here is one of my better friends. (though it&apos;s funny I found out after knowing him for years he went to school with my very best friend from second grade who is Hispanic himself). I feel safer because I look out for my neighbors, and most of them look out for me. We work together, not against each other. You have to know who the enemy is, and who is neutral as well. The good people have to stick together regardless of color, because somebody who is just like you may not always be around to help.
