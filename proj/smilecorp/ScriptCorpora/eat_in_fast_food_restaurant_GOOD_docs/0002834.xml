&quot;When dining out with our one year old, Sidney, the TableTopper®placemat is a diaper bag essential&quot;
Dena C - Atlanta, GA

&quot;I was in a fast food restaurant and I watched the busboy wiping the trashcan off. He was scrubbing dried ketchup off the can, around the thing that flaps open and shut. Then with the same towel he wiped the seats of the booth. Then he WIPED OFF THE TABLE! I thought I was going to be sick. My son used to eat the french fries after they touched the table. No more! I ALWAYS have Table Toppers®now. Clean up is so easy too.&quot;
Karen O - Oakland, CA

&quot;Table Topper®have been a real blessing, especially since we travel a lot. We look forward to using them with our second child. Thank you!!!&quot;
Charlene H - Candia, NH

&quot;Yeah! I don&apos;t have to look like a crazy person scrubbing down the tables at fast food restaurants! Instead I can look like the greatest, most prepared mom ever, who even provides fun for her kids while they wait! My 3 year old wants one under her plate too! Also, I have used the Table Topper®to cover the table so my 3 year old could practice painting her toenails (mine too)!&quot;
Danielle D - Irvine, CA

&quot;My little granddaughters who are both right at 19 months have to eat off of the table. Even thought we would use wipes when we were at restaurants we never felt that it was clean enough. Thanks so much for the Table Toppers.&quot;
Debi B - Wylie, TX

&quot;I discovered your great product on a recent visit to a restaurant with my 11 month old. A mom at a nearby table was using a Table Topper®and when I asked about it she was kind enough to offer me an extra. This was just the thing I was looking for -- what a wonderful idea!!&quot;
Janet F - Midlothian, VA

&quot;I love your product! I used to use wipes on the tables whenever my son and I were out. I still didn&apos;t feel like the tables were clean though. You&apos;ve solved that problem. What a fantastic idea!! Now I just always carry one in my diaper bag.&quot;

Neat Solutions is a &quot;family owned&quot;, &quot;mother owned&quot; baby business. We understand the needs of parents with young children.

Our mission is to provide peace of mind to parents on-the-go by providing unique baby essentials.

It all started in 1995 when our founder, Beth, went out to lunch with her baby and ordered some &quot;finger food&quot; for the first time. The chicken strips came on a plate, which quickly became a Frisbee for her son. (Sound familiar?) She tried the paper placemat...it got tossed, too. The only choice was to let him eat right off the dirty table.

She had heard about reports documenting the presence of germs on restaurant tables.

&quot;It didn&apos;t make any sense.you spend the first six months of your child&apos;s life sterilizing baby bottles and then you feed them on a dirty table!&quot;

Beth decided to take action and soon the Table Topper®Stay-in-Place Mat®became the only answer to a big problem facing us when we go out to eat with our children.
