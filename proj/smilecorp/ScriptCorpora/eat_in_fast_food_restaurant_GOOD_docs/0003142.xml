Restaurant Seating



 
For some people, eating at a restaurant, especially during challenging financial times, is quite a treat. It is seen as an opportunity to treat oneself, relax, and have fun with family and friends. For others, though, especially those who have neither the time nor the skills and patience to cook, this can be quite a regular activity. Whether you eat at a restaurant regularly or once in a blue moon, though, you would probably agree that you expect a certain standard to be met, not only by the food, but also by the other elements involved. The restaurant must maintain cleanliness, the ambiance must be pleasant enough for you to actually want to spend some time and money there, and restaurant seating must be comfortable and attractive.
 
Now if you are setting up your own restaurant, these are also some of the considerations you will need to think about. It might be quite easy to take restaurant seating for granted. After all, they are just chairs, right? Wrong. To be able to decide well on the details of your restaurant, you will have to look at things from the perspective of your potential patrons as well. As such, it would be beneficial to ask yourself what elements (aside from the food) would encourage you to keep coming back to a particular restaurant. Restaurant seating can play a big role in this, because people are more likely to return to a place where they can really relax and feel comfortable.

This does not mean, though, that you have to shell out a huge fortune just to complete your restaurant furniture supply. In fact, you may be able to find used restaurant furniture that is just as good as new or that requires minimal improvements. What is most important is that you find something that suits your needs perfectly and contributes to your efforts to both attract and keep loyal patrons.

 

Deciding on Your Restaurant Seating Furniture 

The first thing you will have to do in order to determine your restaurant seating needs is decide on what type of restaurant you will be setting up. This will determine not just the types of chairs that you get for your establishment, but will also influence its overall design. If, for example, you intend to set up a café, then you would logically have to source café tables and chairs. However, there are many types of seats, so you will have to decide on whether you want your café to be comfortable enough for students to study and hang out at. If so, you can opt to get different kinds of chairs, and probably even some small couches.

On the other hand, if you are running a fast food restaurant, then you need not invest in very pricey seats. You can simply pick out seats which are comfortable enough to sit on, but not too comfortable. This is because you are probably expecting people to come and go as quickly as possible, which means that you probably don’t want your customers to be lounging about after they had already eaten. Also, since a fast food restaurant is very casual, you will not be needing intricate designs on your seats but will do well with bright and friendly colors.
 
Bistro furniture is a lot more sophisticated than fast food restaurant furniture. You will want to have restaurant seating that is both comfortable and classy. Again, it is necessary to take the restaurant’s theme into account, so that you can choose the right color combinations. If you have used restaurant furniture, you will have to get your chairs re-upholstered and perhaps even repainted, depending on the type of seating you have and the color scheme of your establishment. This is a practical and cost-efficient way of meeting your restaurant seating needs.

One thing you have to remember is that restaurants serve food, and sometimes, the situation can turn a little bit messy – literally. Before you make your furniture purchases, you will have to decide on how much effort you are willing to put into cleaning your chairs and tables. Some types of material are trickier to clean than others, and may require special cleaning agents. If you want chairs that are easy to clean, then keep this in mind while you are choosing your seats or the material for re-upholstering. Another option is to go for table and seat covers that are easily removable so that you can simply replace them as necessary and have the covers laundered. Of course, this, too, will incur additional cost.

 Restaurant Seating and Customer Satisfaction 

Another thing that you will have to consider when picking out your restaurant’s furniture is the available space and the seating capacity you are going for. If you do not have much space but would like to fit in as many customers as possible, you will have to get furniture that will meet these space requirements. That means that you will probably have to forego round dining tables, as these tend to take up more space.

While it is a good idea to try to maximize the space you have, you will have to remember, though, that you need to keep your customer’s comfort and satisfaction in mind, as well. If your restaurant is too cramped and the chairs are too narrow, you might inadvertently discourage big groups from coming. This, in turn, will cause you to lose potential customers and revenue. As such, even if you want to be practical and set your seating capacity to an optimum number, you will have to make sure that this still allows your customers freedom to move around and sit easily. You will also want to be sure that tables are not pushed too close to each other such that two different parties can hear each other’s conversations as if they were one big group. Allowing your customers a little privacy is something you should factor into your restaurant seating decisions.

 Meeting Your Restaurant Seating Needs 
 
Even if you already have a clear idea of what you want your restaurant seating set up and furniture to look like, you will never really be sure about your decision until you have finally taken a look at your options and made a decision about which tables and chairs to use for your establishment. Explore online resources or try to get referrals from acquaintances in the restaurant business. You are sure to find companies that specialize in furniture for the restaurant industry. These can present you with a wide array of choices, as well as different price ranges to fit your requirements. By clearly identifying your objectives and having your customers in mind, you will be able to pick out the best restaurant seating arrangement for your needs.
