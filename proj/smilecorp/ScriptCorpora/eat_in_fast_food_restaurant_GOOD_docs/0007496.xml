 Pin It Article Edit Discuss History 
A cash register is an electronic tool used to calculate and record sales transactions with a cash drawer that will be used to store cash. This machine will automatically print receipt after a certain amount and the money transactions compared to the manual transaction of sales. There are different types of cash register but they usually have the same key and functions. Here are the steps in operating this machine. 
 
 Edit Steps 
 
 1 First, check the manual if the machine needs to be plugged at a 110V or a 220V . If possible, just use a voltage regulator for safety purposes. Plug the wire to the nearest outlet, some machines needs to be turned on first on the power button to start running. The check if the receipt paper or receipt journal and the 0.00 amount is seen in the display window. Set the time and date and select receipt options for printing. 2 After that, you are now ready to begin with your first transaction . 3 Press the numbers indicating the amount you want to encode such as 12 .35 then press X, which means how many items is sold, and press enter to get the total amount. 4 After you get the total amount, enter the total amount the customer pays you (if using cash), or else press &quot;Credit&quot; to pay via credit (a second machine needs to be attached for that purpose) . 5 Press sale . the drawer will open, you can keep the cash inside and get the change in a form of bills or coins. The receipt will then automatically pop-out from the printer, displaying the exact amount you entered, the number of items and the total amount of all the items being purchased. 6 Then the display window will turn to 0 .00 display and is ready for the next transaction. 

 
 
 Edit Tips 
 
 In handling the machine, observe and strictly follow the procedures and precautions stated clearly in the manual. This include the safety rules, the programming of the department key, the basic set-up and operations, programming for the unit price of each items to be included in the machine, programming discounts, preparing and using reductions, merchandise sub-total, registering charge and payments through checks, registering returned goods, registering money paid-out, making correction in the registration, as well as registering of the daily sales report If there are problems with the machine, call the technicians or the service center agent and never repair it by yourself. In operating a cash register machine, you just need to have a receipt or journal paper ready at all time and a price scanner. An extra battery is also needed in case of a brown out. 

 
 
 Edit Warnings
