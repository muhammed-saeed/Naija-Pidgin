		The McDonaldization 
 of Society 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 TO SOCIOLOGY 
 
 Sociology

 Robert 
 Keel, Instructor 

 George Ritzer has taken 
 central elements of the work of Max Weber, expanded and updated them, and produced 
 a critical analysis of the impact of social structural change on human interaction 
 and identity. The central theme in Weber&apos;s analysis of modern society was the 
 process of Rationalization; a far reaching process whereby traditional 
 modes of thinking were being replaced by an ends/means analysis concerned with 
 efficiency and formalized social control. For Weber, the archetypical manifestation 
 of this process was the Bureaucracy ; a large, formal organization characterized 
 by a hierarchical authority structure, well-established division of labor, written 
 rules and regulations, impersonality and a concern for technical competence. 
 Bureaucratic organizations not only represent the process of rationalization, 
 the structure they impose on human interaction and thinking furthers the process, 
 leading to an increasingly rationalized world. The process affects all aspects 
 of our everyday life. Ritzer suggests that in the later part of the Twentieth 
 Century the socially structured form of the fast-food restaurant has become 
 the organizational force representing and extending the process of rationalization 
 further into the realm of everyday interaction and individual identity. McDonald&apos;s 
 serves as the case model of this process in the 1990&apos;s. 
 
 ... McDonaldization,... is the process by which the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming 
 to dominate more and more sectors of American society as well as of the rest 
 of the world. (Ritzer, 1993:1) 
 
 How Far 
 Has It Gone ( local )? 
 
 Since 1955 McDonald&apos;s has 
 grown to 31,967 outlets 
 worldwide (Ritzer 2011:2)( local ) ( Der 
 NÃ¼rnburger, 2010 ).The central concepts employed in the fast-food industry 
 have spread to all types of restaurants. Everything from pizza to lobster, from 
 ice cream to bread, from alcohol to fried chicken is dominated by the Chain mentality. 

 We no longer have to go 
 to the chains. They have come to us. They are in the suburbs, the central cities, 
 the malls, our schools and military bases, our hospitals and airports, even 
 our airplanes and ballparks. They dominate our highway interchanges-every exit 
 looks the same. 

 It&apos;s not only the food industry 
 that represents this process of McDonaldization. Toy stores (Toys R Us), Bookstores 
 (B. Dalton&apos;s), Newspapers ( USA Today ), child care (Kinder Care), learning 
 (Sylvan Learning Centers) and a host of others have followed. 

 &quot;In the 1980s and 1990s 
 McDonaldization has extended its reach into more and more regions of society, 
 and those areas are increasingly remote from the heart of the fast-food business.&quot;(Ritzer 1994:137) 

 Each new spin-off serves 
 to further extend the process. The&quot;news bites&quot;of USA Today have changed the way most local papers present the news, perhaps even the way 
 we see and hear the news on TV-take a look at Headline Network News. And 
 even the way&quot;news&quot;is constructed- work of PR managers and 
 press releases. 

 Ritzer outlines five dominant 
 themes within this McDonaldization process: Efficiency, Calculability, Predictability, 
 Increased Control, and the Replacement of Human by Non-human Technology. 

 Efficiency 

 Efficiency means the choosing 
 of means to reach a specific end rapidly, with the least amount of cost or effort. 
 The idea of efficiency is specific to the interests of the industry or business, 
 but is typically advertised as a benefit to the customer. Examples are plentiful: 
 the drive-up window, salad bars, fill your own cup, self-serve gasoline, ATM&apos;s, 
 Voice Mail, microwave dinners and supermarkets (versus the old-time groceries 
 where you gave your order to the grocer). The interesting element here is that 
 the customer often ends up doing the work that previously was done for them. 
 And the customer pays for the&quot;privilege.&quot;We end up spending more 
 time, being forced to learn new technologies, remember more numbers, 
 and often pay higher prices in order for the business to operate more efficiently 
 (maintain a higher profit margin) . 

 Calculability 

 &quot;(this) involves an 
 emphasis on things that can be calculated, counted, quantified. Quantification 
 refers to a tendency to emphasize quantity rather than quality. This leads to 
 a sense that quality is equal to certain, usually (but not always) large quantities 
 of things.&quot;(Ritzer 1994:142) 

 Examples of this element 
 include: the&quot;Big Mac,&quot;the Whopper,&quot; &quot;Big Gulp,&quot; Wendy&apos;s &quot;Biggie Meals,&quot;food sold by its weight-- Taco Bell&apos;s 8 ounce burrito. Another manifestation relates to time-quicker is better.&quot;Lose 
 weight fast,&quot;microwaving allows for&quot;spending less time in the kitchen,&quot;and in news reporting; no details to slow you down. A further extension involves 
 the credentialing process. Status, capability and competence are assumed to 
 be related to the number of initials one lists behind one&apos;s name or the number 
 of pieces of paper we have hanging on our office walls . 

 Predictability 

 Predictability refers to 
 the attempt to structure our environment so that surprise and differentness 
 do not encroach upon our sensibilities. Rational people need to know what to 
 expect. They want to be sure that the fun, satisfaction, taste, and benefits 
 they received last week in Cincinnati will be repeated next week in San Diego. 
 A Big Mac is a Big Mac is a Big Mac. 

 The movie industry builds 
 upon this concept by churning out sequel after sequel. The spin-off series in 
 television programming, or the success of authors like Tom Clancy, also represent 
 the importance of predictability: We get to follow our favorite characters and 
 the publishers and producers can be assured of a predictable profit. 

 Shopping is predictable 
 in the mall , the same stores, often the same layout, enclosed and protected 
 from the unpredictable weather. Our lives are structured and controlled; we 
 go through the motions on auto-pilot. 

 Control Through 
 the Substitution of Nonhuman for Human Technology 

 Ritzer&apos;s discussion combines 
 these last two elements of the McDonaldization process. 
 
 ...these two elements 
 are closely linked. Specifically, replacement of human by nonhuman technology 
 is often oriented towards greater control. The great source of uncertainty 
 and unpredictability in a rationalizing system are people-either the people 
 who work within those systems or the people who are served by them. (Ritzer 
 1994:148) 
 
 Everything is pre-packaged, 
 pre-measured, automatically controlled. The human employee is not required to 
 think, just follow the instructions and push a button now and then. At home, 
 our ovens and probes tell us when our food is done, seasoning is premixed, or 
 the meal comes complete in one convenient package. 

 Checkers at the supermarket 
 don&apos;t have to think either, just scan the barcode (we&apos;ve already weighed and 
 labeled the produce).&quot;The next step in this development is to have the 
 customer do the scanning,...&quot;(Ritzer 1994:150). The scanners are replacing 
 the checkers, but they also allow for more control over the customer; prices 
 are no longer on the items we buy so we have less ability to oversee our spending 
 and the accuracy of the store&apos;s charges. We accept the&quot;infallibility&quot;of the computerized check-out. 

 Airplanes are already under 
 the control of computers, pilots merely oversee the process. Soon automobiles 
 will follow suit-already diagnostic modules&quot;tell&quot;mechanics what 
 components need to be replaced (note: there is little repair that takes 
 place). 

 What this means is that 
 the skills and capabilities of the human actor are quickly becoming things of 
 the past. Who we are and how we interact is becoming defined by our dependence 
 upon and subordination to the machine. 

 The Irrationality of Rationality 

 Although there have been 
 many benefits and conveniences that are related to this process of McDonaldization: 
 variety, round-the-clock banking and shopping, and often speedier service; there 
 is a certain sense that these rational systems tend to turn in on themselves, 
 to lead to irrational outcomes. 

 &quot;Most specifically, 
 irrationality means that rational systems are unreasonable systems. By 
 that I mean that they deny the basic humanity, the human reason, of the people 
 who work within or are served by them.&quot;(Ritzer 1994:154) 

 The lines at the fast-food 
 restaurants can be very long, and waiting to get through the drive-thru can 
 even take longer than going inside. These rational system don&apos;t save us money; 
 we might spend less, but we do more work. The food we eat is often less nourishing, 
 loaded with stabilizers and flavor enhancers, fats, salt and sugar. This contributes 
 to the health problems of our society, a definitely&quot;antihuman&quot;component. 
 As our children grow up within these systems, they develop habits which insure 
 our increasing dependency upon the systems. The packaging used in fast food 
 industry pollutes the environment. And the family: part of its solidarity and 
 integrity was centered around the family meal: 
 
 The communal meal is our 
 primary ritual for encouraging the family to gather together every day. If 
 it is lost to us, we shall have to invent new ways to be a family. It is worth 
 considering whether the shared joy that food can provide is worth giving up. 
 (Visser, 1989:42; in Ritzer, 1994:156) 
 
 Microwavable foods and fast-food 
 restaurants allow us to eat what we want, when we want it. The ritual of cooking, 
 eating together, and sharing is fading from the American family. 

 Two final problems are worth 
 noting. How long will it be before these rational systems evolve beyond the 
 control of people. How much of our lives are already subject to their influence 
 and control. What happens when the people who control the systems succumb to 
 being controlled? 

 And, as these systems expand 
 and develop interdependencies amongst themselves-both nationally and internationally, 
 the possibility of a small number of individuals exercising tremendous control 
 over the people dependent upon the systems becomes increasingly realistic. Perhaps 
 a Brave New World is already in the making. What do you THINK?
