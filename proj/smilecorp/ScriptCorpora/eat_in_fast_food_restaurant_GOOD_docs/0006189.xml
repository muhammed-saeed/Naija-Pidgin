 Del Taco Testing Carnitas 
 UPDATE: Del Taco has brought the carnitas items back that they first released about a year ago and added a Primo Carnitas Burrito to the lineup:
 You can also get a coupon from their Facebook page to get a free carnitas taco al carbon with any beverage purchase:
 And while I still miss their jalapeño rings they do have these new Cheddar Potato Poppers now:
 Here&apos;s their press release about these new items:

Del Taco&apos;s Primo Carnitas Burrito Headlines Star-Studded, Flavor-Packed Carnitas Lineup of New Tastes
 (LAKE FOREST, CA) June 11, 2012 –A new Primo Carnitas Burrito leads the pack as Del Taco brings back for a limited time the Shredded Pork Carnitas line that has become a fan favorite. Del Taco&apos;s carnitas, unlike anything available in the quick-service category, offers customers the savory taste of tender, slow-braised pork that is simmered in small batch kettles as found in the cooking methods of the traditional Mexican kitchen.
The new Primo Carnitas Burrito delivers the traditional flavors of carnitas in a burrito loaded with shredded pork, seasoned rice, spicy jack cheese, creamy chipotle sauce and fresh pico de gallo salsa. Other shredded pork Carnitas items appearing on Del Taco&apos;s menu for a limited time include the Carnitas Combo Burrito, Carnitas Taco al Carbon, Macho Carnitas Burrito and Carnitas Macho Nachos.
Also, for a limited time, consumers can find a coupon for a Free Carnitas Taco al Carbon with any beverage purchase on Del Taco&apos;s Facebook page–www.facebook.com/deltaco.
&quot;Del Taco fans love our shredded pork Carnitas tacos and burritos, so we&apos;re glad to bring them back for a limited time to fulfill their cravings,&quot; said John Cappasola, Chief Brand Officer at Del Taco. &quot;Our shredded pork Carnitas is just one example of the great tastes and quality that we&apos;re proud to deliver out of our kitchens at a value that is unmatched in the category.&quot;
Del Taco is also adding another cravable menu item with the introduction of new Cheddar Potato Poppers. These cheesy crunchy potato bites feature bits of jalapeno for a hint of flavorful spice. A four piece order is $1.79 and a six piece order is $2.49.
At Del Taco, all menu items are made to order using fresh ingredients including freshly grated cheddar cheese, hand-made salsa, slow-cooked lard-free beans and marinated chicken grilled fresh in our kitchens every day. The menu includes Mexican offerings of tacos, burritos, quesadillas and nachos as well as American favorites like hamburgers, fries and milk shakes. Del Taco also serves breakfast and most restaurants are open 24 hours with a drive thru. Del Taco restaurants serve more than three million customers each week.
Del Taco has more than 535 restaurants in 17 states.

 Below is our old entry from June 8, 2011:
 First Taco Bell tried introducing carnitas meat and now Del Taco is testing (at least I think it&apos;s just a test item for now). Posters in the windows show the burritos but when you go in you see they also have a carnitas torta and carnitas big fat tacos:
 I tried it in the torta and the carnitas meat was pretty good, certainly less processed overall than the Taco Bell attempt was.
 The location I got it at was here , and I think I also saw a poster for it here . Click any of the three images here to be taken to the complete Del Taco flickr album.
UPDATE: Del Taco has moved these items from testing to being regular items in all their stores. Here&apos;s the press release:

Del Taco Adds Shredded Pork Carnitas: Menu Items Include Combo Burrito, Taco al Carbon and Macho Nachos Free Carnitas Taco Al Carbon Coupon on Facebook
 (Lake Forest, CA) Sept. 14, 2011 –Shredded Pork Carnitas is available now for a limited time at Del Taco, offering fans the savory taste of tender, slow-braised, pork that is simmered in small batch kettles as found in the cooking methods of the traditional Mexican kitchen.

The Carnitas Combo Burrito, features slow cooked beans, tender braised pork, grated cheddar cheese and green sauce wrapped in a warm flour tortilla. The Carnitas Taco al Carbon features shredded pork, California Chili sauce, diced onions and chopped cilantro wrapped in two warm corn tortillas. The Carnitas Macho Nachos start with fresh tortilla chips, loaded with slow-cooked beans, carnitas, nacho cheese sauce, diced tomatoes, sour cream and topped with sliced jalapeño peppers.
Consumers can receive a coupon for a free Carnitas Taco al Carbon with any purchase at Del Taco&apos;s Facebook fan page–www.facebook.com/deltaco.
&quot;Shredded Pork Carnitas reinforces once again that Del Taco is the destination for more flavor, more variety and great value,&quot; said John Cappasola, Del Taco&apos;s Chief Brand Officer. &quot;Fans will find the delicious flavor unlike anything available in the quick-service category. And we&apos;ve got it for a limited time. So, we&apos;re encouraging anyone looking for a fresh taste to come and try our new Carnitas.&quot;

If you&apos;re wondering what Mexican restaurant is the oldest one in Orange County then wonder no longer because Sariñana&apos;s is it. Established in 1939 (OC Weekly says 1936 ) Sariñana&apos;s has remained the humble yet sincere place it started out as. When you&apos;re here you really are at home because Sariñana&apos;s was built into an old house on a sleepy stretch of 5th Avenue in Santa Ana. Of course they are famous for their tamales and you can&apos;t go wrong with theirs but what they might be even more well known for is their hard shell crispy tacos. These are made the way my dad made them when I was growing up, by deep-frying a corn tortilla, folding it in half and stuffing it with ground beef, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. The result perks you up and fills you up and reminds you what a non-mass produced taco can be. Sariñana&apos;s also serves soup, burritos, enchiladas, tortas, quesadillas, sopes, tostadas and Mexican breakfast items and has a quick service grocery store next door to the restaurant.
 
For trooping on so long and remaining 100% true to their roots Sarinana&apos;s Tamales Factory earns a 5 Speedy Gonzales rating:

 Cholula Hot Sauce 
 
The good folks at Cholula Hot Sauce recently sent me a caddy of their four different kinds of hot sauce: Original, Chili Lime, Chili Garlic and Chipotle. Check out their Facebook page and give it a like and check out their Recipe section too, many of which should be good for Memorial Day Weekend barbecuing. They even let you submit your own recipe.
 
Last night I heated up this Mexican-style pizza from Trader Joe&apos;s and sliced it into four pieces and each slice got a different Cholula sauce on it. For this pizaa the two best Cholula flavors were Chili Lime and Chipotle.

2012

If you know of a Mexican restaurant in Orange County that is holding a Cinco de Mayo event (it&apos;s even okay if you work for that restaurant) please forward the information to me by leaving a comment here or e-mailing me at reviews@ocmexfood.com .

IMPORTANT NOTE: All the information below is from prior years. When we get info from a restaurant for the current year then we erase their information down below and put the updated info at the top of this entry. We keep the old information because quite often a restaurant will have similar parties/deals in subsequent years.

Mi Casa (Costa Mesa)

 

Sol Cocina

NEWPORT BEACH, April 2011–It’s a little more sophisticated than the typical tequila-slinging, beer-guzzling party that Orange County has come to know as Cinco de Mayo. SOL Cocina in Newport Beach is hosting a celebration beginning at 11 a.m. on Thursday, May 5th that will draw fun-loving local foodies and margarita connoisseurs who are looking for a lively party with style. In addition, the event will serve as the one-year anniversary party for Peligroso Tequila, complete with a fresh fruit margarita bar set up on SOL’s patio overlooking the Balboa Marina.

“The restaurant’s location at the Balboa Marina induces the perfect ambiance for those daring enough to play hooky on a sunny afternoon -- and for those who aren’t, the celebration will continue into the night with SOL’s eclectic twist on traditional Mexican cuisine offered till 1 a.m., along with cocktails and beers,”commented General Manager Matt Baumayr.“Cinco de Mayo is the perfect day for us to showcase how SOL is different than other Mexican restaurants. Our customers are looking for a fun night out, and to us, that includes good music, great food and drinks along with a little elbow room!”

To view menus or make reservations, guests may call 949-675-9800 or visit www.solcocina.com .

 New Shrimp Tacos at Rubio&apos;s 
 
 Good ol&apos; Rubio&apos;s , originally known as Rubio&apos;s Fish Tacos then Rubio&apos;s Baja Grill and now as Rubio&apos;s Fresh Mexican Grill, has recently introduced two new shrimp tacos: the Salsa Verde Pan-seared Shrimp Taco and the Smoky Red Chile Hand-battered Shrimp Taco. One grilled, one fried; one in a flour tortilla, one in a corn tortilla; one with salsa verde, one with a full-bodied red chile sauce reminiscent of Soho Taco&apos;s chile de aceite sauce; both with cabbage and lime. I&apos;ll have one of each, please. Rubio&apos;s seems to have done intensive item testing recently and these two passed the test and are now available at all locations. If you like shrimp and you like tacos and you are near a Rubio&apos;s then these are worth trying out.
 
After starting out as a small homespun chain where you could get a discount if you wore a Pesky t-shirt Rubio&apos;s got more corporate and cookie-cutter over time but is now reversing that trend by hand-battering all its fish tacos (except the grilled ones of course), putting a focus on sustainable seafood, and introducing daring new flavors, even more of which are yet to come...
 
UPDATE: Here is a video of chain founder Ralph Rubio demonstrating how a test item of theirs, the Mango Habanaero Ono Taco, is put together:
 
And here is a combo plate with that taco, which was pretty good, along with another test item, the Spicy Serrano Fish Taco, which was even better:
