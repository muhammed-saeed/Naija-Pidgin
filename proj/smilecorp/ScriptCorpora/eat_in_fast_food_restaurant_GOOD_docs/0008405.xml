McDonald&apos;s Franchises - Master Mind Ray Kroc
 By David Au on July 20, 2009 7:02 PM | 9 Comments | 0 TrackBacks 
The McDonald&apos;s concept was introduced in Southern California by
 Dick and Mac McDonald of Manchester, New Hampshire . It was modified and expanded by their business partner, Ray Kroc , of Oak Park, Illinois , who later bought out the business interests of the McDonald&apos;s brothers in the concept and went on to found McDonald&apos;s Corporation . The agreement was for the McDonald brothers to receive $2.7 million for the chain and to continue to receive an overriding royalty of 1.9% .( 
 Timeline 

 1937: Brothers Dick and Mac McDonald open a hot dog stand called The Airdrome at the airport in Monrovia, California . 1940: The brothers move The Airdrome building to San Bernardino, California , where they open the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant, on U.S. Route 66 , at 14th and E St., on May 15. Its menu consists of 25 items, mostly barbecue . As was common at the time, they employed around 20 carhops . It became a popular and highly profitable teen hangout. 

1948: After noting that almost all of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed the restaurant for several months to implement their innovative &quot;Speedee Service System&quot;, a streamlined assembly line for hamburgers. The carhops are fired, and when the restaurant reopens it sells only hamburgers, milkshakes , and french fries . At 15 cents, the burgers are about half as expensive as at standard diners, and they are served immediately. The restaurant is extremely successful, and its fame is spread by word of mouth . 
 1953: The McDonald brothers begin to franchise their restaurant, with Neil Fox the first franchisee. The second McDonald&apos;s opens in Phoenix, Arizona at N.Central Ave and Indian School Road. It is the first to feature the Golden Arches design; later this year the original restaurant is rebuilt in the same style. 1953: Third McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens in Saginaw, Michigan at the corner of State Street and N. Center Road, it is rebuilt in 2006 but stays at that location since opening. 1953: Fourth McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens, in Downey, California at the corner of Lakewood Blvd and Florence Avenue, and is the oldest McDonald&apos;s restaurant still in operation.[ citation needed ] 1954: Entrepreneur and milkshake -mixer salesman Ray Kroc becomes fascinated by the McDonald&apos;s restaurant during a sales visit, when he learns of its extraordinary capacity and popularity. Others who had visited the restaurant and come away inspired were James McLamore , founder of Burger King , and Glen Bell , founder of Taco Bell . After seeing the restaurant in operation, Kroc approaches the McDonald brothers, who have already begun franchising, with a proposition to let him franchise McDonald&apos;s restaurants outside the company&apos;s homebase of California and Arizona, with himself as the first franchisee. Kroc works hard to sell McDonald&apos;s. He even attempts to prevail on his wartime acquaintance with Walt Disney , in the failed hope of opening a McDonald&apos;s at the soon-to-be-opened Disneyland . 1955: Ray Kroc founds &quot;McDonald&apos;s Systems, Inc.&quot; on March 2, as a legal structure for his planned franchises. Kroc opens the ninth McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois , in suburban Chicago on April 15. The first day&apos;s revenues are $366.12. The company&apos;s literature usually refers to this date as the &quot;beginning&quot; of the company, then already 15 years old, writing the McDonald brothers out of its history in favor of &quot;Founder&quot; Kroc. The company still refers to this restaurant as &quot;McDonald&apos;s #1&quot;. In July, Ray Kroc opens his second McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Fresno, California , operated by Art Bender, Kroc&apos;s first subfranchisee. The Fresno site is referred to as &quot;first McDonald&apos;s restaurant franchised by Ray Kroc&quot; on a plaque on the site, which is later rebuilt to resemble the 1950s-style restaurants. 1955: Ray Kroc hires Harry J. Sonneborn as his Chief Financial Officer . Sonneborn remained a key influence in the McDonald&apos;s corporation till his resignation in 1967. 1955: Ray Kroc hires Fred Turner (later CEO and Chairman) as a grillman in his store in Des Plaines. 1958: McDonald&apos;s worldwide sells its 100 millionth hamburger. 1959: The 100th McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin . 1959: McDonald&apos;s begins billboard advertising. 1960: Kroc&apos;s company is renamed &quot;McDonald&apos;s Corporation&quot;. 1961: The McDonald brothers agree to sell Kroc business rights to their operation for $2.7 million, a sum that Kroc borrows from a number of investors, including Princeton University ; Kroc considers the sum extreme, and it strains his relationship with the brothers. In a handshake agreement, the brothers would also receive an overriding royalty of 1% on the gross sales. At the closing table the brothers told Ray that they were giving the real estate and rights to the original unit to the founding employees. Ray closed the transaction, then refused to acknowledge the royalty portion of the agreement because it wasn&apos;t in writing. The brothers keep their original restaurant, but in an oversight they fail to retain the right to remain a McDonald&apos;s franchise. Renamed &quot;The Big M&quot;, Kroc drives it out of business by opening a McDonald&apos;s just one block north; he attends the opening. Had the brothers maintained their original agreement, which granted them 0.5% of the chain&apos;s annual revenues, they or their heirs would have been collecting in excess of $100 million per year today. Had the brothers closed their handshake agreement with Ray, these royalties would have doubled. 1961: Hamburger University opens in the basement of the Elk Grove Village , Illinois, McDonald&apos;s restaurant Bachelor of Hamburgology degrees went to graduating class of 15. 1962: McDonald&apos;s first national magazine ad appears in Life magazine. 1962: The first McDonald&apos;s restaurant with seating opens in Denver, Colorado . 1963: One of Kroc&apos;s marketing insights is his decision to advertise McDonald&apos;s hamburgers to families and children. Washington, D.C. franchisees John Gibson and Oscar Goldstein (Gee Gee Distributing Corporation) sponsor a children&apos;s show on WRC-TV called Bozo the Clown , a franchised character played by Willard Scott from 1959 until 1962. After the show was cancelled, Goldstein hires Scott to portray McDonald&apos;s new mascot, named Ronald McDonald . According to Scott, they wanted to pay him in stock, but Scott decided to take the money. Scott, looking nothing like the familiar appearance of any McDonaldland character as is known today, appeared in the first three television advertisements featuring the character. After changing the character&apos;s first name to &quot;Ronald&quot; and replacing Scott with a new actor, and giving him the more familiar red, white, and yellow clown features, the character eventually spreads to the rest of the country via an advertising campaign. Years later, an entire cast of &quot;McDonaldland&quot; characters is developed. 1963: The Filet-O-Fish is introduced in Cincinnati, Ohio , in a restaurant located in a neighborhood dominated by Roman Catholics who practiced abstinence (the avoidance of meat) on Fridays. It is the first new addition to the original menu, and goes national the following year, with fish supplied by Gorton&apos;s of Gloucester .

The Hot Apple Pie is also introduced this year. 1968: The 1000th McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens in Des Plaines, Illinois . 1970: McDonald&apos;s opens in Costa Rica , its third country after the United States and Canada, and its first restaurant in Latin America . 1970: Having changed hands in 1968, the original &quot;Big M&quot; restaurant closes.

[7] [8] 2005: McDonald&apos;s experiments with call centers for drive-through orders. The center, located in Fargo, North Dakota takes orders from more than a dozen stores in Oregon and Washington . The experiment is in part motivated by labor costs, since the minimum wage in North Dakota is over 40% lower than that in Oregon or Washington . 2005: Owing in part to competitive pressure, McDonald&apos;s Australia adopts &quot;Made for you&quot; cooking platform in which the food is prepared from pre-cooked meat after the customer orders (as opposed to the firm&apos;s normal procedure since 1948, in which the food is cooked then sold as needed).

The practice had earlier been tested, and abandoned, in the U.S. 2005: McDonald&apos;s in Singapore began their McDelivery service: customers place their food orders over the phone, and it is delivered to wherever they are.

Split allegedly mutual although the generally accepted reasons were that McDonald&apos;s no longer sees benefit from sticking with one studio; due to the increased competition from other studios, as well as having to promote flop films, and Disney no longer wants to be associated with a company so strongly tied to childhood obesity . 2006: McDonald&apos;s begins their &quot;forever young&quot; branding by redesigning their restaurants. 2006: Anna Svidersky was murdered by David Sullivan while working in an Anderson Road McDonald&apos;s in Vancouver, Washington. 2007: McDonald&apos;s reintroduces its 42-ounce super-size soda under the name Hugo . 2008: Mcdonald&apos;s introduces the McSkillet burrito.

Can I just pop in that it&apos;s sad Cheryl Cole&apos;s been fired from the American X-Factor because of her hard to understand Northen accent but I have to say I&apos;m English born and bred and I can hardly understand a word she says. This was never likely to work for the Americans, known to be conservative when it comes to television.
