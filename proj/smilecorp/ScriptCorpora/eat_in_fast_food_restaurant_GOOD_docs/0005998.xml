Maui, Fast Food

 June 20, 2012 Da Kitchen Mobile review by John W ( 38 reviews ) Grabbed a couple Hawaiian plates to-go (as well as some chocolate Haupia pie -- GOOD GOD) before dashing across the street for a sunset dinner on our beach towels! The food was AWESOME! Everything was amazing, but the chicken long rice really caught me off guard (ginger??). The lomi lomi salmon was okay, but we&apos;ve had better. June 13, 2012 Da Kitchen Mobile review by zen ( 6 reviews ) Portions were huge and you could easily split an entree. Prices were between 9- 14 food was flavorless and fish didn&apos;t taste fresh. April 15, 2012 Da Kitchen Da Kitchen is NOT Good by Kim ( 20 reviews ) Don&apos;t waste your time trying this restaurant. I find it hard to believe that the greasy, uninspired food in styrofoam trays are a very good reflection of Maui cuisine. We had 7 in our party, it was busy and we had to sit on opposite ends of the restaurant, not a big deal but annoying. i tried the fish and chips which was supposed to be done in a tempura style. The fish was very greasy and mushy, not very tasty either. Pass on that one. Friends tried to be more adventurous with an island mixed plate. They did not enjoy it either. The kalua pork was very bland and VERY salty, the other sides were not good either. We will take a pass on this restaurant next time, very dissapointing.

 about 14 hours ago Da Kitchen NEW! Kim Chee Crabcake at Kahului location. t.co/29vxCa4g More tweets by dakitchenmaui about 21 hours ago Taco Del Mar (Kahului) In the future, tacos will be worn as hats. The phrase &quot;...or I will eat my hat&quot; will be used a lot more. More tweets by Taco_Del_Mar
