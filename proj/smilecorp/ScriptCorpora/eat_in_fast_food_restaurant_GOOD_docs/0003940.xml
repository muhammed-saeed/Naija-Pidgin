 Best Answer - Chosen by Asker
 depending on the state, the minimum age to work in a restaurant is different here it is 16. The manager and other staff teach you all you need to know about preparing the food and other duties you are supposed to do. No it isn&apos;t hard, but it does take a little bit to where you remember what condiments go on which burger etc. without having to ask or look at a manual. It is a good place to begin work experience.

 I worked in the&quot;short shift position at Pizza Hut. Basically all I had to do was prep the pizza dough for the next day. It was the easiest job I ever had, and they work with student who have weird schedules. Just tell them your available hours when you first a apply. I was 19 at the time, but everyone else was 15-16 years old.
