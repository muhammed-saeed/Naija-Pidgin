Most Common Positions At Wings
&amp;Income Information

The most common entry-level positions at WINGS are the sales associate and the cashier. Experienced supervisors will find the most common position available to be the assistant store manager.

Cashiers are the people who work the cash register. Easy enough, right? Well, not exactly. Working a cash register means being dedicated to efficiency and great customer service. Every customer should be greeted with a smile and should leave the store with every intent of returning. Customers are the life blood of any store, and should be treated like they are. This means that a cashier is responsible for return and repeat business as well as the simple act of running a register and checking customers out of a store with a receipt in hand.

Sales associates need to understand what makes customers come to WINGS- the souvenirs and gifts. A good associate knows the location of all of the most popular items and knows just the thing to show unsure customers when they walk through the door. A good sales associate is hard-working, outgoing, and enthusiastic.

Assistant managers are the ringleaders who tie it all together. They’re responsible for making sure that each employee has adequate training, experience, and know-how to run the show themselves. They’ll also be the ones making the schedule and taking over for the sales associates when they need help, or when a customer requires a certain experience for their needs.

Typical entry-level employees at Wings make $7.25 an hour. Managers and assistant managers typically make a yearly wage, which varies with the managers’prior experience and the location of the store.

Wings Benefits

Qualified employees receive an employee discount, solid starting pay, paid time off, retirement plans, and sometimes even more. Turn in your WINGS job application form today and find out how you can score a job you’ll always remember.
