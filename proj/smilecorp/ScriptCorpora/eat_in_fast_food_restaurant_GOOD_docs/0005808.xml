Top Ten Diet Fallacies — Fallacy #4: Fat Will Make You Fat

 Can correct use of “primal fat-rich foods” be the secret to higher energy, better endurance and — most surprisingly — a leaner, stronger body? Is it true that adding more of the right fats to our diet can make us sexier and sexually more magnetic? “Absolutely Yes!” says weight loss and strength gain expert, Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html. But you need to know what you’re doing, or you probably will still bloat up into an overweight eyesore. 

St. Paul, MN, (PRWEB) May 31, 2005 -- Can correct use of “primal fat-rich foods” be the secret to higher energy, better endurance and — most surprisingly — a leaner, stronger body? Is it true that adding more of the right fats to our diet can make us sexier and sexually more magnetic? “Absolutely Yes!” says weight loss and strength gain expert, Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html. But you need to know what you’re doing, or you probably will still bloat up into an overweight eyesore.

How to Eat Plenty of Fat-Rich Food… Without Becoming A Blot on the Visual Landscape

The claim “Fat is a fat is a fat … and therefore makes you fat”, isn’t theoretically untrue, but nevertheless, in real life it is wrong and literally misleading.

Fat isn’t a fat isn’t a fat, and can’t be regarded as such. Dietary fat consists of a huge variety of fat molecules divided into groups and subgroups; each plays a different role in the body.

Numerous studies demonstrated the critical functions of essential fatty acids (EFAs), phospholipids and cholesterol compounds, in regulating blood pressure, inflammation, lipid metabolism, stress reaction, build up of cell membranes, nerves functions, immune actions and steroid hormone production, respectively.

It’s evidently clear, that the role of dietary fat goes far beyond just being a fuel for energy or storage.

The real question is does dietary fat convert efficiently into energy?

And for that matter, is the human body primarily well adapted to utilize fat as an immediate fuel for energy?

As you’re about to read the answer isn’t simple, but even so it is yes and yes.

Studies at the department of clinical biochemistry and medicine, Addenbrooke’s hospital, Cambridge, UK, revealed that different people respond differently to high fat intake. An excess fat calorie was predominately stored in some individuals and in contrast, it increased total energy expenditure and fat oxidation with no fat gain, in others.

The question remains: why some individuals are more prone to gain fat from fat calories than others?

There is substantial amount of evidence that certain variables profoundly affect the capacity to utilize fat fuel.

These variables include gender, exercise intensity, source of dietary fat and diet composition.

Recent studies at the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, discovered that women have higher levels of lipid binding proteins, with a higher capacity to utilize fat fuel in the muscle tissue, than men.

Interestingly, same studies found that men’s capacity to utilize fat in the muscles significantly increases with application of intense exercise.

The effect of exercise intensity on fat burning was farther investigated at the University of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Studies revealed that fat serves as a most efficient fuel in the form of intramuscular fat (IMT). IMT stores function as an important and most effective substrate source of energy, in particular during intense prolonged exercise.

As noted, it has been suggested that fat mobilization and utilization seems to be also determined by other variables such as diet composition (ratio of fat/carbs), glycemic index, source of dietary fat as well as the frequency and intensity of exercise.

According to the thrifty genes theory (Journal of Applied Physiology 96:3-10, 2004) humans have primarily adapted to better survive when following cycles of famine and feast (undereating and overeating); exercise and rest. It has also been suggested that we humans have adapted better to primal foods on the bottom of the food chain evolution (late Paleolithic period).

It has been suggested that following a lifestyle that mimics primal feeding cycles and physical activity, would most likely trigger genes (thrifty genes) that help us better survive; making us more efficient in utilizing fat and carb fuel with an increased resistance to fatigue, stress and disease.

From that aspect, we humans generally do better on primal fat rich foods (bottom of the food chain), such as nuts, seeds and fertile eggs than later fatty foods (top of the food chain), derived from farm animals or processing, i.e. lard, butter or margarine, respectively.

Primal fat foods such as nuts and seeds are also good sources of amino acids and fat-soluble vitamins. In their raw state, they contain phytosterols (cholesterol- like plant compounds), which predominately support the production of sex steroid hormones.

To take advantage of nuts and seeds, eat them alone or with veggies and protein. Do not combine these fat foods with sugar or grains. Nuts and seeds are naturally low glycemic. Generally our body is better adapted to food with a low glycemic index. (Slow releasing nutrients)

In summary, fat is primarily a superior fuel. Muscle is the largest fat utilizing organ. Exercise intensity positively affects the body’s capacity to utilize fat for energy. We humans have adapted to better survive on primal high fat foods that belong to the bottom of the food chain, such as nuts and seeds or fertile eggs.

These primal high fat foods should maintain their natural low glycemic character and therefore should not be combined with later high glycemic foods such as grains or sugar. Evidently, the same fat foods that may cause fat gain could instead convert to energy and promote fat burning if combined properly.

In conclusion, “fat makes you fat” is a fallacy that completely disregards the complexity and critical functions of dietary fat.

If taken seriously, this fallacy often causes fat phobias, typically leading to extreme low fat diets, with severe consequences including malnutrition, chronic fatigue, eating disorders, impotency, compromised immunity and fat gain.

DiabeticsBooks.Com to Hold Online Diabetes Awareness Fundraiser

 Millions of people across the country are living with diabetes. We need help from across the country now! Diabetes is slowly, but surely becoming an epidemic in this country. 

(PRWEB) June 1, 2005 -- &quot;The Most Frightening night of my life was 17 years ago when my blood sugar level dropped&quot;, says Angelo Abruzzese of DiabeticsBooks.com

Abruzzese, who has diabetes, was rushed to the hospital where he went into a vegetative state for several hours while everyone waited in the emergency room. Today Abruzzese is an active diabetes activist, who has participated in walk-athons, jog-athons, and any events he can find to raise money for diabetes research. If everyone that reads this article was to just send a one dollar donation, It could make a huge difference says Abruzzese!

Today http://www.Diabeticsbooks.com is launching an online diabetes fundraiser, in hopes of generating $10,000 in donations. Abruzzese says that his website diabeticsbooks.com sent out a survey, and the results were stunning. Only 18% of people surveyed actually understood the complications and seriousness of diabetes. He says this diabetes fundraiser is to try to raise diabetes awareness, and raise money for diabetes research.

The fourth-leading cause of death in the U.S. is diabetes; diabetes claims more than 180,000 lives each year. It is estimated that 16 million Americans are currently living with the disease, with two million afflicted by type 1 or juvenile onset diabetes. In fact, 12,000 children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes every year.

Type 1 diabetes, also called childhood diabetes, is a chronic, genetically determined metabolic disorder that damages the pancreas, preventing it from producing insulin. Insulin is a hormone which the body requires to make use of glucose — the fuel for the body&apos;s myriad processes. Type 1 diabetes destroys the islet cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin. Insulin is not a cure, but a treatment for diabetes.

Adult onset or type 2 diabetes, usually presents after the age of 13. Individuals with this form of diabetes have a pancreas that still produces insulin, though not adequately. They also have &quot;insulin resistance,&quot; which means that the body&apos;s tissues do not respond normally to insulin. But patients with type 2 diabetes can often control the disease through diet, exercise, and oral medications rather than by the use of insulin injections.

Diabetes can affect anyone no matter what their status.

&quot;Once you&apos;re a diabetic, you&apos;re pretty much a diabetic,&quot; says Abruzzese. &quot;I have adult onset diabetes. I was diagnosed when I passed out one day 17 years ago. I&apos;ve gotten my diabetes to a really manageable place. So I don&apos;t have really any complications due to it, but I still have to deal with it and check my blood many times a day.

I just want to do whatever I can to help the diabetes cause, and to speed the process of finding a cure for diabetes. That&apos;s why I am doing this online diabetes fundraiser says Abruzzese.

To all those that donate $10 or more, they will receive a high quality silicone (PURPLE) HOPE Bracelet. I am hoping to raise the diabetes awareness with the bracelets says Abruzzese. If we can get 10,000 of these HOPE bracelets out there, and people wearing them, that could raise the awareness by 100,000 just from people asking questions to those that wear the bracelets he says.

A portion of the proceeds from the fundraiser will be going directly to the American Diabetes Association for further diabetes research. So even if you can only make a one dollar donation Please do so!

To make a donation to the diabetes awareness fundraiser you can send cash, check, or money order to:
Diabetics Books
9207 N. 47th drive
Glendale, AZ 85302

Or you can go online to make a donation by credit card at:
http://www.diabeticsbooks.com

We ask that you pass this address on to your friends and family. Let&apos;s make a difference!

Is Mad Cow Disease Caused by a Bacteria?

 Transmissible spongiform enchephalopathies (TSE’s), include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also called BSE or “mad cow disease”), Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and scrapie in sheep. They remain a mystery, their cause hotly debated. But between 1994 and 1996, 12 people in England came down with CJD, the human form of mad cow, and all had eaten beef from suspect cows. Here resercher/internist Lawrence Broxmeyer MD offers a new approach to this disease. 

(PRWEB) May 31, 2005 -- Lead researcher Lawrence Broxmeyer MD, who has appeared in The Journal of Infectious Diseases and other respected medical journals isn’t satisfied with the current explanation for mad cow disease. [Is mad cow disease caused by a bacteria? Medical Hypotheses (2004) 63, 731–739

“Current mad cow diagnosis”, said Lawrence Broxmeyer MD, “lies solely in the detection of late appearing ‘prions’, an acronym for hypothesized, gene-less, misfolded proteins, somehow claimed to cause the disease. Yet laboratory preparations of prions contain other things, which could include unidentified bacteria or viruses. Furthermore, the rigors of prion purification alone, might, in and of themselves, have killed the causative virus or bacteria. Therefore, even if samples appear to infect animals, it is impossible to prove that prions are causative and not just the end result of an infectious process.”

“Furthermore”, Lawrence Broxmeyer MD asserted, “Manuelidis found viral-like particles, which even when separated from prions, were responsible for spongiform STE’s. Subsequently, Lasmezas’s study showed that 55% of mice injected with cattle BSE, and who came down with disease, had no detectable prions. Still, incredibly, prions, are held as existing TSE dogma and Heino Dringer, who did pioneer work on their nature, candidly predicts “it will turn out that the prion concept is wrong.” Many animals that die of spongiform TSE’s never show evidence of misfolded proteins, and Dr. Frank Bastian, of Tulane, an authority, thinks the disorder is caused by the bacterial DNA he found in this group of diseases.”

“Recently,” added Lawence Broxmeyer MD, “Roels and Walravens isolated Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis) from the brain of a cow with the clinical and histopathological signs of mad cow. Moreover, epidemiologic maps of the origins and peak incidence of mad cow disease in the UK, where it all began, suggestively match those of England’s areas of highest bovine tuberculosis, the Southwest. The neurotaxic potential for cow tuberculosis was shown in pre-1960 England, where one quarter of all tuberculous meningitis victims suffered from Mycobacterium bovis infection from cows. And Harley’s study showed pathology identical to “mad cow” from systemic M. bovis in cattle, causing a tuberculous spongiform encephalitis.”

“In addition to all of this” said Lawrence Broxmeyer MD, prions have been described as amyloid and in the past amyloid was usually the deposition that took place due in the course of chronic inflammatory disease, mainly tuberculosis, its usual precipitating cause.”

“M. bovis or cow tuberculosis, fowl tuberculosis or Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis causes Johne’s disease, a problem known and neglected in cattle and sheep for almost a century, and rapidly emerging as the disease of the new millennium.” revealed Lawrence Broxmeyer MD “Not only has M. paratuberculosis been found in human Crohn’s disease, but both Crohn’s and Johne’s cross-react with the antigens of cattle paratuberculosis. Furthermore, central neurologic manifestations of Crohn’s disease are not unknown.”

Lawrence Broxmeyer MD sums up that “there is no known disease which better fits into what is occurring in Mad Cow and the spongiform enchephalopathies than bovine tuberculosis and its blood–brain barrier penetrating, virus-like, cell-wall-deficient forms. It is for these reasons that future research needs to be aimed in this direction.”

“In his 1932 historical overview, Webb speculates that man was first introduced to tuberculosis when he began domesticating cattle around 5000 B.C.. Thus one could surmise that human tuberculosis originated by transfer of M. bovis, which has the potential to infect humans, into the human body, where it adapted as the tubercle bacillus”, Lawrence Broxmeyer MD related. “Garnier though, using deletion analysis, recently questioned this, placing human M. tuberculosis as having come first, and, having infected cows at the time of cattle domestication 10,000–15,000 years ago. At any rate, prior to that, the tuberculous bacilli, always soil born, first infested and then infected an assortment of mammals, both ruminants and primates.”

“Modern genetics has verified that DNA between human (M. tuberculosis) and cow (M. bovis) tuberculosis are almost identical, indicating they are virtually the same species.” said Lawrence Broxmeyer MD. “Even in culture plates their appearance is similar.”

Once the most prevalent infectious disease of cattle in the US, bovine TB caused more losses among US farm animals in the early part of this century than all other infectious diseases combined. And M. bovis still causes worldwide annual losses to agriculture of $3 billion dollars. In his Nobel Prize address of 1901 Von Behring stated &apos;As you know, tuberculosis in cattle is one of the most damaging infectious diseases to affect agriculture&apos;.”

“Today”, concluded Lawrence Broxmeyer MD, “the greatest hindrance to finding a cure for TSE’s lies in the very theory they have become embedded in. Santana’s oft quoted “he who does not remember the past is condemned to relive it in the future” seems clear here. Early twentieth century recognition of the spread of cow tuberculosis was obvious and at one time American milk contained the words: “tuberculin tested,” an epitaph to the up to 30% of human cases of pre-pasteurization Tuberculosis caused by bovine or cow tuberculosis.”

Unclean Food: Does Milk Harbor An Infectious Bacterium?

 Is all of humanity infected with a stealth bacterium, hidden in a milk carton, that doesn’t cause symptoms or disease till years after infection, and then gives rise to Crohn’s, Parkinson’s and many other diseases? 

San Dimas, CA (PRWEB) May 30, 2005 -- There is a growing and troublesome body of evidence that contaminated milk may harbor a stealth bacterium that can withstand Pasteurization and infect humans with a germ that causes severe gastric problems such as Crohn’s disease and may increase the risk for brain disease.


As unsettling as these sounds, the most recently published study reveals that 2.8 percent of milk cartons in US grocery stores may harbor a mycobacterium called paratuberculosis which is known to cause a gastric disorder in animals called Johne’s disease, and is the likely cause of Crohn’s disease in humans. More alarming is a study that followed males living in Hawaii for 30 years. The men who drank more than 16 ounces of milk on a daily basis were more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease. Did the bacterium in milk invade the brain of these men which resulted in their tremor-like brain disorder?

At least one third of humanity, 2 billion out of 6 billion people on Earth, is already infected with a germ called mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes lung TB. But mycobacterium paratuberculosis (PARA-TB), which commonly infects cattle, can be transmitted to humans via meat or milk consumption. It’s possible millions if not billions more people are infected with PARA-TB. Furthermore, skin testing may not reveal whether there is active infection either.

Modern medicine employs antibiotics and vaccines against the family of TB and PARA-TB bacteria, but immunity tends to wear off after vaccination and there is a growing problem of antibiotic-resistant TB. Ignored are nutritional approaches to tubercular infection that may quell both TB and PARA-TB infection, but commonly go overlooked by physicians.

To learn more about the stealth bacterium that has infected billions of humans, and how you and your loved ones can escape from its grasp, go to the four-part series entitled “Unclean Food” at www.knowledgeofhealth.com ;

World Rice Lider Hisparroz and Oryzon Genomics Announce a Strategic Alliance for the Development of new Rice Varieties

 Hisparroz, major shareholder in the Spanish multinational Ebro-Puleva, and the Catalonian Biotechnology company Oryzon Genomics Sa have announced today the signing of a three years technical collaboration agreement which allows Hisparroz access to Oryzon´s Orysamf technology platform for the production of new rice varieties adapted to the Guadalquivir ecosystem. The project will include the evaluation and commercialization of the new varieties and the granting of royalties to Oryzon; at a level not disclosed. 

Barcelona (PRWEB) May 27, 2005 -- The Seville-based company Hisparroz, major shareholder in the Spanish multinational Ebro-Puleva, and world market leader in packeted rice, and the Catalonian Biotechnology company Oryzon Genomics SA have announced today the signing of a technical collaboration agreement which allows Hisparroz access to Oryzon´s Orysamf technology platform for the production of new rice varieties adapted to the Guadalquivir ecosystem.


The agreement, whose financial terms have not been revealed, covers a project of three years duration in which researchers from both companies will participate and which will use rice varieties currently in cultivation in the Guadalquivir region as the basis for the development of improved lines. The project will include the evaluation and commercialization of the new varieties and the granting of royalties to Oryzon; at a level not disclosed.

The Orysamf technology developed by Oryzon is covered by an international patent application and is an approach of great potential which exploits the knowledge of rice gene function gained by Oryzon´s geneticists and bioinformatics scientists to produce normal rice plants changed only in specifically-targeted characteristics

Antonio Hernandez Calleja, Managing Director of Hisparroz and President of the group Ebro Puleva commented: “Our business vision for the rice market is to continue to be leaders in innovation, supporting and optimizing agricultural production and to play a role in improving quality factors in a sector which is every day more competitive and demanding. Our agreement with Oryzon genomics is a clear indication of our aim to lead in innovation”.

Carlos Buesa, director of Oryzon, stated: “In the past five years, our company has developed technology at the leading–edge internationally, which permits a targeted approach to solve problems in Agriculture and Health, applying the latest advances in genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics. Our agreement with Hisparroz fits perfectly with the business model adopted by Oryzon of collaboration with the major companies in the Pharmaceutical, Agriculture and Food sectors. Oryzon is becoming recognised as a primary collaboration partner in the Spanish biotechnology sector, and only in the last six months has signed agreements with BASF, Laboratories Ferrer and Laboratories Esteve. The rice varieties which we will co-develop and co-commercilize with Hisparroz will be targeted at clear needs in the rice production sector which Oryzon can approach using our innovative technology. Our partnership with Hisparroz is of special importance for us as it represents our first agreement with a major multinational in the rice sector and it gives us international visibility.

Hisparroz, the leading Spanish company in rice seed production, is owned by the family Hernandez Calleja, whose industrial and commercial strategy is integrated within the group Herba Ebro Puleva.

Spain is a major world force in the production and export of rice, with Herba being the major European rice company, commercializing approximately a third of the rice consumed in the EU. Rice production per hectare in Spain is at one of the highest levels in the world, thanks to the application of advanced cultivars and constant research and improvement in production processes, in which the innovative approach of Herba has played a major role. Herba applies some of the worlds most advanced technology, from the processes of production to the optical selection of grain colour using photoelectric cells, the use of scanning systems to detect contaminating materials, vacuum sterilization and automated packaging lines. In the EU context, Spain is the second largest rice producer with 0.8 million tonnes produced annually. Since March 2004, when Antonio Hernandez Callejas was named President Executive of the Ebro Puleva group, the company has shown very strong growth in the sector as the result of an ambitious policy of acquisitions. In 2004, the English company Vogan&amp;Company, which commercializes legumes and rice, was acquired, followed in September by the North American company Riviana Foods, the number one rice company in the USA, converting the group Herba into the world’s largest rice company. In 2005, the naming of Antonio Hernandez Callejas as president of the group coincided with the acquisition of the French company Panzani, confirming the group’s leadership position in the European food sector.

Oryzon Genomics, SA (www.oryzon.com) is a Functional Genomics company whose business model is based on “gene discovery “ which involves the application of large-scale, high-throughput research tools to determine the function of genes in chosen organisms, with the objective of subsequent patenting of the genetic applications developed. Oryzon made three new patent applications in this area in 2004. The companies division of New Developments in Molecular Diagnostics uses the most advanced techniques in Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics, which have allowed the company to establish competitive research programmes in oncology in the areas of colon cancer and lung cancer and in neurodegenerative diseases in the areas of Alzheimer’s disease and Lewry Bodies Dementia. The company has a strong record of alliances with the Spanish pharmaceutical industry and with research groups in leading Spanish hospitals. In addition, the companies new technologies for gene discovery are applicable in the formation of non-transgenic plant varieties, in this area Oryzon is building a significant network of strategic alliances with leading companies in the agbiotech and food sectors,. Recently Oryzon signed an important agreement with the multinational BASF and is involved in important projects in the area of functional foods, a field of activity targeted as a strategic growth area for the company in the coming years.

Oryzon was created in the year 2000 as a spin-off of the University of Barcelona and of the CSIC IBMB and is located in the Parc Cientific in Barcelona. With a current headcount of 34 scientists, the company has grown rapidly, financed by the venture capital investor Najeti Capital, SCR, SA, after having received initial financial support from Enisa and CDTI, which allowed the company to establish its position internationally in the area of biomedicine. With a turnover of more than two million euros the company first recorded benefits in 2004 and has remained in benefit in the first two quarters of 2005.

Meals on Wheels of San Francisco uses Trained Professional Case Managers, Drivers and Social Workers to Protect Homebound Seniors

 Meals On Wheels Of San Francisco uses trained professional case managers, drivers and social workers to protect homebound seniors 

San Francisco, CA (PRWEB) May 26, 2005 -- Meals On Wheels of San Francisco (www.mowsf.org) – the San Francisco nonprofit that “delivers hope” along with two meals a day to more than 1,100 homebound San Francisco seniors – says that today&apos;s article in the San Francisco Chronicle about another agency&apos;s food delivery program calls attention to the plight of homebound seniors everywhere.

“This was not one of our clients. However, it highlights the plight of this population and how as a community we need to band together to ensure their safety and that this sort of abuse does not happen,” says Sima Dahi, Chief Executive Officer of Meals On Wheels of San Francisco. “At Meals On Wheels, our highly trained professional drivers, case managers and social workers ensure not only the delivery of a hot meal to all of our 1,100 clients every day, but also that these clients are safe in their own homes. In a very real way, the Meals On Wheels staff person delivers hope along with that hot meal. Meals On Wheels is the first responder and the red flag about exactly the sort of abuse mentioned in today&apos;s San Francisco Chronicle article. My heart goes out to her.”

Dahi continues: “Also, our vital work is made possible in part by everyday heroes – our volunteers. They support our seniors by helping with all aspects of the operation. They ride along with our staff drivers and help deliver meals. They serve as friendly visitors for clients, calling on them once a week to sit and talk, play games, help around the house, or go for short walks. Often, our volunteers become valued members of our clients’ support systems. Our homebound senior clients, some of whom have been with us for many years, come from all walks of life. We function as an important connection with these seniors, who are often isolated and forgotten.”

About Meals On Wheels

Stem Cell Research – Barking Chicken - Imminent Chicken Shortage

 A Barking Chicken is being engineered using stem cell genrated embryo&apos;s in Nothern CA USA, to help resolve the impending shortage of chicken being caused by unheralded use of Peri-Peri in the USA 

(PRWEB) May 25, 2005 -- According to confidential sources, an impending shortage of chickens is believed to be imminent in the USA for the balance of 2005 thru 2008. This shortage is due to the sudden increase in demand for chicken as a primary source of nutrition. Hence causing a new chicken breed to be mechanically engineered which will bark like a dog. Stem cell Research has now begun to develop what is being called “The Nando’s Peri-Peri Barking Chicken”


A Spokesman for CAUSA (Chicken Assoc of the USA) says
“The Barking Chicken will solve this impending disaster”. The unprecedented demand for chickens is being caused by the use of Nando’s Peri-Peri Hot Sauces.

A Nando’s spokesman is quoted as saying that it will make no difference to sales of chickens whether they bark or not. “People won’t care if the chicken barks or not!”.

The Scientists&amp;Veterinarians in Northern CA responsible for this “Nando’s Barking Chicken” were not available for comment.

This addictive Peri-Peri Hot Sauce may be obtained in small quantities at http;//www.nandosusa.com.

New ISO Food Safety Auditor Training in Long Beach, CA 11-15 July, 2005

 The First IRCA Certified Lead Auditor Course Taught in the U.S. that Combines ISO 9001:2000 Quality with HACCP Creating ISO 22000:2005. 

(PRWEB) May 25, 2005 -- Bizmanualz, Inc., a management training, consulting and publishing provider based in St. Louis, MO., today announced the release of a new 5-day IRCA ISO Food Safety Management System (FSMS) Lead Auditor Training course that combines ISO Auditor certification with HACCP (Hazard Analysis And Critical Control Point) to satisfy the requirements of the latest food safety release of ISO 22000:2005.

The auditor training class certifies quality auditors of food industry companies involved in the safe sourcing, processing and packaging of food&amp;drink products. Industries affected include: Airlines, Hospitals, Hotels, Food Producers, Food Packagers, Warehousing, Agricultural Processors (meat, livestock, cattle, hogs, poultry, fish, and other farm products) and Regulatory Enforcement Agencies.

&quot;Recent global news highlighting unsafe food processing, distribution and preparation are creating an increasing demand for standardized food safety training to ensure a safer food supply” explains Christopher Anderson, Managing Director of Bizmanualz, Inc. “By integrating the two most popular global standards – ISO 9001&amp;HACCP – into a single Food Safety Management System, companies will save both the time and expense involved in complying with two different standards.”

Bizmanualz has teamed up with qualified instructors from Business Edge Ltd. to provide ISO Training—worldwide—accredited by IRCA, the world&apos;s leading auditor training certification body. IRCA represents industry-accepted benchmark qualifications for professionals involved in the development, implementation and maintenance of management systems (See www.IRCA.org for details).

“According to International Standards Organization (www.iso.ch) The application of HACCP within an ISO 9001:2000 quality management system can result in a more effective food safety system than the application of either ISO 9001:2000 or HACCP alone leading to enhanced customer satisfaction, improved organizational effectiveness and safer food products” explains Michael Gerard Kelly, President and CEO, Business Edge Ltd.

The FSMS professional program is based on the following standards:
- ISO 22000:2005 implementation guidelines for ISO 9001:2000 for the food&amp;drink industry
- ISO 9001:2000 Quality Management Systems requirements

ISO Food Safety Auditor Training is offered 11-15 July, 2005 in Long Beach, CA. Private in-house classes are available upon request.

In no particular order, the top ten rated culinary schools according to the survey results were: The Culinary Institute of America, The French Culinary Institute of New York City, Ottawa Culinary Arts Institute, Johnson&amp;Wales University, New England Culinary Institute, California Culinary Academy, L’Academie de Cuisine, Tante Marie’s Cooking School, Kendall College and the George Brown Chef School.

The professional cooking schools range in size from the tiny Tante Marie’s Cooking School in San Francisco, to The Culinary Institute of America, one of the world’s largest institutions devoted to culinary education. Canadian schools Ottawa Culinary Arts Institute, affiliated with Le Cordon Blue Paris, and the George Brown Chef School in Ontario, Canada were also named by respondents to the list.

The Top Ten Rated Cooking Schools list will be used by CookingSchoolsCompared.com for its head to head comparisons of more than 40 leading culinary schools included in their data.

About CookingSchoolsCompared.com
“While there are many websites that provide a directory of 1400 or so cooking schools in the US and Canada, only CookingSchoolsCompared.com offers real comparison data, including tuition costs, among 40 of the best and largest culinary schools.” said founder Gregg Dearth.

As Credit Card Discount Rates and Merchant Fees Continue to Rise, Many More Businesses Are Returning To Paper Checks As Their Preferred Method of Payment

 As credit card discount rates and merchant fees continue to rise, many more businesses are returning to paper checks as their preferred method of payment. They are doing this because now there are no longer any costs associated with the occasional bad check, now that these businesses have become customers of a completely free service called NeverABadCheck.com. 

(PRWEB) May 24, 2005 -- As credit card discount rates and merchant fees continue to rise, many more businesses are returning to paper checks as their preferred method of payment.

They are doing this because now there are no longer any costs associated with the occasional bad check, now that these businesses have become customers of a completely free service called NeverABadCheck.com.

Neverabadcheck.com offers a “check guarantee” service to quick service restaurants, family style dining establishments, convenience stores, gas stations, dollar stores, and other businesses. The only requirements are that the check be imprinted with the customers name; address and phone number, be under $50.00, and not be on that stores ‘hot check list.’ That is right, the bad checks (only the bad checks) go directly to them, and they pay you for each bad check within 30 days or as soon as it is collected.

They know that every dollar counts and the business owners do not have the time or resources to collect bad checks. NeverABadCheck.com assumes all of the risks of taking checks. They pay you on every check including NSF, account closed, stop payment, fraudulent…all checks up to three checks on an individual.

Taking checks is still very profitable for businesses. According to a recent Cardservice International study, cash still accounts for the vast majority of all purchases. However, paper checks are a close second. Even in an age of electronic banking and online commerce, the paper check accounts for nearly 65% of all non-cash transactions in American business today.

Because they make their money off the allowed state fees, the program is absolutely free to businesses. Each business is provided a personal web page where they can easily access all of their information 24/7.

John McRae, owner of NeverABadCheck.com promises, “Our great customer service will make your life easier. If your customer wants to pay the bad check at your store, just notify me and we drop them from your stores “hot list”.

NeverABadCheck.com is an affiliate of Restaurant eFund. They have been successfully performing this service for thousands of businesses since 1998.

Some of the artists were so impressed with the gourmet meals cooked that they took &quot;to go&quot; plates just so their wives would believe what they accomplished. Mark Chesnutt baked a Gingerbread Pear cake that he took back to the hotel for breakfast. &quot;It was great fun working with these folks, and finding out that they love to cook outdoors just like everyone else,&quot; said host Johnny Nix. Viewers will be looking forward to each episode in the series to see their favorite performers doing something totally unexpected…mixing, chopping and roasting.

Two New York Metro Personal Chefs Team Up To Offer An Introductory Share A Personal Chef Service

 Professional Personal Chefs Donna Mintz of Basil&amp;Barbells and Lia Soscia of Home Cooking Consultant have been working diligently over the last several months to educate New Yorkers and Long Islanders on the many benefits a personal chef can bring to families and individuals looking for healthier meal options. 

New York, NY (PRWEB) May 23, 2005 - Professional Personal Chefs Donna Mintz of Basil&amp;Barbells and Lia Soscia of Home Cooking Consultant have been working diligently over the last several months to educate New Yorkers and Long Islanders on the many benefits a personal chef can bring to families and individuals looking for healthier meal options. After seeing the flood of recent health studies on obesity and bad-eating habits as well as news stories which talk about some of the time-saving benefits of hiring a Personal Chef, Chefs Donna and Lia realized that an introductory service offering could give consumers a way in which they could try their own Personal Chef Service with a friend.


In the last 10 years there has been amazing awareness of the personal chef industry among those who have a cooking interest, watch the Food Network, or search for new career options on the web. However, the general population in the NY Metro area are still unaware that personal chefs are even an option when considering “What’s for Dinner?” ideas. “When we begin to explain to people who have never heard of a personal chef, and just what a personal chef does, such as menu planning, shopping, meal preparation and kitchen cleanup, the light bulb finally goes off,” states Chef Lia. “They do the math and realize that for a similar monthly expenditure which now includes noisy and fat-laden restaurant and takeout meals, they can eat a customized variety of meals in the comfort of their own home.” Chef Donna adds, “When one of my clients, who is a single mom with a busy career, considered the amount of time it takes to plan and prepare healthy meals on a daily basis for her family, she realized that having her own Personal Chef as part of her household team was just as cost and time-effective as having a housekeeper who cleans. The difference, though, is that now they eat healthier too!”

As part of their ongoing campaign of Personal Chef Service awareness in New York City and Long Island, Chef Donna and Chef Lia have created a new introductory level service called the “Share A Personal Chef” program. This new offering is a way in which people who might consider hiring a personal chef can get a personalized introduction without all the risk. All they need to do is get a friend to want to try the service with them and they split the service cost.

Here’s an overview of the new Share a Personal Chef Service:

A minimum of 2 families up to a maximum of 4 families will choose and agree on 3 different entrees and sides (where applicable). This service will provide 3 nights worth of meals (a choice of 3 entrees and appropriate sides agreed upon by all families). All cooking will be done in one day at one family’s home. The other families will then pick up their meals from their friend’s house at the end of the day. There are also two different levels of service to choose depending upon whether you are a couple or family. Additional servings, if needed, are available for an additional cost. In addition, the families would split the cost of the food. As an added bonus, if any of the families decide to continue with a contracted service after the Share a Personal Chef Introductory Service, they will receive a $50.00 discount coupon, which will be applied to the first chef service. The Share a Personal Chef Service starts around $18.75 per person. (Pricing depends on food selections).

“This is a new-wave version of the cooking club whereby local families group together and cook a week’s worth of meals for each family involved. With the Share a Personal Chef program, they get the same time benefit along with added expertise in healthy meal options without all the work. All they have to do is find a friend and choose the menu!” states Chef Donna. “If you can justify the expense of a housekeeper and gardener, you can justify having a Personal Chef. All you do is add the expense of ordering takeout or eating out, the time it takes to plan and prepare the meals, and the toll on your health for not eating the right combination of foods, and you can certainly realize a Personal Chef is affordable,” states Chef Lia. In fact, if you give up that daily pack of cigarettes and Starbucks, which are pretty expensive here in NY, you will be able to invest that money back into healthy eating.

Delight Foods Inc. Awarded a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I Grant by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

 Delight Foods, Inc. based in Morrisville, North Carolina, has received notification of an award by the USDA to fund a Phase I SBIR project entitled, “Packaging and Marketing of Domestic Vegetable Soybeans.” 

Morrisville, NC (PRWEB) May 23, 2005 –- Delight Foods, Inc. has received notification of an award by the USDA to fund a Phase I SBIR project entitled, “Packaging and Marketing of Domestic Vegetable Soybeans.” The USDA SBIR program awards competitive grants to small businesses. If successful, this research could lead to social and commercial benefits. John Ujvari at the Chapel Hill SBTDC provided helpful feedback to Delight Foods during the grant writing process. Prior to this grant, Delight Foods conducted four years of research into the Domestic Production of Vegetable Soybeans in partnership with crop scientists, food scientists, and farmers.


The principal investigator for this project, Ms. Lila Y.Chung, Delight Foods President and Founder said, “Our research represents a new opportunity to small family farmers in North Carolina – but this group has been offered other income alternatives to tobacco before, only to be disappointed by the lack of marketing support available once the product launches.” Ms. Chung continued, “It is not enough to conduct the agricultural field research. This SBIR Phase I grant addresses the equally important marketing and packaging issues.”

Ms. Neesha Mirchandani, responsible for the planning and execution of the project commented, “As an immigrant from Hong Kong, it is Ms. Chung’s dream that North Carolinians will be able to replace lost tobacco income with healthful and profitable agricultural products. She brings her Asian heritage to bear on this project – and if it succeeds, it will be only fitting that it will benefit her home state for almost three decades - North Carolina.” Ms. Mirchandani also noted that the soybean project has led to the formation of a membership organization of small family farmers called the Eastern Growers’ Association (EGA). Delight Foods will support EGA’s request to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture to build a processing plant in the distressed Eastern counties of the state.

Ms. Chung said, “The family farm is an integral part of the American fabric. That’s why we were encouraged to hear of Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler’s Agricultural Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund. We welcome his commitment to small family farms as a way “to revitalize our communities and bring economic and environmental benefits to all North Carolinians.”

Delight Foods, Inc. is a privately-held company in Morrisville, North Carolina providing a variety of healthful products including vegetable soybeans, soy-based vegetarian patties and nuggets, texturized vegetable protein, baked goods, and soy energy bars.

British Airways Wins Worst Vegetarian Caterer Award

 London nutritionists Foods For Life have marked The Vegetarian Society&apos;s National Vegetarian Week by awarding British Airways ‘The world’s favorite airline’ an award for what they described as the worst vegetarian &apos;special meal&apos; they have ever had. 

(PRWEB) May 21, 2005 -- &quot;The worst Vegetarian Caterer of the year award 2005.&quot; Winner BA


The authors of a best selling UK healthy vegan cookbook by Hamlyn, London nutritionist Yvonne Bishop-Weston and husband Tony food writer and vegan cook love their food.

They paid extra to fly with British Airways to Prague thinking they were more likely to get fed well, they also turned down the offer of a free upgrade to keep their &quot;special meal&quot;.

&quot;What we got was a small soggy white bread finger roll with some limp salad and a pot with three pieces of melon - not what you would expect from the &apos;world&apos;s favorite airline&apos;&quot; says Yvonne.

&quot;The meal that everyone else got wasn&apos;t great from a nutrition point of view but would have been easy to find inexpensive vegetarian replacements - our meal was free of protein, freshness, the chocolate biscuit, the muffin, the juice and even the water that everyone else got”

“I dread to think what was in the water or juice that stopped it being vegetarian.”

The competition for this Award was stiff, apparently Hells Kitchen star and Michelin acclaimed foul-mouthed chef Gordon Ramsay came a close second. He’s always making jokes about slipping meat into vegetarian dishes showing a clear lack of understanding about allergies.

A vegetarian is unlikely to visit Mr Ramsay out of choice whereas I’ve previously had good meals on British Airways. Many non-vegetarians used to choose the option on BA flights because it was better than the meat choices. “The standards are obviously slipping and we want to nip it in the bud before they give vegetarian food a bad name.” adds Tony

Many people choose the vegetarian option because they think it’s going to be healthier. Quite often it’s tasty, but smothered in cheese so no healthier than a meat dish. The British Airways serving we got was neither healthy nor tasty.

Listen up Howard Stern Fans - Captain Janks will Make You Laugh Tonight

 Wack Pack Member Hosts Karaoke at Philly’s Irreverent BBQ Spot The Smoked Joint 

Philadelphia, PA (PRWEB) May 20, 2005 -- On May 24 The Smoked Joint’s Tuesday Night Rock N Roll Karaoke and Revue will have a guest host, none other than Howard Stern Show favorite Captain Janks. PA native Captain Janks has made his name as a Phony Phone Caller since his first call during the OJ Car Chase. His Modus Operandi is to call in during live news coverage and insert any number of “Howard Stern-isms”. Much controversial hilarity often ensues.


It has been said that Captain Janks and his protégés have changed the face of news coverage, as we know it. Phony Phone Callers have been the among the first to publicly challenge the truthfulness and sincerity of the TV Media, a topic much at the forefront of today’s media circus. The Captain has recently come out of retirement and has a new CD to promote, as he will do during his appearance at The Smoked Joint, A Barbecue Experience.

The newest Captain Janks CD is a compilation of greatest hits and new material. The new CD, slated for release at the end of the month, holds a first ever recording of the now infamous Dan Rather call. Captain Janks somehow managed to insert himself between Dan Rather and A CBS Correspondent during a live broadcast from the Iraqi/Kuwait Border and with a gleeful shout of “Ba ba Booey, You Idiot” disrupted the broadcast.

During Tuesday night’s Rock N Roll Karaoke and Revue Janks will be holding a Howard Stern Trivia Contest with 15 of his soon to be released CDs as prizes. Additionally he will be available to make cranks calls for fans to their friends, family, co-workers etc. For Howard Stern fans this is an opportunity not to be missed!!

The Smoked Joint, A Barbecue Experience is owned and operated by ex-pat New Yorkers and long time Howard Stern fans Keith Gertler and Michael Berman. When approached by Captain Janks it seemed a natural fit. Penn Law Grad Michael Berman is also known as The Bermanator in competitive eating circles. He competed in the 13th annual Wing Bowl dressed as a giant be-crowned chicken and was a frequent guest on WIP’s morning show during football season. Gertler and Berman&apos;s much touted barbecue spot, a favorite of frequent take-out patron, Governor Ed Rendell, is known for its controversial tag lines nearly as much as for Gertler’s prowess in the art of smoking meats.

The Smoked Joint’s Rock N Roll Karaoke&amp;Revue, KJ’ed by Nick of Xtreme Entertainment tales place every Tuesday night from 9:30 to 2am. On May 24th Jack Daniels will be holding a special promotion featuring give-aways, drink specials and in true Howard Stern tradition shot girls. The kitchen will be open until 1 am and will be offering food specials such as SJ Nachos, Jumbo Dry Rubbed Smoked Wings and the signature Smoked Ribs with Sweet Potato Fries.

Tuesday night is an opportunity to eat well, drink well, laugh well and sing as well as you can.

Produce Processor Selects Ronningen-Petter DCF Filter for Innovative Sanitizing System

 A produce processing company in Tennessee, with assistance from an ozonation system manufacturer in California, has developed an ozonation system for cleaning and sanitizing water used to wash fresh-cut vegetables and lettuce. It is among the first of its kind to be successfully implemented in a fresh-cut processing plant, and the Ronningen-Petter DCF Mechanically-Cleaned filter is the processor’s filter-of-choice. 

(PRWEB) May 20, 2005 -- A produce processing company in Tennessee, with assistance from an ozonation system manufacturer in California, has developed an ozonation system for cleaning and sanitizing water used to wash fresh-cut vegetables and lettuce. It is among the first of its kind to be successfully implemented in a fresh-cut processing plant, and the Ronningen-Petter DCF Mechanically-Cleaned filter is the processor’s filter-of-choice.


Situation
The company processes and packages fresh-cut vegetables and lettuce in bags for the ready-to-eat market. Produce is washed, sanitized and transported through the plant by flume water, which is recycled in a closed loop. Previous cleaning methods used chlorine to sanitize the flume water, however, the water quickly became discolored and contaminated with suspended solids and chlorine residue. As a result, the flume water had to be replaced every two to three hours.

To improve product quality and conserve water resources, the owner of the company and his team of consultants spent nearly five years developing an ozonated wash system that applied the known benefits of injecting ozone into water as a means of sanitizing the flume water.

His goals were:
1) to obtain a longer shelf life
2) fresher taste and lower bacterial counts for his product
3) reduce the plant’s water consumption

In the original system prototype, coarse suspended solids were removed from the flume water by a rotary screen with a two millimeter gap. It became apparent during initial testing, however, that fine suspended solids also needed removal
before ozone was injected — to improve the dissolution of ozone in the flume water.

RPA Process Technologies Solution
After further design and testing, a new water cleaning and ozonation system was installed, which included two Ronningen-Petter DCF Mechanically-Cleaned filters equipped with 50 micron wedge wire screens. The DCF filters were placed immediately after the coarse rotary screen, to capture fine lettuce particles and prepare the water for ozone injection. The DCF filters perform a self-cleaning action by mechanically scraping collected particles from the filtering screen with a patented disc that moves up and down the screen, parallel to the liquid flow. Particles are then purged from the collection chamber at the bottom of the filter. This self-cleaning action is performed without halting production, and provides the highest quality filtering under continuous demand. Because the screen is cleaned without interrupting production, a consistently high flow rate is maintained.

Results
Continuous filter: Flume water is cleaned and recycled in an 800 liters-per-minute loop.

Fine filtering: Improves the dissolution of ozone, resulting in dramatically cleaner water, longer run times, and reduced water consumption.

Labor savings: Flume water replacement is required only once a day, instead of every two to three hours.

Ronningen-Petter DCF’s continuous filtering capability means the flume water is cleaned and recycled in an 800 liters-per minute loop without interruption.

Its fine filtering improves the dissolution of ozone in the flume water, resulting in:
1. dramatically cleaner flume water
2. longer run times between water changes
3. reduced water consumption.

Now, flume water replacement is required only once a day, instead of every two to three hours. The company owner is also very pleased with the system’s impact on product quality. His goals of longer product shelf life, fresher taste, lower bacterial counts, and decreased water consumption have been realized.

DCF also provides the additional benefit of improving the performance of a water chiller in the sanitizing system. Immediately after filtering, the flume water is pumped to a chiller where it is cooled to 5°C by spraying the water onto heat exchanger plates. The high quality filtering provided by the DCF eliminates the risk of suspended solids clogging the sprayer nozzles, and keeps the water chiller at optimum performance.

Conclusion
RPA Process Technologies is pleased that its Ronningen-Petter DCF Mechanically-Cleaned filters were chosen as a major component in the innovative sanitizing system developed by the produce processing company. DCF&apos;s continuous and high quality filtration make it the perfect solution for produce washing applications, giving the company improved quality and, ultimately, making their company more competitive.

Application Details
Filter model: (2) Ronningen-Petter DCF-1600s
Type of liquid: Wash Water
Pressure: 50 psi (3.4 bar)
Temperature: Chilled
Flow Rate: 211 gpm (47.9 m3/h)
Contaminants removed: Fine vegetable particles and debris

Flies be Gone by MonsterFlyTrap.com- Building a Better Fly Trap for Protecting Families and Businesses Against Disease Carrying Flies

 Flies be Gone is a powerful non-toxic, safe and effective alternative for eliminating disease carrying flies naturally. Designed for individuals and business that are concerned about the health of their families and patrons during the peak fly season. It eliminates the risks of using toxic pesticides that could harm humans and animals while protecting themselves from the spead of diseases that flies spread. 

Atlanta, GA (PRWEB) May 19, 2005 -- Mosche the Flymaster of MonsterFlyTrap.com is at War again, a War against disease carrying flies.




Fly Season is upon us again. With the start of summer just around the corner and outside activities increasing, concerned families and businesses alike will once again have to deal with the onslaught of those pesky little insects and the terrible diseases they carry.

In the past, individuals and businesses had little choice in combating against this annual mass invasion. Every year their choices were limited to using pesticides containing toxic chemicals, messy and unsightly fly strips or in-affective and noisy bug zappers that need constant electricity.

With the development of Flies be Gone by MonsterFlyTrap.com, individuals and businesses now have a better and safer alternative for fighting back.

Flies be Gone was designed to solve multiple problems once and for all.

First- By using a safe non-toxic bio-mass bait that attracts flies to it like bees to honey it eliminates the need for dangerous chemicals that could harm both humans and animals. Once captured the flies die naturally.

Second- It was engineered to be compact but capable of eliminating a large numbers of flies for over a long period of time. In fact, one football sized Flies be Gone trap can hold up to 20,000 flies and will last up to a whole month. One trap also protects an area up to half of a football field.

Third- It requires no power so that it can be used virtually anywhere outdoors. No more worries about where to plug-in a bug zapper again.

Flies be Gone has been proven to be so effective and economical in controlling flies that it has been selected for duty with our US Armed Forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the USA.

As Mosche the Flymaster states &quot;18 Billion Flies Can&apos;t be Wrong&quot;. If Flies be Gone can&apos;t eliminate them nothing can.

Carbs A Weigh, Inc. Launches into the Grocery Class of Trade

 Carbs A Weigh, Inc. a New York based manufacturer of &quot;Wheat Free/Gluten Free&quot; low sugar frozen pizzas is introducing the line to the Grocery Industry. 

(PRWEB) May 19, 2005 -- Carbs A Weigh, Inc., founded in October, 2003 has recently begun to introduce its unique “Wheat Free/Gluten Free” line of products to the Grocery Industry. John Muscarello, a 25 year pastry chef by trade and founder/President of Carbs A Weigh, Inc., created the line in response to his own families dietary needs.

“My mom was diagnosed with diabetes late in life and was unable to enjoy the foods she once did. Being a pastry chef, she came to me for help. Through hard work, trial and error, and the relentless desire to achieve good tasting fun food, where flavor and quality would never be compromised, Carbs A Weigh Inc. was born. With an unwillingness to settle for tasteless, unattractive, and undesirable foods, I spent months developing recipes and formulas to create fun food such as Pizza, Pepperoni Pockets, Cheese Crisps and Italian classics such as Manicotti, Lasagna, and Ravioli, just to name a few.”

The entire product line is Wheat Free/Gluten Free” with no added sugar and best of all, it “Tastes Great”. Anyone who is struggling with the dietary restrictions of diabetes or celiac disease (allergic reaction to wheat or gluten) can now enjoy great tasting pizza and crisps. (It is estimated that one out of every 133 people may have some form of Celiac Disease. (www.celiac.org)

Corn Fed Labels Have Arrived

 Labels made from renewable resources offer hope for “earth friendly&quot; packaging. 

Lenexa, KS (PRWEB) May 19, 2005 -- Spectragraphics Label Systems is one of the first label manufacturers in the United States to offer labels made from corn. The labels, made from NatureWorks™ PLA, allow abundant, annually renewable resources like ordinary field corn to replace finite ones (petroleum) in food packaging, labeling, and consumer goods packaging applications. The labels and packaging made from this film disintegrate in about sixty days when disposed of in a composting facility.


Spetragraphics has been working with customers primarily in the food and beverage industries to rebrand entire product lines using this new film technology. The PLA material is offered as an ultra clear sheet, producing the “no label” look on many substrates. The same technology is increasingly being utilized for other packaging needs like bottles and molded products. Organic, all natural and other whole foods processors are anxious to grow market share by incorporating these “earth friendly” materials.

The PLA label film is currently offered only with a clear PET liner, requiring similar labeling equipment used for other clear/clear labels. Through advanced engineering and testing, Spectragraphics has developed printing processes to meet some of the older labeling equipment requirements such as liner eyespots. The label film also has a limited print life requiring tight coordination with suppliers. Combinations of ultra violet and water-based inks are used to achieve high quality printing and opacity, while maintaining competitive label costing.

While organic food processors are a natural fit for labels and packaging made from NatureWorksTM PLA, SpectraGraphics is gearing up to make corn fed labels available to what they see as an ever increasing audience of “earth conscious” pressure sensitive packaging companies.

SpectraGraphics has been designing, engineering, and printing labels specifically for every imaginable use on plastic and plastic containers for over 25 years. Find out more at www.spectragraphics.com or at the Label Guru Blog - http://labelguru.typepad.com

Ask Filter Man Forum

 Do you have a question about industrial filtration? Ask the experts! The new Ask Filter Man forum is an online industrial filtration community that will answer your questions about filtration at no cost or obligation to you. 

(PRWEB) May 19, 2005 -- The new Ask Filter Man forum is a community that provides industrial filtration answers within a 24-hour time period, and it is completely free.




Selecting the Right Filter for Your Process:
Factors to Consider

When selecting a filter for a particular application, the following criteria should be considered:
• How large is the process volume? What is the flow rate?
• Is it continuous or batch process?
• What are the material characteristics of the solids being removed? How large are the particles? Is the material hazardous? Can the material being removed be recycled back into the process?
• What are the waste disposal costs? How often do bags or cartridges need to be replaced? Can the waste volume be reduced or eliminated by switching to a different filtration method?
• What are the labor and downtime costs for filter or cartridge replacement? Can downtime be replaced or eliminated by switching to a different filtration method?

Here is your chance to tap in to a forum of RPA filtration specialist that have decades of experience. They understand the impact your filtration system can have on your process, and would like to help guide you in the selection of the right system for your application and process requirements.

Here is a sample of a few questions:
1. We have Sweet Gas Pipeline that contain a noticeable amount of black powder (Iron Oxides and Iron Sulfides) what will be the best filtration system for it Please note that the line size is 56&quot; dia.

2. I have an aqueous and a solvent based systems with 5-150 micron pigment particles. What filtration system do you recommend for a batch(2000 gal)or 33 gal/min continuous operation.

3. I am looking for an alternative to our current method of filtration. We are filtering high viscosity materials (50,000 cps) at 15 microns. We are using wire mesh cloth and our of our major problems is blinding of the mesh. Our runs are short (less that 100 gallons), so I am looking for small units with minimal dead volume.

RPA Process Technologies owns four brands that have been in the filtration business for over one-hundred years. They are Ronningen-Petter, Filtres Philippe, Filtres Vernay, and Malaxeurs Guittard.

Here is your chance to let them share their knowledge gained by experience with you!

 Impromptu Wine Bar and Café brings a celebratory summer to Madison Park with a new chef, summer lunch hours, and an outdoor patio. 

Seattle (PRWEB) May 18, 2005 -- Daniel Ahern, formally of Cassis Bistro, has been appointed Executive Chef at the Impromptu Wine Bar. He joins Owner Cliff Willwerth with plans for new culinary innovations and festive fare to herald the restaurant’s 3rd anniversary.


Opening its celebrations with an Australian inspired menu and wine pairings, Impromptu introduces the exotic meats from “Down Under,” ostrich and kangaroo. The restaurant announced it is serving lunch beginning May 18th.

The cozy, informal, yet romantic café, with its spacious and gas-heated patio, is located on the shores of Lake Washington, in Madison Park.

Impromptu, which originally started exclusively as a wine bar, has expanded to serving a full array of cocktails, regular winemaker dinners, a broad menu of small bites and dinner plates and an outdoor barbeque.

The heart of the café is its wine offerings served in Riedel glasses. Both the wine and dinner menus change every three months with a range of old and new world labels served by the bottle or the glass.

“I am very proud of Impromptu and have had great joy from our guests who patronize our café,” said Willwerth. “We have a really good time here. I have always believed that a warm welcome, personal touch and a high level of quality ultimately leads you to where you want to be. A restaurant takes time and care to grow and as we celebrate our 3rd anniversary and enter our 4th year, I feel we are right where we want to be.”

About Impromptu Wine&amp;Art Bar
Impromptu Wine Bar and Cafe provides a fashionable, intimate setting for Seattle residents and visitors to experience a comfortable neighborhood place. Here, amid fantastic views of Lake Washington, guests enjoy fine wines, inspired foods from around the world and the work of local artists. The only true wine bar in Seattle, Impromptu was modeled after a Southern French café once visited by Cliff Willwerth. Floor to ceiling windows trimmed with natural finished light woods invite the sunlight in the early evening and the moonlight at night. Guests can cozy up in rich black leather chairs or choose to be seated at one of the crisp white linen tablecloth-topped tables arranged with chairs in dark wood and colorful upholstery. Private Parties are accepted.

Location: 4235 East Madison Street, Seattle, Washington 98112, nestled in the heart of Madison Park on the shores of Lake Washington.

So How Do You Get a Handle on Sugar Consumption for Your Family?

 In response to this Sunday&apos;s New York Times front page feature, Low carbs? Who cares? Sugar is the latest demon, , bestselling parenting author Vicki Lansky says you need to do your homework 

(PRWEB via PR Web Direct) May 16, 2005 -- In response to this Sunday&apos;s New York Times front page feature, Low carbs? Who cares? Sugar is the latest demon, , bestselling parenting author Vicki Lansky says you need to do your homework—and it&apos;s really not that hard. Cutting back on sugar is the focus of her book, TAMING OF THE C.A.N.D.Y.* MONSTER Recipes and Tips for Feeding Junk Food Fans&amp;Picky Eaters. It was on the New York Times bestseller list for 16 weeks in 1978 after Lansky&apos;s appearance on the Phil Donahue show when she demonstrated just how much sugar is hidden in everyday foods. The book has been updated for today’s parent and its message of how to shop better, keep your refrigerator and pantry stocked with items kids like, and to use sugar mainly in baking nutrient-dense desserts and snacks is as current today as ever. (*C.A.N.D.Y. stands for Continuously Advertised Nutritionally Deficient Yummies.)


&quot;Minimizing sugar intake was of interest then and it still is—especially when you are feeding children. There just isn&apos;t room to eat a nutritious diet when kids fill up on food items that are high in empty calories. I’m also delighted that cereal companies are now offering lower sugar choices even thought it has taken 25 years for them to get the message,&quot; Lansky says. &quot;I am not advocating a sugar-free life but cutting back is do-able.&quot;

Her first book, FEED ME I&apos;M YOURS, which features how to make your own baby food, has sold over 3 million copies and set Lansky on her path of authoring over two dozen additional books that have sold well over 6 million copies. FEED ME I&apos;M YOURS, a long time favorite of new parents, was updated in 2005 for its 30th anniversary edition. Vicki Lansky is a trusted name in ideas for feeding kids, and in parenting and practical household advice. She is also a contributing editor to Family Circle Magazine.

Unique PIDC Location Code is Critical for Guaranteeing Food Chain Security

 ScoringSystem’s Web-based databank product, ScoringAg.com, has been specifically designed to provide seamless traceback and traceup of agricultural products, worldwide, from “Field-to-Fork.” 

(PRWEB) May 15, 2005 -- ScoringSystem’s Web-based databank product, ScoringAg.com, has been specifically designed to provide seamless traceback and traceup of agricultural products, worldwide, from “Field-to-Fork.” At the heart of this global traceability system is PIDC – ScoringSystem’s patented unique international standard of location and property identification Premises / Property Identification Code.




Unlike the generalized ISO codes that are designed for multiple uses, PIDC is more comprehensive and inclusive, and defines all land and sea locations over the entire surface of the earth, including those areas that are not recognized or covered by the UN and other international organizations.

In today’s global marketplace, any true traceability system must include all agricultural products to provide a true chain of custody with traceback and traceup throughout. This includes: fish from lakes, rivers, and oceans around the world; poultry and hydroponics crops that may be raised in multi-story structures above ground; and wild mushrooms, truffles, and root vegetables that may be collected or harvested below ground.

With the global trade in an increasing number of products from diverse locations around the globe, all worldwide agricultural sources must be identified with their unique PIDC of origin to ensure food safety. Any complete and reliable international traceability system that is called upon to do such an important job must be based on a comprehensive location code, such as PIDC, to be effective.

Finally, protection against bio-terrorism and accidental contamination of the world’s food supply chain must also take advantage of the latest technology, as well as a Site-Specific Recordkeeping™ system and worldwide traceback – with no exemptions. Nevertheless, this Internet based system’s success is solidly based on PIDC to provide a unique worldwide location code reference for all the important links in the food supply chain.

ScoringAg.com and its cattle traceback system, featuring Site-Specific Recordkeeping™ and PIDC location code, are one of the many divisions of ScoringSystem, Inc., which is located in Sarasota, Florida USA and specializes in providing solutions with mobile data, via wireless PDAs, laptops, and Semacode-programmed Nokia mobile phones. Whether using an RFID code or barcodes for tracking and traceback of livestock or perishable commodities and other consumer goods, or storing performance data for sports players, www.ScoringSystem.com makes managing data easier, and does it in an extremely cost effective manner.

Penny Lane required an extremely reliable packaging system which can deliver consistent packs 365 days a year with near zero giveaway to help them compete in a very competitive market. Prins UK Ltd was the company to full fill these requirements due to their vast experience and know-how in the food weighing and packaging industry.

Penny Lane - Sales Manager, Ken Stunt, commented: “With continued high demand for our sausage products this will enable us to meet customer demand and continue to offer the same high level of customer service that our existing customers have come to expect from us&quot;.

The new line efficiently processes catering packs of 5lb and 6lb with great accuracy bagging them in fully sealed printed &quot;pillow pack&quot;. The new packaging line allows Penny Lane Foods Ltd to offer own branded bag designs for multiple customers. Their main range of sausage products include catering, pork&amp;beef, pork, lincolnshire, cumberland, and sausagemeat all of which are available in jumbo (4 per lb) to cocktail (32 per lb) formats.

The system starts with the new high performance MT8/16 Multihead weighing machine which is available in a wide range of sizes. This machine is manufactured by Prins UK in their recently opened West Midlands factory and made to meet the high hygiene requirements necessary in the food industry.

This was combined with the Inno-Tech 3800 Form Fill Seal Machine and a Prins apex checkweigher with metal detector making the system completely automated.

The advantage of a Prins complete system is continually monitors its accuracy using trend feedback from the checkweigher and uses this information to automatically calibrate up-line machinery. This provides increased packet weight accuracy and dramatically reduced give-away. ‘Live’ production information is available to your windows based PC making it easy to manage and control your production.

The award winning apex checkweigher by Prins UK with integrated metal detector ensures the accuracy of the final packs and protects against potentially harmful metal fragments. Prins UK have designed the apex check-weigher to provide extra stability, enhanced hygiene and simpler set-up, while making it possible for the company to offer extremely short delivery times.

How To The Carve Wwow - Factor into Artistic Table Décor - Workshop Teaches Caterers and Novice How To Carve Amazing Works Of Art Using Fruits&amp;Vegetables

 Whether planning an elaborate event or just a small dinner with friends, focusing on a few important elements can create the Wow! factor in your table décor without breaking the budget. Chef Ray Duey has made an art, not to mention a living, at carving fruits and vegetables into centerpieces and décor elements that complement pretty much any buffet or table. “People eat with their eyes,” says Duey. “If you don’t believe that, turn on MTV.” On Saturday, June 4th, Chef Ray will conduct a hands-on training workshop where he promises to “unleash the class participant&apos;s own artistic creativity and making them culinary arsonists (people who are on fire for food)”. 

Big Bear Lake, CA (PRWEB) May 15, 2005 -- Whether planning an elaborate event or just a small dinner with friends, focusing on a few important elements can create the Wow! factor in your table décor without breaking the budget. Chef Ray Duey has made an art, not to mention a living, at carving fruits and vegetables into centerpieces and décor elements that complement pretty much any buffet or table. “People eat with their eyes,” says Chef Ray. “If you don’t believe that, turn on MTV.”

Chef Ray started with garnishing, like most chefs, but got the urge to try something more elaborate. He says he looks for inspiration for his carvings everywhere—and everywhere inspires him. “Now when I go to the botanical gardens, that’s better to me than any concert or show because I fully appreciate the colors and textures,” he says. “I just want to duplicate them.”

Chef Ray urges caterers to look hard at ideas for décor—like his carvings—and to find ways to duplicate the things they like. “Your clients cannot afford not to wow their customers,” he says. “Everybody makes pasta stations, everybody does sauces and dips and hors d’oeuvre. What do you do that causes people to just stop and say, ‘Whoa!’”

Today Chef Ray works for the New York Food Company in Los Angeles and spends most of his time turning out spectacular I-can’t-believe-it carvings for 700 weddings a year, other events, seminars and more. Chef Ray is the expert, but caterers and others wanting unleash their creative talents can try simpler carvings.

On Saturday, June 4th, Chef Ray will conduct a hands-on training workshop at the StarGazers Inn and Observatory in Big Bear Lake, California. He promises to “unleash the class participant&apos;s own artistic creativity and making them culinary arsonists (people who are on fire for food)”. His workshops often cost $400 or more, but the cost of this 3-hour workshop is only $150 and includes and instructional CD ROM and a set of carving tools. Seating is limited. Discount lodging is also available. For information and reservations, call StarGazers Inn toll-free at 866-482-7827.

Top Ten Diet Fallacies — Fallacy #3: Eating Late will Make You Fat: “Not So! It’s More Likely to Burn Fat and Build Muscle,” Says Warrior Diet Author Ori Hofmekler

 Will “eating late” turn you into a bloated blob of unwanted body fat? Many of us think so, but according to weight loss and strength gain expert, Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html eating a big meal in the evening can result in fat loss and muscle gain… if you follow the right plan. 

St. Paul, MN (PRWEB) May 13, 2005 -- Will “eating late” turn you into a bloated blob of unwanted body fat? Many of us think so, but according to weight loss and strength gain expert, Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html eating a big meal in the evening can result in fat loss and muscle gain… if you follow the right plan.

It has been commonly assumed that night is the worst time to eat. The logic: night is when the body typically slows down and therefore is more prone to gain fat. Makes sense, but is it true?

There are no conclusive studies or any evidence to prove the assumption that eating late meals causes fat gain more than eating early meals.

Studies reveal that other variables such as the frequency of meals, the glycemic index of food, calorie intake and hormonal balance are the real “power brokers” in the body’s capacity to burn or gain fat.

Even so the notion that eating late causes fat gain is deep rooted. The reason: for most people, who typically eat several meals during the day, any additional meal including a late meal maybe “one too many”. The result is an overwhelming overloading effect on the body often involving fat gain. Does it mean that eating late is a bad idea? Quite the opposite. If daily food intake is planned properly and the evening meal turns to be the main meal, then eating late could be highly rewarding.

There is a substantial amount of evidence that we humans have adapted well to nightly eating. We carry the same genes of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, who were primarily busy gathering or hunting during the daily hours and eating during the nightly hours, while at rest.

Indeed, our body is biologically preprogrammed to work around the circadian clock (i.e. active during the day and relaxing at night). Our inner clock is controlled by two antagonistic autonomic nervous systems: the SNS, with its highly alert “fight or flight” state, responsible for action and reaction to stress during the day, and the PSNS, responsible for relaxation, digestion and sleep during the night. (See Top Ten Diet Fallaces, Fallacy # 1.) For that matter our body digests and utilizes nutrients better at night while at rest, than during the highly stressful hours of the day.

Furthermore, night is the time when growth hormone (GH) reaches a peak level. (Peak secretion during non-REM, SWSdeep sleep). GH is known to be a potent muscle and bone builder and a fat burner. Late meals, if applied correctly could be most anabolic.

Note that GH actions can not be effectively finalized without the interference of insulin. Late meals, may well take advantage of max GH spike during the night, providing the nutrients required for actually facilitating GH actions, thus promoting protein synthesis in the muscle tissues and fat burning (in particular, abdominal fat).

In conclusion, do not betray your biological destiny.
Don’t deny yourself from eating late meals. If you do, your body may come back with a vengeance, to reclaim what was taken away from him, often inducing chronic cravings for food at night, which may result in nocturnal bingeing. Finally, late meals often have a relaxing effect on the body, preparing you for sleep. If nothing else, late meals can help bring a happy end for a tough day.

“We have a cocktail hour for one hour, with a host to introduce you around, so you actually meet much more than seven other people,” Howard added. Most dinners have between sixteen and thirty-two people. “Usually we seat you next to someone who matches your profile and you end up sitting with the opposite sex on either side of you and across. You simply enjoy a three to four course meal and conversation!”

Howard has seen many successful relationships develop over the last fifteen years through her innovative dining club. “We receive lots of wedding invitations!”

Winsted, CT (PRWEB) May 12, 2005 -- Laura Schneider, owner of the company LS Vending (http://hoodia4weightloss.com/) was preparing to do some print advertising to promote their organic weight loss product Hoodia and learned about Mediabids through a colleague’s referral.




LS Vending spoke with Mediabids.com’s media planner Kris Cianciolo and expressed interest in one specific publication. Kris contacted this publication (whom she has a very strong relationship with) and encouraged them to post an offer for display advertising space on Mediabids that could be purchased instantly and fit the advertising needs of her client, LS Vending. Within 15 minutes of this process LS Vending purchased one full-color, full page insertion in a well-branded, national health&amp;fitness magazine for $2,000 – without Mediabids it would have cost over $10,500.

“As a small business owner, I am absolutely thrilled to have found Mediabids.com - it has enabled me to purchase advertising that I had previously only dreamed of.

One Billionth Biotechnology Acre and Counting

 The one billionth acre using genetically enhanced crops has been planted this spring. Dean Kleckner, former president of American Farm Bureau and now chairman of a not for profit group Truth About Trade and Technology is a national and international leader in agriculture. Kleckner and the Truth About Trade and Technology organization have developed a sophisticated monitoring system for counting the acres and the one billionth acre is expected to be planted this spring. 

(PRWEB) May 11, 2005 -- Remember how McDonald’s used to boast beneath the golden arches about how many billions of hamburgers it had sold?




Well, it’s time for someone to raise a sign on behalf of agricultural biotechnology, because somewhere in the world this week a farmer planted the 1 billionth acre of genetically enhanced crops.

This is a huge milestone for the world. Just ten years ago, biotech crops became commercially available for the first time. Since then, they’ve been adopted with astonishing speed. In the United States, about 85 percent of all soybeans, 75 percent of all cotton and nearly half of all corn is biotech enhanced.

Just how big is a billion acres? Let’s start by recalling that the traditional understanding of a single acre is the amount of land a yoke of oxen can plow in a day. In German, the word “Acker” means, literally, “a field.”

Today, of course, we need more precise measurements--and so a square acre measures precisely 208.75 feet per side.

A billion acres is a lot of territory. It would take more than 27 land masses the size of Iowa to fill up that much space.

If you lined up a billion square acres, they would circle the planet at the equator more than 1587 times. They would reach to the moon and back 164 times. They would go all the way to the sun and all the way back--and still have some length left to spare.

Some years ago, it was possible to say that biotech crops were a newfangled concept. Today, with a billion acres of them now planted, they are a conventional source of food.

There are those who will continue to hurl insults by calling them “Frankenfood” and the like, but these shrill voices are increasingly out of step with mainstream methods of food production. How many more acres must we plant, harvest, and consume before these radical naysayers admit that biotech enhanced crops are a proven technology? Must we go all the way to the sun and back before they’ll see the light?

The simple fact is this - biotech crops are the latest developments in an ancient line of agricultural innovation. Farmers are the world’s original genetic enhancers--they’ve been crossbreeding plants for thousands of years. In the wild, there’s never been any such thing as a juicy tomato. But there have been little red berries that farmers, across generations, have turned into a staple crop.

Something similar could be said of virtually everything we eat, and biotech crops are a part of this heritage. Farmers have chosen to adopt them so rapidly because they produce more food at lower costs. On a planet populated by over 6 billion people--and the number is growing every day--this is an essential characteristic.

Farmers have also rapidly adopted biotech because we care about the environment. Biotech crops help the environment in a variety of ways. Yielding more food on existing farmland reduces the pressure to cut down rainforests in Brazil and elsewhere. Since 1980, farmers around the world have increased our corn production by 45 percent but it was accomplished by adding less than 5 percent more acres to our fields. That additional corn was produced on the equivalent of 130 million acres of rainforest that has not been cut down!

Moreover, biotech crops protect our environment by allowing us to use farming techniques that save topsoil and use our resources much more effectively.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, biotech crops are approved for commercial use only after regulators at the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency have tested them repeatedly and registered their approval.

The bottom line is that they’re perfectly safe to eat. There’s never been a case anywhere of a biotech plant causing a human being so much as to sneeze.

In the future, it will become increasingly clear that biotech crops aren’t merely acceptable to eat--they’ll be preferable to eat, as plant breeder’s research ways to produce crops that add essential vitamins and nutrients to our diets. The research is going on right now and it promises to transform the ways in which we think about keeping ourselves healthy.

So today, we celebrate a billion acres. At some point in the future, like McDonald’s, so many billions will have been “served” that we’ll quit counting these biotech acres altogether.

Dean Kleckner is chairman of Truth About Trade and Technology, an Iowa farmer and a past president of the American Farm Bureau. Truth About Trade and Technology is a national grassroots advocacy group based in Des Moines, IA, formed and led by farmers in support of freer trade and advancements in biotechnology.

DiabeticsBooks.com offers a collection of the best literature on diabetes, as well as a host of diabetic cookbooks that tackle the single most important part of a diabetic’s daily life – &quot;diet&quot;. The web site lists specific diabetic recipes that balance the various components of a meal to optimum effect, ensuring that sugar levels can be kept in firm control. “A diabetic’s diet, in fact, is so balanced that it is healthy for everybody,” says Abruzzese. “My wife used a diabetic diet to lose weight and feels great, fit and energetic.”

The web site also hosts basic information about the symptoms of diabetes, including diabetes in children. DiabeticsBooks.com provides direct access to purchase any of its listed literature, eliminating lengthy hours of searching in bookstores or on the Internet.

“The number of people who are suffering from diabetes today is alarmingly high, and it continues to rise,” says Abruzzese. “With a resource like DiabeticsBooks.com, diabetics can fight back against the disease and continue to lead healthy, productive lives.”

Saltworks Products Reviewed in Slate Article

 Saltworks.us, a leading provider of gourmet and bath sea salt, was featured in a recent Slate article. 

(PRWEB) May 11, 2005 -- Saltworks gourmet salts were on display last week in Slate magazine. In the article &apos;Worth One&apos;s Salt&quot; the magazine compared nine products for taste, packaging and value - of the nine, four were Saltworks products:

Our La Baleine Sea Salt was cited for its &apos;reasonable price&apos; and called &apos;an excellent addition to your outdoor grilling area&apos;.

For those who want to make a step up, Slate recommended
Ravida Sea Salt for use on grilled meats, in salads and on fresh tomatoes, or anywhere &apos;a noticeable crunch is desired&apos;. The big crystals make this salt a texture and taste experience.

Camargue Fleur de Sel, won added points because of the salt&apos;s delightful fragrance. One reviewer described it as &apos;pure and warm like a Santa Ana wind&apos;. This salt&apos;s perfect for steak or French fries.

When nothing but the finest is required, though, try
M Gilles Hervy Fleur de Sel. This salt is light and crunchy, exquisite on fresh vegetables and meats alike. Hand harvested in Brittany, it&apos;s a true gourmet experience.

&quot;Saltworks has always tried to be a resource, as well as an online store,&quot; Mark Zoske, company owner, said, &quot;and we&apos;re glad Slate is profiling so many of our products.&quot;

Saltwork supplies premium grade salts to the wholesale, retail, and consumer markets throughout North America. Customers range from individuals who order by the pound, to manufacturers, restaurants, food co-ops, and health food stores, who order by the pallet. While SaltWorks, Inc. is known for its wide selection of highly sought-after varieties of gourmet sea salt, the company’s pricing is equally popular among retail consumers and bulk buyers. Zoske buys from the source, striking deals with small French salt farms and Dead Sea salt producers in Israel alike.

Products include Dead Sea salt and other bath salts, as well as a full range of
gourmet salts.

Diet King: A New Inspirational Novel Enters and Challenges the Usual Weight-Loss Diatribe

 Diet King is the first novel published by Adam Wilk. This new book, composed of thirteen separate yet uniquely connected short stories about the trials and tribulations of dieting, offers readers not only inspiration but raw hilarity while at the same time provoking a rethinking of the many weight issues wracking our society. 

(PRWEB) May 11, 2005 -- What really goes on in the mind of an overweight person? The inspirational novel Diet King gives readers a raw, whimsical look into the world of Peter Wells and his emotional twenty-five-year journey through dieting hell. Each chapter is an emotional roller coaster, sometimes causing hysterical laughter only to then bank sharply and hurl the reader into the solemn struggle of trying to lose weight and stay healthy in a world where food is so plentiful.




When young Peter Wells embarks on a field trip with his third-grade class, his problems begin when he hurls insults at a large-sized classmate. In high school, Wells cuts gym classes and rapidly gains weight. His parents and his school counselor send him to a psychologist who believes that exercise will help cure Wells of his poor eating habits. Wells begins a rigorous and lengthy pilgrimage to lose weight by attending diet meetings with a reluctant brother, by challenging an intolerant corporate world, and by dealing with an overzealous vegetarian hostess during a weekend retreat. He begins a low-carb diet and watches his ailing, overweight father request fast food from his hospital bed. After facing a frightening close call with his own health, Wells begins to question his choices.

In Diet King, Peter Wells, like most Americans struggling with their weight, must make a life-changing decision—does he want to “eat to live” or “live to eat?” The result will inspire many.

This 276 page book is published by iUniverse, Inc., where it is currently available as an ebook or a print book (http://www.iuniverse.com/bookstore/index.asp).

Author Bio: Adam Wilk is a writer and has been a long-time advocate of natural and alternative medicine. Born in Flushing, New York, Adam began writing poems at a very young age and was later encouraged by many of his English teachers, from junior high school through Queens College, to continue writing. He began writing Diet King in 2002. An excerpt from a short story he wrote for friend and fellow author Dianne Arcangel will appear in her book, Afterlife Encounters (Hampton Roads, Inc.), due out October, 2005.

Report Highlights:
With new occasions emerging and a growing relevance of snacks in fulfilling modern nutritional requirements, the combined value of snacking in Europe and the US is expected to near US$150bn by 2009. Snacking out-of-home and day-time snacking occasions represent key growth opportunities.

Packaging Graphic Design Firm Mark Oliver Takes Stahmann&apos;s to New Levels

 Package redesign allowed the gourmet foods company to successfully expand its reach. 

Solvang, CA (PRWEB via PR Web Direct) May 10, 2005 -- When specialty food retailer Stahmann&apos;s set their sights on the gourmet market, they enlisted branding and packaging graphic design firm Mark Oliver Inc. to pave the way.

&quot;The road from New Mexico family ranch to Nieman Marcus is not an easy one to walk. No matter how rich the tradition or how sweet the pecan brittle, no company moves their product into select stores without the &apos;look,&apos;&quot; explained Mark Oliver, CEO of Mark Oliver Inc.

Begun over seventy years ago, Stahmann&apos;s (the largest privately-owned pecan producer in the world) had established a successful catalog business and country store, but wanted to expand into fashionable gourmet retailers nationwide. The problem, however, was stale packaging that failed to reflect the quality of the product. Awash with muted beiges and featuring Texas-style western fonts, the look was pioneer - but decidedly not gourmet.

&quot;When we asked Mark Oliver Inc. to reposition and brand our product line, we had two focus points: our heritage, and appealing to a high-end customer base. Incorporating both was the challenge,&quot; reflects Stahmann&apos;s General Manager, Beverly Hart.

With this in mind, staff members traveled to New Mexico gaining access to the family, ranch, employees, and landscape. Privy to tales covering seven decades and to photographs of annual ranch events like a mock bullfight, they cultivated a visual story and timeline that would beautifully illustrate the Stahmann heritage. The strategy for introducing the company into the homes of high-end consumers became clear: illustrate the heritage – make the illustration a package.

&quot;They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and nothing could be more true in the Stahmann&apos;s case. We asked illustrator Jeremy Sancha to recreate the family history in his linocut style, and we ended up with eleven scenes capturing the ranch both as it was, and as it is today,&quot; shared Oliver. &quot;Each handsomely illustrates life on the ranch and brings a sense of connection between the target audience and the product&apos;s origins.&quot;

Since redesigning, Stahmann&apos;s no longer worries about walking the road to Nieman Marcus, they’re already running -- the value-added packaging has evolved to include 50 SKUs.

Gluten-Free Living the National Magazine for People with Celiac Disease Announces the Spring 2005 Issue

 Gluten-Free Living is a magazine written for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten-Free Living has a ten year history of success, and wants to expand its reach through our new distributor, OneSource Magazine Distribution. We are announcing our Spring issue, which has a bold new look and exciting topics. 

(PRWEB) May 10, 2005 -- Gluten-Free Living, the most reliable source of information about celiac disease and the gluten-free diet, has published a landmark Spring issue. With a new, exciting look and availability on selected newsstands across the county, the publication is visual evidence of the growing influence of the gluten-free segment of the population.

Gluten-Free Living has a ten-year history of outstanding research and writing in all areas pertaining to celiac disease. This issue features an article on cheese, whether or not it is gluten free, and the possibility that blue cheese, particularly, might be dangerous. The dangers in spelt, a derivation of wheat, are emphasized in another story. A very important article outlines follow-up care for those diagnosed with celiac disease.

“Read it or weep,” uses a personal story to emphasize how easy it is to fall into the trap of not reading food labels. “Allison ambushed by spelt,” teaches a lesson to everyone who follows the gluten-free diet. In “Catch this recipe for GF beer-battered fish,” the first article in a new “Recipes Reinvented” section, a forbidden dish is turned into a gluten-free delight. Then there’s recent news and information, product details, an extensive list of gluten-free vendors and more.

Gluten-Free Living is the only magazine published specifically for those who have celiac disease and follow the gluten-free diet. Celiac disease is an autoimmune problem that results in a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. The patient is “cured” by following a gluten-free diet, a particularly challenging method of eating.

Ann Whelan, founder and editor, has celiac disease and has been an outspoken advocate for people with celiac disease. She has spoken to groups across the country sharing her expertise on ingredients containing gluten and her practical knowledge of living with celiac disease. She is currently serving on the Celiac Disease Task Force with the leading medical professionals in the field. The Celiac Disease Task Force has successfully lobbied Washington lawmakers for tougher food laws.

Amy Ratner, associate editor, has a child with celiac disease and has helped eliminate food myths – like the possibility of gluten in vinegar. There is no gluten in vinegar, except malt vinegar, yet newly diagnosed celiacs receive misinformation on a regular basis. Amy has covered many angles of raising a celiac child, from bat mitzvah to birthday parties, Holy Communion, peer pressure and sleep-away camp! Contributing editors include dietitians and doctors who focus on celiac disease.

Practical information is available on the website as well as back and a starter kit for newly diagnosed celiac. For more information, call 914-741-5420 or visit www.glutenfreeliving.com.

Eating Protein and Carbs Before Exercising May Lead to Fat-Gain and Muscle Wasting Warns Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler

 Pound down a good protein shake with some banana before exercising to gain muscle lose body fat? According to groundbreaking research, eating before exercising can be a recipe for disaster, stimulating fat gain and leading to catabolic muscle loss — rather than the opposite — warns cutting-edge diet guru and bestselling Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html 

(PRWEB) May 9, 2005 -- Another major diet fallacy exposed: Eating protein and carbs before exercising may lead to fat-gain and muscle wasting warns Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler.

Pound down a good protein shake with some banana before exercising to gain muscle lose body fat? According to groundbreaking research, eating before exercising can be a recipe for disaster, stimulating fat gain and leading to catabolic muscle loss — rather than the opposite — warns cutting-edge diet guru and bestselling Warrior Diet author Ori Hofmekler. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html

“Many people assume that the human body operates like a machine and therefore in order to work, it needs to be fueled liked a machine. Eating before exercise seems to make sense. But does it really? “ asks Warrior Diet author, Ori Hofmekler and provides this answer:

As you’ll soon realize, the idea that pre-exercise meals provide the muscle with instant energy is literally wrong, often misleading and counter effective.

In order to provide the muscle with nutrients and energy, food must be first fully digested. During digestion food is broken down into smaller compounds, yielding molecules of amino acids, fatty acids and glucose — which are transferred to the body’s tissues through the circulatory system. The digestion elimination process, that occurs in the stomach, intestines, liver and kidneys, respectively, requires substantial amounts of energy. During digestion, blood flow shifts from the brain and muscles to the inside organs (responsible for digestion and elimination). That shift in the blood flow profoundly affects the brain and muscle tissues, lowing their capacity to perform and resist fatigue.

The question remains: “What about meals that require almost no digestion?” such as those made from fast assimilating nutrients. (Note that fat is a slow digested and assimilated nutrient compared to protein and carbs.)

Consuming a pre-exercise meal made from a blend of fast releasing proteins and carbs (such as whey and sugar), looks initially quite appealing. In theory such meals would nourish the muscle tissues with amino acids and glucose to inhibit muscle breakdown, while providing instant energy. It all makes sense, but even so, in real life, things often work differently than in theory.

Recent studies demonstrated that eating fast releasing foods before or during exercise could be counter effective, to say the least. Investigators in the school of sport and exercise science, University of Birmingham, Edgbastion, England found that ingestion of carbs before exercise adversely elevated plasma cortisol levels. Interestingly enough, there was a significant reduction in post exercise cortisol when carbs were not ingested before exercise. Furthermore, there was a faster shift from carb to fat fueling during exercise, when a pre-exercise meal was not applied.

As for protein, what failed to reach mainstream nutrition knowledge is the already established fact that protein rich foods raise cortisol levels if applied incorrectly. Studies at the University of Lubeck, in Germany, found that oral administration of fast releasing protein foods such as hydrolyzed (pre-digested) proteins, have an even more profound cortisol elevating effect, compared to whole protein foods.

Note that chronic elevated cortisol has been associated with muscle wasting and fat gain (in particular abdominal fat.)

In summary, pre-exercise meals may rob the brain and muscle of energy (due to digestion). Eliminating the digestion effect of pre-exercise meals may only make things worse. Eating meals made from fast releasing proteins and cabs, before exercise, can cause a profound cortisol elevating effect during and after exercise. This may severely compromise ones ability to build muscle and burn fat.

In conclusion, DO NOT EAT before exercise, instead eat right after exercise.

Ironically, the same meal that would be counter-effective before exercise can be most effective and beneficial when applied after exercise.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the critical positive effects of post-exercise recovery meals on total muscle recuperation (i.e. replenishment of energy reserves and increased protein synthesis). Recent studies at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston, TX, revealed that applying fast releasing proteins and carbs after exercise had substantial anabolic effect on stimulating net muscle protein synthesis, even in cases of elevated cortisol.

Consequently, we are not preprogrammed to be fueled like machines. Our biological machine is based on survival mechanisms that when triggered, increase our capacity to utilize fuel, generate energy and better survive.

We trigger these mechanisms, when we follow cycles that rotate between undereating while in an action followed by eating while in rest.

For the human body, timing affects everything. “It is when you eat that makes what you eat matter.”

If you insist on eating before exercising then there are some crucial things you should do to avoid sabotaging your body. Visit http://www.dragondoor.com/articler/mode3/317/ for more information or read Ori Hofmekler’s The Warrior Diet. http://www.dragondoor.com/b17.html

Research and Markets : Global Food Retail Sales Exceed $2 Trillion Annually

 Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c16876) has announced the addition of Changing faces of Supply-Chain Model in Global Food Market to their offering. 

Dublin (PRWEB) May 6, 2005 -- Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c16876) has announced the addition of Changing faces of Supply-Chain Model in Global Food Market to their offering.




This report serves as a major tool in understanding the functioning and dynamics of the global food market, which doesn&apos;t just pertain to the fundamentals of international trade any more. The structure of the global food industry is continually changing and evolving as food suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers adjust to meet the needs of consumers, which includes demand for wider variety of higher quality products.

Global food retail sales exceed $2 trillion annually, with supermarkets/hypermarkets accounting for the largest share of sales. Additionally, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse-style discount outlets, convenience stores, and combined gasoline and grocery outlets have emerged in numerous countries over the past few years to increase the demand for global food supply.

Driven by innovation and competition from private retail brands, food manufacturers are focusing on specific product lines where they have inherent advantages, and target for developing countries for more focused approach. Expansion in foreign markets is further contributing to the growth of large multinational food manufacturers but local markets are still welcoming small-scale individual retailers to successfully find opportunities within the marketplace.

This enables food manufacturers to become leaders in certain product lines and to better cater to consumer demand for these products in different markets. Therefore, while manufacturer concentration is not evident at the global level for total packaged food sales, firm concentration may exist in specific product lines and regional markets. Firm concentration can be specifically seen for the products in which the manufacturer&apos;s brands are popular, such as in soup, breakfast cereal, and baby food.

The report also takes into account the various consumer preferences that are driving changes in global food supply chains, including growth in private label sales and expansion of multinational retailers and manufacturers in developing countries.

Nando&apos;s Chickenland Inc Market Leader of Peri-Peri Sauces, Marinades&amp;Cooking Sauces Have Been Awarded Professional Chefs Award

 Clucking Good News - Nando&apos;s Chickenland Inc market leader of Peri-Peri Pepper Sauces, Marinades&amp;Cooking Sauces have been awarded the 2005 Professional Chef&apos;s Association Gold Seal Award - Score level - Excellent - Criteria - Consistency, Color, Appearance, Texture, Taste, Aroma, Feel, Freshness 

(PRWEB) May 4, 2005 -- Peri-Peri – A story we’re sure you’ll warm to: It all began centuries ago, when Portuguese explorers set out in search of spices and gold. After many adventures and months of toiling the high seas, they accomplished their mission. The famous spice route to the East had been discovered!

Southern Africa soon became a stopover for the explorers, and with its glorious climate and beautiful terrain, many of them settled there. It was here that they came across the Bird’s Eye Chilli, called Pili-Pili by the local Swahili people. The settlers adopted the name Peri-Peri and started using this fiery ingredient, with a blend of herbs and spices as part of their cuisine.

Peri-Peri recipes have always been a source of family pride and have been passed down from generation to generation. The Nando’s Peri-Peri sauces are just such a recipe – a combination of old-world mystery and fiercely guarded secrets. The secret Nando’s recipes reveal themselves in the legendary Nando’s Peri-Peri sauce range, Nando’s Cooking Sauces and Marinades, and of course, our world-famous chicken. Today people on five continents have fallen in love with the Nando’s Peri-Peri taste.

Its all about good taste&amp;exotic flavours:
Visit http://www.NandosUSA.com to ex Peri-Peri ence Oral Satisfaction

Peri - Interesting Facts:
Peri-Peri is not just about flavour – it also has many curative properties. Look no further than a chilli for a healthy vitamin C dose to relieve you (albeit temporarily) of blocked sinuses, a congested throat or lungs. Studies have also shown that Capsaicin also works with protein molecules to decrease cholesterol absorption in the body and to speed up metabolism (another great reason why people on a diet should eat Nando’s!) But probably the best thing about eating Peri-Peri is that it enhances the release of endorphins (a substance in the brain that causes one to feel pleasure). No wonder it is rumoured that Peri-Peri is an aphrodisiac – how much more could one ask for?

What is most obvious that Peri-Peri is an absolute must for dieters because of the incredibly low kilo joule count (approximately 168 kJ per chili) and virtual lack of fat present. What&apos;s more their fiery taste can liven up any meal and does away with the need for adding extra salt or fat while cooking.

Flying the Coop:
This phenomenal international Peri-Peri trail (which has really just started) has made Nando’s Chickenland the first and only South African restaurant brand to successfully extend its operation internationally and capture the high-streets of major world capitals such as London, Kuala Lumpur, Toronto, Cape Town and Sydney. Nando’s has been highlighted as one of the top five most exciting food concepts in London (a city at the centre of cutting-edge trends) and was recently awarded Restaurateur of the Year in the UK,

Health&amp;Fitness Expert Debbie Siebers Debuts Bestselling Cookbooks at Her Official Web Site

 After a successful launch of her fashion collections, Debbie Siebers extends the brand to include both of her bestselling books, “Nutritional Makeover”&amp;“Energy Boost”. 

Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) May 3, 2005 -- Debbie Siebers, the health and fitness industry’s leading lady, today announced the addition of her bestselling cookbooks, “Nutritional Makeover” and “Energy Boost” to the product offerings at her official website, www.DebbieSiebers.com.

In “Nutritional Makeover” Siebers teaches her readers the importance of discovering the right balance of healthy eating, nutrient intake, and exercise. Unlike traditional health-conscious cookbooks that feature bland and flavorless recipes, this book exhibits delicious entries, such as vegetable tempura, spicy beef&amp;avocado stir-fry, and fresh plum dumplings which are guaranteed to impress at any dinner party.

“I know how hard it can be to want to lose weight and still cook delicious foods,” Siebers symphonizes. “With this book, you’ll find great healthy recipes, nutritional information, eating plans, and more.”

With “Energy Boost” Siebers shows her readers that by eating nutritionally balanced meals, they will find that their energy and motivation levels will skyrocket. Additionally, Siebers demonstrates how the proper intact of vitamins&amp;minerals benefits her readers’ beauty concerns.

“The basic elements of beauty—blemish-free skin, strong nails, and healthy hair—are all affected by your diet,” Siebers explains. The recipes included in this book, while decadent&amp;scrumptious, are consistently mindful of readers’ concerns about carbohydrates, fat, and calories. Some of the mouth-watering entries in the book include: a kiwi-grapefruit drink with mint, gnocchi with oyster mushrooms, and spicy chicken with fresh mango sauce.

While many readers will relate to satisfying the all-too-familiar hunger cravings most dieters experience with a chocolate bar or a bag of chips, “Energy Boost” offers easy to prepare recipes to avoid that trap.

“These books are a wonderful companion to any type of workout program,” Siebers summarizes.

Both “Nutritional Makeover”&amp;“Energy Boost” are published by Silverback Books and are sold through Siebers’ official website, www.DebbieSiebers.com, at the easy to swallow price of $19.95.

For over twenty years, Siebers has inspired people to achieve physical fitness through her associations with Body-By-Jake, BeachBody, and Slim in 6. During the previous season of FOX Television’s hit reality show, “The Swan,” she starred as its health&amp;fitness expert.

Our Greek Yogurt or &quot;yiaourti&quot; embodies all of these characteristics and more with our signature Greek Gods Greek style added technique.

Once you’ve tried Greek Gods Greek Yogurt, you won’t go back to the old standard. Typically, Greek Yogurt currently comes in a plain variety, but will also be available in flavored versions soon.

Uses: Greek Gods Greek Yogurt can be added to fresh fruit, vegetables and cereal for breakfast. It can be used to make dips and salad dressings, as a garnish for soups and used to add a creamy taste and texture to sauces and curries. It can be used as a substitute for cream or ice cream or as a topping for almost any meal. Excellent served with honey, or wherever your imagination takes you.

Grilling Face Off: Gas or Charcoal

 Men everywhere will face off this spring and each will take an importance stance on the age-old argument: gas or charcoal. Writer Kim Justice gets to the bottom of this &apos;fiery&apos; debate. 

(PRWEB) May 1, 2005 -- Grunt and fire up the grills gentlemen. It’s the time of year when masculinity is proven with a dripping steak and sizzling burger. Men everywhere will face off this spring and each will take an importance stance on the age-old argument: gas or charcoal.

Men everywhere have their own secret recipes for success and while their methods are as different as sunshine and shade, there is a common ground. When it comes to grilling it’s all about the flavor!

Mesquite grilled everything is always in style and since you can cook with wood on a charcoal grill, we’ll chalk up one point in the flavor category for the charcoal grill.

“Wood lights faster and gets hotter; the real secret in locking in juices and flavor. Plus it gives flavor without chemical taste,” says the founder of Gourmet Grills dot Net, Roger Styles. Styles recommends taking ‘purity’ a step further with charcoal grills like the Barbecook, which can be lit without lighter fluid. “Lighter fluid and propane are health hazards because of the hydrocarbons they release and that’s not, personally, what I want to eat for dinner!”

The department of health also has concerns about excessive lighter fluid exposure. So, we’ll share the lighter-fluid-free victory with both propane and charcoal lovers because of the recent improvements in grill designs.

But, we still haven’t determined the issue at the heart of this sizzling debate. Can propane grills, in-fact, provide the best down home grilling flavor?

“A recent study found that people can’t taste the difference between burgers cooked with propane and coal even thought they could taste a difference in steaks,” says grilling guru Olivier Vanneste. “So, for me flavor isn’t the issue. Convenience is. With artificial heat you don’t have to mess with tending the fire as much and it’s a great way to cut your teeth as a beginner.”

Charcoal lovers have to give a gracious point to their competitor on this one; because, gas grills require less supervision.

So, with the issue of flavor and convenience tackled most men around the country face just one more conundrum: if you can’t impress a woman with your car, which grill will make her weak in the knees?

Natural charcoal usually gets an a-plus for romance. It has the red glowing coals and small flames, which keep the ladies around the grill for Smores after dinner. Briquettes have a lot of gray ash and a ‘camping feel’. If that’s the mood you’re looking for, just hold off on cleaning up until after a date, because the ash is bound to get messy. As for gas, it’s all about speed and function. Gas grills don’t have much charm, but a chef with lots of personality may not want a grill that competes for attention!

Of course, all grillers win when it comes to their waistline. Grilling is the ultimate low-fat cooking method. So, gas or charcoal aside everyone has an excuse to cook up a little fun this spring.

Kim M. Justice is a freelance writer, for Savvy Buzz. For more information about the grills mentioned in her article, go to gourmetgrills.net.

Paramount Cards Says Mother&apos;s Day Is 3rd Top Card Giving Day - From Ancient Greece To Modern Days, Mothers Are Honored

 Andy Meehan, Executive Vice President of Paramount Cards, says Mother’s Day is the third most important card giving day, as greatful children pamper their Moms. 

Pawtucket, RI (PRWEB) May 1, 2005 -- Mothers across America will soon have their day. On Mother’s Day, May 8th, children will participate in the time honored tradition of expressing love and appreciate to their mothers.




Flowers, candy, greeting cards, restaurant meals, and lots of affection and appreciation will typify the day, which is good for business too.

Mother’s Day gives rise to the busiest day for restaurants and the exchange of about $100 million in gifts, and a vast number of greeting cards in the U.S. alone.

Andy Meehan, Executive Vice President Marketing at Paramount Cards, America’s oldest and third largest greeting card company, said, “Mother’s Day is the third most important card giving day after Christmas and Valentine’s. Half of all families exchange cards, including tens of millions by step-families. Card companies gear up for the day at least a year in advance. At Paramount our Mother’s Day cards run from handmade to value priced and are given by children both young and old.”

Meehan said Paramount Cards markets its full line of greeting cards through a wide array of companies, including supermarkets, drug stores, card stores and many others.

Hamilton Davison, President of Paramount Cards said, “Paramount knows what mothers think and how they appreciate loving sentiments from their children. Next year we’ll celebrate our Centennial Anniversary, which means we were well into the card business before 1914, when President Woodrow Wilson declared the day a national holiday, to be held on the second Sunday of May.”

The momentum for Mother’s Day began even earlier, as he noted that Ana Jarvis in 1907 established Mother&apos;s Day at her deceased mother’s church in West Virginia. The next year it spread to her hometown of Philadelphia and by 1911 was in most states. Three years later, President Wilson made it official.

There was earlier precedent for the holiday. In the U.S. in 1872, Julia Ward Howe, who wrote the Battle Hymn of the Republic, began annual Mother&apos;s Day meetings in Boston. Before that, Mother&apos;s Day celebrations trace to the celebrations in ancient Greece to honor Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. Then, in the 1600s, England celebrated Mothering Sunday on the fourth Sunday of Lent and as Christianity spread in Europe, it changed to honor the Mother Church, with people honoring their mothers on that day.

Based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Paramount Cards features a full-line of more than 20,000 beautifully designed greeting cards, and is America’s oldest and third largest greeting card company. Paramount’s operating subsidiaries include Cardsmart Retail Corporation, a fast growing national chain of value priced card and gift stores; Image Craft, the second largest card publisher in Canada and supplier of over 90% of the dollar cards sold in Canada; Premier Greetings division, the USA leader in strategic value marketing; Lawson Falle, the second largest Christian card publisher, Images From The Heart, which markets products including handmade greeting cards sold through www.cardshopinabox.com; Paramount International is a leading supplier of private label and custom produced cards and related products.

Wine School Enters Culture Wars

 Who has the right the make wine—the landed gentry of Europe or the garish millionaires of California? Keith Wallace, founder of The Wine School of Philadelphia, offers critical insight into the new documentary &quot;Mondovino&quot;. 

(PRWEB) April 30, 2005 -- Who has the right the make wine—the landed gentry of Europe or the garish millionaires of California? That is the question—quite likely unintentional—posed by Jonathan Nossiter in his new documentary “Mondovino.”




Keith Wallace, founder of The Wine School of Philadelphia, believes Mr. Nossiter is asking the wrong questions.

The real question should not be which set of elitists should make or drink wine, but can wine be democratized without being simplified?

Nossiter&apos;s message in the film is clear: big business is ruining wine. Large wine companies, such as (formerly huge) Robert Mondavi Winery (now sold to Constellation Brands, the world’s largest wine producer), don&apos;t care about the history or craft of wine-making, as long as their product turns a profit. Insofar as European winemakers go, Nossiter has a point. Large wine conglomerates gobbling up hectares and vineyards in Burgundy and Tuscany do threaten traditional wine-making methods and varietals that are important historically and agriculturally, but lack popular, mainstream appeal.

What Nossiter ignores is the how modern grape-growing and wine-making techniques have opened up new agricultural areas, such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and Argentina. These new entrants into the world wine markets often rely heavily on the highly scientific and mechanized processes that Nossiter decries to make them competitive.

These advances in technology have encouraged the development of environmentally sensitive and sustainable agricultural practices, made possible new vineyards which are not backed by huge sums of cash, and encouraged a revival of the hand-made, artisanal approach to wine that hearkens back to the glory days of old European producers. Growers in areas like Chile and Argentina—exemplars of the modern wine production facilities decried by Nossiter—have preserved endangered varietals no longer found in Europe, when Old World vineyards stopped producing certain grapes a century ago because they were insufficiently profitable or when delicate crops were destroyed by weather and disease.

The modern wine industry has also contributed to the preservation of farmland, created new jobs, and brought tourism to new areas. The thriving industries and economies that have sprung up in these new regions make your local wine store is a much more interesting—and affordable—place to shop than it would be if Europe or California alone dictated production standards or tastes. This doesn’t mean shiraz is good just because it comes from Australia, but the sophisticated wine production techniques of micro-producers have improved our ability to find wonderful, unique, hand-crafted wines at affordable prices.

Nossiter’s film raises legitimate and troubling questions about the implications of large wine conglomerates that should be of interest not only to the oenophile, but to anyone concerned with sustainable agriculture and economic justice in a world of increasingly globalized capital and standardized production. Can wine be democratized without being overly simplified? The answer is an emphatic yes.

With his unspoken assumptions about who should make and drink wine, Nossiter perpetuates the class warfare and elitism so often unfortunately associated with the wine world. This sense of class-entitlement becomes the unacknowledged core of the film. Sadly, he misses the chance to explore how new wine-makers are blending the best of Old World knowledge, varietals, and passion with the expertise and precision of New World technology. Mr. Wallace notes that these small producers, combined with good common-sense wine education, may be the wine-lover’s strongest weapon against the homogenization Nossiter deplores.

Mondovino provides lots of history, interesting tidbits, and even uncovers unpleasant fascist leanings in the great wine-making families Nossiter examines under his lens, but the potential benefits of the global competition are given short shrift. This is a wonderfully eccentric and detailed film that nonetheless should have spent a few more years in the bottle.
