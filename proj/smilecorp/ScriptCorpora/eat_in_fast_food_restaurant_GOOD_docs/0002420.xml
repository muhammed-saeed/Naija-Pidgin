 Ramada Inn application online - Ramada Inn was founded in 1953 by a group of investors. The investors included Marion W Isbell, Michael Robinson, Del Webb, and Bill Helsing as well as others. The group opened their first 60 room facility on the historic Route 66 in Flagstaff Arizona.

 

The idea for the Ramada came from Isbell who, like the founder of the Holiday Inn chain, was dissatisfied with some of the roadside inns that he and his family had stayed at on a cross country trip. At one time the chain also had a chain of restaurants that were located inside the hotels.

 

 Ramada Inn Application - The chain owned restaurants are now defunct but many properties still have a restaurant onsite, even though they arent the company owned restaurants.
 
 Job openings at Ramada Inn: Like with many of these big chains the job opportunities depend on the hotel you are working at.

 Ramada Inn careers : 

The Ramada Roadside is going to have limited positions because it is not a full service hotel. Often these hotels will have a manager, who is in charge of running the facility. As manager youll be responsible for scheduling, hiring, and ensuring that the hotel is doing well business wise.

 

These facilities also need front desk help. As a front desk worker its your job to ensure that the guest is taken care of. Youll register, check in, and check out guests. Youll also be in charge of wake up calls, delivering messages, and assisting the guest with locating places in town. Housekeepers are also needed at these smaller facilities.

 

Larger facilities, such as the Ramada Inn or Ramada Suites, will have other opportunities available. While they will still need managers, housekeepers, and front desk workers they will need additional staff. Larger facilities will often have a restaurant that will need cooks, waiters/waitresses, and hosting staff. They will also have gyms that will need people to keep the machines working correctly and assist guests.
 
Remember, with all things in life, you MUST take action! You MUST stay persistent in order to accomplish your goals in finding work.

 

It&apos;s all about taking advantage of all your resource, and today you have the internet on your side!
