 Wendy&apos;s Fries vs. McDonald&apos;s Fries: Taste Test

The Wendy&apos;s vs. McDonald&apos;s french fry war is heating up. You&apos;ve probably read the latest pronouncement: &quot;In a national taste test, consumers said Wendy&apos;s fries taste better than McDonald&apos;s. When asked which they thought taste better after sampling both, 56% of participants chose Wendy&apos;s Natural-Cut Fries with Sea Salt. Only 39% preferred the taste of McDonald&apos;s.&quot;

Go ahead; be skeptical. That info comes straight from Wendy&apos;s website -- it&apos;s a part of their new ad campaign to topple McDonald&apos;s long-running reign as &quot;America&apos;s Favorite Fries (McDonald&apos;s trademark phrase, by the way). And although that claim is on the pompous side, it&apos;s not without clout -- enough people have raved about them over the decades that McDonald&apos;s very identity is synonymous with those fried spuds. While some may disagree with their claims, there&apos;s no denying that McDonald&apos;s fries have set the standard that others in the fast-food industry aim for. Burger King has been trying to dethrone the Golden Arches for years, once even claiming victory after their own taste-test survey.

Wendy&apos;s claims their nationwide French fry survey was conducted by an independent research firm in eight American cities. However, there&apos;s some question about whether their resulting data is skewed -- it&apos;s their marketing campaign, after all.

 We figured it was time for an unbiased review: 

 The Claims (From Their Websites): Wendy&apos;s latest fries are &quot;made from 100% Russet potatoes and sliced &apos;natural-style&apos; with the skin on for additional texture and taste, then cooked in proprietary oil that has 0 grams trans fat per serving. They are finished with a dusting of natural sea salt to further enhance the flavor.&quot; (Medium size: 420 calories.)

 McDonald&apos;s &quot;World Famous Fries&quot; are &quot;golden on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Made with quality potatoes and cooked in our canola oil blend for zero grams of trans fat per serving.&quot; (Medium size: 380 calories.) Continue Reading

 McDonald&apos;s to Hire 50,000 in One Day

For millions who have ever faced unemployment, or even the prospect of losing their job, it&apos;s the thought that lingers as the last-resort fallback option in the back of your mind, inspiring as much dread as comfort: You could always work at McDonald&apos;s.

But before you send out your next batch of resumes, McDonald&apos;s wants you to know two things: One, working under the Golden Arches isn&apos;t all about flipping burgers. And two, the company is hiring--big time.

As Nation&apos;s Restaurant News reports, Mickey D&apos;s is looking to take its own big bite out of the nation&apos;s stubborn unemployment rate. The company has announced a one-day hiring bonanza: 50,000 new employees on April 19, or what it has declared &quot;National Hiring Day.&quot; Continue Reading

 Happy Meal Toys to Be Banned in NYC?

Yes, the nuggets taste fine, but let&apos;s face it: Most kids beg their parents for Happy Meals because they regard fast-food drive-throughs as drive-by toy stores. The city of San Francisco has already banned toys in fast-food meals , and now it looks as though New York City may follow suit.

Councilman Leroy Comrie, a coucilman from Queens, said &quot;Prohibiting fast food restaurants from giving out toys with highly unhealthy meals will reduce the allure of such establishments for children while hopefully incentivizing the fast food industry to provide their customers with healthier and more nutritious options,&quot; reports the New York Post .

 It&apos;s not just Happy Meals that are being targeted: Comrie&apos;s bill would prohibit any restaurants from giving out kid-targeted trinkets with meals that have more than 500 calories, 600 milligrams of sodium and 35 percent of calories from fat, excluding nuts, seeds and nut butters.

Think those tiny meals don&apos;t pack a caloric punch? Check out the data compiled by Comrie&apos;s office: McDonald&apos;s Happy Meal contains 1,090 calories, Burger King&apos;s Kid&apos;s Meal contains 1,460 calories, Wendy&apos;s kid&apos;s portion meal contains 1,080 calories and KFC&apos;s Kid Meal contains 680 calories.
Toy or not, those numbers are no fun at all.

It&apos;s ironic that perhaps a decade ago, &quot;street meat&quot; sidewalk food was frowned upon by uppity gourmands, because these days, it&apos;s all the rage. Food trucks and sidewalk cart vendors are now the go-to spot to get good, inexpensive meals, and the fervor over these portable eateries has spawned the Vendy Awards and food truck rivalries in different American cities. Restaurants, including fast food chains, have embraced the trend: Last year Taco Bell introduced street-inspired &quot;Cantina Tacos,&quot; and now Qdoba Mexican Grill has jumped on the urban bandwagon with their Mini Street Tacos. Here&apos;s how they rate:

 The Claims: An order of Mini Street Tacos is a &quot;light meal, heavy on authentic flavors&quot; consisting of &quot;three snack-sized soft corn tortilla tacos with your choice of pulled pork or shredded beef, finished with diced red onion and fresh cilantro.&quot; Completing the combo is lime wedge for a squeeze of citrus, plus a small side of ancho chile baked beans.

 The Price: $4.99 for the combo (480-510 calories). (Prices may vary at participating locations.) Continue Reading

As the &quot;Fish Fridays&quot; of Lent continue, the folks at Taco Bell want remind all the observant omnivores out there that fish isn&apos;t the only game in town -- shrimp is fair game, too. And as we all know from &quot; Forrest Gump,&quot; shrimp can be prepared in many ways -- you can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, or saut√©it. Taco Bell has jumped on the proverbial shrimp boat, and now offers the Pacific Shrimp Taco and Burrito. Here&apos;s how they rate:

 The Claims: Both the Pacific Shrimp Taco and Pacific Shrimp Burrito are made with soft flour tortillas, and start with &quot;six succulent shrimp, marinated in spices, crisp shredded lettuce, creamy avocado ranch, [and] fiesta salsa.&quot; The tortilla of the burrito is larger, allowing for two additional ingredients: a shredded three-cheese blend and crispy red tortilla strips.

 The Price: $3.29 for the taco (170 calories); $4.29 for the burrito (460 calories). (Prices may vary at participating locations.)

 Wendy&apos;s Menu: Premium Fish Fillet Reviewed

It&apos;s that time of year again, the 40-day Christian season of Lent, a time when fast food restaurants ramp up their seafood menu selections to capitalize on religious dogma -- hell, even KFC plays up their Fish Snacker. The rules of the season mandate that no meat is to be eaten on Fridays -- vegetarians need not change their eating habits -- but to the observant carnivorous fast foodie, this usually means replacing those burgers and fries with fish and chips. Wendy&apos;s heeds this call, and has jumped back on the bandwagon this year, offering a Premium Fish Fillet sandwich to fill this religious niche. Here&apos;s how it rates:

 The Claims: Wendy&apos;s Premium Fish Fillet is 100% North Pacific cod breaded with panko crumbs, served in a bun with a leaf of lettuce and tartar sauce (500 calories). A slice of American cheese is optional (for an additional 40 calories).

 The Price: $3.99 for the sandwich, plus an extra 30 cents if you want cheese. Add their natural-cut fries to make it a &quot;fish &apos;n chips&quot; combo with a drink for $5.99. (Prices may vary at participating locations.) Continue Reading

 Nathan&apos;s and Wienerschnitzel have dominated the fast food chain hot dog arena for years, but now Sonic, America&apos;s Drive-In, has stepped up their game with the introduction of four new premium hot dogs -- and you don&apos;t even have to leave your car for them. Here&apos;s how they rate:

 The Claims: The frankfurters in Sonic&apos;s new lineup all start with a grilled , all-beef hot dog inside a &quot;soft, warm bakery bun,&quot; and are each differentiated by their fixings: the All-American Dog has ketchup, mustard, relish, and chopped raw onions (386 calories); the Chili Cheese Coney is topped with chili and shredded cheddar cheese (420 calories); the New York Dog has spicy mustard, grilled onions, and sauerkraut (352 calories); and the Chicago Dog is topped with a pickle spear, relish, tomatoes, hot peppers, chopped raw onions, celery salt, and mustard, with poppy seeds on the bun (435 calories).

 The Price: Each hot dog sells for the introductory price of $1.99, at participating locations.

Now that folks at Domino&apos;s Pizza are finished revamping their pizza recipe, they&apos;ve turned their attention to their chicken offerings , introducing new Boneless Chicken (basically nuggets), and a reboot of their Chicken Wings. Here&apos;s how they rate:

 The Claims: Domino&apos;s new Boneless Chicken is &quot;lightly breaded with savory herbs, made with 100% white breast meat.&quot; The revamped wings are &quot;now tastier than ever. Sauced with your choice of Hot, New Sweet Mango Habanero or BBQ Sauce.&quot; The Boneless Chicken can be &quot;customized&quot; with those same three sauces for dipping, in addition to the standards, Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing.

 The Price: Boneless Chicken comes in 8-, 14-, or 40-piece combos, at $6.99 (410 calories), $10.99 (710 calories), or $29.99 (2030 calories), respectively.

Heinz is rolling out a new ketchup container to replace their ubiquitous little packets, and Chick-fil-A is celebrating the new &quot;Dip&amp;Squeeze&quot; ketchup by offering free waffle fries to customers tomorrow from 2-4 p.m. During the two-hour window, it&apos;s &quot; Free FryDay :&quot; All you have to do is ask for a Heinz Dip&amp;Squeeze ketchup at the counter and they&apos;ll hand over a medium waffle fries to go with it.

But while the free fries are nice, we&apos;re way more excited about this ketchup innovation: We can&apos;t believe it&apos;s taken a ketchup company so long to make a ketchup container that you can dip your fries into. It may be a small luxury, but we&apos;ll take it.

 Arby&apos;s is known for their roast beef sandwiches, and now, like other chains before them, they are jumping on the Angus beef bandwagon -- that breed of cattle whose name has become associated with leaner, tastier, and higher-quality meat. This is good news for the carnivores out there, especially since the Angus beef is sliced and piled into a sandwich with bacon and three types of cheese . Here&apos;s how Arby&apos;s new Angus Three Cheese&amp;Bacon sandwich rates:

 The Claims: The Angus Three Cheese&amp;Bacon sandwich contains USDA Choice Black Angus beef, slow-roasted with a rub of garlic and onions, sliced fresh in the store, and piled onto an Italian roll. The roast beef is draped with slices of Swiss cheese, and topped with shredded cheddar, a Parmesan peppercorn ranch sauce, and thick-cut, pepper-spiced bacon . (660 calories sans condiments)

 The Price: $4.99. Continue Reading
