 Are fast food companies to blame when people get fat? 
 
 7 1 
People are quick to blame the golden arches and other fast food restaurants when they get fat, even though they are the ones that bought the food. Parents and organizations even tell fast food restaurants to stop advertising to kids! Whatever happened to parenting and telling your kids &quot;no, you can&apos;t get this!&quot; What&apos;s your opinion on this topic? Here&apos;s mine in depth.

Fast food places are just companys it&apos;s the parents who take them their and feed them the food. as for the advertising the whole custermer base is kids. THE PARENTS JUST SHUT UP! the fast food places are not fully responsible.

 No! Fast Food Companies are NOT to blame for people getting FAT, but ... they are a source of diet busting yummies! 

 People have choices, and shouldn&apos;t try to find blame for their bad actions/decisions. 
 
 Alcoholic Beverages are not to blame for Alcoholism Violent video games are not to blame for the crazy things some kids do iPods are not to blame for hearing loss Casinos are not to blame for addiction to gambling etc.

Ooh, I got that Friendly&apos;s sandwich, it was good. A little too scared to try the Double Down.

I did a blog post about the KFC sandwich and dear GOD; During my research, I looked up all the nutritional facts, and it&apos;s like trying to shove a truck with fat sauce into your mouth. It&apos;s just not meant to be eaten!

I&apos;d love all of those, even if I never could finish any of them. And I&apos;d go into cardiac arrest.

Certain types of clothes don&apos;t make people look fat ... It&apos;s the FAT that makes people look FAT!

Those Double Downs are awesome! I know that&apos;s not the right thing to say here but I like them. :)

I think I only partially agree with you. Yes, fast food restaurants don&apos;t forcefully make people fat, but they make it possible for them to get fat easily and conveniently. iPods don&apos;t directly cause hearing loss, but they make it extremely easy to play your music way to loud. You get the idea. While fast food restaurants aren&apos;t really to blame for fat people, they could work harder to make it less likely for people to get fat.

Completely agree.

&apos;We&apos; make the choice of what we consume. They just provide.

No, the fast food places just serve the food. It is the person eating it that makes the decision to eat it. If they did not want to gain weight then they should not eat it.

Well, if I offered you a burger, and you said no, you&apos;re on a diet, and I later offered you some cake, and you accepted, whose fault is it, yours or mine? Is it the person selling the food who is to blame if someone gets fat? I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s clearly the fault of the person selling the food. Fast food companies get a lot of heat because fat people don&apos;t like to admit that it&apos;s their fault they&apos;re fat. It&apos;s basic human nature: if it can be blamed on someone else, it will be. Everyone, including you and me, have done this at some point in our lives.

I love certain things at McDonalds. I love the Big Mac, the fries, the chicken nuggets, and if I&apos;m feeling cheap, I will eat a McDouble or two. Would I eat it every day? Hell no! I would be so nauseous! Do you know how much sugar they put in it? That should be enough to deter unintelligent people from eating there every day and making their fat rolls stretch even further.

However, it isn&apos;t the fast food companies&apos; faults. Those fat-asses made the choice to drive (or heaven forbid WALK) to the chain and order their death in a sandwich. They need to learn to buy healthier food, even just some ham and bread, and make delicious low-fat sandwiches at home.

I do enjoy going to McDonalds, and I&apos;m 6&apos;1&quot; and 150 lbs. How? I don&apos;t go there every day. I go there maybe two or three times a month at most. My digestive system wouldn&apos;t be able to handle any more than that!

No people just like to blame people other than themselves for their problems. I saw one guy outside of a McDonalds who&apos;s fat folds were literally overflowing out of his wheelchair and protesting how McDonalds and other food corporations like that were making him fat. Well can you guess where he ate?

Unless the fast food restaurants are shoving this food down people&apos;s throat... then no, they shouldn&apos;t be blame for anything.

No, you have to control yourself, and you won&apos;t get fat from it.

No, of course not! People are free to choose whether or not he/she wants to eat such cuisine. It&apos;s not just advertisements that cause said person to want to indulge in said cuisine. Said person may have an infatuation with said meal and its variants, but that does not always cause said person to gain weight at a rapid pace.

It&apos;s pretty simple....No one wants to take responsibility for their own actions. It&apos;s much easier for them to blame it on someone else, and possibly make a buck or two in the process from lawsuits.
 It&apos;s like buying a car, driving it like a maniac until you wreck it, then blaming the car dealer....
