 Marketing Function: Selling 

Objectives:

 
        Apply the Eight Steps of the Sales Process on the job. 
        Understand the importance of relationship building when working with 
 customers. 
        Perform the functions of a cashier. 

Materials: 

 
        Web site resources 
        Making Correct Change handout 
        Fake or real money 
        Cash drawers 
        Student&apos;s personal sale items 

Teaching/Learning Activities:

 1.    Introduce the definition and sales process to the students. 

 2.    Instruct the students in the proper way to make change and count 
change out accurately back to the customer. 

 3.    Making Change Activity . Using fake or real money set up some cash drawers. Divide 
students in pairs and have them take turns being the customer and the 
cashier. As the teacher observing each pair, make sure cashiers are using 
please and thank you and are looking customers in the eye. Have students 
practice using odd amounts of change. For example, if the sale is for $9.34, 
and the amount tendered is $20.34 or $20.04. (Odd amounts tendered can easily 
confuse the inexperienced cashier so practice is critical.) 

 4.    Sales Activity . 

 a.    Make sure students have brought their items to sell with them to 
class. 

 b.    Assign the students to participate in role-plays involving 
customers and salespersons selling the items brought to class. Let the students 
have some fun with this activity--not all buying and selling situations are 
ideal. Use the pushy salesperson, the rude customer, the customer who doesnt 
have enough money to pay at the end, the indifferent salesperson, the 
salesperson that hasnt done their homework, the couple who gets in an 
argument in front of the salesperson, and any other sticky situation. Sometimes 
students can learn more from observing/participating in the way its not 
supposed to be. Finish the activity with a well-rehearsed sale involving an 
exceptional salesperson. 

Instruction: 

 
      Daily Quote . The mechanics of running a business are really not very complicated when 
 you get down to essentials. You have to make some stuff and sell it 
 to somebody for more than it cost you. Thats about all there is to it, 
 except for a few million details. John L. McCaffrey 
      Discussion . To introduce the concept of selling, ask students to recall the last visit 
 they made to their favorite fast-food restaurant. Lead a discussion 
 centered on the following questions: 
 
    Did the employee taking your order try to sell you something other 
 than what you had already ordered? (Up-sell or Suggestive Selling) 
     If so, did you buy it? Why or why not? 
      How did you feel when the 
 employee suggested additional items? Was s/he enthusiastic? Knowledgeable? 
     Why do you think the employee made those suggestions? 
 

 Definition . 

 
    Selling . The processes of helping consumers make purchase decisions for 
 which they will be satisfied. 

 The Eight Steps of the Sales Process . 

 
    Pre-approach . The homework or research, which is done by the salesperson in 
 order to know the customer and the customers motives for buying. This 
 homework also includes the time spent by the salesperson learning all the 
 products and product features in order to be able to answer the questions 
 asked by customers. First impression is everything; the salesperson must 
 always be professional and well groomed. 
    Approach . This step takes place when the customer is greeted. It is very 
 important to earn the trust of the customer right away; look the customer in 
 the eye, smile at them, and greet them. A relationship between the 
 salesperson and the customer begins during this step. 
    Determining Needs and Wants . Listening skills are 
 critical during this step. The salesperson must ask the customer questions 
 to determine what exactly the customer is in the market for. Effective 
 questioning and listening will allow the salesperson to direct the customer 
 to the product that will best meet their needs. 
    Feature/Benefit Presentation . During this step, the 
 salesperson highlights the features of the product that has been determined 
 to best meet the needs and wants of the customer. Effective presentations 
 are those that incorporate as many of the customers five senses as 
 possible. As a reminder, these five senses to involve are: sight, smell, 
 taste, hearing, and touch. Whenever possible, allow the customer to try the 
 product themselves. 
    Handling Customer Objections . Customers may object 
 to purchasing the product at any time during the sale. The effective 
 salesperson does not take the objections personally nor does he/she argue 
 with the customer.  Remember : An objection is really a request for 
 more information; the customer hasnt walked away s/he is giving another 
 opportunity to sell the product! Listen and empathize with the customers 
 concerns and address each one completely. Never bad mouth the competition; 
 always focus on the quality and benefits of the product. 
    Closing the Sale . Upon successful completion of the previous steps, the salesperson can feel 
 confident asking for the sale. Watch for signs from the customer that they 
 are ready to buy; these may occur anytime during the sales process. An 
 example can be to say, So, how does that sound? (Soft Close) or, How many 
 cases of Grape Fizzy would you like on your next order? (Hard Closeuse 
 only if feeling very confident that the customer is going to buy). 
    Suggestive Selling and Reassurance . Suggestive selling occurs when the salesperson makes the customer aware of 
 other products that would enhance the quality of their initial purchase. For example, in the introductory discussion about the fast-food restaurant, 
 if the employee asked a customer if they would like something to drink, they 
 would be suggestive selling. Perhaps the customer forgot to order a drink 
 and they ordered something spicy to eat. Another example would be the 
 customer who goes in to buy paint. If the salesperson asks the customer if 
 they need brushes, rollers, or paint thinner, they also would be suggestive 
 selling. Whether additional items are purchased or not, it is very 
 important for the salesperson to reassure the customer about the product 
 they have bought. 
    Follow-up after the Sale . Whenever possible, the salesperson needs to contact the customer to make 
 sure they are satisfied with their purchase, and that the product does 
 indeed, meet their needs. This is especially true for high-priced items 
 such as automobiles and furniture. This step also enhances the relationship 
 between the salesperson and the customer, which may lead to future business 
 dealings.  Remember : Customers buy from salespeople they like and trust. It is important to maintain that sales reputation with 
 customers. 
      Use Making Correct Change handout to help with explanation of how to make 
 correct change. 

Student Activities:

 1.    Counting Change.  Using fake or real money students in pairs will take turns 
being the customer and the cashier. They are to use please and thank you 
and look customers in the eye. They should practice using odd amounts of 
change. 

 2.    Selling Activity . Students will participate in role-plays involving customers and 
salespersons selling the items brought to class.  

 3.    With the students, identify a company in the area with excellent 
customer service or sales people. Invite the owner or manager to class to share 
the companys philosophy on guest service and customer satisfaction. Ask about 
the companys selection process for employees and their training program. 

 4.    Have students prepare questions for this guest speaker.
