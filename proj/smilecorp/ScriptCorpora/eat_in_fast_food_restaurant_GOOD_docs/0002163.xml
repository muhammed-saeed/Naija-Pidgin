 Hoppit Launches Ambience Search Engine for Restaurants, Bars 
 
 Hoppit , a Manhattan-based startup and the world’s first ambience-based search engine for restaurants, has launched in 25 cities today.

 Hoppit’s tailored ambience and guest-based recommendations are built on an innovative personalization platform and delivered to consumers with just a few clicks. Consumers can pick from 10 Hoppit “vibes” or atmosphere styles, including: classy&amp;upscale, hipster, watering hole, romantic, cozy&amp;quaint, mad men, trendy&amp;chic and more. Another click selects one of six types of guests accompanying the user. Users can choose “I’m dining with my 2-year old,” or one can select friends, family, someone to impress, business colleagues or dining alone. Hoppit’s search results present a full selection of restaurants according to the vibe you want, and include special deals, wherever possible.

“We’ve all been tasked with the proverbial ‘where should we go’ question at some point. How many of us then scour web reviews or email friends or family for their suggestions? Let’s face it: that gets annoying. So, we made the Hoppit app and the Hoppit site to solve this problem,” said Steven Dziedzic, CEO of Hoppit. “Hoppit is a personal concierge that knows the interior and vibe of every restaurant, bar, lounge and café in your city and makes personalized recommendations based on the ambience you are looking for and the type of guests in your party.”

Hoppit’s state-of-the-art natural language processing technology and related algorithms take into account a consumer’s preferences and provide personalized search results. This unique technology is a first in the web-world of restaurant search.

Included in its search process are more than 10,000 local food and beverage deals. Hoppit aggregates these deals from sites such as Groupon and Gilt City, and presents them alongside search results. Users can also search in “Deals Only” mode.

Hoppit began investing in its personalization platform in mid 2010. Established by its CEO; a brilliant graphic designer; an engineer with a photographic memory; and one of the world’s most socially outgoing software developers, Hoppit was built by harvesting the vast amount of information available on the Web and creating its own catalog of vibes in turn.

The startup’s management team consists of web pioneers from Pandora, Google, and Pitney Bowes.

Check us out at www.hoppit.com on your mobile device or on the web. The Hoppit App for Android and iPhone is scheduled for release in early May.

 Harbortouch Adds Tableside iPad Ordering Functionality to Hospitality POS Systems 
 
Harbortouch, a leading national supplier of point-of-sale (POS) systems, today began deploying its new tableside ordering feature on all Harbortouch Hospitality systems as part of its industry-leading free POS system program.

With Harbortouch Tableside, restaurant servers input customer orders directly into the POS software at the table via a dedicated Apple iPad app that mirrors the main POS interface. Orders are relayed directly to the kitchen or bar for a dramatic increase in efficiency for both the restaurant and its customers, as well as other key benefits, including:

 Increased speed of service for a better customer experience, Quicker table turns, which produce additional revenue, Elimination of redundancies associated with hand writing orders, More accurate ordering, and A unique, impressive dining experience for restaurant patrons. 

&quot;The operational efficiencies gained with touch-screen POS systems are undeniable,&quot;Harbortouch CEO Jared Isaacman said.&quot;However, all POS Systems are vulnerable to one antiquated technology: pen and paper.

&quot;When you look at large restaurant chains and high-end dining establishments across America, they all have some of the most sophisticated POS and restaurant management systems available. However, their servers still use a pen and paper to take the order and then must walk to a POS station to input the order,&quot;he said.

&quot;With Harbortouch Tableside, restaurants can eliminate this redundancy and greatly enhance the substantial efficiency gains of having a POS system in the first place. There is no question that Tableside will have a tremendously positive impact on the financial performance of restaurants across the nation.&quot;

As part of the company&apos;s unprecedented free equipment program, the Harbortouch Hospitality software is perfect for fine dining or casual restaurants. The system offers countless time- and money-saving features, such as employee management, inventory tracking, customized menus, flexible pricing and advanced reporting. While the iPad integrates seamlessly with the Harbortouch Hospitality system, the customers are responsible for purchasing their own iPad.

For more information about the Harbortouch free POS system, visit www.harbortouch.com.

 Vending Machines Get Healthier 
 
For decades, vending machines have gotten a bad rap. Problem is, much of it was well deserved. After all, they have traditionally served up unhealthy food and drink options that left parents reeling and adults challenged in trying to stick with their goal of eating healthy. In 2010, all of that changed when a company called Fresh Healthy Vending entered the market with a whole new machine and a healthy mission.

 “People have complained about vending machine fare for many years,” explains Dan Negroni, Chief Executive Officer and President of Fresh Healthy Vending ( www.freshvending.com ). “It was high time that someone revolutionize the industry, so that’s exactly what we at Fresh Healthy Vending did. Now it will never be the same again. People have come to expect more out of a vending machine, and we are happy to be there to give it to them.”

Here are five ways that Fresh Healthy Vending beats traditional vending machines:

 Healthy snacks. While traditional vending machines were stocked with snacks containing too much fat, salt, sugar, and calories, Fresh Healthy Vending machines are different. They are stocked with healthy food options, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, baked chips, healthy cereal bars, and yogurt. Healthy beverages. Fresh Healthy Vending has revolutionized the beverage options, as well. Traditional machines mainly offered sugary sodas, while the new machines offer a variety of healthy options, including 100 percent fruit juice, smoothies, tea, and soymilk. New look and design. While older vending machines were drab, boring, and often difficult to use, Fresh Healthy Vending machines have even transformed the design and appearance of the machines. Their machines feature bright colors, are dual-climate controlled so that cold foods can also be offered, and are user-friendly. New mission. The old vending machine mission was simply to make money, regardless of what was being offered to consumers. Fresh Healthy Vending has a mission of giving people access to healthy snack options, in an effort to combat the obesity issue that the country is facing. Progressive business opportunity . Fresh Healthy Vending offers those seeking to start a small business with a unique business idea. Franchising the vending machines gives business owners an opportunity to be a part of revolutionizing the industry and becoming a part of something that helps solve a significant problem. 

“With Fresh Healthy Vending, we have addressed some of the issues in the industry that gave rise to its negative reputation,” adds Negroni. “People are noticing and supporting the transformation, and it’s only going to continue to get better. It’s an exciting time to be in healthy vending.”

Fresh Healthy Vending has machines in 44 states across the country, as well as in Canada. New machine locations are added monthly. Franchisees are able to choose from more than 500 brands to stock the machines. The Fresh Healthy Vending machines are located in a variety of places, including hospitals, office buildings, military bases, workout facilities and on school campuses.

 AB SCIEX, Phenomenex Partner to Improve Food Safety Testing 
 
 AB SCIEX , a global leader in life science analytical technologies, and Phenomenex , a global leader in separation science techniques, today announced a collaboration agreement designed to significantly improve food testing. Critical to the collaboration is the creation of a joint rapid response team responsible for developing the industry’s highest-quality, most cost-effective methods. This partnership is expected to support efforts to prevent the spread of tainted food and help increase safety of the global food supply.

 Recent food contamination crises have increased the demand across the food testing community worldwide for just-in-time methods for faster response, higher quality results and less expensive tests. To address this demand, scientists from AB SCIEX and Phenomenex will work closely with a broad range of food industry experts in specific applications, such as pesticides, antibiotics, allergens and natural toxins, to swiftly provide labs worldwide with verified analytical methodologies for emerging threats to food safety.

Expertise and resources from both companies combine to form a new global rapid response unit comprised of personnel from Phenomenex’s method development research team and AB SCIEX’s total solutions group. This joint network will better enable food testing laboratories around the world to test for emerging contaminants and more quickly identify the cause of tainted food than previously possible. Food testing scientists and analysts will be able to access this rapid response resource via the Internet to help them solve LC/MS issues that they face in their own laboratories.

Among the food testing application-specific experts who are part of the joint network of independent scientists working with these companies to help shape new method development is Dr. Michael Quilliam at the National Research Council of Canada in Halifax. He is a recognized expert on shellfish toxin analysis and is already working with AB SCIEX to develop an iMethod application to improve the identification and quantitation of shellfish toxins in the food supply. The application will involve the National Research Council’s analytical methodology and certified reference materials. Quilliam uses both AB SCIEX and Phenomenex technologies in his laboratory.

As part of the collaboration agreement, Phenomenex will work with AB SCIEX to expand and sell the portfolio of AB SCIEX’s iMethod applications and combine Phenomenex’s state-of-the-art HPLC/UHPLC columns and sample preparation with AB SCIEX’s industry-leading mass spectrometers. The combined resources simplify the process for food testing scientists to acquire complete methods to rapidly address food contamination crises.

iMethod applications are turnkey, verified methods designed to provide the instructions and parameters of how to most effectively conduct a test to identify food contamination with the highest confidence. These methods, which can be used through AB SCIEX’s Cliquid Software in multiple languages, have proven to reduce the time to results in food analysis from days to hours.

“We continue to push the limits of food safety testing to improve outcomes, especially in times of crisis,” said Joe Anacleto, Vice President of the Applied Markets and Clinical Research Business, AB SCIEX. “By working with Phenomenex and sharing in their world-class expertise in this critical area, we believe we have pulled together complementary tools and testing capabilities to provide the most complete solutions for food testing laboratories. No other LC/MS/MS vendors have the expertise or range of products to make state-of-the-art food testing so cost-effective and easily accessible as AB SCIEX and Phenomenex do together.”

Sky Countryman, Manager, Applied Markets Research Team, Phenomenex, added, “As we witnessed the recent food contamination crises, we realized that, along with our partner AB SCIEX, we are in a unique position to do something very impactful about it. Our collaboration with AB SCIEX offers complete solutions at a level that this industry does not currently have. Not only are we combining state-of-the-art sample preparation, chromatography and mass spectrometry, but we are also providing the opportunity for any lab in the world to access the ingenuity of leading experts in food safety analysis through our joint rapid response team.”

 Deschutes Microbrewery Chooses Demand Solutions for Supply Chain Management 
 
Demand Management Inc., a global resource for supply chain management solutions, announced that Deschutes Brewery, an award-winning craft brewery, has selected Demand Solutions supply chain management software to increase forecast accuracy and customer service levels.

Based in Bend, Ore., Deschutes Brewery is a craft brewery founded in 1988. The company produces a range of beers that it currently distributes to 18 states. As of 2010, it was the fifth-largest craft brewery and 11th-largest overall brewery in the country.

“We outgrew our manual forecasting process and were spending more time sifting through data rather than analyzing it. We needed a solution that would improve our ability to forecast depletions from our distributors while having better visibility of distributor inventories. This helps us add value to our distributors, by allowing us to ensure the right product mix is available to fulfill customer demand and maintain high customer satisfaction,” said Peter Skrbek, Director of Finance for Deschutes Brewery. “Demand Solutions is a great fit for us given their out-of-the-box standardization. Some of the other solutions we reviewed were highly customized and wouldn’t be cost effective for us to maintain in the long run.”

Demand Solutions has a history of helping craft breweries meet their supply and demand planning goals. Deschutes was looking for a system that could integrate third-party data from a leading Beverage Industry Market Data Provider, Vermont Information Processing. The need for integration to the third-party data, along with Deschutes’ Internal history and an easy connection to the company’s Microsoft Dynamics GP ERP system, were critical factors in the decision.

“Our supply chain management tools will give the Deschutes the visibility necessary to manage a growing brand with high levels of distribution excellence,” said Demand Management President Bill Harrison. “We look forward to supporting Deschutes Brewery in exceeding their goal to increase customer satisfaction.”

 Avero Launches Client Partnership With Romano&apos;s Macaroni Grill 
 
Damian Mogavero, CEO and Founder of Avero, and Norman Abdallah, CEO of Romano&apos;s Macaroni Grill, today announce that the companies will partner together to roll out Avero Single Server Mentoring across all 181 of Macaroni Grill&apos;s company-owned restaurants in the United States. Based on the results of a successful eight-restaurant pilot, Macaroni Grill believes the partnership will increase restaurant average check by 1 percent. 

&quot;In this challenging economic environment, we see Avero Single Server Mentoring as one of the best ways to generate incremental revenue with limited capital expense,&quot;Abdallah says.&quot;Avero Single Server Mentoring will help us increase sales, improve the menu knowledge of our service team, and help our servers take home more money in tips.&quot;

Avero Single Server Mentoring evaluates restaurants&apos;sales data to identify the servers with the largest lost sales opportunities. The program indentifies servers&apos;individual areas of opportunity to improve and sends restaurant managers recommended action steps for each server in the program. Certified Avero Trainers review progress with restaurant managers bi-weekly and employ an industry-tested curriculum to help managers become more effective mentors.

&quot;Avero Single Server Mentoring is proven to be one of the best ways to increase sales and deliver a more consistent experience to restaurant guests,&quot;says Mogavero.&quot;We saw phenomenal results during our pilot with Macaroni Grill and are excited to enter into a long-term partnership with such an innovative company.&quot;
