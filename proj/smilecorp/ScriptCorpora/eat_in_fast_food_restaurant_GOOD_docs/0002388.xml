A friend once gave me brilliant advice when it comes to finding authentic and tasty Mexican food:  he said, any place that&apos;s just called &apos;Mexican Food&apos; is your best bet... and In this case, his theory is right on the money.

After a nasty fire and the ensuing construction, Mexican Fast Food is back!  So bring your appetite and don&apos;t forget your cash (they don&apos;t take credit) and enjoy one of the best carne asada burritos in town!

A solid three-star place, in my mind. It&apos;s not blow-you-out-of-your-seat fabulous and it&apos;s not awful, either.

Booya:
--You can order your burrito wet for an extra couple bucks, which is essentially enchilada style. Although it&apos;s tasty, their enchilada sauce is somewhat bland. I really had to spice mine up with salsa.
--Their burritos are HUGE! You will definitely leave this place full, if anything.
--The wait is generally pretty short.

Boo:
--Meals usually only come with six chips. SIX. CHIPS. Their salsa is great, but SIX CHIPS. And if you want more, you have to order their &quot;to go&quot; bag of chips for $3, which is apparently, an explosion of chips. There is no happy medium.
--Their breakfast burritos come with lettuce?? It&apos;s not that big of a deal, since you can always order it without, but WEIRD.
--NO REFILLS on fountain drinks. Major sadface.
--As everyone else says, cash only.

Historically this place USED to be the ish as far as good, tasty with tacos stuffed with beef, cheese and lettuce. NOW you get a very small taco .....jack in the box comes to mind as far as the size is concerned.  Filling my bag with chips does not compensate for the lack of quality and quantity of the food.

Save your time, money and hunger go somewhere else!

CASH ONLY place!  Ordered food for take-out a couple of weeks ago.  The bf and I were craving nachos after a morning hike lol.  Also ordered some other food for my family as well.  We ordered nachos with carne asada which was really, really good!  Another place that serves juicy and flavorful meat (my top pick is still Tacos Reyes in Canoga Park) and another nachos with chicken, that one was okay because we were expecting cubed/diced chicken but it was shredded which tends to be dry and plain which it was.  That&apos;s just our opinion, maybe to others it&apos;s good so don&apos;t judge me!  I also ordered fish tacos and chicken tacos for my parents and they said it was good, heard no complaints from them so I&apos;m assuming they liked it.  The tacos come with chips!  So make sure you go to their salsa bar and grab some to go with your chips!

Overall, not a bad place.  It&apos;s close to my house so when I&apos;m craving for mexican food I might come here.  Parking lot is very small and street parking may be limited since it&apos;s on the very corner of Balboa and San Fernando Mission Blvd.

I&apos;ve been hedging on writing a review of this place... but I really think i should. The Mexican food was alright (nothing THAT special except that they did use fresh avocados) and I totally would have come back to this place... but as we were leaving we saw something that looked suspiciously like a cockroach crawling around inside the restaurant. So gross.... I really can&apos;t even think of a good excuse for that happening.
Because of this, I won&apos;t be back.

Hi. My name is Anita and I have a problem.

I drink Mex Food&apos;s Salsa. By the tub.

Seriously. It&apos;s gotten to a bizarre point where we buy large tubs of the salsa and then I put it on EVERYTHING. Morning omelette...make it a mexican omelette. Salad at lunch? Why not salsa...as my dressing. Chicken for dinner? Make that chicken with salsa please! It just has the perfect texture, spice and tastiness for me to bathe everything in it. And sometimes...I just pop a spoon of it in my mouth. Oh dear. Maybe I should be on that show Strange Addictions. Me and that girl who eats laundry detergent can bond.

On a side note...I&apos;m starting to get a little too close to their soy-saucey grilled onions and peppers. What is it about their condiments? I swear they spike them with something bc I spend more time drinking salsa and eating their sides than anything else.

p.s. Yes, their actual food is great too.

I used to live in the neighborhood and this place is the only reason I ever go back. There is ZERO atmosphere but you go for the food. Parking can be difficult since it is in a very small strip mall.
The best salsa ever. My wife likes to make her own salsa but when we are entertaining, she sends me to get the salsa and chips (they make their own) here. Only four stars because of the parking and lack of atmosphere. Five star food. Cash only doesn&apos;t bother me because it&apos;s hard to rack up much of a bill.

The sign says it all: Mexican Food.

Generally, this place is great.  Their burritos are filling and come with some free chips, their salsa bar is fairly well-stocked, and this place is generally tasty.

There are some off-days.  There was this one time I had a chicken burrito that tasted like gasoline.  I haven&apos;t ever drank gasoline in my life, but this is more of a smell/taste intuition.

I&apos;ve read some of the other reviews and have heard some things first hand and there seems to be a general consensus: this place IS generally good, but don&apos;t be surprised by the occasional &quot;off-day&quot;.

I read the previous reviews and I usually don&apos;t eat at a place until I&apos;ve yelped it.  My fellow yelpers have never let me down.  My friends even swear by this place but.....

Maybe I came on an &quot; Off day&quot;  I ordered a typical item, carne asadas burrito.  When I picked it up to take a bite, a stream of orange grease came out of the bottom.   The bottom of my tray was like the Gulf oil spill!!

I love Mexican food and wanted to find something a little closer to home.  My favorite place is Las Fuentes in Reseda.  I&apos;m a little hesitant to try this place again.

I couldn&apos;t agree with Ally S more - how have I turned a blind eye to this place when I go get my hair cut at the shop next door every month?

This has got to be one of the cleanest (and well air conditioned) hole in the wall Mexican joint I&apos;ve ever been to.  Inside this unassuming store lies a kitchen that dishes out some seriously delicious food.  I only tried their lengua taco and pastor torta, but these were delicious.  Especially the taco.  Next time I hit Mexican Fast Food I am going to work my way through the taco menu - and for $1.25 a pop they&apos;re a steal!  Plus, their horchata is one of the best I&apos;ve tried.  Too many horchatas are either watered down or just too sweet.  This was rich, flavorful, and a perfect balance.  Admiteddly, their salsa bar selections isn&apos;t as vast as one would desire, but you will definitely make do.

Sometimes reviews are hit or miss on yelp.  Everyone has different tastes and biases.  Sometimes I find places reviewed on the lower end of the scale, only to find out that it&apos;s a lot better than I expected.  Then, there are the times when people rant and rave about a place, but it doesn&apos;t live up to it.  This place is the latter.

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed.  I feel like the food lacks a lot of flavor, but hey maybe it&apos;s just me.  Parking is scarce and seating is as well.  I also felt patrons were eyeing me funny cause a person of my ethnicity shouldn&apos;t be in their local hole in the wall.  However, i suppose I would probably give the same glares if someone outside of my ethnic schema did the same.  I won&apos;t be back again.

CASH ONLY.  CASH ONLY.  CASH ONLY.  That matters a lot if you&apos;re like me and never visit the ATM...so come prepared. :)

I wasn&apos;t intending to try this restaurant when I did; I actually had my heart set on the Burrito Factory (which I&apos;d also never visited before) over on Woodley, but it turned out to be closed on a Sunday afternoon, so I headed over here.  I&apos;ve been meaning to try both places, so no harm no foul.

I thought their name on Yelp--&quot;Mexican Fast Food&quot;--was generic.  This place is hidden away in a tiny strip mall that I&apos;ve driven by probably thousands of times, with only an even more generic sign bearing the words &quot;Mexican Food&quot; to tell the world of its existence.

I had the carne asade burrito.  It came with chips, which weren&apos;t plentiful but which were OK.  The size of the burrito made up for the stingy serving of chips.  The carne was flavorful, but had a few more fatty chunks than I usually care for.  Still, it was a good, solid burrito, and the price was reasonable, so I didn&apos;t leave disappointed.

Service was also quick, despite them being fairly busy.  So bonus points there.  On the downside, the place felt a bit stuffy and ever so slightly grungy (though not for lack of trying--the staff were quick to clean up the tables, etc.).  I credit that to the place just being a bit old and tiring looking.  Seating isn&apos;t plentiful, and we thankfully managed to squeeze our butts into the last available booth.

Discovering this place won&apos;t keep me from visiting my other favorite Mexican haunts in the Valley, and based on this experience I wouldn&apos;t recommend it to friends ahead of some of the other hole-in-the-wall places I&apos;ve found...but I&apos;ll certainly be willing to stop by the next time I have a hankering for quick Mexican food when I&apos;m in the area.  I can&apos;t say for sure that you&apos;ll be amazed, but I&apos;m pretty certain most people won&apos;t leave disappointed.

I&apos;ve tried a few Mexican food places, taco trucks included, and of all the places I&apos;ve been so far, this one stands out as being most substandard.  I got the carne asada taco and burrito which came with some chips. The taco was okay - I didn&apos;t really like the steak flavour in its context. To me anyway, it tasted like steak that should&apos;ve been with rice and salad on the side, rather than in a taco.

I didn&apos;t like the carne asada burrito at all. Lettuce in tacos and burritos, I would expect from chain Mexican restaurants which also don&apos;t taste as authentic, so I was displeased to find it in this burrito! I also did not like the way the soggy lettuce and onions meshed with the burrito - it left a bad taste in my mouth and I regretfully threw away the last quarter of it because I could not bring myself to finish it (and no animal around to do it for me!).

The place was recommended to me too as being really really good, but I found it mediocre at best - I won&apos;t be coming back here.

The best Mexican food in town!  I live in panorama city which is like only 4-5 miles away and whenever I crave for burrito, this is the place! Lol, ambiance?.. who cares~ the food is awesome it&apos;s a must eat!  Got to love their huge burrito&apos;s and salsa&apos;s that are FREE not like other Mexican food/restaurant sucks bad and charges for salsa&apos;s.

Just a warning this place is always full so what I do all the time is I order by phone and then pick it up, it&apos;s always ready by 10-15minutes.

Parking is mostly always full because of other stores/shops.

Try it!

I&apos;ll keep my review as short and to the point as this fine establishment&apos;s name.

So close to getting 5 stars, but -1 for not having chunky salsa/pico de gallo at the salsa bar. Otherwise, the food is exactly what you&apos;d expect from a popular Mexican hole in the wall - cheap, filling, and delicious.

This is our go-to Mexican restaurant.
Their cheese enchilada, chile relleno combination plate is the thing I eat most often.  The enchilada sauce is insanely delicious, especially mixed in with the rice that comes on the side.  Great rice, the beans are average, but work with the meal.  They even put a little iceberg salad on the plate, so you can pretend that the food is slightly healthy.
The salsa bar is great.  The roasted jalapenos and onions are so spicy that I tear up when I eat them.  And you can never go wrong with spicy carrots.

My family loves their crispy beef tacos, carnitas, and cilantro chicken soup.

my family left me to fend for dinner by myself, so i thought it was a perfect opportunity to find a new place to eat!

after yelping for almost an hour, i decided on this place. pretty close to home, and i&apos;m always up for mexican.

there was no parking when i got there so i parked in the alley behind the strip mall. how shady. but it was well lit and it connects to a big street so i wasn&apos;t too worried.

walked inside and it was filled with people. good sign.

it was my first time so it took a while for me to look over the menu. i decided to go for the 2 combination plate with chile relleno and a carnitas taco. comes with rice, beans, and chips. cost me $6.90.

the salsa bar had two salsas (red and green), pickled jalapenos, and also roasted jalapenos! you don&apos;t see roasted jalapenos anywhere! but the roasted ones were a lil greasy. not something to pair if you already have greasy food. the salsas weren&apos;t spicy to me.

when i got home and opened the box, the first thing i noticed was the carnitas taco! it was huge! it&apos;s not one of those dinky ones from the taco trucks. it was probably 3x the size! loaded with meat too! the carnitas was a bit on the salty side, but i didn&apos;t mind it.

not much to say about the chile relleno. it was ok.

one thing i didn&apos;t like was that it came in the foam box with no compartments. i don&apos;t like certain foods touching. the chile relleno sauce was mixing with the beans and the rice and the bean juice was getting into my rice. and the taco was touching the chile relleno sauce too. (ok i think this paragraph makes me look like a weirdo, but this is for the weirdos like me).

Been my favorite mexican spot for years.  Great, fresh food and quality ingredients.  I love the carrots in the salsa bar.  I usually get the sopes but their burritos and taquitos are excellent, the taco/enchilada combo is solid, the tortas are flat out yummy and for a cold day the soups really hit the spot.  You definitely gotta try the Chicken Cilantro Soup if that sounds like your kind of thing.  Which it should be.

Great little spot.  The food is authentic, fresh, tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced.  The space is clean.  The clientele is predominantly Mexican.  So far I have enjoyed the sopes, tacos and burrito.  I will continue to frequent it as long as I&apos;m in GH.

Delicious! Two-dollar Tongue tacos all the way! I&apos;ve eaten here a couple times now and it has yet to disappoint. I tried the chicken tamale last time and despite ordering it ala cart I still got a big side of chips and fresh tomatoes and lettuce. Stop by for some tortilla soup and a taco: yum!

The place is actually called &quot;Mexican Food&quot;. Can you get any more simpler than that? Maybe &quot;Restaurant&quot;?

I&apos;ve been here twice, both times I ordered the carne asada burrito and once tried the carne asada tacos. Both were pretty good. A little dry, but squeeze some lime or put some salsa on it and that is fixed. The service is a bit slow, but I usually order, go next door to the liquor store for a 6 pack, load up on free salsa, sit for a minute or 2 then my order is up. Free chips and salsa come with your food. I&apos;ve never tried the soups, but I while I was waiting last time, I saw 4 people get two big containers to go, so it must be pretty good.

I have never eaten inside because it is cramped and I like beer with my Mexican food.

They only accept cash and the parking is very limited, you may have to go up the street or to the building next door if there is space.

The name says it all. I&apos;m giving this place five stars because it&apos;s exactly what you should expect from a hole in the wall Mexican food place- cheap, fast, great tasting food. Love their enormous burritos and their nachos- which are vegetarian and come fully loaded- enough for two easy. They also have a salsa bar where you can choose whatever you want into those little plastic containers which is good cause all their food comes with tortilla chips. The ambiance in the place is very plain- 5-6 booths and a couple tables, mostly single guys eating in, but they do a lot of take out. They also have great horchata and some other interesting sounded juices that I&apos;ve never tried cause I love horchata so much. Next time you drive down Balboa don&apos;t just drive past this place to go to Cabos across the street- stop here and you won&apos;t be sorry.

I&apos;m going to assume that most of the reviewers here haven&apos;t had any San Diego carne asada burritos. :) When I had the carne asada burrito at Mexican Fast Food, it just didn&apos;t compete with any Mexican restaurants in San Diego. The burrito here has rice beans, meat, lettuce, cilantro, tomatoes and onions...I think guacamule too. I liked the lettuce and other ingredients, but the meat was terrible. It wasn&apos;t fresh and I felt like I was eating the white fat that is usually cut off.

I do have to add that they had a winne the pooh accessory trinkets where you put in a quarter...it tempted me bit to get one, but i didn&apos;t. ^u^

I don&apos;t think I will be coming here again which makes me continue my journey to find a hearty carne asada in the valley.

Went here to pick up chicken soup for someone who was sick. They swear by the soup and said it is the best in the Valley. If I were not a vegetarian I would have eaten it. It looked AMAZING and smelled phenomenal. He said it was FANTASTIC and I believe him. I don&apos;t think they had one vegetarian item on the menu, but no biggie I grabbed a salad at Trader Joe&apos;s.

This is one of my favorite mexican food place in the valley. I love the shedded beef in everything. I&apos;ve been coming here for about 10 - 15 years and I have never got anything i didnt like or love for that matter.  love the salsa bar and they not look at you funny when you take a large amount.  The one doen fall for me is that sometimes it takes 30 - 45 mins to get your food. ok now i am craving the shedded beef  tacos i guess i know what i am having for dinner tonight.

I love places like this!  But, what I love even more is the simple inconspicuous name this place has -- direct and the to point!  Rather than ordering something I usually get at other Mexican restaurants, I decided to go with an audible and order something from their specials menu.  Ordering the Camarones empanizados como papas y ensalada, or Shrimp platter with fries and salad -- was well worth the possible disappointment.  This meal was far from disappointment!  A plate full of battered and fried shrimp over a bed of french fries, served with a salad on the side.  The staff is super friendly and doesn&apos;t mind your large group of 8 people taking over half of the restaurant for up to 3 hours sitting -- eating, chatting and what not.

DEFINITELY of my most favorite Mexican restaurants. Its a small location and there is not very many sea ting, but their crispy shredded beef tacos are REALLY great. i would also recommend their enchiladas and their sopes. One of the best FLANS Ive ever had. Their service is great and they are always very friendly. The only DOWN side of this place is the parking and its CASH only. Def my favorite!!!!

I have to say I don&apos;t understand what everyone is raving about. I will say that the service was decent and the place was relatively clean. I ordered a carne asada burrito and was a little dissapointed at the quality of the meat. It was very tough and seemed old. Everything else on the burrito was tasty and fresh, just the meat was a little funky. With so many other local choices, I don&apos;t understand why this place is rated so high. It&apos;s mediocre at best.

Granada Hills&apos; best kept Mexican food joint.  The taquitos are great and so are their Albondigas Soup.  The beans are made with chorizo and are delicious.  We eat here any time we can.  The place is small and always busy but worth the wait.  The burritos come with lettuce (I tell request this be left off) but they are delicious.

A place so good they don&apos;t even need to come up with an original name.

Starting with 5 stars...

+1: The cilantro soup (with shredded chicken, avocado, cilantro and celery) was very good.  I never would have thought to put soft cubes of avocado into soup!

-1: I also had the carne asada, which I found to be rather dry.

+1: The food is made fresh: They included fresh lettuce, tomato, beans and slices of avocado - wish it included sour cream, too.

-1: Maybe carne asada wasn&apos;t the best thing to order, but they only included 2 tortillas with the order, which is not enough to fit all the food - I ended up having to eat the rest alone since I didn&apos;t have any tortillas laying around.

-1: My friend wanted to get their jalapenos, but when she asked for a container the cashier pointed at these little containers about half the size of the jalapenos.  Then she gave my friend this look like &quot;What?&quot; when it was obvious that the jalapenos could not fit into those little salsa containers.

So what does that leave me with?  5 STARS +1-1+1-1-1= 4.

It&apos;s a decent place for Mexican
