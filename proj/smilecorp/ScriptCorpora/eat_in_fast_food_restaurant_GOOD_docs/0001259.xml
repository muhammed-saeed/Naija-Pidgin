To begin, bedroom has been dead since our last daughter was born four years ago. I used to try and initiate sex but my wife continually had excuses. It was a trying time for us when our youngest daughter was born, as our oldest daughter got sick (and made a full recovery thankfully) and was hospitalized for nearly a month soon after the birth. I know this was hard on my wife as we had to visit a few hospitals in larger centres for care. (we live in Northern Ontario). It was hard on me too, but I made sure to be the rock for our family.
My wife started gaining weight after that, and eventually went on anti-depressants. She came off them a little bit later on my advice, when I recommended that she join a weight loss centre and a gym and do some things naturally to make herself feel better. Ive always been supportive of her.
After two years of very little sex, I found myself not even trying to initiate any more, and that seemed to be okay with my wife. She always found a reason to not feel well, or to go to bed early, or to stay with the kids in their room when they woke in the middle of the night as they needed her. I talked to her about that not being good for the kids or our marriage but it fell on deaf ears.
Then I just quit coming to bed, finding things to do late at night and porn. Weve maybe had sex 6 times in the last three years. Our lives got busier, and we barley spoke to each other at all other than being with the kids. Weve always been very family oriented, we keep our kids busy and she really is a great mom.
Anyway, she has lost quite a bit of weight and I could tell she was feeling better about herself. It was around that time last year she started going on weekend trips with her girlfriends to Michigan (we live on a border town). Ive always supported her in this knowing that she needed some time to herself too as she has been supportive of my activities.
In the last month, theyve been to Michigan twice. This weekend is a holiday weekend coming up and I was looking forward to finally spending some time with my wife as we had nothing planned for a change. On Monday she tells me they are planning another trip to Michigan to celebrate on of her friends birthdays. All of a sudden my Spider Sense starts to tingle.
Her suitcase hasnt even been unpacked yet since her first trip in April and my curiosity got the best of me and I looked through it yesterday. I was surprised to find lingerie, frilly panties and very sexy tops; things she never wears for me. Then I went through her drawers, I knew it was wrong but this didnt sit well with me.
In her top drawer at the bottom I found some American cash she had stashed away. This was surprising too has we have never hid money from each other as far as I knew. I counted the money, nearly $700 and, a phone number on a piece of paper that wasnt her handwriting. It was a mid-Michigan area code and google tells me its a cell phone number. I started to tremble, but I wrote the number down and put the piece of paper back in her drawer.
I Skyped the number so it would show up as unknown number, and of course a man picks up. I tell him its a wrong number.
Now things start to fall into place, of the time she has spent texting on her phone in the last two weeks (something she rarely does), quickly putting it away when I walk into the room. One time last week I came to bed, and she got up, went to the washroom for a bit and then went to sleep in the kids room with her phone.
So last night I tried to make excuses to see her phone at the kids baseball practice. I knew she had it with her, but she quickly told me she forgot it had home. Then I tell her when we get home I wanted to update the OS of our phones and she finally gives in. Again, I shouldnt have, but I went though her text history quickly when she wasnt around and it was blank nothing there. This is a person that usually had 500 emails and texts saved on her phone because she doesnt clear her inboxes. I sent a text to the number just asking if he was there and didnt get a response back.
When I came back upstairs. She asked me if something was wrong. I told her I was upset about her going away again to Michigan. I wasnt ready to tip my hand about what I knew yet.
I asked her if everything was okay with us. Ironically, we had a long talk. I never brought up what I knew about the lingerie or the phone number as Im confused and want to keep the upper hand in this. It was the best talk we had in a long time and she told me how much she misses me and that we dont spend enough time together and that we need more us time. She even asked me to go to bed to have sex. I stupidly did and it was the best sex weve had in a long time. I was angry and part of me was thinking that Im going to gets some at least in case Im kicking out the door next week.
I think she beginning to suspects that I may be on to her. So, this morning, getting ready to go to work, I took that number our of her drawer again and wrote I know about this and I love you on it. Really, I dont know what to do next. Lingerie, a phone number, hidden money and trips out of town dont prove anything, but things certainly dont look good for her. I dont know if shes already cheated on me, or if shes about to cheat on me and theres still time to stop this.
My goal is to stay calm, and work this out logically, but my stomach is in butterflies. I would never have thought this could happen to us, people tell me all the time what a great couple we are. She always been a great mother, and this is totally out of character for her. I dont know if I just need to vent, or if Im looking for advice, but thanks for listening.

Here&apos;s what I did: We fed an old oil burner and average of 664 gallons a year for five years before taking advantage of a substantial local utility rebate for insulating. After cellulose was blown in, the next five years averaged 472 gallons per year. That&apos;s a savings of 29.8% and at $3 gallons for oil saved $3474. We paid about 2.5k for insulation, and it was tax deductible.This year we took advantage of an oil to gas conversion promo. I would have expected oil to cost $924 so far this year, adjusted for a warm winter. So far, we&apos;ve spent $327 on gas. The new system cost 6k when all&apos;s said and done.Not too shabby. Tags: saving   lot   money   heating   old   house   New   England   Heres   what   did   Hypothetical Exercise: Creating a Bank So, the entire OWS movement has a lot of resentment towards banks, to say the least. While the major banks did receive bailout funds, even though some did not want them, I don&apos;t place the blame in these banks. I see a problem with the Fed and fractional reserves that have the opportunity to take any outcome to a greater magnitude... profit=profit^5, loss=loss^5.So, my thought is, what would it take to start a bank and have the ability to borrow from the Fed and take advantage of the fractional reserve system? Take $30k of your own money and start a bank... then make a mortgage to yourself for $150k. Or do it as a group. Is anyone familiar with this level of banking? What would it take to be recognized by the Fed?Any other situations where this would make sense or where benefit could be had?

LINKIf you are used to eating potato chips while working on the computer, but are too lazy to wipe off your grease-strained fingers, Potechi Hand will put an end to your dilemma.This plastic hand is especially designed to pick up potato chips. It may look like a toy at first glance, but it is actually a carefully designed gadget. The device has an integrated No Broken Clutch System (NBCS) that allows it to pick up fragile potato chips using just the right amount of pressure. Thanks to this you can pick up large or small potato chips without breaking them.But the salt on the potato chips also gets all over the Potechi Hand. In order to solve this problem, the Potechi Hand includes an Finger Easy Cleaning System (FECS). When you turn this feature on, the index finger and thumb of the hand moves to rub off the salt. Although, you can also rinse the hand off with a bit of water instead.

Gas company wants $35,000 to extend the main down my street...Recently I&apos;ve noticed electric rates have been falling pretty substantially, probably due to natural gas being so cheap right now. But it&apos;s opened my mind to thoughts about using electricity for heat. 1 KWH produces 3412 BTU of heat. At my current electric rate (inclusive of all costs) of $0.12, this comes out to $3.52 per 100,000 BTU (1 therm). Resistive electric heat is 100% efficient as none of it is sent outside as exhaust, like other heating fuels. Compared to oil heat, where my boiler probably averages 80% efficiency: $3.42 per gallon (currently) X 1.39 (therm/gallon) X .80 (efficiency) = $3.80 per 100,000 BTU of heat inside the house.So right now it&apos;s actually more cost effective to heat the entire house with space heaters than it is to burn heating oil, never mind that I can more effectively heat only the occupied areas of the house more easily with space heaters and gain efficiency that way.I&apos;m wondering if others can chime in with real calculations of their cost per 100,000 BTU for other heating fuels. I&apos;m particularly curious how propane and pellets are fairing this winter.Editted to correct inverted (therm/gallon) Tags: Heating   fuel   pricing   for   20112012   season   Free gift pack ($5 value,) photo and coupons ($10 value) for trick-or-treating at CVS 10/23 Join us on Sunday, October 23 for our 2011 Halloween Party and Customer Event!

The winner of the 12-minute all-you-can-eat event will take home the lions share of a $10,000 cash purse. The event will take place prior to the last game of the Dallas Mavericks regular season Dallas Mavericks vs. New Orleans Hornets. The contest will feature 12 15 competitors, including: Joey Chestnut: Number-one ranked Chestnut has consumed 182 wings in 30 minutes in competition, and won his fourth consecutive hot dog eating title last July 4th in Coney Island, New York. He now looks to add another Major League Eating title to his legendary body of work. Sonya The Black Widow Thomas: Looking to beat Chestnut will be number-four-ranked Thomas a 100-pound wing-eating specialist from Alexandria, Va. Thomas will have confidence on her side in Dallas, having won four consecutive titles at the National Buffalo Wing Festival (2007-10). Last year she topped Chestnut and a field of 12 other men in Buffalo, N.Y. Pat Deep Dish Bertoletti: The number-two ranked eater in the world, Bertoletti, a mohawked chef from Chicago, holds world records in 29 foods including grits, ice cream and jalapenos.
Bob Shoudt: Ranked number-three-in the world, Shoudt, who hails from the suburbs of Philadelphia, was formerly known as Humble Bob before embarking on an eight-contest winning streak that resulted in a moniker change to The Notorious B.O.B. Wings have surged to the top of every sports fans list of favorite foods and competitive eaters are no different, said George Shea, chairman of Major League Eating. Few other foods on the circuit test a competitors hand speed, technique and capacity more than wings. These skills will be on display in Dallas when the worlds best eaters pay homage to the mighty wing.Previously scheduled to take place in advance of the Super Bowl, the contest was postponed due to a snowstorm that hit Dallas in early February. Wingstop, which sold more than five million wings on Super Bowl Sunday, will prepare more than 1,000 wings for competitors on Wednesday evening.The 12-minute contest will take place from AT&amp;T;Plaza at American Airlines Center prior to the final home game of the Dallas Mavericks regular season. The winner will take home the first-place prize of $5,000. The remaining second through six place payouts are as follows: $2,000, $1,500, $750, $500, $250.Additionally, Wingstop will sample wings for attendees from the contest area, and giveaways and other prizes will be on-hand for the crowd.

This is a business case involving the purchase of running franchise. We believe the seller cheated on us by withholding some information on his negotiations with the landlord. The money at stake is about $75K. Can some one recommend a lawyer, who can work on a contigency basis in HOUSTON, TX ? We had consultation with one lawyer, who was quite positive that we have a good case for a lawsuit against the seller, but couldn&apos;t get workable references from him.
More details: Basically, we were asked to vacate the place (by the landlord, as per a clause in the lease agreement saying the landlord can terminate the lease with a 90 day notice) immediately after buying a running franchise. It turns out that (as we learned later), the landlord has been suggesting the same to the previous owner, who did not share this info with us. Since the lease was signed by the franshisor (and not us, the franchisee), we did not bother to talk to the landlord in detail, before making the purchase.

Do I leave my heat on the whole day or do I shut it off and then turn it on when I get home, I&apos;ve read it&apos;s cheaper to keep it at 66 during the day and then up to the tempearture when I&apos;m home (69), then shut it off and when I come home turn it on to 69?Second question. when I run my central air in the summer should I open the windows in my attic? or keep them closed? i&apos;ve heard to open them to let the heat out but I feel if I have the windows in the house closed then I should have the attic ones closed as well.thanks I live in Connecticut. Tags: Saving   Money   Heating   Bill   and   Central   air   What&apos;s the FW way when it comes to heating? Curious to what people&apos;s take on winter heating...I am fairly frugal. I keep my house&apos;s temperature very low, and if it is too cold, I use a space heater in the room where I am.However, in my frugality, I am even trying to find out what the best FW way is to heat a decent size room. The space heater draws quite a lot of electricity, and its area of effectiveness is usually very small.There are some products out there that claim to work well (note the word &apos;claim&apos;):e.g.
Solar Comfort (sure advertise a lot) http://www.solarcomfortheat.com/HowItWorks.html
Solar Window Heater - who wouldn&apos;t want free heat, http://www.solarwindowheaters.com/shop/and then even for space heaters, there are the radiant heater, the oil ones, ones with fans, etc. Curious to see:1) whether anyone has tried any alternative products like above and can comment on them?
2) whether anyone has a great space heater to recommend that is very efficient (they all draw a lot of power, but there has to be more efficient and safe models out there)?or you can just laugh at my frugality.

I contacted the listing agent on 12/2 via his webpage with my details and asking to arrange a visit.
The next day I called him on his cell and left a message.
The following day I called his office and they sent me over to another agent.
He promised me to get back and called me next day saying a tenant lives there and nobody can see it for some time per the owner.
I kept following up about 3 times since 12/6 through last friday 12/17 being the last active contact with this other agent and kept hearing the same thing that we are working on arranging the visit. I have email chain to support my records from the other agent.
On saturday 12/18, I noticed an offer was accepted on the property and I thought I was being BS the whole time. The other agent also said he was very upset and probably that either the owner or listing agent is trying push someone he prefers to get the property.
I called the original listing agent right away and left a strong message.
He called me a bit later in the afternoon basically saying I am sorry, my hands are tied an offer is accepted now etc.
When I suggested I will take some action here and contact appropriate agency and complain he agreed to arrange a showing today and asked
the details about the other agent in his office.
This morning they both are singing a different tune basically suggesting we can&apos;t do much. It is a done deal and illegal to take up two offers on a short sale and they would contact me if the property comes back to market. They say it just happened this way and had problems with arrangement of showing the place all along.
The property is really offered at a great discount well below zillow and my estimate of what it should be worth right now. It seems really a great price considering the description, photos, upgrade list and the area is a very desirable location in my area and I think it is a great offer if it works out near or even about 10% more of asking price.My concerns are
1. Even if the current offer does not work, bank will counter it and the person who is making that offer gets a chance to take it.
2. I think the owner with this help from agent is trying to buy it back through friends or the agent is using a contact to buy it as an investment property.Is there anything that I can do here? I am really feeling cheated and frustrated.Pl comment on my options and your thoughts/suggestions.Thanks!

I found an old thread on finance tips for a divorce written on the perspetive of a man. How about something for the ladies Suppose one spouse is cheating and a divorce is going to occur. Im writing for a friend BTW. Married 20 years, stay at home wife, no kids but took VERY good care of the house, constantly making sure everything was tidy and organized, handled hiring a maid and replacement maids every few years. Purchasing new furnishings every few years. Basically keeping the house really perfect.So the husband is always busy at work, constantly going to what he calls meetings and conferences but who really knows where he is going?? After 20 years of this she has enough and started an affair with someone who really knows how to treat a lady as she needs to be treated. Now I think he found out and my friend may be getting a divorce. Theres no prenup but my other friend said that my friends husband was talking to different divorce lawyers ALL around town. I read in the other thread that this is what guys do when they want to get a divorced. Also I found someone following me that I think is a private detective trying to take pics of me with the new guy. He was in an unmarked grey car, always wearing dark sunglasses and seems to be the same guy all the time at different places!Should my friend start putting money away for this? Start talking to lawyers? What if she talks to a lawyer my husband already talked to? Will the lawyer tell him or is it a secret?So come on ladies, lets start a thread of our own here so we can discuss this from OUR side of the table.

The boiler is in good shape so I&apos;m not going to be pushing the gas company to come down the street just yet (the main is approx 400 feet from my house). I&apos;ve never had oil heat before but best I can tell it&apos;s a huge pain. Seems that regular cleaning and maintenance is required unlike gas heating. I intend to eventually do this service myself but I&apos;ll probably watch a pro do it once first to see what&apos;s involved.The day we moved in, 3 different heating oil delivery salesmen showed up in the driveway to drop off information. I guess they check public records every day to drum up new business. All were addressed to my wife, which raises red flags for me (it&apos;s easier to sell to women). I&apos;ve got half a tank left and it&apos;s summer so I&apos;ve got plenty of time to figure this out.I fully expect I&apos;m going to be offered a variety of &quot;contracts.&quot; Just like cell phone contracts, I fully expect these &quot;contracts&quot; to be a way to lock you into crappy service. So some questions:1. I believe there is an inherent conflict in interest from having your boiler serviced by the guy who sells you the fuel, what interest does he have in making it operate at peak efficiency if this actually causes him to lose money from selling less oil? Is it worth having the oil company do maintenance on your boiler or is better to have an independent boiler/HVAC person do the service?2. Price locking/prebuying/etc. Effectively having the oil company buys futures contracts on your behalf. Because of the effect of contango, the price of oil for future delivery is nearly always higher than the current price. In effect, it would be virtually impossible to come out ahead in the long run with a price lock or prebuy. That said, heating oil delivery company&apos;s may need cashflow and may sell below market to get it, so in this respect you might be able to come out ahead.My conclusion so far is unless the cashflow issue has a real effect on the market that the best deal is to have my boiler independently serviced and to get will call/COD delivery from the cheapest source when needed.So, I&apos;m looking for people with real experience that have actually run the numbers. Not, &quot;I locked at $2.29 because it seems like a good price.&quot; Tags: Heating   oil   the   Fatwallet   way   Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food (Spiral-bound) $5 at Kohls Kohls has the following book for $5: Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food (Spiral-bound)it is $10 at Amazon.
