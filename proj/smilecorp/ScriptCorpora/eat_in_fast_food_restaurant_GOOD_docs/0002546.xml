NOTRE DAME SIGNS CHARLIE WEIS TO 300 YEAR CONTRACT
EXTENSION

SOUTH BEND, IND (AP)--Notre Dame Athletic Director Kevin White announced the signing of a contract extension to head football coach Charlie Weis this morning, inking the third year head coach to an unprecedented three hundred year contract extension worth an estimated 1.4 billion dollars in salary and benefits.

&quot;We&apos;re pleased to announce that Notre Dame again stands at the forefront of college football by making sure we keep not only the future secure, but the future of the future of this football program in the right direction by making sure Coach Weis will be around for centuries to come,&quot; said White, who spoke from the podium wearing a blue and gold jumpsuit.

&quot;0-3 means nothing to us. Excellence is what matters, and that&apos;s a long term goal. We&apos;re here to show our commitment to it.&quot;
 Notre Dame Football Coach: 2047 Projection. 
Weis, whose Notre Dame team is riding a five game losing streak and the first 0-3 start in school history, answered skeptical questions about the viability of a deal that not only endorses a coach whose team remains in dire straits, but also seems to defy the laws of mortality itself.

&quot;Kevin and I have talked about it, and you know what? We&apos;re not gonna talk about the future right now. That&apos;s what contract negotiations are for. We&apos;ve reopened training camp. We&apos;re not rebuilding. I&apos;m not gonna talk about that. I&apos;m not. It&apos;s just nice to have that vote of confidence going into training camp again.&quot;

White took the brunt of the skepticism and addressed concerns specifically. For instance, how would Weis, already 51 and overweight, live to fulfill a contract exceeding not only his expected lifespan, but that of any already born?

Technology, says White, pure and simple. &quot;People don&apos;t just come here for the outstanding athletics, spiritual focus, or beautiful campus. They come here for a first rate, 21st century education,&quot; said White. &quot;And that includes technology.&quot;

&quot;We&apos;ll be ready for the failure of Charlie&apos;s organs, which will be replaced with new ones grown from existing, ethically provided stem cell lines provided by Charlie later today. When the replacement strategy proves untenable, Charlie has agreed to have his head severed from his body and placed in a life-sustaining jar filled with a nutritious, oxygen-rich syrup sustaining him for what our scientists predict will be a span of at least 120 years following his removal from the proto-body.&quot;

At that point, White explained, they would have to figure something out. &quot;But by then, we&apos;re assured of three things. One, that Coach Weis will have this program thriving into his second century of rule. Two, that our investment now will have paid off double or perhaps triple, even with the projected rise of the Mer-people in 2108. And three, that we will have at least partially recovered from the recruiting shortfalls some people have left behind.&quot;

White paused, and then corrected himself. &quot;And by some people, I mean Ty Willingham, his name be cursed.&quot;
 Notre Dame Football Coach: 2168 A.D. Projection. 
White also pooh-poohed suggestions he had fielded what Mark May called &quot;the dumbest fucking contract I have ever seen--pardon my fucking language, ESPN, fire me if you will, but this is seriously the dumbest fucking thing I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot;

&quot;We&apos;ve done the forecasting, people. Sure, there&apos;s flexibility. The recruits of tomorrow will be different. So will the game. But there is one and only one answer for this: Charlie Weis. He&apos;ll be able to relate to the gill-bearing wideouts of 2214, as well as be able to cope with the predicted introduction of energy weapons into gameplay in the mid-2160s. And most importantly, he&apos;s got a commitment to his players, be they the anticipated cyclopic nuclear mutantbeasts from the Varragaraz Neutral Zone of No Return in 2245, the highly aware cyborg running backs from the Great Metallization of 2084, or the Vandal Jackalmen of the 2165 Gatorade Insurrection.&quot;

White smiled, turned to Weis, and nodded with a smile. &quot;He&apos;s our man. Not forever, of course&quot;--the room broke into laughter at this point--&quot;But at least for the next 300 years!&quot;

Weis testily summed up his feelings after a barrage of questions by saying, &quot;I&apos;m not thinking about life-support jars, bionic hearts, or transposing my neural fingerprint onto a chip for all eternity. All I&apos;m thinking about is Michigan State next week--and how I&apos;m gonna work flying mutants into the gameplan for that matchup versus Flextron Robot Sex Academy in 2093. Believe me, that&apos;s the real challenge here!&quot;

 Illustrations: the awesome J-Money of Ladies... and Keep Your Receipt . Much thanks.

Thank you!

One factor that could be slowing down this Irish this year is sideline communications. The laminated spreadsheet Weis has in his hands during the game is a compilation of local fast food restaurant menus and phone numbers. Heavy cell phone use at stadiums during game time can cause problems.

ALong with the contract extension for Charlie Weis, they also have frozen the sperm of all of the Clausen family, to provide for quarterbacks for the entire term of the Weis regime.

So no chance of Weis being at Notre Dame in the year 3000 when the Space Pope is Reptilian? But he will still be at Notre Dame when Zefram Cochrane makes First Contact in 2063. Football will be very scary in the future when Klingons and Romulans face off against each other with Kirk and Picard coaching on the sidelines with Vulcan coordinators. It will become really scary when the Borg field their first team in The Federation BCS. Both Paterno and Bowden will still be on the sidelines of PSU and FSU.

Orson, bra-fricking-vo!

To be honest, I personally think the 300 year extension is completely logical. I mean based on the results on the field so far this season, that’s about how long its going to take Charlie to field a MNC-caliber team.

Plus, that quote from Mark May of all people was pure genius. Its posts like this that remind me why EDSBS is the greatest CFB site on the Internets.

Orson: 300 years of cocktails and virgins to you, sir. I hope you win a Pulitzer, and Emmy, and an Oscar for this. And a Teen Choice award (rad!).

And PS, Mark May would still find a way to be wrong about this somehow. The guy is an enigma, along with Pat“I do my research by reading blogs”Forde at the WWL. Speaking of, what will become of tESPN in 300 years? And will Berman still be annoying and wearing ties from Vineyard Vines?

ND is pitiful this year–as an alum it really stings. But, as a lifelong Atlanta resident I am perfectly suited for this–following the Braves in the 1980’s (God bless Dale Murphy, the only player we had for 10 years), the Falcons (Gritz Blitz my ass), and the Flames–who had to leave town to win anything.

I agree with Expat Ohioan–we take our medicine and it’s very funny. But I have to admit I was praying to“tiny baby Jesus”ferverently Saturday that Ohio State would demolish Washington. So many people were just loaded up and ready to spew the Ty nonsense. At least we won’t have to hear that this week.

Charlie is just spreading the love whereever he goes.

Hugh Millen (former Huskie and New England Patriot) is on the radio here, and said Weiss is the worst human being he has ever met. The story he told of his meeting with Weiss earlier this year was great no holds barred type stuff. I’ll see if there is a podcast of it somewhere…

Worse than Jimmy Clausen, really?

For the record, Weis (sorry the misspelling previously, I should try harder), never coached Millen. Maybe if he had, some of that“genius”would have rubbed off, or something. I’m just sayin’.
