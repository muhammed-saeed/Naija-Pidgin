 FAST FOOD. What is termed &quot;fast food&quot; in the United
States today most commonly consists of hot, freshly prepared, and
wrapped food items, served to customers across a counter or through
a drive-up window. Known as both &quot;fast food&quot; and &quot;quick-service
food&quot; in the restaurant industry, these items are routinely sold
and delivered in an amount of time ranging from a few seconds to
several minutes; they now vary widely in food type, encompassing
virtually all kinds of meats, preparation methods, and ethnic
cuisines. Inexpensive hamburgers and french fried potatoes are
still the products most readily identified as fast food, but the
list of items sold in the format continually increases. Fried fish
and shellfish, hot dogs, chicken, pizza, roast beef, and pasta are
commonly sold at quick-service outlets. In addition to these
staples, many quick-service restaurants sell a broad menu of
Americanized Mexican, Greek, and Chinese foods. Some fast-food
outlets offer specialty items, such as sushi, clams, or ribs, and
others even sell complete &quot;home-cooked&quot; meals over their counters.
Though menus and delivery formats vary greatly, fast food&apos;s chief
common denominators include immediate customer service, packaging
&quot;to go,&quot; and inexpensive pricing.

The precise origins of fast food are vague, probably predating
written history. Hungry people are as old as civilization itself,
as are entrepreneurs eager to satisfy their hunger. Food vendors in
ancient cities sold prepared items to passersby on the street. The
actual foods varied greatly, depending on period and culture, but
they generally comprised simple, inexpensive fare sold to people of
modest means.

Immigrants brought a variety of food styles to America, often
preserving these for decades as a comforting connection with their
ethnic past. Though many immigrant foodways were elaborate and
ritualistic, most groups had one or two simple items that they
consumed on a daily basis. As a rule, immigrant groups preferred
their indigenous grains: corn from the Americas, rice from Asia,
and wheat from Europe. Often these served as the basis for the
&quot;peasant&quot; foods of their homelands. Pasta and flat breads came over
with Italians; tortillas, beans, and tamales arrived with
northbound Mexicans; and Germans brought dark breads, along with a
variety of fatty sausages (which later mutated into the hot dog).
Asian immigrants continued to eat rice as the basis of their
diet.

In the early twentieth century fast food remained primarily the
fare of the masses. Vendors wheeled their pushcarts daily to
factory gates, selling their wares to hungry workers. Often
catering to the tastes of the particular factory&apos;s dominant ethnic
group, they charged customers pennies for basic items such as
sausages, meatballs, or stew. Though popular among male industrial
workers, this pushcart version of fast food never became mainstream
cuisine.

The urban diner was the transitional phase between the vendor&apos;s
pushcart and modern fast food. Most early diners were small
restaurants, with limited seating, sometimes constructed out of
converted railway carriages or streetcars. They served simple foods
to working-class customers on a &quot;short-order&quot; basis, usually
cooking each meal individually when ordered. Menus varied, but
fried foods were common. Though diners often emphasized speed in
delivering food, customers routinely lingered before and after
eating.

The hamburger still stands out as the single most important
American fast food, though the precise origin of this meat sandwich
is the subject of historical disagreement. People have eaten
chopped beef throughout the ages, and it was long a fixture in many
world cultures. The lineage of the American hamburger seems to
point directly, as its name indicates, back to the German city of
Hamburg. First appearing on American restaurant menus in the
mid-nineteenth century, ground beef patties bore the title &quot;hamburg
steak.&quot; By the century&apos;s close, vendors regularly sold meatballs
wrapped in slices of bread at county fairs and summer festivals.
Regional legends attribute the invention of this snack to several
different individuals, but its true originator remains a
mystery.
 
The Rise of Modern Fast Food
Our modern image of the fast-food restaurant dates back to 1916,
when Walt Anderson began selling &quot;hamburger sandwiches&quot; from an
outdoor stand on a Wichita street corner. Anderson simply flattened
a meatball and placed it between two halves of a bun. His sandwich
quickly became popular, attracting long lines of hungry buyers. By
1921, Anderson had joined local insurance broker Edgar &quot;Billy&quot;
Ingram to form the White Castle System. After opening several
identical restaurants in Wichita during their first year, the
partners quickly spread their business to neighboring cities, then
to nine major urban areas throughout the Midwest and on the East
Coast. What separated the White Castle System from earlier
short-order restaurants was its very streamlined menu, comprising
only hamburgers, coffee, Coca-Cola, and pie; a uniform
architectural style; and strict standardization of food quality,
preparation methods, and employee performance. By the close of the
1920s, White Castle&apos;s Fast foods have generated their
own type of architecture. To attract attention and customers, some
buildings were quite whimsical, like this 1930s hot dog stand. Â© CORBIS-BETTMANN . aggressive marketing and rapid spread had made the hamburger one of
the most popular foods in America.
Other entrepreneurs soon noticed White Castle&apos;s success in the
hamburger business. Very closely copying White Castle&apos;s products,
architecture, and company name, competing new chains also thrived,
carrying the hamburger craze across the nation to smaller cities
and towns. The White Tower chain appeared in 1925, eventually
challenging White Castle&apos;s dominance in several northern cities.
Krystal&apos;s, opened in 1929 in Chattanooga, soon became the hamburger
powerhouse of the southeastern states. White Castle&apos;s hamburger
sandwich, along with its many imitators, became a daily staple for
many working-class Americans. It proved so successful, in fact,
that by 1930 the president of the American Restaurant Association
identified the fast-food hamburger as the most important food item
in the nation.

Hamburgers became even more a mainstream food during the 1930s.
The larger restaurant chains began marketing their products to
middle-class buyers, and even more Americans became burger lovers.
Despite the harsh economy of the Great Depression, most fast-food
chains continued to thrive, and in many cases grew considerably.
Most continued selling the White Castletyle hamburger, but late
in the decade the Big Boy chain spread east from California,
introducing its new double-decker hamburger sandwich along the way.
By the end of the Depression, America was a solidly
hamburger-eating culture.

After prospering in the Depression, however, the fast-food
industry suffered a serious setback during World War II. Shortages
of necessary foodstuffs, such as meat, sugar, tomatoes, and coffee,
meant limited menu offerings and often a significant loss of
business. Attempting to continue providing meals to their
customers, fast-food restaurants experimented with different items
that were still in abundance, including soy patties, chili, and
french fried potatoes. Even more damaging than commodity shortages
was the very low unemployment rate, which meant that most workers
bypassed the restaurant industry in favor of higher-paying work.
Adjusting to this labor shortage, chains soon replaced their
all-male workforce with women and teenagers, two groups who would
become their most common employees. Despite attempts to find
palatable alternative foods, and despite the shifts in workforce,
much of the fast-food industry was a casualty of the war; by 1945,
more than half of America&apos;s restaurants had closed down, including
several of the major fast-food chains.

Rebuilding the fast-food industry after the war proved a slow
process. No single chain emerged to claim dominance, and little
innovation occurred. Individual companies struggled to restore
their prewar prosperity, and new regional chains tried to gain a
foothold. Suffering the effects of escalating costs and still under
the threat of continued shortages due to unstable food supplies in
war-torn countries, fast-food restaurants often had to double
prices to remain in business.

As population shifted from America&apos;s cities to suburbia during
the 1950s, the fast-food industry quickly followed. Early chains
such as White Castle and White Tower, resisting moving to the
suburbs, were quickly eclipsed by upstart franchised chains. Burger
King and McDonald&apos;s outlets became common fixtures at suburban
crossroads, selling burgers, fries, and shakes to hungry families.
Burger King&apos;s Jim McLamore and McDonald&apos;s Ray Kroc each sought to
build one of his restaurants in every American town, and they
opened hundreds of new Burger Kings and McDonald&apos;s each year in the
1960s. To accomplish this rapid expansion, they relied heavily on
franchise investors, enforced strict product uniformity throughout
their chains, and aggressively advertised in every newly opened
territory. With McDonald&apos;s and Burger King&apos;s success, Burger Chef
outlets soon appeared nearby. Arby&apos;s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and
Taco Bell were not far behind. By the late 1960s, fast food no
longer meant just hamburger restaurants, but had diversified to
include quick-service pizza, roast beef, chicken, and tacos. To
give an idea of the dimensions to which the fast-food industry has
grown, in 1999 Americans consumed over 26 billion pounds of beef,
much of it as hamburgers. In that year McDonald&apos;s alone had more
than ten thousand restaurants in the United States, from which it
grossed in excess of $13 billion in revenue.
 
Criticism of Fast Food

Despite the widespread popularity of fast food in modern
American culture, critics abound. Since the 1930s, articles and
books have condemned the industry, exposing allegedly poor sanitary
conditions, unhealthy food products, related environmental
problems, and unfair working conditions. Whether it warrants the
attention or not, the fast-food industry is still regularly cited
for exploiting young workers, polluting, and contributing to
obesity and other serious health problems among American consumers.
American beef consumption, and more specifically the fast-food
hamburger industry, is often blamed for the burning of the Amazon
rain forests to make way for more grazing lands for beef cattle.
Early foes of fast food cited the deplorable filth of many
hamburger stands, in addition to claiming that the beef ground for
their sandwiches was either spoiled, diseased, or simply of low
quality. In fact, many critics maintained that much of the meat
used in fast-food hamburgers came from horse carcasses. The high
fat content of fast food was also controversial. Despite deceptive
industry claims about the high quality and the health benefits of
their products, in the 1920s and 1930s concerned nutritionists
warned the public about the medical dangers of regular burger
consumption. This distrust and criticism of fast food continue
today, extending even further to include dire warnings about the
industry&apos;s use of genetically modified and antibiotic-laden beef
products. Most major chains have responded to recent attacks by
prominently posting calorie and nutritional charts in their
restaurants, advertising fresh ingredients, and offering
alternatives to their fried foods. Despite a few more
health-conscious items on the menu, fast-food chains now
aggressively advertise the concept that bigger is better, offering
large &quot;super-size&quot; or &quot;biggie&quot; portions of french fries, soft
drinks, and milkshakes. Critics point to this marketing emphasis as
a reason for an excessive and greatly increasing per-capita caloric
intake among fast-food consumers, resulting in fast-growing rates
of obesity in the United States.

Increased litter is another problem that critics have blamed on
the fast-food industry. Selling their products in paper wrappings
and paper bags, early outlets created a source of litter that had
not previously existed. Wrappers strewn about city streets,
especially those close to fast-food restaurants, brought harsh
criticism, and often inspired new local ordinances to address the
problem. Some municipalities actually forced chains to clean up
litter that was imprinted with their logos, but such sanctions were
rare. Fast-food wrappers became part of the urban, and later
suburban, landscape. Since bags and wrappers were crucial in the
delivery of fast food, the industry as a whole continued to use
disposable packaging, superficially assuaging public criticism by
providing outside trash receptacles for the discarded paper. Years
later, environmentalists again attacked the industry for excessive
packaging litter, criticizing both the volume and the content of
the refuse. By the early 1970s, the harshest criticisms focused
more on the synthetic materials used in packaging, and less on the
carelessly discarded paper. Critics derided the industry&apos;s use of
styrofoam sandwich containers and soda cups, claiming that these
products were not sufficiently biodegradable and were clogging
landfills. Facing mounting opposition from a growing environmental
movement, most of the major chains returned to packaging food in
paper wrappings or small cardboard boxes.

Labor activists have criticized fast-food chains&apos; tendency to
employ inexpensive teenage workers. Usually offering the lowest
possible wages, with no health or retirement benefits, these
restaurants often find it difficult hiring adults for stressful,
fast-paced jobs. Many critics claim that the industry preys on
teenagers, who will work for less pay and are less likely to
organize. Though these accusations may have merit, the industry&apos;s
reliance on teenage labor also has inherent liabilities, such as a
high employee turnover rate, which result in substantial recruiting
and training costs. Companies have countered criticism about their
use of teenage workers with the rationale that they offer young
people entry-level work experience, teaching them: both skills and
responsibility.

Despite the relentless attacks, hundreds of millions of hungry
customers eat fast food daily. The media constantly remind American
consumers about its supposed evils. Most are conscious of the
health risks from fatty, greasy meals; most realize that they are
being served by a poorly paid young worker; and if they choose to
ponder it, most are aware that the excessive packaging causes
millions of tons of trash each year. But they continue to purchase
and eat fast food on a regular basis. Fast food remains central to
the American diet because it is inexpensive, quick, convenient, and
predictable, and because it tastes good. Even more important,
Americans eat fast food because it is now a cultural norm. As
American culture homogenized and became distinctively &quot;American&quot; in
the second half of the twentieth century, fast food, and especially
the hamburger, emerged as the primary American ethnic food. Just as
the Chinese eat rice and Mexicans eat tamales, Americans eat
burgers.

And fast food has grown even beyond being just a distinctive
ethnic food. Since the 1960s, the concept has extended far beyond
the food itself, with the term becoming a common descriptor for
other quick-service operations, even a metaphor for many of the
negative aspects of mainstream American life. Theorists and pundits
sometimes use the term &quot;fast food&quot; to denigrate American habits,
institutions, and values, referring to them as elements of a
&quot;fast-food society.&quot; In fact, &quot;fast-food&quot; has become a frequently
used adjective, implying not only ready availability but also
superficiality, mass-produced standardization, lack of
authenticity, or just poor quality.

In the last two decades of the twentieth century, fast food
gained additional economic and cultural significance, becoming a
popular American export to nations around the world. Some
detractors claim that it is even deliberately used by the United
States, as a tool of cultural imperialism. The appearance of a
McDonald&apos;s or Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on the streets of a
foreign city signals to many the demise of indigenous culture,
replacing another country&apos;s traditional practices and values with
American materialism. In fact, the rapid spread of American fast
food is probably not an organized conspiracy, rather more the
result of aggressive corporate marketing strategies. Consumers in
other countries are willing and able to buy fast-food products, so
chains are quick to accommodate demand. Thought of around the world
as &quot;American food,&quot; fast food continues its rapid international
growth.
