Taekwondo and why it sucks and is a scam and a complete waste of time and money!
 By Bloggerdude 
Taekwondo is a scam. All the flowery kicks and trophies for leaping through the air won&apos;t help you in a real fight. It is a complete waste of time and money. Learn a real martial art like Brazilian Jujitsu instead!
 



I’ve been involved in martial arts for many years in several different styles.  I’ve been trained in karate, taekwondo, Brazilian jujitsu, Wing Chun kung fu and more.  Mostly the karate,  taekwondo and kung fu training I received were earlier on in my life.  And then I was introduced to Brazilian jujitsu and after a few short weeks of that I no longer desire to train in karate or tae kwon do or kung fu anymore.

The reason is simple–once you’ve trained in Brazilian jujitsu there is really no comparison.  And I have to say it depends on the quality of your instructor as there are a lot of low quality instructors out there that should not be teaching martial arts at all.  Many of them are out there just for the money and they promote students to ranks that they do not qualify to be at.

I can tell you from a personal recent example that I know of a karate instructor that recently promoted several other students to black belts and I can tell you from watching them and knowing these individuals they cannot protect themselves effectively.  You don’t give someone a black belt in any martial art that is extremely subpar and can’t defend themselves–but many taekwondo schools do.

 Get revenge on companies that have wronged you by leaving your complaints and reviews here on ReportYourComplaint.com! 

Well anyway I trained for years in Brazilian jujitsu and I fought through competitions and largely through some underground fighting (as back then we didn’t have the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), WEC Wreckage and other organized fighting events).  Back then it was all underground and it was all about gambling and it was dirty.  Anything would go as there was no rules whatsoever.

And guess what?  With my Brazilian jujitsu behind me I never lost a fight.  It was never even close.  It didn’t matter if someone had a 3 rd , 5 th , 6 th or seventh degree black belt in tae kwon do, karate, kung fu, etc…  Every flight always went to the ground and then it was just a matter of time before the other fighter made a mistake and they were either choked out, submitted or had their arm broken.

Now the title of my complaint was directed at tae kwon do and why it sucks.  Well, it does suck and I’ll tell you why.  No matter where you take it the dojos charge upwards of $100-$150 a month.  And you are literally throwing that money away because your little fancy spin kicks are absolutely worthless in a real fight.

Now it may work in an open field with someone that has absolutely no experience fighting and is drunk.  But in any other case you’re wasting your time and your money.  This is because someone with just a fraction of training in Brazilian jujitsu will crush you.  I can put a white belt in Brazilian jujitsu (with just 4 months of training) against a second degree black belt in tae kwon do from any instructor anywhere in the United States and they will win.

What spurred me to write this complaint against tae kwon do is what happened recently.  I was taking my son to enroll him in school and I was talking to the assistant principal and telling them that my son was taking jujitsu.  That was fine and dandy until this 25-year-old guy that apparently drives this van that picks up students and takes them to a local tae kwon do school piped in and said Brazilian jujitsu sucks.

I mean was this guy for real?  He then proceeded to gloat and tell us how he was an extremely well-trained second degree black belt in taekwondo and won numerous trophies for competitions.  At that I just had to let out a loud laugh.  I then excuse myself and my son and we left.  I actually felt sorry for the guy because the first time he ever gets in a fight and relies on his taekwondo he is sure to lose and that will greatly hurt his pride and he will then see that he has wasted a lot of money and time on useless training.

Taekwondo is an Olympic sport in my eyes and is no different than watching professional wrestling like the WWE.  That’s all it is.  It is just for show.  And in a real fight I’m sorry but it’s going to go to the ground and the tae kwon do guy will be the first one to lose every time.  Karate as a general rule has a little bit more preparedness for a closer battle and same with kung fu.  As kung fu has their “sticky hands” training.  But none of these can even come close to competing with Brazilian jujitsu which is designed for going to the ground and using your opponent’s energy against them.

I fell in love with Brazilian jujitsu because it enables someone of small stature or even a weaker composition to be able take on people twice their size literally.  One of my favorite moves was always to jump on the person and wrap myself around them in such a way that they would fall to the ground in my guard.  From here I exerted almost no energy whatsoever and there is basically not much they could do.  And there is no defense in tae kwon do for this whatsoever.

There are some very minor  positive aspects to taekwondo training (very limited, though), but it should come with a disclaimer similar to that of the scam online universities like University of Phoenix .  At the end of the TV commercial for University of Phoenix and similar for profit online universities there’s this little blip disclaimer that says credits are unlikely to transfer (that’s because they will not transfer at all).  Taekwondo should come with a similar disclaimer that says training in Taekwondo is unlikely to help in a real fight.  Or a better disclaimer would be – Taekwondo sucks and participants regardless of rank earned are never prepared for a real fight.

What a plonker. You seem to have missed the entire point of your Taekwondo class. The instructor is like a guide book. A person to show you how its done! If you think that you can train for 2 hours a week and become expert in an art–well fool you.
Taekwondo is a superb martial art–as too are many other martial arts. A bad student will always blame his instructor.
And as for the grading–again you missed the point. The black belt is a sign that you have passed all levels of what was asked of you. With regard this–when you become a black belt, your real training begins. I wish you well with your new martial art and I hope that all your‘money’was not ill spend and you did learn‘something’along the way.

yes i do think wtf tkd (taekwondo) sucks big time. what u probabley dont know is that Gen. Choi Hong Hi created a military combat fighting system in W.W.2 and it was named Taekwon-Do in 1955. a complete fighting system from jumping in the air to fighting on the ground. WTF sucks and destroyed the art that Gen Choi personaly taught me. yes WTF TKD does suck but Traditional Taekwon-Do ROCKS, unfortunately most dojos train in WTF.

I’m not sure I agree with the title of it being a scam and a complete waste of time and money. Sure they might not teach street fighting, but tkd is like the biggest MA SPORT in the world. And they teach how to fight in a tournament with head gear chest pads and cups. We all know that street fights won’t be set up like that at all, but that doesn’t mean tkd is a scam. against someone who has no martial art background, I think they would probably win a street fight. I also agree with Schueler, alot of this does have to deal with the watered down dojo’s nowadays. And Joe, I think it is un polite to say“A bad student will always blame his instructor.”When you really don’t know the situation too well, and have really no reason behind this theory. Random insults immediately turn off any consideration of you knowing what you are talking about when it comes to sports to me. Back to the main subject, tkd, I think, Is a good fitness program, and it gives people goals and helps influence other things in their life. Though I never did agree with belt rankings, because why do you need a belt to tell you the“real training begins?”Shouldn’t it be real from the start? But sport and real fights are 2 different things, even UFC is a sport and not a real fight.

LOL hes right. I went up against a 2nd degree black belt twice when I only had a portion of BJJ training and guess what?…. I whooped them both times in under on minute. And I get my training for free, when they spent over 7 years worth of training. I felt bad for both of them.

Oh and about this whole- It’s the fighter not the art, thing, It’s both , but if you are going to against someone who knows BJJ and you don’t know shit, then you’re going to lose. If you’re going to learn A martial art, make it BJJ first

Great post:

The only thing I would add is to incude Muay Thai, wrestling&amp;judo as good arts in addition to BJJ. (Or training in all concurrently as“MMA”).

I presently train judo&amp;bjj with a gi. I also hit the bag. After a few years, I’ll train both without the gi (judo effectively then becomes submission wrestling) and also add muay thai.

An explanation of why TKD sucks should compare TKD to Muay Thai sinch both are striking arts. Mauy Thai crosstrained with BJJ is way better than TKD trained with BJJ. Of course when one learns how to spar alive in BJJ class, he won’t fall for a bullshit non-alive system like TKD.

If you plan on disciplining yourself in only one form of martial arts and plan on not having to improvise or adapt when fighting, well you have already set yourself up for failure in a real world fight. That is why all the authorities of the world have not adopted BJJ as the supreme martial art all man kind should learn.

If you go into anything with arrogance you will fail, and that is all I am hearing here, a lot of arrogance.

That is why the US Military does not prescribe a single form of Martial Arts discipline; they train in multiple disciplines and test themselves against multiple disciplines. They prepare for battle.

Now if you want to live your life, thinking you need to be prepared for any fight you should join the military and dedicate your life to fighting.

I chose Taekwondo because I don’t want to become some super fighter ego maniac. I just wanted a good place to get physical discipline and get in shape. I don’t plan on hurting other people who look at me funny or call me chicken. Maybe other fighting styles are superior to Taekwondo (I wouldn’t know), but I find that the school I go to doesn’t push me to the point where I will hurt myself; and I like that. Maybe after I am in shape I will consider taking some other forms of Martial Arts to be better rounded, but not for a while.

I am a red belt in TKD. I train at a school, where you can get your black belt in 2.5 years. I’ve seen people that have no business getting promoted get promoted. I’ve seen 8-year old 2nd degree black belts. I’ve seen people get their black belt, then get their 2nd degree black belt a year later, instead of waiting two years.

However, I train hard, and keep it in reality. I know jumping / spinning / turning kicks are highly telegraphed and unrealistic. I have two sons, both who take Kodenkan JJ. They have been in it a year, and both have their yellow belts. I have free-style sparred with them, and consistently win. They rarely are able to catch me or get me on the ground, and when they have, I’ve escaped or countered with a close-quarter strike or kick.

So, to say someone trained 4 months in JJ can beat any black belt in TKD is just not true.

TKD is mostly trained as an olympic sport, and you’re right, when used that way, it’s ineffective and yes, even dangerous against someone who is either quick with reflexes or knows what they’re doing.

But, TKD used sensibly and as the killing art it was meant to be. Well, it’s effective, trust me.
