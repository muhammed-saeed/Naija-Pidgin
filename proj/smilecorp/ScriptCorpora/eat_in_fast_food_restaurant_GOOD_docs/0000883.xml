 Lefty&apos;s Closes : 
 On December 8th I broke the news in this blog that Left At Albuquerque was closing by the end of the year. General Manager Jenny Strong called 
 me the next day and informed me that my sources were incorrect and 
 requested I post a retraction which I did December 15th. I then read an 
 interview with Strong in the News-Press December 25th indicating that 
 Left at Albuquerque had already closed. So it appears that I need to retract my retraction .

 Hello from the North Pole! I have 
 been busy running my Santa 
 Claus call center and decided to do something a little different 
 this week. Instead of reading restaurant news in today&apos;s blog you can 
 hear it live on Arthur von Wiesenberger&apos;s AM1290 Table Talk radio 
 show this Thursday at 9am (Christmas Eve) where I will be a guest. 
 You can also listen to it streamed on the web at Nippers.com. Merry 
 Christmas!

 Wine Cask Bar Caf Opens : Intermezzo at 813 Anacapa Street reopened last week as Wine 
 Cask Bar Cafe and is designed as a place to meet for a quick pizza, 
 glass of wine or cocktail before dinner.&quot;We are delighted to have our 
 local bar back in town, says General Manager David Sigman. It is a 
 vibrant space. All the food is outstanding.&quot;

  The menu, available on their web site, includes five types of flat 
 bread pizza, four salads, six plates (Cheese and Charcuterie, The Cask 
 burger, House-smoked chicken sandwich, Pulled short rib, Steamed local 
 mussels, and Frito misto), and five desserts.

  Wine Cask Bar Caf is open daily 11am 11pm and will be open 
 Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. A holiday menu is available. For more 
 information call 966-9463 or visit winecask.com .
 20th Anniversary : Edomasa Japanese Restaurant at 2710 De La Vina Street is celebrating 20 years in 
 business with some specials available throughout December. If it is your 
 birthday you get a free dinner, when you dine with three guests that 
 purchase dinners. The birthday special is available Monday Saturday. 
 On Sundays throughout December everyone receives 20% off all food 
 orders, not including take-out or alcohol.
 Remaining Open : Sources from Left At Albuquerque informed me last week that the restaurant, located at 700 State Street, 
 was scheduled to close at the end of the year. I posted this information 
 in my blog. General Manager Jenny Strong tells me We are conducting 
 business as usual and have received no information to support the rumors 
 that we are closing.
 Red Mango Closed : Two sources 
 tell me that Red 
 Mango frozen yogurt at 3967 State Street (Five Points Shopping 
 Center) has closed their doors. I called Red Mango and confirmed that 
 their phone number is no longer in service. Red Mango opened last March.

 Reports of my demise have been greatly 
 exaggerated : Yes, I am alive, though I haven&apos;t been able to 
 update my blog in nearly a week. I have been working on my Santa Claus call center which runs December 19-24 noon-8pm. Have your kids call 800-726-8222 
 starting this Saturday!
 News From The Valley : Reader Prime 
 Time has passed me some news from Santa Ynez Valley:
 A burger place named the Hayloft Grill has opened inside the Maverick Saloon at 3687 Sagunto Street. Hours are Mon-Fri 
 11:30am-2:30pm, Sat-Sun 11:30am-4pm. A Panino sandwich shop is planning to open inside Artiste 
 Winery&amp;Tasting Studio at 3569 Sagunto Street Roasted Bean 
 Coffee House   has been sold to Trace Eubanks, son of 
 television/radio personality Bob Eubanks. Olsens Danish Village Bakery at 1529 
 Mission Drive in Solvang has a huge gingerbread house on display that 
 is generating a lot of attention 

 Closed : Einstein Bros Bagels inside Albertsons at 7127 Hollister Ave (near Costco) has closed.

 Tis The 
 Season For Giving : Unity Shoppe , celebrating 90 years 
 of service to people in need, will be holding their 23rd annual Unity 
 Telethon this Saturday, December 12, 1pm 11:30pm. The event, whose 
 primary sponsor is the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, will be 
 presented by Cox on channels 8, 12 (KCOY), 712, 708, and streamed live 
 on newspress.com . 
 You can call your pledge in to 805-965-4122 or donate online at unityshoppe.org . Ill be one of the hundreds of volunteers helping 
 answer the phones.

  I spoke with Unity President&amp;Director of Operations Barbara 
 Tellefson and she tells me that food has been in very short supply this 
 year and they need $300,000 just to cover food needs during the holiday 
 season. Only 10% of food comes from Food Bank and for the rest they rely 
 on public donations.

  A monetary donation ($10 or more) is the best way to help provide 
 food because Unity Shoppe can purchase the exact food they need and buy 
 it in bulk. 288 churches&amp;agencies refer people to Unity Shoppe 
 throughout the year which helps as many as 200 families per day.

  Unity Shoppe is different than most organizations that help the 
 less fortunate. They understand that simply giving to others is not 
 enough, and, in fact, can be wasteful. Unity Shoppe uniquely understands 
 that to maximize effectiveness of resources you have to give what people 
 actually NEED and do so in a way that preserves their dignity.

  They accomplish this by operating a Unity Shoppe store and letting 
 the public choose which food&amp;supplies they need most rather than 
 giving them something they might not want. The added benefit to this 
 model is that children get to see their parents shop in what appears to 
 them to be a regular store. It sounds like a simple concept but most 
 organizations that help the less fortunate dont work this way.

  Please pull together during this holiday season and call in your 
 donation this Saturday!
 Lefty&apos;s To Close : I have sad news to 
 report today: Left At 
 Albuquerque at 700 State Street plans to close their doors at 
 the end of the year. Their parent company has filed for bankruptcy.
 Off Topic : Friend and frequent Santa 
 Claus call center volunteer Harley Hahn has setup a web site 
 called Santa 
 Barbara Holiday Light Tour . Every year in December there are 
 wonderful displays of holiday lights throughout Santa Barbara. You can 
 have a wonderful time driving around looking at the festive decorations 
 if you know where to look. Hahns web site tells you the exact route 
 that the Christmas bus tours take. If you drive at a reasonably slow 
 pace the entire route will take about an hour and half.

 &quot;Accidental Santa&quot;Call Center Is A Go : 
 What a difference a day makes.

  For those of you who don&apos;t know, each Christmas I run a&quot; Santa 
 Claus Call Center &quot;because SantaBarbara.com&apos;s phone number 1-800-SantaBarbara is one digit off from 1-800-SantaClaus and tens of thousands of misdialing kiddies from all over the U.S. call 
 me by mistake, expecting to speak with the Jolly Old Elf. 
 1-800-SantaClaus is not a working phone number, children just call 
 hoping that it is. Volunteers 
 from across the South Coast help take these misdialed calls and answer 
 the phone as Mr.&amp;Mrs. Claus.

  On Wednesday things were looking pretty bleak because my Plan A&amp;Plan B locations for hosting the call center downtown had fallen through 
 and time was running out. I told my sad story to friend Mitchell Sjervan , 
 proprietor of the Wine Cask, Bouchon and Seagrass restaurants who 
 promptly made some phone calls to SIMA Management Corporation to 
 see if they had any available retail space that could be used 
 as a call center this Christmas.

  I am happy to announce that yesterday Robert Perez , Sr. 
 Property Manager for SIMA Management Corp, contacted me and has 
 generously donated some available retail space to be home for the Santa 
 Claus call center this Christmas. The address, 1221 State St 
 #6, is on the parking lot side of Victoria Court next to the post 
 office and immediately below SOhO.
  Like last year, Cox Business Digital Telephone is 
 providing a phone system to make it all happen and will also be 
 providing a group of volunteer Santas to answer calls.
  To volunteer to answer the phone as Santa or Mrs. Claus (or 
 an Elf, or a Reindeer, or Uncle Bob Claus...) you can signup online at www. AccidentalSanta.com . 
 The call center will be open from noon-8pm December 19-24.
  Merry Christmas!
 Rumor Machine : Another thing I was 
 busy with yesterday was calling Make It Work to have them come 
 repair the aging Rumor Machine. Earlier this week it put out a message 
 indicating the Firestone Walker Brewing Company was considering 
 coming to downtown Santa Barbara. It turns out that the company 
 interested was actually Firestone Grill of San Luis Obispo and 
 that plans to do so have fallen through.

 Nugget Opens Thursday In Goleta : 
 Summerland&apos;s popular Nugget restaurant will see the opening of its first sister location this 
 Thursday, December 3rd at 5685 Calle Real in Goleta, the former home of Kona Ranch 
 House .
I spoke with General Manager Jemal James who tells me I am excited to 
 open up out here in Goleta. I feel its a good fit and that the people 
 will accept us for what were are, as a family-friendly environment with 
 a fun and exciting atmosphere, and for what is most important: an 
 affordable price.

  Operational advisor Jerome Bohnett tells me that the new Nugget, 
 which has a full liquor license, has been designed with a western motif 
 (familiar to Summerland Nugget fans) with a copper bar. We offer 
 value-oriented food&amp;drink, Bohnett says. Prices range from $5.95 to 
 $24 with most items $8-$12. Lunch and dinner is available at all times, 
 so you can get a smaller priced item (sandwich, burger) during dinner 
 time.

  The main menu includes an assortment of nine salads, 10 different 
 burgers and 10 types of sandwiches. The entres includes 49er Steak, Dr Ts Center Cut Sirloin, Baby 
 Back Ribs, Kents Chopped Steak, New York Steak, Filet Mignon, Angels 
 Pork Chop, Fried Shrimp, Shrimp Scampi, Calamari Picatta, Fresh Wild 
 Salmon, Fish&amp;Chips, Fresh Ahi Tuna Steak, Chicken Strips, Chicken Marsala, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Picatta, Honey Dipped Fried Chicken, 
 Pasta Bolognese, Linguini Pomodoro, Pasta Primavera and Fettuccini 
 Alfredo.

  The Nugget also has a seasonal menu which has 14 items at terrific 
 price points including Lamb Chops $13.95, Homemade Meatloaf Dinner $9.95 
 and Beef Stroganoff $8.95.

  I have little doubt that people from all over the South Coast will 
 be anxious to check out Goletas newest gem but dont rush over to the 
 Nugget tonight youll have to wait for the grand opening this 
 Thursday. Tell them the Restaurant Guy sent you!

  The new Nugget restaurant in Goleta is open 11am-9:30pm seven days 
 a week. For more information call 964-5200.

 restaurant in Goleta 

 
 Rumor Machine : While enjoying a nice 
 Thanksgiving dinner last Thursday I heard a beeping noise coming from my 
 office. I temporarily halted my feast of turkey, cranberry sauce, 
 stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes&amp;green beans and politely excused 
 myself from the table to go investigate.

  Apparently the aging Rumor Machine had received an incoming message 
 but the paper jammed and the contents were smeared&amp;shredded beyond 
 recognition. Fortunately the LCD display still had the message title in 
 its memory buffer which read Firestone Walker Brewing Company is 
 interested in opening a location on State Street in downtown Santa 
 Barbara. As always, this rumor might be completely false or a brilliant 
 forecast of future events. Your call.

 Santa Barbara Survey 2010 Begins : The fourth annual Santa Barbara Survey of your favorite places for food&amp;drink has begun. The online survey ( SantaBarbara.com/survey ) 
 runs from today until the end of December and the results will be 
 displayed in the SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide throughout 2010.

Recently I asked readers if any new categories should be created for the 
 2010 survey and this resulted in many new additions: Best New 
 Restaurant, Best Place For A Private Dining Room, Best Taco Night, 
 Best Place For Ladies Night Out, Best Place For Guys Night Out, 
 Best Tea Selection, Best Restaurant For Fundraisers, Best Place For 
 Wine Tasting (Santa Ynez and Santa Barbara) and Where Do You Eat Out 
 Most Frequently?

Best Burger has now been separated into three categories:&quot;Best Burger 
 (Burger Place),&quot;&quot;Best Burger (General Restaurant)&quot;and&quot;Best Burger 
 (Veggie Burger).&quot;Four dessert categories have been added: Best Frozen 
 Yogurt, Best Ice Cream,&quot;Best Gelato&quot;and Best Cupcakes.

Lastly I received a very unusual category request that I am going to 
 give a try: Best Eatery For When You Are Nightclubbing Downtown And

 Day In Dallas : I am away on vacation 
 in Texas but should be home for Thanksgiving. Yesterday I attended a 
 Dallas Cowboy football game where they played rivals Washington Redskins 
 in the new $1 billion&quot;Cowboys Stadium&quot;(Dallas won 7-6). I try to fly 
 out to a Cowboy game every few years.
  Yesterday was also the 46th anniversary of the assassination of 
 President John F. Kennedy who was shot while driving through Dealey 
 Plaza near downtown Dallas on November 22nd 1963. I stopped by the 
 plaza, which had many memorials setup, and took a photo of the spot in 
 the road where the president died in his car. The fatal shot was fired 
 by Lee Harvey Oswald from a window in the building on the left.

 The Wine Cask Opens Downtown : 
 Welcome back. We missed you. Last night marked the triumphant return of 
 local dining institution The Wine Cask (813 Anacapa Street) 
 which I added to the restaurant guide today. The Wine Cask Bar Caf (formerly Intermezzo ) 
 opens next week. Mitchell Sjerven, who also owns bouchon and Seagrass 
 Restaurant , is the new managing partner of Wine Cask 
 along with local winemaker Doug Margerum, who owned and operated Wine 
 Cask from 1981 to 2007. The owner of the building, SIMA Corp., is a 
 silent partner.

  Sjerven counts time at Wine Cask as a server in the early 90s as 
 pivotal in forging his own career path in the restaurant industry. 
 Experiencing firsthand the joy diners expressed when enjoying a 
 quality wine dining experience was an unbeatable feeling. I knew that 
 suited me to a t even then. What he didnt know was one day hed come 
 full circle as an owner of the very institution that inspired him.

  The new incarnation of the venerable eatery is striving to be less 
 formal than in the past and hopes to become a neighborhood restaurant 
 with a relaxed atmosphere where you can dine frequently rather than just 
 on special occasions. There will be no dress code for customers and they 
 have eliminated the host and hostess position, instead offering a 
 concierge-manager.

  The Wine Cask offers culinary creations from executive chef David 
 Sundeen who worked for Sjerven previously as executive chef at bouchon. 
 For the Wine Cask he will offer a regional cuisine, a blend of Santa 
 Barbara and Mediterranean style. The Wine Cask Bar Caf menu will 
 include salads and pizzas.

The Wine Casks Gold Room will be open for dinner Sunday-Thursday 
 5:30-9pm and Friday-Saturday 5:30-10pm. Wine Cask Bar Caf will be open 
 Sunday-Thursday 11am-11pm and Friday-Saturday 11am-1am. For more information call 966-9463 or visit winecask.com

 as a nightly tasting menu. View menu of Wine Cask Bar Caf (formerly Intermezzo) that opens next week.

 Bella Dolce Bakery Update : This just 
 in from Eileen Randall Cook at Bella Dolce Bakery , 
 113 W. De la Guerra St: 
We opened with a quiet soft opening last week and tomorrow begins our 
 grand opening week. We will have specials and tastings every day this 
 week.

A free house coffee or tea with every sweet purchase this week for your 
 readers if they mention The Restaurant Guys column or web site.

In addition to our usual items special holiday sweets will be available 
 by special order for Thanksgiving, our famous hand painted shortbread 
 cookies, pumpkin pie with praline, and chocolate pecan tarts. For 
 Christmas we will have Buche de Noel, gingerbread people and hand 
 decorated Christmas cookies as well as holiday cupcakes.

I have been cooking&amp;doing pastry professionally since I was 14 years 
 old and started working at D.Crosby Ross here in SB. My last job, before 
 I started Bella Dolce as a dessert&amp;custom wedding cake company 12 
 years ago, was as executive pastry chef for the Wine Cask. With the 
 retail bakery finally opening it is the achievement of a life time dream 
 since I decided I wanted to make cookies for a living when I was 6 years 
 old.

Thanks for your support!

 Marmalade Cafe To Open New Private Dining Room : 
 This just in from Marmalade Cafe 3825 State Street in La Cumbre Plaza: 
MARMALADE CAF OPENS PRIVATE DINING ROOM
ON TIME FOR HOLIDAY PARTIES&amp;FAMILY CELEBRATIONS

State-of-the-Art Equipment will Enhance Business&amp;Board Meetings

Santa Barbara, CA It was announced this week by Marmalade Caf 
 co-founder and partner Selwyn Yosslowitz that Marmalade Caf, an 
 Innovative California restaurant located in the La Cumbre Plaza, will 
 open their new private dining room November 23rd, just in time for the 
 holiday season.

According to restaurant general manager Warren Butler, The new private 
 dining room will provide local business owners, corporations, nonprofit 
 or private organizations, as well as families and social groups the 
 perfect private room to celebrate the holidays, and book monthly 
 business or board meetings. State-of-the-art equipment has been included 
 in the room design for use at breakfast, lunch or dinner meetings, and 
 will ensure the needed video and sound enhancements required by our 
 guests for successful communication during their gatherings.

The design for the new dining room is a group effort, and includes 
 decorating touches from co-founder and partner Bonnie Burns, who has 
 incorporated the comfortable style enjoyed in all Marmalade locations. 
 In keeping with the decorating theme, the room is elegant, warm and 
 functional. Two massive chandeliers grace the ceiling, and seats of 
 cherry wood with rich brocade welcome guests to sit down. A private 
 entrance offers convenience to business or party guests, and all 
 technical requirements for perfect presentations or introductions are 
 ready to go, including an impressive podium.

Marmalade Caf was the brain child of Bobby and Bonnie Burns, along with 
 marketing entrepreneur Selwyn Yosslowitz. The family founded business 
 began in the early 90s and now has restaurants in Santa Barbara, El 
 Segundo, Rolling Hills Estates, Santa Monica, Malibu, Los Angeles 
 (Farmers Market), Calabasas, Sherman Oaks, Westlake Village, and Tustin 
 California.

The dedicated staff at Marmalade Caf is preparing to serve breakfast, 
 lunch or dinner requests in the new room, offering food and beverage 
 options for every taste at affordable prices. La Cumber Plaza provides 
 easy parking for patrons, and Marmalade is open from 7:00 a.m. till 
 10:00 p.m. M-F; 7:00 a.m. till 11:00 p.m. S-S. For dining or private 
 room reservations please call 805-682-5246. For additional information

 Rustys 
 Pizza Turns 40 : Local legend Rustys Pizza has now 
 been serving piping hot pizza pies for four decades. As part of their 
 celebration Rustys is having a couple of contests. Children who create 
 their own Rustys Ad could win a pizza party for 10 people ($100 value). 
 Each Rustys location has two prize categories: ages 2-6 and ages 7-12. 
 Each Rustys location is also having a contest to win a Wii video game 
 console. Visit any Rusty&apos;s for an entry form before the deadline of 
 November 30.

  Rusty&apos;s Pizza has expanded the menu over the years and recently 
 introduced HotWings at every location. Served with celery sticks&amp;Ranch 
 dressing the HotWings come in a variety of flavors including Medium, 
 Hot, Killer, BBQ or Spice BBQ Sauce.

  What is the story behind this popular pizza parlor? In 1969, the 
 founders of Rusty&apos;s Pizza bought a restaurant named Rusty&apos;s Roast 
 Beef. It was located at 910 Embarcadero Del Norte in Isla Vista, 
 currently the home of Dublin&apos;s Sports Grill. The plan was to turn it 
 into a pizza parlor but money was tight at the fledgling business and 
 they couldn&apos;t afford to replace the large&quot;Rusty&apos;s Roast Beef&quot;sign on 
 the front of the building. What they did instead was alter the existing 
 sign to replace&quot;Roast Beef&quot;with&quot;Pizza&quot;and a local legend was born.

  Within three years, the locations on Milpas and State Street were 
 added, followed closely by Carrillo, Fairview and Carpinteria. The 90&apos;s 
 saw the opening of Rusty&apos;s on Storke Road in Goleta and Rusty&apos;s on 
 Turnpike Road. 2002 marked the opening of Rusty&apos;s Lighthouse location 
 on the waterfront across from Stearns Wharf. All Rusty&apos;s locations are 
 locally owned and operated. For more information visit rustyspizza.com . 
 Better yet, order a pizza by calling 564-1111.
 Speaking Of Birthdays : Chocolats du 
 CaliBressan at 4193 Carpinteria Ave #4 in Carpinteria is 
 celebrating their second birthday. During the week of November 16-21 
 save 10% off any purchase of $20 or more.
 New Online Store : C&apos;est Cheese at 825 Santa Barbara Street has just launched an online store where you 
 can view their selection of cheese gift boxes, upcoming tastings&amp;events, and a variety of artisan products. Visit the store online at store.cestcheese.com 
 QuickTip : I recently wrote a column 
 item about a $1.99 iPhone App barcode scanner called RedLaser . 
 Another App that I find useful is called QuickTip . You enter in 
 the amount of your dining bill and it tells you how much the tip is and 
 your grand total. You can customize the tip percentage and round up/down 
 your total bill. I use it so much that it now has a permanent spot on my 
 iPhone home screen. Thank you to Preston Marx of Carpinteria for 
 enlightening me to the wonders of QuickTip which is available for free in 
 the iPhone App Store.

 The Candidates 
 Speak Out : They have given many interviews during their quest 
 to win the election but until now no reporters have had the courage to 
 hammer candidates with the one hardball question you want answered most: What are your favorite places for food&amp;drink in Santa Barbara? I sent an 
 email to those seeking to be Santa Barbaras next Mayor or a member of 
 the City Council, and here are the responses I received (in alphabetical 
 order):

 Lane Anderson (for City Council): I go to Rudy&apos;s on Montecito Street and the Rose 
 Cafe on Haley for Mexican food, to the Szechuan on the mesa for 
 Chinese, to Your Place on Milpas for Thai and to Cliff&apos;s on the Mesa 
 for an occasional burger (I like the Laurel). I like the Coffee Cat on 
 Anapamu for coffee.
  Dianne Channing (for City Council): My husband and I love to have a very late lunch on 
 the patio of Playa Azul. The friendly service, great food, and relaxed 
 feel of the patio embodies Santa Barbara for me.
  Steve Cushman (for Mayor): As President of the Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce, I 
 love to frequent the 150 chamber member restaurants, clubs and bars. 
 There are so many great ones it would be unfair to single out only a 
 few.
  John Gibbs (for City Council): I have four preferred restaurants that Carol 
 (wife) and I frequent weekly. First and foremost is Cody&apos;s in the 
 Turnpike plaza. Prices are very reasonable, food tastefully served, 
 wait staff friendly. The diner menu is quite extensive and there isn&apos;t 
 an entree I wouldn&apos;t order a second time. Second is Alphie&apos;s on 
 Hollister in downtown Goleta. Open only for breakfast and lunch, again 
 the prices are reasonable, food has a home cooked flavor, family owned 
 and staffed. They are more like friends than business owners. For 
 Santa Barbara dining Farmer Boy on upper State sure fills the bill for 
 us. Again open only for breakfast and lunch. The early bird breakfast 
 is almost giveaway priced. This establishment reminds us of what 
 dining in a small town could be like. On Sundays we often go to 
 Mulligen&apos;s at the city golf course. Family run, nice menu and they 
 don&apos;t get excited if we linger over the Sunday crossword. For takeout 
 on football nights it&apos;s Rusty&apos;s Pizza. Sure goes well with a Bud 
 Light. Carol doesn&apos;t drink and I&apos;m happy with an occasional beer at 
 home so I can&apos;t recommend a cocktail lounge.
  Frank Hotchkiss (for City Council): My wife, Sandi, and I love Emilio&apos;s on Cabrillo 
 for its great appetizers and service, Playa Azul for its chile 
 rellenos, El Sitio for its tortas asadas, and Cava for its mojitos.
  Grant House (for City Council): There&apos;s the Sojourner for late night dining after 
 a hard day&apos;s work or after a show -- I always order the tofu with 
 onions if we make it before 10pm. Office manager Jim picks our next 
 door neighbor, Three Pickles, for sandwiches piled higher than 
 anywhere else in town. My early morning favorite is a day kick started 
 with cafe mocha and a pastry for a delightful breakfast with a friend 
 at Our Daily Bread around the corner on Santa Barbara Street. Then 
 there&apos;s Grapevine for lunch. I am amazed by their ever-changing and 
 unique selection including the best kale in the world! Shanghai 
 Restaurant on Milpas St. is where Peggy Jo and I often go when we 
 don&apos;t have the energy to fix dinner at the end of a long day. We 
 choose Aldo&apos;s for election eve victory parties or any other time we 
 want to feel special. Then there&apos;s Jack&apos;s Bagels @ Carpinteria and 
 Milpas for one of the best mocha blendeds in town. Add a Veggie Ranch 
 Wrap (comes with a pickle) and you&apos;ve got the perfect late lunch for a 
 busy Councilmember on the go. Peggy Jo&apos;s pick is Playa Azul for the 
 friendly staff, scrumptious guacamole tacos, and the lovely patio 
 right in the center of Santa Barbara&apos;s historic district.
  Cathie McCammon (for City Council): My favorite places to eat and drink are: Opal for 
 special occasions, then depending on the mood Empress Palace, 
 Petrini&apos;s- they have the only pizza I really like and I always have 
 sausage and mushrooms on it , Mesa Cafe - I love their scrambles, and 
 Hamburger Habit - between meetings downtown and I practically live on 
 the take out food at Lazy Acres. Paradise Cafe - the best hamburger, 
 along with Pacific Crepes.
  David Pritchett (for City Council): Cathy and I prefer to support locally owned 
 restaurants with a long history in the community. Some of our 
 favorites: Petrini&apos;s restaurant... great food and still a locals 
 place; especially like the option for a mix of veggies instead of 
 pasta with the chicken dishes. Pascucci restaurant... great value and 
 wide selection; especially like the spinach salad and the Sweet Potato 
 Pie by Babatunde. Harry&apos;s Plaza Cafe... again, great food and steaks, 
 with nice peeps there in Uptown. El Zarape restaurant... authentic 
 like a diner in Mexico, with awesome specials of the day like chile 
 verde or lengua; a 10-minute walk from home here in the Mid Westside 
 &apos;hood.
  Bonnie Raisin (for City Council): Since I am a native of SB I tend to go for the 
 oldies and goodies such as Caf Del Sol, The Montecito Hotel Caf, 
 Joes on State Street, Buen Gusto on Milpas and Canon Perdido and more 
 recent ones such as Ca Dario (not sure of the spelling.(I really miss 
 The Talk of the Town). I also like the Natural Caf on State (yummie 
 Turkey burgers) and most of the Sushi Restaurants. I have to 
 accompany friends and family sometimes and go to the&quot;trendy&quot;places 
 and they are OK but not my choice! And Enterprise Fish Co. I like!
  Justin Tevis (for City Council): Empress Palace is one of my favorite Chinese food 
 restaurants because you really get an authentic cultural experience as 
 if you are out of the country and the food is always fresh and tasty. 
 I also am a regular at just about every Mexican food restaurant on 
 Milpas Street in SB, because I love authentic Mexican food and live 
 within walking distance.  I also dig the mobil Taco Shop that parks 
 on Cota and Milpas right there at the corner market. Hitching Post and 
 Brothers&apos; Restaurant in the Santa Ynez Valley are always good for 
 birthday dinners or special occasions. Alex&apos;s BBQ in Shell Beach has 
 some of the best BBQ food anywhere (tri-tip sandwich), and I used to 
 live within walking distance. However, Cooks&apos; BBQ in Ventura does 
 give Alex&apos;s BBQ a run for its money. Arnoldi&apos;s Italian food on Cota 
 Street is good for some red wine and delicious plates as well.
  Helene 
 Schneider (for Mayor): Favorite places for lunch - Paradise Cafe. 
 Can&apos;t beat the gazpacho or the seared ahi salad on a hot day, Arnold 
 Palmers (lemonade and ice tea mix) are already in pitchers, and if you 
 have a craving for a burger, the Paradise Burger is the way to go. 
 Less time for lunch? Three Pickles with their Italian sub or the 
 Pastrami. Yum. Best outside ambiance: Brophy&apos;s. On the patio 
 overlooking the harbor and the mountains, with an oyster shooter, a 
 drink and good friends. Fantastic. Favorite neighborhood bar: 
 Palmieri&apos;s. Friendly staff,&quot;the game&quot;is always on and Paesano&apos;s 
 Pizzeria is right next door ready to deliver to your bar stool. Happy 
 Hour delights: Enterprise Fish Company and The Chase Bar&amp;Grille - 
 great drink and appetizer deals at the bar and these places have a 
 constant gathering of regular folks and a good vibe in the air.&quot;Date 
 Night&quot;dinner: Bouchon. Definitely. And I cannot wait to see what 
 magic Mitchell Sjerven&amp;Doug Margerum will bring with the re-opening 
 of the Wine Cask in November. And when you want Asian cuisine - gotta 
 go to Your Place Thai Restaurant or Shintori Sushi. Off the main 
 beaten path, reasonable prices and oh so good. I&apos;m sure I missed some 
 - Santa Barbarans are blessed with so many great choices.
  John Thyne (for City Council): Zaytoon the best lamb shanks and most amazing 
 Baba Ghannouj available! Fire tables are fun, hookah is unforgettable. 
 Great place for large events or intimate dinners. The best service 
 around. Elements right by the courthouse where I spend a lot of 
 time; amazing food; beautiful ambiance; very friendly staff; fun 
 crowd. Uncle Roccos NY Pizza a real slice of pie like youd get 
 back East; authentic cheese and crispy thin crust served with enough 
 pizza oil to almost require a bib, love it! Rose Caf (Haley Street) 
 incredibly authentic Mexican food with the best cheese enchiladas 
 rojas I have ever had (aside from my friend Irenes); gotta have the 
 rice + beans; I have friends who travel to town for this one; a great 
 place for Sunday brunch after church. Really friendly staff. Luckys&amp;Caf Luck two of my favorite spots, always a place to see and be 
 seen, expertly prepared steak and fresh shellfish, amazing staff at 
 both locations! Also Arnoldis, Crushcakes Cupcakery, Opal, The 
 Palace, Saigon In&amp;Out, Sakana, Tupelo Junction, Via Maestro and 805 
 Deli.
  Bendy White (for City Council): Kathy and I consider Cafe del Sol our pub. Alfredo 
 Arroyo and owner Jack Sears run the ultimately comfortable ship, and 
 it&apos;s a hop and a skip from home. Downtown, the pull of Paradise Cafe 
 is powerful. Randy and Jim always have a team of friendly, efficient 
 staff. And then there&apos;s Pascucci&apos;s. My, but hasn&apos;t Laura Knight shown 
 the world how to establish a mood and deliver the goods. All three 
 establishments serve remarkably good fish and provide value for our 
 diminished dining-out dollars. My old friend Tom White and son Adam 
 have done something transformational with their Boathouse---a dining 
 adventure in an understated hip setting. Arigato and Super Rica stake 
 out their delicious niches. Eladio&apos;s and Brophy&apos;s both call when we&apos;re 
 doing an SB Staycation. We love to splurge at the upscale places, but 
 they&apos;ll have to wait till the economy improves before getting back 
 into our budgets. 

 Election Night : 
 Speaking of emails, I received a message from KEYT reporter John 
 Palminteri letting me know about some of the restaurants that will be 
 hosting election night parties : Dale Francisco - Joes Caf, 
 Steve Cushman - Arts and Letters Caf, Helene Schneider - Dargans, 
 Grant House - State&amp;A, David Pritchett - Jills Place (Shalhoobs), 
 John Thyne - Rubys State St. Caf, Michael Self&amp;Frank Hotchkiss - Left at Albuquerque.

 Wine Cask Video Tour : Last Friday 
 proprietor Mitchell Sjerven gave me a tour of the Wine Cask 
 Restaurant (currently under construction) and I brought my video 
 camera along . Learn about plans for the restaurant, private dining 
 room, Wine Cask Bar Cafe (formerly Intermezzo) and the new wine store&amp;tasting room.

 The Thanksgiving Restaurant List : Each 
 November my inbox is swamped with the same question: Which 
 restaurants serve a traditional turkey dinner on Thanksgiving Day? Last week I made a hundred phone calls to find the answer, just for 
 Restaurant Guy readers. You should make reservations EARLY because many 
 places will be sold out weeks in advance. Here is my list which is also

 flavors of McConnell&apos;s Ice Cream in addition to providing 10 flavors of 
 self-serve frozen yogurt, 30 toppings and an assortment of bulk candy. Sweet Alley opened at 955 Embarcadero del Mar in Isla Vista last February.
 Off Topic : You probably recognize 
 some of these people from the movies and television. In reality, you have never 
 seen 
 any of them before. They are all look-alikes for hire from a service in 
 the U.K. called Fake Faces .

 Wine Cask Update : The new 
 estimated opening date of the Wine Cask restaurant is November 
 16th. The neighboring Wine Cask Intermezzo has been renamed&quot; Wine Cask 
 Bar Cafe .&quot;

 Rumor Machine : On October 15th I 
 mentioned that the&quot;For Sale&quot;signs have been taken down from the Big Yellow House in Summerland. This morning the Rumor Machine popped out a message, 
 printed on 100% recycled paper, that read:&quot;The Big Yellow House 
 property has changed ownership and now belongs to the bank that carried 
 the loan when the restaurant was purchased a few years ago.&quot;As always, this rumor 
 might be completely false or a brilliant forecast of future events. Your 
 call.

 Jake&apos;s Cafe Closes : Reader Richard tells 
 me that Jake&apos;s Cafe at 2911 De La Vina Street has closed for a second time. Jake&apos;s Cafe closed last April 12th 
 then reopened a week later. It&apos;s interesting to note that I happened to 
 mention Jake&apos;s address in my blog yesterday as part of that hugely 
 successful poll (not). Hopefully this isn&apos;t the beginning of a Restaurant Guy curse .

 Organic Soup Kitchen : On Saturday, 
 November 7th 2-6pm at Yoga Soup, 26 Parker Way (around the corner from 
 SB Roasting Co.), there is a fundraiser with music, food, drink and a 
 silent auction to support a free thanksgiving day dinner to 
 financially challenged families&amp;individuals. The November 26th dinner 
 will serve approximately 300 meals at the Veterans Memorial Building 112 
 W. Cabrillo Blvd. 
 Tickets are $25. For more information call 886-7427.

 Free Hot Dogs : You can get a free 
 hot dog today at Surf 
 Dog off of Bailard Ave in Carpinteria. Owner Bill Connell 
 recently won a victory over state tax officials in Sacramento.

 Off Topic : If you don&apos;t own an 
 iPhone you can stop reading today&apos;s blog right here. I recently bought 
 one of the highest rated iPhone apps: RedLaser . It lets you scan 
 any product&apos;s barcode with your iPhone&apos;s camera and it tells you where 
 you can find it online. You just hold the iPhone&apos;s camera over the 
 barcode, with no need to tap any on-screen buttons, and it promptly does 
 a price comparison with Amazon.com, Google Products Search and many 
 other sites.
  I was at Best Buy recently and ended up saving $40 when I 
 pointed out to the staff that the two hard drives I was about to 
 purchase were far less expensive at BestBuy.com. The Best Buy staff promptly 
 lowered the price with no trouble at all. Needless to say RedLaser 
 ($1.99) is now a must-have app for me.

 Three Pickles Opens in Goleta : Three Pickles deli has opened at 420 S. Fairview Ave in Goleta and I added them to the 
 restaurant guide today. Current hours are Mon-Fri 11am-3pm and they 
 expect to add breakfast soon and begin opening at 6am. It&apos;s not obvious 
 from the road where they are located so look for the red umbrellas 
 partially hidden behind some trees!

 Beyond The Bubble : Occasionally I 
 write about restaurants outside of Santa Barbara. Here is a tip about a 
 new, red 
 hot restaurant in Santa Monica: R&amp;D Kitchen . This restaurant, 
 open to the public, is the research and development location for the Houstons restaurant chain. They test all sorts of new dishes there 
 to see what&apos;s popular and then transport the best stuff over to the menu 
 at Houstons. My friend was dining there last week and noticed Arnold 
 Schwarzenegger at a table nearby. They don&apos;t accept reservations so 
 there is always a line (except for the governor who came through the 
 back door). R&amp;D Kitchen 1323 Montana Ave, Santa Monica (310) 395-3314

 Poll: Who Serves Swedish Meatballs? : 
 Reader Graham sent me a message:&quot;My family and I miss Skandi buffet 
 (long since gone from 2911 De La Vina). Can you put out a call to find 
 if Santa Barbara hosts any other good place to get Swedish meatballs ?&quot;If you have any suggestions for Graham, please send me an email .

 
Reader Glenn says:&quot;Only other thing that come up on a Google search is 
 Bit O&apos; Denmark in Solvang along with The Red Viking (they have a 
 smorgasbord though I have never been to it) though I think they call 
 them&quot;Danish Meatballs&quot;instead of&quot;Swedish&quot;ones. Apparently Danish 
 food is not much different than Swedish food (they are right next to 
 each other on a map).&quot;
 
Reader Jonathan says: Here is what a Swedish friend in town had to say:&quot;No servings of meat balls in SB as far as I know. Let me know if you 
 find one.I think SB is ripe for a good Scandinavia Restaurant..and 
 not the &apos;old&apos; buffet style that was on De La Vina. Best bet is IKEA in 
 Burbank or make them yourself using the frozen Small Party Meat balls at 
 Trader Joes, fry them in butter, serve with boiled potatoes (new 
 potatoes), brown cream sauce and lingon berries from Gelsons.Im 
 getting hungry&quot;

 during November it will become&quot; China Palace .&quot;China Pavilion 
 continues to own several restaurants in town including their flagship 
 location at 1202 Chapala Street, Ichiban Sushi on the Mesa and China 
 Express on Milpas.

 Dining Detective : For Lease signs 
 have appeared at Left 
 At Albuquerque , 700 State Street. I called the restaurant and 
 was told we have no idea why SIMA put the signs there and was assured 
 that the restaurant has no plans to close. The same mysterious signs 
 briefly appeared in February.

 Top Chef : On Thursday October 29th 
 Hotel Mar Monte at 1111 E. Cabrillo Blvd presents&quot;An evening with Top

 Zagat Releases Survey Results : 
 Zagat just released their highly-respected 2010 Zagat Survey of restaurants 
 and I had an opportunity to glance at the booklet covering the Santa 
 Barbara region. Zagat only surveyed about 60 local restaurants so if 
 your favorite place didnt make the list, it doesnt necessarily mean it 
 received a low ranking.

The Top Food results are identical to last year except that In-N-Out 
 Burger moved up from 5th place to 4th place and Wine Cask moved up from 
 4th place to Heaven. The Top Service results are identical to last year 
 except that Coast Restaurant&amp;Bar has now made the top five. The Top 
 Dcor results are identical to last year except that Sevilla and Wine 
 Cask have walked off the list and strolled through the Pearly Gates.

The Most Popular results are identical to last year except that Ca 
 Dario moved up one notch taking Wine Casks former spot in 4th place and 
 Olio e Limone moved from out of the top five into 5th place. The three 
 anchors in the Best Buy category last year have again taken top honors.

 Oktoberfest : 
 This just in from Brewhouse at 229 W. Montecito Street:
 
Its back! The Brewhouse is once again hosting Santa Barbaras only 
 authentic Oktoberfest celebration. This weekend, Friday October 2nd and 
 Saturday October 3rd , the Brewhouse parking lot will be transformed 
 into a German Beer Garden featuring authentic music, costumes, food, 
 glassware and of course beer. I really enjoy Oktoberfest Bier says 
 brewmaster Pete Johnson. This style has been described as a liquid poem 
 to the glories of malted barley. The Brewhouse will feature traditional 
 Oktoberfest beers from two of Munichs great breweries (Spaten and 
 Hofbrau) as well as theirr own interpretation of the style. Our version 
 is fairly traditional, smooth and malty, with a touch more hops than the 
 classic German versions say Pete.

In addition to beer there will be great food. Bratwurst with sauerkraut 
 and fresh baked pretzels will be available in the Beer Tent, with the 
 full Brewhouse menu available in the restaurant. And speaking of 
 bratwurst dont miss the Shalhoob Bratwurst eating contest. This event 
 is always great big fun says Pete. The last few years weve had world 
 hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut give us a demonstration of how it 
 should be done. Sadly this year a previous commitment forced him to 
 cancel, but Im sure our local gluttons can still put on a great show. 
 There will be lots of other games and prizes, including a German costume 
 contest, beer trivia game, and a stein carrying competition. Friday 
 night will feature Hans the Red Baron playing the sounds of Oktoberfest 
 and leading us in many Prosts. Saturday night Oktubafest, a 12 piece 
 tuba band, will take the stage. Ach du lieber!

 Sea Change : This just in from Seagrass at 
 30 E. Ortega Street:
 
 Chef John Pettitt Joins Seagrass Restaurant as Executive Chef 
 Pettitt takes the helm and puts his own spin on Santa Barbara-style 
 Coastal Cuisine 

Santa Barbara, CA Chef John Pettitt joined Seagrass Restaurant as 
 executive chef, leading the established team of chef de cuisine Greg 
 Murphy and sous chef Adriana Heiler. Pettit comes with impressive 
 credentials, having worked for high profile restaurants in San Francisco 
 (Gary Danko, Masas and the Dining Room at the Ritz Carlton), Los 
 Angeles (Melisse and Michaels) and more recently Santa Barbara (Wine 
 Cask and The Hungry Cat).

Chef Pettitt is a seasoned professional who brings stellar talent to 
 the table along with valuable management expertise, comments Proprietor 
 Mitchell Sjerven. Patrons will be delighted by the evolution of the 
 menu and enjoy his frequent presence in the dining room. While he will 
 absolutely be hands-on in the kitchen, the strength and depth of our 
 kitchen team will allow him to interact with guests on a regular basis, 
 too. I am a firm believer in making the dining experience personal, and 
 am excited to see Seagrass flourish and reach new culinary heights under 
 chefs leadership!

The menu has been completely revamped by Chef Pettitt. New offerings 
 include local ridgeback prawns with blood orange and fennel; beef ribeye 
 with wild mushrooms and sauce bordelaise; and Pacific cod with chorizo 
 and razor clams. Seagrass will continue to feature regionally-sourced 
 ingredients, fresh catch from local waterspredominantly Santa Barbara 
 and exclusively Pacificand a meticulous selection of Santa Barbara 
 County Wines.

Seagrass isnt all about seafood, despite what the name might infer. 
 Coastal Cuisine is more of a philosophy than a genre or category. 
 Seagrass celebrates local bounty and embraces the local lifestylefrom 
 the rich natural resources at our fingertips to the relaxed-yet-refined 
 atmosphere that permeates Santa Barbara. While seafood is a core 
 specialty, the menu is diverse enough to cater to all tastes and fluid 
 enough to keep regulars palates entertained. Seagrass supports local 
 farmers, fishermen and purveyors, and participates in the Ty Warner Sea 
 Center Sustainable Seafood Program.

ABOUT CHEF PETTITT

 a part-time job for extra cash became a love for the fast-paced

 restaurants including Gary Danko, Masas and the Dining Room at the

 Java Jones To Become&quot;Jitters&quot; : This 
 just in from the new owners of Java Jones at 
 728 State Street:
 
Hey John,

I read your column weekly and would just like to let you know that my 
 wife and I have just purchased the Java Jones at 728 State Street. We 
 took over a few months ago and have attempted to clean it up and bring 
 it back to its former glory. We are renaming it Jitters Coffee . For nine 
 years I owned the Old Kings Road, but after having two children decided 
 that maybe the bar business was not the one for me anymore!

Our aim is to be a locally owned business and support locally owned 
 businesses. At the same time we are being very earth conscious. All our 
 coffee is certified organic fair trade and roasted by Greenstar in 
 Goleta. Our teas are all organic fair trade and currently come from Ojai 
 but we are in the midst of finding a more local (How much more local can 
 you get? Well, we&apos;ll see!) organic, fair trade tea. We are also talking 
 to local farmers from the farmers market to get our produce organic and 
 local. All my bakery products come from Jacks Bagels in Carp. or 
 Spudnuts on Upper State.

All our paper products are either recyclable or compostable, although 
 compostable is not the way to go in Santa Barbara due to there being non 
 commercial facility here. It is all also purchased from local suppliers. 
 We have invested in an electrical usage minimizer and solar powered 
 fans, as well as a high powered hand dryer that minimizes waste and cost 
 less than $1 per 1,000 drys.

Just thought I would let you know what is going on down here and that we 
 hope local Santa Barbarians will support us in our effort to support 
 them. It is as important to support local as any other environmental 
 initiative. Lets stop sending our money to corporate offices in other 
 cities, States or even countries.

Thanks for your time John,

Ross and Bridget Cathie

 Thank You : On September 3rd reader Karen asked blog readers for help 
 finding a Happy Hour get together location for a celebration of being 
 cancer-free for 5 years. I just received this follow-up message:
 
After posting a notice on SantaBarbara.com stating that I was looking 
 for a nice Happy Hour spot to celebrate being cancer-free for 5 years, I 
 received an invitation from Stacey, Director of Events, for Elements Restaurant&amp;Bar . After telling her we&apos;d have 30-35 people in 
 attendance, she reserved the entire lower patio for us (which overlooks 
 the gorgeous Courthouse Sunken Gardens--especially beautiful at sunset). 
 I ordered several appetizers, including warm, roasted nuts, marinated 
 olives and several cheese platters. Not only did the food exceed my 
 expectations, but the service was excellent too. A big thank you to our 
 waiters, Ben and Robert, as well as Stacey for making this an evening I 
 will always remember.

 Poll: Who Serves The Best Fish Tacos? Reader Kent tells me he just returned from Hawaii where he enjoyed great 
 fish tacos and is now wondering which local restaurant serves the best 
 fish tacos. Many readers offered suggestions for Kent, posted below.

 
Reader Alisa says:&quot;Sounds weird, I know, but Carl&apos;s Jr. has 
 great fish tacos. Great baja sauce, two soft corn tortillas and salsa 
 bar to dress it up. Shoreline Cafe also has awesome fish tacos 
 with a delicious creamy chipotle sauce on the side.&quot;
 
Reader Lauren says:&quot;Hand&apos;s down - Shoreline Cafe .&quot;
 
Reader Chris says:&quot; Hollister Brewing Co in Goleta has great fish 
 tacos. Grilled fish, not fried. Yum! Lots of fresh veggies and a killer 
 cilantro sauce of some sort.&quot;
 
Reader Caitlin says:&quot; Hungry Cat tacos... tortillas made to 
 order, grilled swordfish, fresh guac, so good!&quot;
 
Reader Carrie says:&quot;Without a doubt, it SB Shellfish Co. on the 
 Pier or Boathouse . They are pretty much the same since both restaurants 
 have the same owners. Choose between lobster or shrimp. Both are sauted 
 with garlic and shallots and are absolutely delish!!!&quot;
 
Reader Jonathon says:&quot;Although some would argue otherwise, a true fish 
 taco is and should be a lightly battered piece of fish on two CORN 
 tortillas, chopped cabbage, and a drizzle of white sauce. Accompanied by 
 lime wedges and a chile based salsa. Unfortunately SB has too many 
 places that bastardize the classic perfection of flavor and texture. I&apos;d 
 have to say I have yet to find a truly great fish taco in Santa Barbara, 
 but if you get a craving the ones at Mexican Fresh Taqueria on 
 the Mesa and Esau&apos;s in Carp are both pretty decent. Both suffer 
 though from usually being oversized and falling apart. A fish taco 
 should be something you can easily consume holding the taco in one hand 
 a cold cerveza in the other at a roadside stand.&quot;
 
Reader Deena says:&quot; SB Shellfish Co. of course!!! They are the 
 best. Great now I am hungry.&quot;
 
Reader Jonathan says:&quot; Minnow Cafe . Down in the marina around the 
 corner from Brophys.&quot;
 
Reader Jeff says:&quot;Of course I&apos;m a little biased when the subject of 
 fish tacos comes up, but I&apos;ve been told by many of our customers that we 
 have the best in town. Our formula is simple: we exclusively serve Ono, 
 and we do it either flame grilled or blackened spicy on soft corn 
 tortillas with a little cheese, cabbage and our fresh Pico de gallo. 
 Kent, come give Wahoo&apos;s a try! All the best, Jeff, Wahoo&apos;s Fish Tacos &quot;
 
Reader Laura says:&quot; Enterprise Fish Co. and Coast have 
 great fish tacos and Boathouse has great shrimp tacos. Yum, yum, 
 yum, yum, yum!&quot;
 
Reader Meghan says:&quot;I love the fish tacos at Wahoos !! They are 
 a great deal, great taste and a great restaurant to enjoy them at!!&quot;
 
Reader Josh says:&quot;Just found a terrific little hole-in-the-wall...&quot; La 
 Carreta &quot;in the K-mart shopping center has phenomenal fish tacos 
 (several varieties). They had a sort of &apos;tropical&apos; seared shark taco, 
 and a sort of creamy almost stewed salmon taco. Delicious.&quot;
 
Reader Jayne says:&quot;I really think Epiphany has GREAT fish

 138 E Canon Perdido Street is offering an Heirloom Tomato Tasting Menu on 
 Tuesday September 22. It will be seven courses featuring tomatoes from Roots 
 Farms, Tamai Farms&amp;Earth Trine Farms. There will be wine pairings with 
 all the courses as well. The price for this event is $125 per head 
 inclusive of tax and gratuity. Julienne is offering 46 seats to this 
 event and I am told they tend to go quickly. For more information visit 
 restaurantjulienne.com or call 845-6488.

 Little Alex&apos;s In and Out : Perhaps Little Alex&apos;s in Montecito should add a drive-up window to their restaurant. The 
 construction happening on Coast Village Road is causing big traffic 
 backups and, consequently, drivers are taking a&quot;shortcut&quot;through the Vons parking lot right past Little Alex&apos;s. There 
 is and endless chain of cars creeping through there all day now and I am sure that serving the 
 hungry drivers food while they&apos;re waiting would be a win-win for everyone. But I wouldn&apos;t go 
 so far as to recommend they change their name to&quot;Little Alex&apos;s In and 
 Out&quot;lest they draw the wrath of lawyers from In-N-Out Burger (see 
 yesterday&apos;s blog).

 Eateries In Name Dispute : In-N-Out Burger has sent a cease-and-desist notice to local 
 Vietnamese restaurant Saigon In and Out claiming that Saigons 
 name is confusingly similar. On July 22 legal representatives of 
 In-N-Out Burger of Irvine, CA delivered a letter to Saigon owner William 
 Lam stating that the use of In and Out in Saigons business name may 
 lead to likelihood-of-confusion and that doing business under the name 
 Saigon In and Out may constitute trademark infringement.
  Local attorney John J. Thyne III is representing Mr. Lam and 
 disagrees with In-N-Outs assertion. In a three page response Thyne 
 compares the differences between each companys name and logo and 
 includes the statement The strength of your clients mark does not 
 preclude use by others of the phrase in and out without additional 
 factors that could result in a likelihood of confusion on the part of 
 consumers. Thynes letter to In-N-Out ends with the statement Your 
 clients mark is not being affronted and despite your allegations there 
 is no likelihood of confusion between our clients products.
  I spoke with Mr. Lam who tells me We have nothing to do with 
 In-N-Out burger. We are a Vietnamese restaurant and are totally 
 different. We have a completely different logo and ours ends with the 
 phrase &apos;In and Out&quot;while theirs begins with the joined words 
 &apos;In-N-Out&apos;.

 Reader Tom: Hey John - I ate at Saigon I&amp;O and the food was great; I 
 would agree that the name is too similar though..... :) 
 
 Reader Robert: They are also on Mileage Plus Dining... S I&amp;O family 
 is related to the California Cleaners&apos; folks... Both good local 
 businesses 
 
 Reader Roy: John, thank you for posting those letters. John&apos;s reply 
 to their attorney is not only a literary masterpiece, he kicks em right 
 in the head like they should be ! Bravo! Thx for sharing, I enjoyed 
 every word of it 
 
 Reader Eric: Ya, I often go to Saigon and mistakenly ask for a Double 
 Double. Stupid. 
 
 Reader Julie: How can a phrase like&quot;in and out&quot;be trademarked?&quot;In-N-Out&quot;is different. Like can someone say they&quot;own&quot;the word&quot;cafe&quot;? Anyway, John, thanks for a great column. 
 
 Reader Aileen: I am always pulling up to In-N-Out and asking for the 
 Pho. Yes... very very confusing.&quot;In-N-Out - that&apos;s what Pho is allll 
 about!! 
 
 Reader Becky: John J. Thyne III is my new hero! And I definitely 
 intend to go seek out Saigon and have a meal. I&apos;ll be darned if I can 
 figure out why folks choose In&apos;N&apos;Out when they have the choice of 
 Hamburger Habit or Cal Taco, who serve similar, better food, at better 
 prices... Then again, I usually favor local businesses over national 
 chains. Reminds me of MooseHead Beer threatening Moose Drool Beer over 
 the similar name. MooseHead is big (and OK tasting); Moose Drool is tiny 
 (and wonderful, according to my beer loving friends). 
 
 Reader Mike: The response letter from John Thyne III is brilliant. I 
 believe this is the same gentleman running for city council. Your blog is 
 great! 
 

 Sweet Alley Coming To Camino Real Marketplace : 
 When McConnell&apos;s Ice 
 Cream in Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta closed last July I 
 received dozens of emails from locals asking me if I know what business 
 will be taking their place. Today I have an answer: Sweet Alley . 
 Sweet Alley is a popular self-serve frozen yogurt and ice cream shop at 
 955 Embarcadero del Mar in Isla Vista.
  I spoke with owner Geoffrey Friedman and he tells me that he 
 finalized the lease last Friday and hopes to open in November. Sweet 
 Alley will continue to offer 24 flavors of McConnells Ice Cream in 
 addition to providing 10 flavors of self-serve frozen yogurt, 30 
 toppings and an assortment of bulk candy. Friedman added What 
 McConnells had done there for so long is wonderful. Its a great 
 product. Its locally loved. We want to take it to what we think is the 
 next level.

 Make A Wish : During September Cold Stone Creamery (504 State St and 5718 Calle Real) is partnering 
 with Make-A-Wish Foundation. Here is the press-release:
 
TRI-COUNTIES, CA During September, Cold Stone Creamery locations will 
 host a month-long fundraising celebration to benefit the Make-A-Wish 
 Foundation of the Tri-Counties.

These twelve stores will work together raising funds to grant the wishes 
 of children with life-threatening medical conditions throughout Ventura, 
 Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. Cold Stone Creamery has 
 partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation since 2002, generating $3.2 
 million in donations. Five-year-old wish kid Jack teamed up with Cold 
 Stone Creamerys Tastemaster Ray Karam to create his own ice cream 
 Creation to celebrate the alliance this year. Jack was named Junior 
 Tastemaster as he created his special Creation with sweet cream ice 
 cream mixed with brownie, sprinkles and fudge.

Throughout the month, every Cold Stone store will sell paper Wish Stars 
 for $1 each. The celebration will reach its peak with the eighth 
 Worlds Largest Ice Cream Social. On Sept. 24, 2009, Cold Stone 
 locations will give away a 3-ounce portion of Jacks Creation from 5-8 
 p.m. in exchange for a donation to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

This month-long fundraiser is a great and easy opportunity for our 
 community to support such a heartwarming organization, said Mike Briggs 
 owner of Cold Stone Creamery in Goleta and Santa Barbara. Cold Stone 
 ice cream, children and wishes coming true create the perfect 
 combination for a joyful experience.

 Poll: Best Happy Hour? If you can 
 help reader Karen please send me an email and I&apos;ll post it here.
 
Hey John,

I&apos;m planning a Happy Hour get together on 9/9/09 in celebration of being 
 cancer-free for 5 years!! Can you ask your readers for their favorite 
 happy hour spots? The restaurant/bar should be able to accommodate 30-40 
 people, with decent parking and ability to order some appetizers. Would 
 like to stay away from the downtown bar scene.

Warmly,
Karen
 
 
Reader Tony says:&quot;The Brew House!&quot;
 
Reader Laurie says:&quot;FisHouse! They may be able to give her a separate 
 area for this event. They have their own lot and a city lot right next 
 door. Rockin fish tacos.&quot;
 
Reader Ryan says:&quot;I would say Zodos... They have a big enough place... 
 And on Wed around happy hour, I wouldn&apos;t think it&apos;s too busy. Or, you 
 could always reserve upstairs at Blue Agave (when we did, we didn&apos;t have 
 to pay anything... Just guarantee that $XXX amount would be spent while 
 there, which wasn&apos;t a problem with our crowd of 40 or so)&quot;
 
Reader Michelle says:&quot;Hello John, We would love to help Karen celebrate 
 such a wonderful milestone. Epiphany would be honored to host a happy 
 hour cocktail reception. We do not charge a room fee and offer half

 appetizers. We do also offer complimentary hors d&apos;oeuvres for our happy 
 hour from 5-7. Kind Regards, Michelle Mastrangelo, Epiphany Restaurant&quot;

 Simply Pies Opening Storefront On Saturdays : 
 A local bakery&quot;Simply Pies&quot;sent me a press-release yesterday to share with you:
 
 Santa Barbaras First Organic Pie Shop and Bakery To Open 
Simply Pies, the only local organic pie, quiche and cheesecake bakery,
Launches Saturday storefront service on September 12
 
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. Simply Pies, the only Santa Barbara-based bakery 
 specializing in organic pies, quiches and cheesecakes, announces new 
 Saturday retail operation hours beginning with a grand opening on 
 September 12. The bakery located at 2611 De La Vina in Santa Barbara 
 will be open Saturdays from 11AM to 3PM. At their retail opening, fresh 
 baked whole or sliced pies and quiches along with take-and-bake frozen 
 pies and crusts will also be on hand. Crust options include sweet, 
 savory, gluten-free and vegan. Customers can order in advance for pick 
 up on Saturday to ensure their favorite baked item will be available.

Simply Pies specializes in pies, quiches and cheesecakes made with 
 organic ingredients purchased from environmentally friendly neighborhood 
 businesses, farmers and co-ops. It is the first and only Santa Barbara 
 bakery to offer gluten free, vegan and regular sweet or savory crusts. 
 Sugar free alternatives are also available on some of their pies. 
 Everything is homemade and handcrafted, just like Grandma used to make.

Our customers love to tell us about childhood memories that our pies 
 evoke, said Nancy Blau, co-founder of Simply Pies. The tastes and 
 smells coming from their moms and grandmas kitchens were warm, 
 delightful experiences. Unfortunately, for many this tradition has been 
 lost in our fast food culture. Simply Pies wants to take you back to 
 the basics and fill that void with baked-to-order, fresh, delicious 
 pies baked with only the best produce from local farmers.

Simply Pies offers a variety of sizes for every group and occasion. Six 
 and nine-inch pies and quiches, and cheesecakes in four and eight-inch 
 sizes are available. They are also fondly known as makers of the pielet, 
 a three-inch version that has been a favorite with diners at the Santa 
 Barbara Art Museums Museum Caf, an early Simply Pies customer. Now, 
 visitors to the Simply Pies bakery will be able to create and enjoy 
 their own custom flight of three 3-inch pielets to sample a variety of 
 different flavors. The pielets have also been a popular choice for 
 weddings and other special occasions.

In addition to the Saturday storefront service, items can be ordered any 
 day of the week for pick up or delivery through the Simply Pies web site 
 or by phone. For added convenience, all items can also be received 
 through the Plow to Porch organic produce home delivery service.

 Off Topic : Tomorrow the Internet 
 celebrates its 40th birthday ( see

 1969, when about 20 people gathered in a laboratory at UC Los Angeles, 
 to watch as two bulky computers passed meaningless test data through a 
 15-foot cable. That was the beginning of the fledgling Arpanet network 
 which later became known as the Internet. By the end of 1969 UC Santa

 first 4 nodes in what became a world wide computer network.

 SantaBarbara.com) and in 1990 British physicist Tim Berners-Lee,

 Help, Help Rhonda : I received an 
 email from reader Rhonda looking for a deli that sells corned beef by 
 the pound (and not just in sandwiches). If you have any suggestions 
 send me an email and I will post it here.
 
Hi John -

I&apos;ve been looking for some great corned beef for sandwiches. I&apos;ve been 
 to several delis, but they offer only sandwiches. Surprisingly enough I 
 went to a couple yesterday that don&apos;t even have corned beef on their 
 menu. Do you have any suggestions as to where I can find some really 
 good, tender corned beef by the pound?

Love your column, by the way.
Thanks,
Rhonda
 
 
Reader JS says&quot;I could be wrong but I think Gelson&apos;s sells prepared 
 corn beef by the pound. Probably worth a call. I know for sure they have 
 brined, ready to fire corned beef in the meat section that you can take 
 home and cook yourself.&quot;
 
Reader Roy says:&quot;What about &apos;Ye Olde Butcher Shoppe&apos; on that road by La 
 cumbre, modoc etc on the way to state st?? I bet they woul;d have it. 
 Otherwise maybe country meat market, on Calle Real.&quot;
 
Reader Tina says:&quot;I work at Vons on Turnpike and we have corned beef 
 in the Service Deli ready to be sliced and sold by the pound.&quot;
 
Reader Mary Lou says:&quot;Gelsons market deli has good corn beef by the 
 pound.&quot;
 

 The Royal Chef Returns for CASA : I 
 just received this press-release about an upcoming event:
 
 Princess Dis Chef and CASA Serve Up A Royal Event at Casa del 
 Herrero in Montecito 

Don your tiaras and brush up on your British accent at The Royal Chef 
 Returns for CASA special four-course dinner that will be held on

 of Michaels Catering, Kristine Castillo, Village Modern Foods, and 
 pastry chef Christine Dahl of Christine Dahl Pastries to present a

 Special Advocates (CASA)-Santa Barbara County.

Sponsors of The Royal Chef Returns for CASA include Michaels 
 Catering, Village Modern Foods, Demetria Estate Winery, Christine Dahl 
 Pastries, and David and Tracy Beard.

The scrumptiously successful second annual Royal Chef event was a

 training, and screening of volunteer advocates for foster children in 
 the juvenile dependency system in Santa Barbara County.

Tickets ($250) may be purchased by contacting Riley at CASA at 
 805.845.8364 ext. 24 or via email at riley@sbcasa.org. A shuttle service

 The Nugget Coming To Goleta : 
 Summerland&apos;s popular Nugget restaurant will be opening a second location 
 at 5685 Calle Real in Goleta, the former home of Kona Ranch House . I 
 spoke with owner Bob Montgomery and he tells me that he is hoping for a 
 November grand opening.

The restaurant will have the same menu and same prices as the iconic 
 Summerland eatery. Montgomery tells me that he will be duplicating the 
 distinctive interior of the Nugget and is importing barn wood from Idaho 
 to recreate the homey look&amp;feel. You might even see a moose head or 
 other wild animal on the walls surrounding diners enjoying a drink at 
 the large all-copper bar.

Jerome Bohnett, manager of the Summerland Nugget (and former owner of 
 the Big Yellow House restaurant) will be manager and part owner of the 
 new Goleta location.

 California Crisp Opens 
 This Week : The new sandwiches&amp;salads restaurant California 
 Crisp will open by the end of this week at 718 State Street, the former 
 home of Fat Burger .

California Crisp was established in 1979 with the 
 mission&quot;to provide delicious, healthy food made to order, using fresh 
 ingredients, in a fast service format.&quot;They have grown to fourteen 
 stores located in regional shopping centers and food courts that span 
 from San Diego to Portland, Oregon.

Owner Craig Hopkins tells me that one of the focal 
 points will be the carver station. They will have fresh roasted 
 turkey, roast beef and tri-tip carved daily for sandwiches. The downtown 
 eatery will also offer six specialty salads (or create your own), a 
 variety of wraps, paninis, seared ahi and eight different types of 
 pizza. Dinner entrees will also be available after 4pm. California Crisp 
 offers Dream Cake desserts from the Cheesecake Factory . Most items on 
 the menu cost $5-$9.

 Off Topic : Last Friday I attended 
 the South Coast Community Coalition&apos;s forum where candidates for city 
 council and mayor were asked questions on a variety of topics. I shot 
 some videos of the mayoral candidates ( Helene Schneider , Isaac 
 Garrett , Dale Francisco , Iya Falcone , Steve Cushman ) responding to 
 questions from moderator Phil Bugay. In the first video, mayoral 
 candidate Iya Falcone addresses the signature-gathering issue that made the 
 news recently.

 What will be your 
 three top priorities as mayor? Do we have a 
 revenue problem or a spending problem? Follow-up questions 
 to answers about revenue/spending problem Should Santa 
 Barbara extend the building permits for La Entrada?

 Off Topic : My friend&quot;Flip&quot;in Texas

 and three-time surfing world champion Tom Curren.

 
Reader Dianne says&quot;Just a guess. Are you 7th row 4th from the left?&quot;
 
Reader Wendy says&quot;7 rows down, 6 columns over. No one under you, one to 
 the right of center.&quot;
 
Reader Elizabeth says:&quot;You look like the kid that&apos;s 3rd row from the 
 bottom and 4th from the right. Tom Curren looks like the kid from the 
 2nd row from the top and 1st left. Doesn&apos;t matter which generation 
 their from, kids have the same expressions.&quot;
 
Reader Deena says&quot;7 rows down, 4th in from the right. Either that or 
 someone with pigtails. :-)&quot;
 
Reader Peter says&quot;Um.....not sure if this is fair, since I was in your 
 grade....though apparently not in your class.....but sixth column, 
 bottom row is you. And as for Tommy, I think he is (and this is really a 
 guess because I can hardly remember him actually being at school!) First 
 column, just below Leslie Wells.&quot;

 Doug Margerum and Mitchell Sjerven 
 Reopening Wine Cask In November : New owners Doug Margerum 
 and Mitchell Sjerven plan to reopen the Wine Cask restaurant this 
 November. Margerum owned the Wine Cask from 1981 until he sold it in 2007. Sjerven currently owns local 
 restaurants bouchon and Seagrass . 
 Here is the official press-release:
 
 Local Duo Acquire Wine Cask 

Former owner Doug Margerum and Santa Barbara restaurateur Mitchell 
 Sjerven have joined forces to bring back the venerable Wine Cask. 
 Margerum, who owned and operated the awardwinning institution since 
 1981 before selling in 2007, and Sjerven, who owns Santa Barbara 
 restaurants bouchon and Seagrass both took the restaurants closure 
 personally. Rather than simply sit back and allow a permanent demise 
 of the Wine Cask, the duo instead decided to combine their passion and 
 talents. It wasnt so much the business side of the equationthings 
 happen, restaurants are tough even in good timesbut the personal 
 aspect of seeing what had been the formative decades of my 
 professional career just evaporate, relates Margerum.

Sjerven, too, believes the Wine Cask magic can be recreated yet still 
 evolve. Many of the old menu favorites will do an encore but, at the 
 same time, much has changed in the way guests approach the dining 
 experience. Some of the luster of fine dining is gone, Sjerven 
 admits. The modern diner yearns for a greater connectivity to the 
 food and wine they savor while simultaneously avoiding the pomp and 
 circumstance of what fine dining has come to mean. They want comfort, 
 value and familiarity and we aim to provide it.

Now a respected wine maker, Margerum makes Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc and 
 other smallproduction lots at his winery in the Santa Ynez Valley. 
 Margerum will develop the Wine Cask wine program with one eye on the 
 past history and another to the future. So much has changed in the 
 wine business just in the last twenty years it defies belief, states 
 Margerum. If you had told the handful of local wineries in Santa 
 Barbara in the early 80s that in less than 20 years there would be 
 nearly 200 wineries in the County, Pinot Noir would be the top grape 
 in the area and CostCo would be the leading retailer no one would have 
 believed you. Add to that the proliferation of tasting clubs and 
 online purchasing and its easy to see the retail landscape hasand 
 continues torapidly evolve.

Sjerven looks forward to returning Intermezzo, Wine Casks Caf 
 sibling, to its former glory. Our locals made the Gold Room at the 
 Wine Cask the special occasion dining spot, Sjerven recalls, but it 
 was Intermezzo that they missed more immediately for that pretheater 
 or after work quick bite and a glass of wine. Look for local 
 ingredients, great wines bytheglass and a flavorful lineup of 
 organic, marketfresh cocktails.

Of course service is critical as well, in that patrons are more 
 awareand savvythen ever before. I love striving to provide the 
 ultimate in hospitality, Sjerven offers, staff at my restaurants 
 know that we want conciergelevel serviceanything we can do to make 
 the experience richer, more enjoyable, we will do.

Sjerven counts time at Wine Cask as a server in the early 90s as 
 pivotal in forging his own career path in the restaurant industry. 
 Experiencing firsthand the joy diners expressed when enjoying a 
 quality wine dining experience was an unbeatable feeling. I knew that 
 suited me to a t even then. What he didnt know was one day hed 
 come full circle as an owner of the very institution that inspired 
 him.

Just exactly how the menu and wine list will evolve Sjerven and 
 Margerum arent saying. We want some element of surprise, a sense of 
 anticipation, rather than just reveal everything says Sjerven, with a 
 wink.
 
 Union 
 Ale Opens Friday : Union Ale Brewing Company opens at 214 
 State Street (across from Enterprise Fish Co.) on August 14th. Hours

 Off Topic : Believe it or not, 
 SantaBarbara.com has dozens of guides unrelated to restaurants. I just 
 started work on a new Hiking Guide and added Jesusita Trail . I hiked the burnt-to-a-crisp Jesusita Trail all the

 continuously record my hiking path, elevation&amp;photo locations and then I plotted all 
 the data on a map.

 Burger Bus Update : I received a 
 message from the folks who bring you the The Burger Bus :
 
Hello John-
I wanted to let you know that have have made some changes and additions 
 to our food. We have created a Falafel sandwich that is quite wonderful. 
 We use 5 of our Falafel balls on top of grilled onion, tomato and 
 cucumber along with our spicy peanut sauce piled onto ciabatta. As well, 
 we have a new burger, the Pesto Burger. Grilled onion, tomato, fresh 
 basil and our Pesto Jack on ciabatta with a balsamic glaze. It is, in 
 our opinion, really delicious! We hope you stop by and try us out again 
 soon. Take care and thanks again for all your support.
Sincerely,
Cheryl and Michael Gardner

 Off Topic : To say that Michael Jackson has been in the news a lot recently is an 
 understatement. His name has received so much press in the weeks since 
 he died on June 25th, I started wondering how the media exposure of 
 Michael Jackson&apos;s death compared to that of other musicians and 
 well-known 
 figures who died tragically in the last 50 years. By one measurement, 
 my research reveals that the media exposure of Michael Jackson&apos;s death 
 is exceeded only by that of the passing of Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
 President John F. Kennedy.

  Many people have been comparing the death of Michael 
 Jackson to that of Elvis Presley. When it comes to media exposure, 
 using my benchmark, the King of Pop far exceeded that of the King of 
 Rock&amp;Roll.

  To compare media exposure across 50 years you need to use a media 
 source that has been around for 50 years so I chose the Los Angeles 
 Times that has been publishing daily news since 1881. I decided to use 
 the front page of the Los Angeles Times as the benchmark. Over 
 the last few weeks I spent a few hours studying micro film archives of 
 the Los Angeles Times at the Santa Barbara Public Library and at 
 UCSB.

  I counted the number of consecutive days a 
 person was mentioned on the front page of the Los Angeles Times, 
 starting with the first day their death was reported. I stopped 
 counting the first day the Los Angeles Time was published with no 
 mention of the deceased name on the front page.

  To make the list a person must have died 
 unexpectedly/tragically. I included several musicians and well-known 
 figures for comparison.

 Name Died Consecutive days mentioned on the
front page of the Los Angeles Times
  
 LA Times front page Jim Morrison 7/3/71 Not mentioned   Karen Carpenter 2/4/83 1 day Headline Kurt Cobain 4/8/94 1 day   Jimmy Hendrix 9/18/70 1 day   Grace Kelly 9/14/82 1 day Headline Tupac Shakur 9/13/96 1 day   Jerry Garcia 8/9/95 2 consecutive days Headline John Lennon 12/8/80 4 consecutive days Headline Elvis Presley 8/16/77 4 consecutive days Headline Robert F.

 New In The Guide : Today I added French Press to the restaurant guide.

 McConnell&apos;s Closes : It appears that McConnell&apos;s Ice Cream in Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta has gone out of business.

 Photo Blog : Yesterday I was given a very special tour of the new Tydes restaurant at the Coral Casino in Montecito and I 
 brought my camera along. The restaurant is only open to members of the 
 club and guests of the Four Seasons Biltmore. To say that the view is 
 spectacular is an understatement in this case. You are so close to the 
 ocean you almost feel like you are dining on a yacht. And every inch of 
 the property meets Ty Warner&apos;s incredibly high standards.

 French Press Opens : This just in 
 from the owners of the French Press , 1101 State Street:
 
 After 
 a whirlwind remodel and move in, The French Press has opened its doors 
 at 1101 State St!

We&apos;ve spent the last 10 years becoming fanatical about coffee and 
 espresso, about brewing it, about talking about it and definitely about 
 drinking it! So here we are! The FRENCH PRESS! We have worked extremely 
 quickly to create a space that we can all enjoy and taste delicious 
 espresso and coffee and whole leaf tea.

Using micro roasted coffee from Verve Coffee Roasters in Santa Cruz CA, 
 and exceptional brewing methods, such as French presses and (coming 
 soon!) vacuum pots and our beautiful La Marzocco espresso machine that 
 is on its way from Florence- (it will be here on Monday the 20th), we 
 will guarantee a unique and amazing experience every time.

We also love snacks and treats, and know how lovely a fresh baked cookie 
 tastes in the afternoon. We are looking forward to providing Santa 
 Barbara with a truly exceptional product in a beautiful setting!

So come see us soon for a cookie or a croissant and a pot of tea or a 
 macchiato. And coming soon sandwiches and salads!

If you are in the area, stop by and say hello. It&apos;s a beautiful space in 
 our beautiful city.

You will find us at 1101 State St, at the corner of State and Figueroa 
 from 6 am to 7 pm.

Thanks! We will see you soon!

 Holdren&apos;s&amp;Pastavino Ready To Launch :

 for Holdren&apos;s and a similar dedication on August 11th at 10am for 
 Pastavino.

  Holdren&apos;s restaurant seats 70 in the main dining room, 32 people in 
 the private dining red room (with wine display cases), and 50 people 
 on the heated, glass-enclosed patio. Holdren&apos;s will be open Monday 
 through Saturday, serving lunch 11am-3pm and dinner 4pm-close. On 
 Sundays they will serve brunch 10am-3pm and dinner 4pm-close.

 Goleta: Sirloin and Shrimp on Sunday, Tuesday&amp;Thursday along with 
 all-u-can-eat baby back ribs on Monday and Prime rib on Wednesday. All

 Pastavino at 685-7300.

 Rumor Machine : 
 With all the talk of wine this time of year, it is no surprise that 
 yesterday morning the Rumor Machines tray had a sheet of 100% recycled 
 paper resting in it with a message printed in 100% soy ink that read: A 
 new wine store will open soon in El Paseo.
  Before I tossed it into my 
 recycle bin I happened to notice a few more words printed on the 
 backside of the page: Ross or Marshall&apos;s will replace Linens N Things 
 in Camino Real Marketplace, with Ross being the candidate most likely to 
 take the space. As always, this rumor might be completely false or a 
 brilliant forecast of future events. Your call.

 Silver Screen Bash : 
 This Sunday, July 19 th , walk the red carpet at the Doubletree 
 resort to the Santa Barbara International Film Festivals 25 th anniversary party. General admission tickets are $75, VIP tickets are

 Sustainable Seafood : The Santa 
 Barbara Museum of Natural History&apos;s&quot; Sustainable Seafood &quot;program was 
 created to help the community make conscientious seafood choices that 
 support sustainable and environmentally sensitive fisheries. By helping 
 restaurants and markets replace unsustainable seafood items with 
 sustainable ones, they hope to shift thousands of dollars spent 
 supporting unsustainable fisheries to supporting the new sustainable 
 seafood movement.
  Participating restaurants include Aldos, Arts&amp;Letters Caf, Blue 
 Agave, Bouchon, Downeys, Brophy Bros, Coast, Elements, Epiphany, Fresco 
 Caf, Julienne, Seagrass and State&amp;A. Participating markets include 
 Santa Barbara Fish Market, Cadenas Fresh Fish, Kanaloa Seafood. For 
 more information visit sbseafood.org.

 Off Topic : I got into a car chase 
 with a bad guy last Friday evening. I had just turned on to my parents&apos; quiet cul-de-sac in Montecito 
 when a car came speeding towards me, then past me, followed by my parents&apos; 
 neighbor running down the street trying to get his license number. I 
 quickly went into pursuit but lost him.

  It turns out that the bad guy had just pulled on to my parents&apos; 10 mph 
 street while driving about 50 mph. He then proceeded to drive across my 
 parents&apos; lawn, through their garden, through their hedge, through the 
 neighbor&apos;s garden, across the neighbor&apos;s lawn, and smashed into the 
 neighbor&apos;s red convertible (while it was parked in the 
 driveway).

  The force of the impact was so great that it knocked the neighbor&apos;s car 
 from the right side of the driveway all the way over to the left side. 
 The bad guy sat there in a daze for a few moments until he saw neighbors 
 come outside to see what had caused such a horrible noise. He then sped 
 away even though the front end of his car was now totaled.

  I am told that the driver was a big, stocky, heavyset man with kind 
 of a square face and short brown hair. The car was a gray/silver Saab (newer 
 model) and the license plate begins with a&quot;5P&quot; . The 
 model likely was a sports sedan or a 2-door convertible with black 
 molding. If you 
 know a big bad dude with a smashed Saab that fits this description, please let me know .

 New In The Guide : I added Saigon In and Out to the restaurant guide, which opens for business today at 424 State 
 Street.

 Photo Blog : July 8, 2009 - Pictures of last night&apos;s grand opening dinner party at Saigon In and Out, 424 State Street. I went with my sister, nieces and 
 friends. Having sampled a few things on the menu, I really liked the egg 
 rolls, #22, #47, #78c and #82F. 

 Poll Results : I received more 
 responses to&quot; What new restaurant does Santa Barbara need? &quot; than any poll in the history of this blog (see last Thursday&apos;s poll 
 results). Here are a few more comments received after the poll closed:

 
Reader Grace says:&quot;I would like to have a good Greek restaurant 
 in the area. One where people could also do a little Greek and folk 
 dancing during the weekend. We still miss The Plaka.&quot;
 
Reader Susan says:&quot;What is it with all these people crying for national 
 chain restaurants? We have lots of restaurant talent in SB and many of 
 the ideas might be their cup of tea. I&apos;d love to see a good Jewish 
 Deli like Brent&apos;s in Thousand Oaks and the Valley. We could 
 also use a good French restaurant, but certainly not more 
 Italian. The best news is that SB offers a wonderful variety and that&apos;s 
 our icing on the cake!&quot;
 
Reader Sally says:&quot;Reading the answers was interesting and made me feel better about 
 what I would have suggested: Souplantation . It doesnt bother me 
 that it is a chain restaurant. However, if a local private citizen could 
 do what they do (and they use local, farmers market items when they are 
 able), more power to them. I cant afford to go out to most of the 
 restaurants in SB except occasionally, so a healthy salad bar/buffet 
 priced under $10 is more my cup of tea.&quot;
 
Reader Lisl says:&quot;I must say I am really surprised that no one felt the 
 lack of a good German restaurant, or better yet, an Austrian one. Austrian cooking is delicious and Viennese pastries, in my opinion, 
 better than French. And although China Pavilion comes close, there is no 
 really excellent Chinese restaurant here, and especially an inexpensive 
 one, such as proliferate in San Francisco. Definitely Jewish deli s 
 would be great too.&quot;
 
Reader Anonymous says:&quot;I don&apos;t want to insult all the good Santa 
 Barbarians, but between you and me, Julia Child was right : when 
 she was asked what she thought of Santa Barbara restaurants, she 
 declared that they were&quot;perfectly nice.&quot;That&apos;s about as far as i would 
 go, too. What&apos;s wrong with this town, that it doesn&apos;t have &quot;incredibly great&quot;or&quot;magnificent&quot;restaurants , with all the money 
 floating around in the area? For heavens&apos; sake, even little Ojai has The 
 Ranch House (very good); even little Carmel Valley up north has Baum&amp;Blume, The Corkscrew Cafe, and Cafe Rustica (all 3 better than very 
 good). I know SB can&apos;t be San Francisco or Manhattan, but there ought to 
 be at least one place that&apos;s beyond&quot;perfectly nice,&quot;don&apos;t you think?&quot;
 
Reader Danny says:&quot;I am puzzled at how many people want to see chains 
 open in town. We have enough of those as it is. Most types of 
 restaurants have already been covered but. I agree with many and think a Jewish deli would be really great. Barbecue would be 
 another good choice. Traditional Dim Sum using cart service is 
 another idea. &quot;
 
Reader Anonymous says:&quot;Santa Barbara should get a Pizza Fusion . 
 Great pizza, environmentally friendly company, and a gluten-free menu 
 for those who have Celiac Disease.&quot;
 
Reader Julie says:&quot;Bring on Wood Ranch or Cheesecake Factory !!!&quot;
 
Reader Ron says:&quot;How about a great reasonable priced bar and grill . 
 Good outside happy hour, good apps, nice late night fare..&quot;
 
Reader Roy says:&quot;Hey man, how about a REAL BBQ house for a 
 change...with some FRESHLY COOKED meat ( vs the day/days old previously 
 cooked meats at Woody&apos;s they reheat and serve) And...w some beef 
 brisket.. COME ON, is this SO hard to figure out, is there no market in 
 SB for real barbecue..???&quot;
 
Reader DeeAnna says:&quot; Mongolian BarBQue !!!&quot;
 
Reader Collette says:&quot;I definitely would love a Wagamamas . 
 originally in London, they&apos;ve made it as far as Boston so far. I know 
 it&apos;s a chain - but really is fantastic and unique to anything else I&apos;ve 
 seen. How about a good Greek restaurant.&quot;
 
Reader Margie says:&quot;How about a decent Indonesian restaurant? A 
 Vietnamese restaurant that only serves Vietnamese sandwiches (barbecued meats with condiments on crusty French baguettes).&quot;
 
Reader Ruth says:&quot; Il Fornaio for sure! I believe they are only 
 in California and Italy.&quot;
 
Reader Elizabethe says:&quot;One restaurant that consistently gives great 
 service, prepares good honest food and drink and doesn&apos;t break the bank . 
 Not a chain or formula. Is it so hard? Apparently so since that does not 
 exist in SB.&quot;
 
Reader Barbara says:&quot; NO national chain restaurants, please!!! &quot;
 
Reader Julie says:&quot;I agree with Barbara. So we don&apos;t have to wonder if 
 we&apos;re in Kansas or New Jersey.&quot;
 
Reader Amie says:&quot; Cheesecake Factory and Houston&apos;s &quot;
 
Reader Roy says:&quot;Yeah, yeah - I&apos;m with you, Amie ! And.. for those of 
 you who pleaded for &apos;no national chain restaurants, please&apos;: Fine - then 
 YOU STOP shopping at: Macy&apos;s, Best Buy, Costco, Sears, Kmart, Cost Plus 
 Imports, Save-On, Rite Aid, Longs Drugs , Ross, Nordstrom&apos;s, Victoria&apos;s 
 Secret, Bebe, Chico&apos;s,Linens n Things, Ralph&apos;s, Von&apos;s, Carl&apos;s Jr, Taco 
 ... Read MoreBell, In n Out Burger, Blenders in the Grass, Jamba Juice, 
 Starbucks, Peet&apos;s, Firestone Tires, Big Brand, Fantastic Sam&apos;s, 
 Supercuts, Petco, Trader Joes, Jiffy Lube, Kragen Auto Parts, 
 Doubletree, Four Seasons, etc etc etc...ALL &apos;NATIONAL CHAINS&apos;...so 
 please, no more absurd, moronic posts, unless you practice what you 
 preach ! please..&quot;
 
Reader Angela says:&quot;I just have to throw my two cents in there for what 
 restaurant we need here and I vote for WOODRANCH . They have the 
 best BBQ!! We only have 2 BBQ places here and they cant compete with 
 WOODRANCH! My second vote would be the Cheesecake Factory !&quot;
 
Reader John says:&quot;I was glad to see Eds comment on July 2 about how 
 much we need a real butcher in Santa Barbara. I dont expect to 
 walk in and get anything-you-can-think-of but its very difficult even 
 to order special items that you want, no matter the lead time. Most 
 dont even seem to know where their products come from unless its 
 Farmer John or Hormel. Try asking a local butcher if they carry Niman 
 Ranch. Most wont even know what youre talking about. By the way, Mr. 
 Niman has sold his business (he was broke) and does not approve of some 
 of the new owners practices. That said, I do like the guys at Gelsons. 
 They cant get everything, but they try (within the limitations of their 
 store). Remember Mark at City Market at Chapala and Figueroa? I used to 
 shop there every week. I walked in one day and he had just finished 
 butchering a hog that he picked out at the county fair. Best chops Ive 
 ever had! I miss him and those days.&quot;
 
Reader Anonymous says:&quot;santa barbara needs a raw food restaurant 
 !!! and a yanagi sushi like up in pismo / san luis opisbo !!! 
 what we don&apos;t need are any more sub-par places that charge exorbitant 
 prices for boring food that i can make better at home !!!&quot;
 
Reader Tony says:&quot; My answer is, none . We&apos;ve got so many great 
 restaurants of all types and sizes, we really don&apos;t need anything here, 
 what we need is to patronize the ones we&apos;ve got so we can keep them. 
 I&apos;ve been to a lot of different cities and towns in this country and 
 with the exception of NYC I&apos;ve never encountered the breadth and 
 diversity of restaurant selection we have here in such a small area. 
 Many (most) of the suggestions that have been made either already exist; 
 German, French, Barbecue, Indian, More Mexican?! Or have been tried and 
 didn&apos;t last Spanish, Greek, South American and even Boston Market. As 
 for the chain restaurants, I don&apos;t think we have to worry about them in 
 SB proper. Most of the mentioned names like large spaces and rely on 
 steady volume to make their profit targets. SB retail space costs too 
 much and the myriad choices available to SB diners means that its 
 generally too difficult to keep those steady, repeat customers. Chains 
 seem to be leaving SB more than they&apos;re coming. The only place I can see 
 chain restaurants working (not talking fast food here) is in Goleta 
 where its mostly suburban and there are multitudes of students and 
 visitors generally look for something familiar. I wouldn&apos;t mind having a 
 Cheesecake Factory in Goleta at all but I doubt we&apos;ll ever see one 
 downtown.&quot;

 What new restaurant does Santa Barbara 
 need? Santa Barbara has more restaurants per capita than most 
 other cities in the United States. Yet, it would be so great if only 
 Santa Barbara had _______. I asked readers to help me 
 fill in the blank and their responses are posted below.

 Reader Keri says:&quot;My suggestions are not a type of food, but specific 
 restaurants and they might be franchised so there have to be number of 
 interested parties. I would love for SB to have a Wagamama . It&apos;s a 
 Japanese noodle place that started in London, but now has locations in 
 Boston. It it sit-down dining, but fast, fresh, delicious! Cafeteria 
 style seating, take-out, usually open late. Great for tourists, business 
 lunch, students, downtown party-goers.
  Also, Portillo&apos;s that hails from 
 Chicago (ribs, Chicago style hot dogs, Chicago Italian beef sandwiches, 
 great salads). Great food and to-die-for chocolate cake! Casual, order 
 at counter, catering too. Be great at old Bee-Bop Burger.&quot;
  Reader Jan says:&quot;I&apos;d like to see a traditional, casual Italian 
 restaurant that features no-fuss old world basics: Killer traditional 
 sauces, pastas, antipasta, a few meat dishes. I hate to say it, but if 
 Presto Pasta wasn&apos;t a fast food restaurant, they almost have the food. 
 They are just missing table service and a decent wine menu and some 
 quiet ambiance. Petrini&apos;s is not what I&apos;m talking about. Arnoldi&apos;s, a 
 little too fussy. Maybe the new place Holdren&apos;s is putting in by Home 
 Depot will finally fill the void. I hope so!&quot;
  Reader Shelley says:&quot;1) Mediterranean style seafood , 2) Zankou Chicken franchise the best there is, 3) Cuban - 
 Versailles Cuban restaurant in Los Angeles, 4) Good Greek restaurant&quot;
  Reader Eugene says:&quot;I would love to see a Hometown Buffet or a Souplantation close to Solvang&quot;
  Reader John says:&quot;I would like to see a Greek restaurant - a 
 real full service restaurant, not just the counter service one we have.&quot;
  Reader Jenss says:&quot;Okay...for realio...Santa Barbara needs a good boba (or pearl milk tea) joint. There are a few places in LA, like 
 Tapioca Express, Tea Station, and AU79 that have good boba as well as 
 Taiwanese-style slushies. I also want a Chicago-style pizzeria in our hood...but now I&apos;m just getting greedy...&quot;
  Reader Alison says:&quot;The restaurant chains I would love to see here are Flattop (create your own stirfry) and Potbelly&apos;s (sandwiches). I would also like a Puerto Rican restaurant, but 
 would settle for Cuban .&quot;
  Reader Anonymous says:&quot;The Weathervane www.weathervaneseafoods.com&quot;
  Reader Ed says:&quot;SB may have many restaurants, but most are fair to 
 good. But I have been
spoiled in NY, so let me give constructive ideas.....
  We need an Italian restaurant that reminds you of Tuscany with a wood burning 
 oven and grilled meats. We also need a high end pizza place with 
 a thin crust, think of Spago comes to SB. We need a tapas restaurant, casual but with dozens of those Spanish small plate 
 specialties. It would be nice if the Slanted Door (Ferry Bldg in 
 SF) came to SB.
  John, one last request, can you work on getting a real butcher in town, the type where a half steer is carried through the front door 
 (not prepackaged meats form the freezer).&quot;
  Reader Mike says:&quot;Im sure that many SB locals will faint at the 
 thought of thisBut here I go anyway Olive Garden , there I said 
 it deal with it! Id also like to see Red Robin come back; 
 Marmalade Caf is leaving a lot to be desired. One moreI would love, 
 love, love to see sandwich shop called Togos arrive. They blow 
 Subway out of the water and they would rock SB. Thats my 2 cents.&quot;
  Reader Glenn says:&quot;From living in LA awhile I miss eating Ethopian food and also Argentinian food i.e. Empanadas. Brazilian food is also nice. You just can&apos;t beat the variety of foods in the LA 
 area but hey we have an In N Out so why should we be complaining? Jenss, 
 Boba Tea is available at Spudnuts uptown and at Naan Stop in IV. A Souplantation is a good idea. We have a BBQ place in Carp now that&apos;s 
 pretty good. Tapas places are in town already (see John&apos;s&quot;Spanish&quot;section though he has not added&quot;Reds&quot;yet). I would like to see a KFC and/or Wendys in Buellton. I am not sure why the 
 FatBurger closed as I believe they had good food, must have been the bad 
 name?&quot;
  Reader Chris says:&quot;Id like to see someone open a real, unpretentious barbecue joint a cook who understands how to tenderly, 
 lovingly, patiently caress the pink ring into a brisket ever so gently 
 in an oak-fired smoker (not an oven, not an open grill) for 8 hours or 
 so. Theyd serve slabs of barbecue not roast beef masquerading as such 
 on a slice of butcher paper with some onions, a big hunk of rat 
 cheese, a few pickles, a couple of pieces of home-baked bread and two 
 sauces one peppery hot and another sweet and mild in squeeze bottles 
 so they can be mixed perfectly to taste and applied to either the meats 
 or the bread. Maybe some smoked ribs, pork sausages and perhaps a bird 
 or two. A home-baked peach, berry, or cherry cobbler would top it off. 
 The definitive model was Slicks in Muskogee, OK, but many superb 
 BBQ joints can be found in the Texas Hill Country. (The folks at Its 
 In the Sauce in Ventura know how to do it, but they gave up because 
 people didnt appreciate the art. Their other offerings are nonetheless 
 excellent.) The Central Coast needs to escape the tri-tip trap and 
 eschew the shoe leather served locally under the BBQ flag so bring 
 forth the briskets.&quot;
  Reader Chris says:&quot;SB really needs a good, sit down, Greek restaurant with a good gyro!&quot;
  Reader Emily says:&quot;My number one necessity in SB is a good Jewish 
 Deli . Matzo-ball soup, matzo-brei, huge sandwiches, fresh deli meat, 
 deli counter etc. I would even be happy to see a big chain deli like 
 Jerry&apos;s Famous Deli. Another place I would love to see here is The 
 Noodle Box . So delicious, a franchise in British Columbia (I know of 
 Vancouver and Victoria as far as I know). http://www.thenoodlebox.net/
Other than that, anywhere kid-friendly.&quot;
  Reader Lemonjelly says:&quot;I&apos;ve just perused the growing list of 
 suggestions and am disappointed to see the majority are requests for 
 chains. This area has a 12 month growing season, and good local 
 suppliers. I would like to see more restaurants highlighting and 
 incorporating fresh seasonal produce, locally grown . The number 
 of restaurants that now source goods from the farmers markets has 
 improved a lot in recent years, but it can be even better. Cuisine-wise, 
 I&apos;d love some Ethiopian , east European , and more Mediterranean restaurants of regional specialty, like Spanish or Portuguese . And, boy, if we could have another place like JR&apos;s 
 BBQ, that would be oh so nice. I still miss it.&quot;
  Reader Linda says:&quot;I&apos;d love to see a Boston Market &quot;
  Reader Anonymous:&quot;Here is another anonymous request for a chain 
 restaurant to come to SB... I think that the Alcapulco/Stateside spot 
 would make a great Cheesecake Factory . Only a good national chain 
 restaurant with high volume could make it in that large of a spot in SB 
 right now.&quot;
  Reader Rio says:&quot;We need a Wood Ranch , PF Changs and a Cheesecake Factory !&quot;
  Reader Jonathon says:&quot;I agree with LemonJelly, shocking and disturbing 
 to see that most of the responses to your poll are wishes for more chain 
 restaurants in SB! The last thing we need here are more chains! In an 
 area with such amazing local produce, seafood, and meat why on Earth 
 would any want mass produced mediocrity? As far as places I&apos;d like to 
 see, is a restaurant serving REAL Spanish tapas . Not medium sized 
 Mexican dishes passed off as tapas, but actual taps sized tapas 
 showcasing local ingredients and based on traditional Spanish tapas. 
 Also an actual legitimate BBQ joint would be great. Meats cooked 
 low and slow with actual wood. I&apos;ve heard the reason why we don&apos;t have 
 any real BBQ in SB is it&apos;s too hard to get an air permit to run a real 
 pit/smoker? Maybe someone can overcome this hurdle? Also I&apos;d be happy if 
 there was a brewery that serves BOTH great beer AND a great 
 burger ! Not some faux Kobe beef nonsense, but an unpretentious 
 burger made from a custom grind of local beef, cooked properly, and 
 served on a homemade bun.&quot;
  Reader Tiffani says:
- A Korean BBQ place with the meat cooking in front of you and 
 the many little side dishes that come with the meal.
- A Southeast Asian restaurant with cuisine from Thailand, 
 Malaysia, Indonesia
- A traditional but casual French bistro with good wine, serves 
 breakfast, and only $$.
  Reader Brian says:&quot;They need a traditional Meat and Three . Ive 
 said it before but they need a place where people can go in and choose 
 from a selection of fresh mains and side dishes. A meat and three would 
 typically feature 3-4 mains like chicken, fish or beef and then a long 
 list of vegetables and other sides that someone could choose 3 from. In 
 the South the meats are usually fried and so far a lot of the vegetables 
 but you can easily get healthy fare and make it uniquely Santa Barbara.
  Another place we need is a small pizzeria that does 
 traditional small, artisan thin crust pizzas like Italy. A lot of them 
 dont even use a sauce, instead focusing on a little olive oil and then 
 the toppings like fresh tomatoes, herbs, arugula, pancetta, etc.&quot;
  Reader Dennis says:&quot;1)  Cheesecake Factory 2)  Pei Wei &quot;
  Reader Greg says:&quot;Definitely would be good to have Greek restaurant - recently in Orange County we enjoyed Daphne&apos;s, which is one 
 of 80+ of Greek fast food restaurants. Good food, reasonably priced, 
 though no scrumptious Galatobouriko dessert. SB has way too many 
 (mediocre, fairly non descript) Italian and Mexican restaurants.&quot;
  Reader Kimberly says:&quot; French Cambodian . Ethiopian - There 
 is one in Solvang, but would be good to have in SB. Or Italian 
 Ethiopian restaurant. Raw restaurant at decent prices. 
 Everyone seems to want the Kogi Korean BBQ Taco Truck. Vegan/Vegetarian 
 restaurant with breakfast options.&quot;
  Reader Beth says:&quot;I LOVE your food blog (and your website) and 
 generally read it about once a week when you announce openings/closings 
 and the like. I missed your request for what Santa Barbara needs as far 
 as restaurants go, but felt compelled to email because ... I was 
 HORRIFIED to see all the people who want restaurants like the Cheesecake 
 Factory and PF Changs. Are you kidding me??!!! These restaurants are the 
 LAST thing we need here. If we want those we can go to Plano, Texas or 
 just about any other city in the U.S. We have the best sources for meat, 
 seafood and produce right in our back yard... all we need are good chefs 
 and good service. Luckily we have a few notable restaurants at various 
 price points (e.g. Ca Dario, Sojourner, Natural Cafe, and newer Renauds 
 among others) that do a pretty good job of taking what we have right 
 here and turning it into something good. We have a few more ethnic 
 restaurants that are pretty good (e.g. Chef Karim&apos;s and Zaytoon) and 
 even our own smoothies that are a better local version than Jamba Juice 
 (obviously-they are gone). I appreciate all you do to promote the goings 
 on of our local restaurant scene and hope that we can continue to 
 support local or at least not corporate restaurants - this is not the 
 food we need in SB or to eat in general for a lifetime of health and 
 happiness!

But more specifically, I would love:
- a really good juice bar (e.g. G&apos;s Juice in Playa del Rey / LA 
 but our own version of course)
- a really good mexican restaurant where they make the tortillas 
 to order, the cheese is mexican not monterey jack and the margaritas are 
 from scratch
- Jewish deli, Tapas, ethiopian , etc all great 
 ideas!

NO WAY would I be excited to see a Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden or 
 anything like that on STate St - that would be very sad!
 Thanks for reading my 2 cents and thanks again for all you do!
  Reader Lemonjelly says:&quot;Beth - there is currently a wonderful, small, 
 unpretentious Mexican place downtown that makes their tortillas to 
 order, and using queso fresco and specifically Oaxacan cheese. The chips 
 come with a delicious mole instead of salsa. It&apos;s Romanti-Ezer, and 
 prices are dead reasonable. Amazing birria hurraches. No alcohol, 
 though, so you won&apos;t be able to get that margarita.

Several people requested real Spanish tapas, Jonathan in particular 
 stands out. I agree this town is lacking, especially considering this 
 town is Spanish-themed. The Museum Cafe, last time I dined there, does 
 have a small, but very acceptable, tapas menu. Just 9 or so items, and 
 if you go during happy hour, with two friends, you can order the happy 
 hour special of 3 tapas and a glass of Spanish wine for $15 pp and get 
 every item on the menu. A la carte would be $25+ pp. The downside is...gotta 
 go during their specials time, which ends at 5 pm weekdays.

For the boba request - try Naan Stop in Isla Vista. It has the most 
 extensive boba menu I have seen in town. I see that someone else has 
 said the same thing.

Now that I&apos;ve read more of the requests, I agree with two more 
 suggestions: the jewish deli , and a Korean bbq place with tableside 
 grilling and all those fabulous plates of banchan. There used to be a 
 small unofficial place in Goleta, many years ago, that was a french deli 
 during the day, and korean bbq at night, but they closed a long time 
 ago. They shouldn&apos;t have kept the place a secret! Then again, blogs also 
 didn&apos;t exist back then to help spread the word.&quot;
  Reader Ted says:&quot;I&apos;m with lemonjelly, Jonathon, and Beth, We need less 
 chains and more locally owned, locally sourced restaurants that put 
 money back in the community. If you want a P.F. Chang&apos;s, go move to 
 some city filled with box malls. Feh. However, I would like to see: a Korean BBQ place, a dim sum  restaurant, a low-price but 
 healthy and spiiiiiicy Indian food place, a Jewish deli like Langer&apos;s in LA, and a Thai restaurant that&apos;s a different 
 spin on the places we have already. Sorry to bang on about the chain 
 restaurant thingy, but please folks, take a look at&quot;Food, Inc.&quot;still 
 in theaters I believe and see what you think. It&apos;s a very important 
 doc.&quot; 

 Hummingbird Cafe Closes : This just 
 in from the owner of Hummingbird Cafe at 1101 State Street:
 
Hello all.

This is Kristi, the owner of the Hummingbird Cafe... I just wanted to 
 give a sad farewell to all you beautiful folks who supported the Cafe 
 the short but wonderful time of its existence in Santa Barbara. The Cafe 
 has closed and at the present moment doesn&apos;t look to re-open. The Cafe 
 is being replaced by The French Press , another coffee 
 house/sandwich cafe. It looks really cool and Arcoboleno Trade will 
 still be in the back so stop by and keep supporting local business. I am 
 wishin you all open hearts and healthy bellies.

With love,
Kristi

 Restaurant Of The Month : The Burger Bus is Restaurant of the Month for July

 Off Topic : This will be my last blog 
 until Monday. Tonight I am picking up my sister&amp;nieces who arrive at 
 LAX from El Salvador. We then continue on to the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach for the 4th of July .
  Going to 
 Balboa for the 4th of July is such a tradition in our family that I have 
 only been in Santa Barbara on the 4th once in my life (and I 
 grew up in Santa Barbara). The family 
 we visit and stay with are the only original home owners in Balboa, their family 
 having purchased their lot in 1910 when the region was just a big 
 sandbar.
  I hear that there is a 4th of July parade in Santa Barbara (I couldn&apos;t tell you for sure 
 since I&apos;ve never seen it). If someone could take pictures of it for me I 
 will post them in my event guide!

 Red Robin Rumor : 
 There is a rumor circulating that Red Robin is reopening, based 
 on the fact that the restaurant chain posted a job offering on their web 
 site for General Manager in Santa Barbara. I called Red Robin&apos;s 
 corporate office and was told that the ad refers to a position available 
 in Santa Maria. I was also told that they have no plans to reopen on the 
 South Coast.

 Santa Barbara White Sea Bass : I just 
 received this press-release from Enterprise Fish 
 Company at 225 State Street:
 
ENTERPRISE FISH COMPANY PAYS TRIBUTE TO A LOCAL GEM
 
Enterprise Fish Company, a local Santa Barbara tradition for over 30 
 years welcomes the return of Santa Barbara White Sea Bass with a totally 
 local, totally sustainable menu addition.

Santa Barbara, CA, June 29, 2009: Enterprise Fish Company is giving 
 customers what theyve been asking for: a local, seasonal, farmers 
 market-inspired dish. The long-awaited reintroduction of Santa 
 Barbara White Sea Bass gave owners Michael Bank and Randy LaFerr the 
 opportunity to present customers with an entirely local dish. The Santa 
 Barbara Summer Sea Bass will be offered locally all day at the State 
 Street location, while the ingredients are in season.

With news of Santa Barbara White Sea Bass availability, Executive Chef 
 Bruce Choi was asked to create a featured dish straight away. The main 
 focus: sustainability. With the help of Sous Chef Rumi Kamasawa, the 
 Santa Barbara Summer Sea Bass menu addition was born. The dish features 
 locally caught White Sea Bass, Moroccan style couscous, and a 
 fennel-leek slaw. Several other Santa Barbara ingredients show up in the 
 dish, including local olives and farm stand vegetables.

With the anticipated success of the Summer Sea Bass, Enterprise Fish 
 Company has already begun planning a seasonal addition for fall. The 
 goal is to stay connected with the community by turning local fresh 
 products into delicious, affordable, sustainable meals.

 In Search Of A Free* Lunch : I was at Costco the 
 other day strolling for some non-essential purchases when I suddenly 
 felt hungry. I realized that I had completely skipped lunch. As luck 
 would have it, right next to me was a booth offering a free sample of 
 sausage that I quickly devoured.

  A thought then occurred to me: Is it possible to have an entirely 
 free lunch made out of Costco food samples? I noticed that some of 
 the free samples didn&apos;t look very filling (like a sip of apple juice) 
 but others appeared quite substantial (grilled cheese sandwich bite).

  I decided to give my free lunch idea a try and paid a visit to 
 every booth that offered something edible. To my disappointment, after 
 visiting all 15 food sample booths I still felt hungry. So what did I 
 do? Visit them again. I made another pass to each and every smiling food 
 attendant and requested another taste. Verdict: still hungry. I then 
 made a THIRD voyage through my mini&quot;Taste of the Town&quot;and I felt full!

  So there you have it. If you are willing to endure a 45-course meal , it 
 is possible to have an entirely free lunch at Costco.

  So what did I actually have for lunch? Here goes: 1) Seapoint Farms 
 Dry Roasted Edamame, 2) Green Envy Daily Detox Liquid (veggie juice), 3) Mrs. May&apos;s 
 Variety Pack (peanuts), 4) Kirkland Signature Wild Sockeye Salmon, 5) 
 Tasty Bit Basmati Rice, 6) Philippine Dried Mangos, 7) Kraft American 
 Singles (grilled cheese sandwich sample), 8) Tree Top Apple Juice, 9) 
 Pasta Prima Spinach&amp;Mozzarella Ravioli, 10) CP Products Shrimp Wonton 
 Soup, 11) Okami Asian Chicken Salad, 12) Rotisserie Chicken Greek Pasta 
 Salad, 13) Pork Brisket Grillers, 14) Bilinski&apos;s Sausage, and 15) 
 Italian Round (bread).

  * Costco membership required!

 20th Anniversary : I just received 
 this press-release from Piatti in Montecito:

MONTECITO, CA. Sarah Rudd, General Manager of Piatti Ristorante&amp;Bar, 
 announced they are celebrating 20 years of being in business by giving 
 back to their Montecito and Santa Barbara communities, without which 
 they would not have made it this far. Piatti strongly believes that the 
 true gift lies within the giving and feels honored to be able to give to 
 the cornerstones of Montecitos community; arts, education, environment 
 and health. Beginning on July 22nd, Piatti will donate 20% (in honor of 
 20 years) of the proceeds from all diners that mention they are there to 
 support Santa Barbara International Film Festival. To follow Piatti has 
 scheduled similar fundraising events on August 4th for Cold Springs 
 School District, August 19th for Heal the Ocean, August 25th for 
 Montecito Union School District and Sept 2nd for Teddy Bear Cancer 
 Foundation. It just makes sense says Rudd, who has a been with Piatti 
 for almost 14 years, we are such a close knit community and we all work 
 together - what better way to celebrate our success than to honor those 
 that have made it possible? In addition to raising funds for the 
 community Piatti has lots of other treats in store for their guests over 
 the next few months including a contest to determine the favorite recipe 
 to be brought back to the menu from the past 20 years. The winning 
 submission will be featured on Piattis menus for the month of August 
 and the entrant will receive a $100 gift certificate to Piatti. From a 
 $20 three course menu to a 20 cent glass of wine (starting June 22) to 
 featuring years of Piatti favorites on the menu, the restaurant will 
 be festively ringing in this notable anniversary all summer, culminating 
 with the finale party on September 19th, 2009. The 20th Anniversary 
 Party will feature Piattis award winning cuisine, local beer and wine, 
 entertainment and raffle prizes. $20.00 admission tickets, benefiting 
 the participating non-profit of your choice, will be sold thru the 
 restaurant and at the door on the day of the event. Doors open at 6:00 
 for the event of the summer - join Piatti Ristorante&amp;Bar in 
 celebration of 20 years and a great cause on September 19th and all 
 summer long at 516 San Ysidro Road, Montecito CA, 805.969.7520. For more

Jan-Jun 2007: 21 openings

Jan-Jun 2009: 18 closings

 Food, Inc. : I received an email from Magnolia Pictures yesterday informing me that a new food documentary named&quot; Food, 
 Inc. &quot;is opening in Plaza De Oro this Friday. I have posted 
 highlights from the email below:
 
Hi John,

My name is Jason Reif and I work for Magnolia Pictures. Magnolia 
 Pictures is one of the leading film distribution companies that focuses 
 on small independent and foreign language films. Currently we have a new 
 film called&quot;Food, Inc.&quot;The film has opened in New York and LA and has 
 received a great response. On Friday, June 26th, Food Inc. will be 
 opening in Santa Barbara at the Plaza De Oro. Due to the film&apos;s messages 
 about the importance of purchasing local, sustainable foods and the 
 dangers of the industrialization of food, we think that your site&apos;s 
 audience would strongly identify with&quot;Food, Inc.&quot;

It would be greatly appreciated if you could blast this on it on to your 
 site members, or followers, or if it could be included in your online 
 newsletter or on your website. We encourage you to check out the film&apos;s 
 website as well: www.foodincmovie.com .

Synopsis:

In Food, Inc., filmmaker Robert Kenner lifts the veil on our nation&apos;s 
 food industry, exposing the highly mechanized underbelly that&apos;s been 
 hidden from the American consumer with the consent of our government&apos;s 
 regulatory agencies, USDA and FDA. Our nation&apos;s food supply is now 
 controlled by a handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of 
 consumer health, the livelihood of the American farmer, the safety of 
 workers and our own environment. We have bigger-breasted chickens, the 
 perfect pork chop, insecticide-resistant soybean seeds, even tomatoes 
 that won&apos;t go bad, but we also have new strains of e coli--the harmful 
 bacteria that causes illness for an estimated 73,000 Americans annually. 
 We are riddled with widespread obesity, particularly among children, and 
 an epidemic level of diabetes among adults.

Featuring interviews with such experts as Eric Schlosser (Fast Food 
 Nation), Michael Pollan (The Omnivore&apos;s Dilemma) along with forward 
 thinking social entrepreneurs like Stonyfield Farm&apos;s Gary Hirshberg and 
 Polyface Farms&apos; Joel Salatin, Food, Inc. reveals surprising -- and often 
 shocking truths -- about what we eat, how it&apos;s produced, who we have 
 become as a nation and where we are going from here.

Thank you!

Best,
Jason Reif
 
 Off Topic : Yesterday I did an 
 hour-long interview about the Wendy Di Rodio murder case with 
 Dateline NBC at Canary Hotel in downtown Santa Barbara. They also 
 interviewed her dance partner Rick Harmon and local dance instructor 
 Sylvia Sykes. Wendy was a friend to many people in town and I run a tribute site dedicated to her memory. Clips from 
 the interviews will air in August.

 Cabana Update : Cabana , the 
 new Brazilian restaurant coming to 509 State Street, has posted the 
 following description on their Facebook page:
 
Get ready SB! Cabana will not only be the worlds first cachaa lounge 
 but will also be the first establishment in our fine town to transport 
 the lighthearted and laid back atmosphere of Brazilian culture and 
 nightlife to the downtown scene. Stepping into Cabana will be like 
 nothing else our town has seen; with sweeping arches, and luxurious 
 expanses in which to dine or drink, Cabana will be the perfect mix of 
 lavishness and leisure. Cabana will fill a void in Santa Barbara 
 nightlife and cuisine with its relaxed Brazilian atmosphere and culinary 
 temptations inspired by the white-sand beaches of Rio de Janeiro. Cabana 
 will undoubtedly prove the new destination for those who desire a break 
 from the monotony of the regular downtown scene and wish to bask in the 
 freshness of Cabanas Brazilian style.
 
 Sukiyaki Survey : Reader Justine sent 
 me an email asking for your help locating a restaurant that 
 serves sukiyaki . If you have any ideas please send me an email . Here is her message:&quot;Hi John. My mom is coming to town for Solstice 
 this weekend, and mentioned recently that she loves sukiyaki and is 
 always on the lookout for it. Can you poll your readers to see where 
 they suggest? - Justine&quot;

 Reader M says:&quot;I&apos;m a sukiyaki lover, too, and I&apos;ve ordered it at 
 several restaurants in town. By far, my favorite place to get it is Edomasa . Their broth and noodles are the best!&quot; Reader Steve says:&quot; Edomasa serves sukiyaki, it is pretty good.&quot; Reader Cathy says:&quot;The only place I&apos;ve ever had sukiyaki is Edomasa and I can definitely recommend it!&quot;

 Introducing Union Ale Brewing Company : 
 Downtown will soon be home to the Union Ale Brewing Company at 
 214 State Street just across from Enterprise 
 Fish Co . Fourth generation Santa Barbaran Matthew Chrestenson, 
 co-owner of Union Ale, tells me: Were really focusing on the food. 
 We are going after being a restaurant first and foremost.

  Union Ale offers eight 50 TVs and will be serving beer&amp;wine. The 
 beers will all be American ales and the wines will be from Santa 
 Barbara County. They will offer 20 beers on tap, four of them made by 
 Union Ale including California Pale, Hefeweizen, Honey Blonde and IPA. 
 The drink menu will also include beer cocktails&amp;wine cocktails.

  Chrestenson gave me a sneak peek at their food menu [ click 
 here to see menu ] and it lists 12 
 types of flatbread pizza, including Pepperoni, BBQ Chicken and Smoked 
 Cheddar Apple. A variety of salads and wraps will be offered in 
 addition to soft corn tacos and baked quesadillas.

  Union Ales menu also includes Build a Burger where you 1) Choose 
 a fresh baked bun (Brewery Sourdough, 9-Grain Wheat or Sweet

 Tip, Chicken Breast Turkey Patty or Soy Oat Tempeh Patty) and 3) 
 Choose your style (Cheese Burger, Bacon Burger, Three Pepper Burger, 
 Mushroom Ale Burger, Union Club Burger or Santa Barbara Burger).

  Chrestenson added: Were making everything in house, everything is 
 from scratch - buns, sauces, were grinding corn for our tacos. It 
 will be a fun, casual environment. Union Ale is hoping to have a 
 grand opening this July.

 Wine Futures Tasting brought to you by The Winehound (1221 
 Chapala St) and the Wine House. The event was last Saturday at the 
 Museum of Natural History and food was provided by Metropulos .
   
 

 Off Topic : Last Friday night, 
 starting at 9:01pm, there was a huge land grab on the Internet . 
 The popular social networking web site Facebook (200 million 
 members and counting) started allowing people and organizations to 
 select one unique name, letting them create a web address for their 
 Facebook profile such as facebook.com/David or facebook.com/McDonalds .
   
  Needless to say, millions of people scrambled to own the 
 easy-to-remember web address of their choice. Within the first few 
 minutes over a million usernames were taken. Most city names 
 nationwide also disappeared instantly including facebook.com/LasVegas and 
 facebook.com/SanFrancisco. To get your own personal Facebook web address you should 
 fill out the online form at facebook.com/username.
   
  What name did I select for my Facebook account? Considering that my web 
 site is SantaBarbara.com, and my phone number is 1-800-SantaBarbara, I 
 really only had one choice: facebook.com/SantaBarbara

 Cabana : A Brazilian restaurant 
 opening this summer at 509 State Street, the former home of Bricks Cafe and Casa Blanca , 
 has changed the name to&quot; Cabana &quot;instead&quot; Buzios &quot;as 
 originally reported.

 The Pub : Word on the street is that&quot;The Pub,&quot;Santa Barbara&apos;s LGBT bar of yesteryear, is planning to 
 reopen on Helena Avenue and may include a restaurant.

 Chino&apos;s Opens Tomorrow : Chinos Rock&amp;Taco at 714 State Street, the former home of Matador and Piranha , is having a grand-opening celebration from 11 a.m. to 11 
 p.m. this Saturday.

 Nantucket : This just in from James 
 Sly, owner of Sly&apos;s at 686 Linden Ave in Carpinteria:
 
&quot;This weekend starts a bit of the Nantucket experience at Slys in 
 Carpinteria.

Heres what we have planned: divers scallops, sweet like only something 
 from Nantucket can be, fresh fluke fillet, and cooked lobster meat, for 
 lobster cocktails, and maybe even lobster rolls if we get some time to 
 bake some soft light rolls for what may be the ultimate fish sandwich.

The divers scallops will be grilled, and served with a light sauce 
 of ripe tomatoes from Beylik Farms, with fresh herbs and a touch of 
 extra virgin olive oil.

The fluke will be broiled under a light crust of our homemade 
 bread crumbs, and served with a Chardonnay butter and lemon. Or maybe 
 a sorrel cream, if we can get some sorrel. We tend to think 
 that anything more complicated will hide what a tender, delicious 
 fish fluke is.

Well have that sweet Nantucket lobster chilled in big chunks, with our 
 classic red cocktail sauce, and our ever-so spicy Louis Dressing. While 
 were at it, why not a Lobster Louis? Seems like a perfect match for 
 Slys incomparable signature salad of crisp Iceberg lettuce, 
 fresh asparagus, ripe avocado, ripe tomato, and hard boiled egg.

We also have warm berry cobblers a la mode as part of the program.

Great memories of adventures past, great thoughts of fish to come, 
 and the lengthening days of summer. What more can one ask for?&quot;- James 
 Sly

 Ice Cream Update : Mike Briggs, 
 owner/operator of   Cold 
 Stone Creamery - Goleta and Cold Stone Creamery - 
 State St , sent me a press-release about his new Jell-O 
 Pudding Ice 
 Cream and Ice Cream Cupcake offerings:
 
Santa Barbara, CA Cold Stone Creamery is kicking 
 off the ice eating season with new and innovative ice cream 
 indulgences that will provide relief from the heat and reduce pressure 
 from the pocket book.. From June 3 to July 28, 2009, Cold Stone will 
 be mixing things up once again in the world of frozen treats with a 
 revolutionary form of JELL-O Pudding ice cream while the highly sought 
 after ice cream cupcake will be available at a bargain price .

A true believer and leader in ice cream innovation, Cold Stone 
 Creamerys Tastemaster, Ray Karam, has created a new and exciting form 
 of ice cream -- JELL-O Pudding ice cream. This new line of ice cream 
 flavors not only taste like the intended pudding, but also holds the 
 characteristics and texture that is easily recognized as JELL-O 
 Pudding. The most interesting and surprising feature of this new ice 
 cream is that it does not melt, instead, when left at room 
 temperature, it actually turns into pudding now thats ice cream 
 innovation.

Developed through rigorous testing and tasting, an entirely new ice 
 cream texture has been achieved to mimic that of pudding yet in a 
 frozen form. Four flavors have been created including butterscotch, 
 chocolate, vanilla and banana pudding. Only butterscotch and chocolate 
 pudding flavors will be available in stores nationwide while banana 
 and vanilla will be optional flavors. Each of these flavors exhibits 
 that of JELL-O Pudding but the difference is this sweet treat is 
 frozen and has a mouth feel much like a velvety mousse.

Just as summer time invokes fervent memories, so does ice cream and 
 JELL-O Pudding. From barbeques to pool parties, these two sweet treats 
 have been served side-by-side for years, and it was about time they 
 were brought together as the ultimate summer dessert, said Mike 
 Briggs, owner of a Cold Stone Creamery store.

Indulgent creations have been developed to compliment the new 
 JELL-O Pudding ice cream flavors:

 Butterscotch Velvet Butterscotch JELL-O Pudding Ice Cream 
 mixed with Butterfinger, Reeses Peanut Butter Cup and Caramel Chocolate-y Goodness Chocolate JELL-O Pudding Ice Cream mixed 
 with Peanut Butter, Caramel and Fudge Blissful Banana Banana JELL-O Pudding Ice Cream mixed with 
 Roasted Almonds, Yellow Cake and Banana (DELETE if not offered in 
 your store) 

And if changing the texture of ice cream was not enough of a feat, 
 several delicious recipes incorporating this new pudding ice cream 
 have been posted at www.coldstonecreamery.com. Recipes include 
 suggestions for creating JELL-O Pudding ice cream pops, sandwiches and 
 trifles.

Also this summer season, Cold Stone Creamery is offering Americas 
 newest favorite dessert, ice cream cupcakes , at a limited time, 
 discounted rate. In a little less than three months, 1.8 million 
 cupcakes have been sold to ice cream loving cupcake aficionados across 
 the country. Recognizing the popularity of these little treats and the 
 nations budgetary woes, it only seemed fitting to celebrate summer by 
 bringing back the ice cream cupcake at its $9.99 introductory price. A 
 variety pack of six will be available in stores nationwide for $9.99 
 from June 3 to July 28, 2009.

Since these cupcakes are part of the Cold Stone family of indulgences, 
 guests can pre-order a pack and customize the cupcakes to their 
 personal taste or they can pick up a variety pack with the three 
 developed Cold Stone signature flavors, Cake Batter Delux, Sweet Cream 
 and Double Chocolate Devotion. Each cupcake is made using a rich

Hey John, just wanted to update you on our

 making a lot of progress and things are going really well.  We are

 Off Topic : Like 
 many of you, Im a big fan of the iPhone. Apple held a news 
 conference yesterday and revealed plans to launch a new version of 
 the iPhone called the iPhone 3GS on June 19 th .
   
  The new iPhone 3GS contains many new features including Digital 
 Compass, Video Recording (send via text message&amp;email and 
 upload directly to Youtube), Voice Control (speak your friends name to 
 dial), 3 megapixel camera with autofocus, longer battery life and faster 
 Internet speeds.
   
  Starting June 17 th all existing iPhone users will get a 
 free upgrade to iPhone Operating System 3.0. The new OS includes over 
 100 new features such as Cut, Copy&amp;Paste, multi-media text messaging, 
 landscape keyboard, voice recorder and more.
   
  Starting this summer the TomTom navigation system will be available 
 for the iPhone 3G&amp;iPhone 3GS. The new software, available in the iPhones App Store, will offer spoken turn-by-turn directions.
   
  The new iPhone 3GS will cost $199/$299 for the 16GB and 32GB versions 
 (with 2-year contract) 
 for people who do not own an iPhone 3G. If you already own an iPhone 3G 
 the cost will be $399/$499 (16GB/32GB) because it wont be subsidized by AT&amp;T. A lot of people 
 are very
 unhappy with that AT&amp;T upgrade policy though most other carriers 
 have the same policy. 
 Starting today the old iPhone 3G 8GB will sell for $99.

 Kitchen Needed : Robyn Van Tuyl, 
 owner of the&quot;Robyn Loves Cake&quot;bakery is looking for temporary use of a 
 kitchen:
 
Due to a fire in adjacent kitchen I have been vacated from my commercial
kitchen for at least several months, perhaps permanently. I make 
 specialty
cakes, and don&apos;t have any employees so don&apos;t need a huge amount of space 
 but
do need a little area that&apos;s just mine. Ideally I could bring my fridge 
 in.
Specialized bakery equipment totally unnecessary. Does your commercial
kitchen have unused space? Let&apos;s talk! Thanks so much, I definitely am 
 in a
time crunch.

 more. He has added two new entrees to the already vast menu as well as

 TV Show Taped At The Palace? : 
 This just in from reader Paul: 
 
 Hey I was at the Palace Grill last night and there was some travel food TV show filming an episode 
 there. Do you what was going on. They had the table next to me but 
 they were keeping pretty tight lipped about the show and wouldnt 
 tell us the name of the show. It was four to five women in their 30s 
 going around different southern California restaurants. Anyways it 
 would be fun to watch when or if it ever airs. Since your up this 
 kind of stuff I figured if anybody knows it&apos;s you. 
 
 Off Topic : I&apos;m 
 on the road right now heading back from a successful trip to Disneyland 
 and Legoland. I am looking forward to being a waiter tonight at Pascucci !
 
 Tuesday, June 2, 2009 

 May I Take Your Order? Wednesday, June 3 rd (tomorrow) I will be a waiter at Pascucci restaurant during dinner time to help raise money for the Summer 
 Solstice Parade. All proceeds and tips go to Solstice. Come on by and 
 ask to be seated in my section!

 Bella Dolce Bakery Opening Downtown : 
 Longtime local bakery Bella Dolce will be opening a storefront downtown at 113 W. De La 
 Guerra Street, the former home of Saffron . 
 The target date is the end of June. Owner Eileen Randall Cook sent me an 
 email detailing her plans:
 
Hi John,

Here are the details about Bella Dolce Bakery and the new spot downtown:

I am a classically trained pastry chef* and I founded Bella Dolce in 
 1997 as a custom wedding cake and dessert catering company. Having been 
 in business for 12 years we are now known for our award winning cookies 
 and elegant wedding cakes. In response to customer requests and the 
 following for our custom desserts we are now opening a retail caf 
 with a full bakery&amp;coffee house in the heart of downtown Santa 
 Barbara, steps from the Paseo Nuevo mall. The new Bella Dolce Bakery 
 will be a vintage style bakery ~ featuring luscious cupcakes, beautiful 
 cookies, retro desserts, exotic chocolate, coffee and teas.

Bella Dolce Bakery is already known for the high standards of quality of 
 ingredients and artistry in everything we create. Everything we make at 
 Bella Dolce Bakery is baked from scratch, with the best ingredients, 
 including organic ingredients and local purveyors as much as possible. 
 Many of our recipes are from my collection of over 200 vintage cook 
 books from the 1920s-1950s. When baking was all done from scratch, 
 with out preservatives, additives or artificial colors. Resulting in the 
 fresh baked and truly flavorful results that Bella Dolce Bakery is now 
 known for.

We will be doing things like making our own vanilla wafers for our 
 banana pudding, and our own marshmallows from scratch for the hot 
 chocolate and rice crispy treats. While I personally am all about the 
 real butter and sugar we will have some vegan and gluten free offerings 
 for people with allergies and special food concerns. We will also 
 feature only recyclable and compostable to go packaging and green 
 cleaning products to support the Santa Barbara tradition of being as 
 earth friendly as possible.

All coffees and espresso drinks served in the caf will be made with 
 organic&amp;fair trade coffees, locally roasted by Green Star Coffee. My 
 ex-husband Daniel Randall is one of the founders and co-owner of Green 
 Star, so we are keeping it all in the family.

We hope to open the new caf at 113 West De la Guerra Street in June and 
 until then you can find our sweets at a few upcoming non-profit events. 
 Bella Dolce Bakery will be at the finale party of the Downtown 
 Organizations Art&amp;Wine Tour at the courthouse sunken gardens on this 
 Thursday night, Share Our Strength on Sunday afternoon, and at the Santa 
 Barbara Museum of Natural Historys Wine Festival on June 27th.

Especially in this uncertain economy people are craving comfort foods. 
 We really enjoy being an affordable indulgence and being able to make 
 people happy and share in special events with them through what we 
 create at Bella Dolce Bakery.

 Gluten-Free : On May 13th I posted some 
 suggestions where to find some gluten-free options in town, including 
 rice pasta. Reader Jeff passes more information your way:
 
Thanks for the info about the rice pasta restaurants in SB. This is so 
wonderful to know. I just got diagnosed with celiac disease and it has 
been a struggle to eat out. I thought your readers would like to know 
that Pizza Guru offers a gluten free crust option. Also Hotcookie.com 
on the mesa has a gluten free peanut butter cookie. I think it would be 
a great service to your readers to survey the restaurants and/or 
readers about gluten free options here in town. It seems that wheat 
allergy is becoming more and more prevalent. Some feel it is currently 
under diagnosed and maybe as many as 10% have this intolerance.

 Off Topic : The 
 third annual West Beach Music&amp;Arts Festival returns to Santa 
 Barbara September 18, 19&amp;20. Last years festival drew over 20,000 
 attendees. Tickets went on sale last Saturday and can be purchased 
 online at westbeachfestival.com .
     Speaking of music, Britney Spears is making a music video in Santa Barbara this week 
 and casting directors have been signing up locals to be in it. It will 
 be shot at one of our local country clubs on May 27th or May 28th. 
 Though I participated as an extra in a recent movie production in Santa 
 Barbara, I have no plans to sing&amp;dance with Ms. Spears.

 Off Topic Update : 
 I have more information about the Britney Spears video being 
 filmed locally. It will be filmed at Nesbitt Ranch (Padaro 
 Lane) on Thursday. Spears is staying at the Bacara Resort. I am told 
 that local columnist Richard Mineards will be making an 
 appearance in the video. It is bringing much needed $ into the local 
 economy as local hotels and services are being used. Tinker&apos;s in 
 Summerland is catering the video shoot.

 Off Topic : I hope you are enjoying 
 your holiday vacation today. I am taking the day off too so today&apos;s blog 
 will include something random.
  While surfing the web I came across a photo taken back east that 
 seemed very familiar. It was a photo of a statue of Benjamin Franklin at 
 the University of Pennsylvania. I realize that it is a duplicate of one 
 on display in La Arcada at 1114 State Street (it is a mirror image 
 rather than an exact copy). I had always thought the La Arcada statues 
 were unique to Santa Barbara. Apparently not!

 Off Topic : If you are a fan of Carr Winery at 414 N. Salsipuedes Street, you can stop reading this 
 column right here. What comes next is nothing new to you. For those of 
 you who have never visited Carr on, say, a Friday evening, or perhaps a 
 First Thursday, I struggled to find a way to describe it for you. Lets 
 just say its off-the-scale cool. Located far off the beaten path in a 
 warehouse in the industrial east side, it has become a vital stop in 
 Santa Barbaras social circuit. The evening ambiance is a magical mix of 
 wine processing/storage facility and upscale, candle-lit bar. For 
 more information call 965-7985 or visit carrwinery.com .

 Happy Hour : This just in from Reader 
 Jess:&quot;I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve seen this posted on your site, but Plow&amp;Angel is having a great happy hour special from 5-6. Drinks are $5 to $8, 
 appetizers are half off, and beers are $3. A friend of mine went 
 yesterday and said she and another lady were the only ones there. I 
 don&apos;t think they are doing much to promote this.&quot;

 Rice Pasta : To those who are celiacs and follow a 
 gluten-free diet, here are some tips: Tre Lune ( 1151 
 Coast Village Rd, Montecito), Olio E Limone 
 Ristorante (17 W. Victoria St) and Pascucci (729 State St) all carry rice pasta that can be made by request. In 
 addition, Lucky&apos;s (1270 Coast Village Rd, Montecito) 
 can make their onion rings with rice flour by request.

 Thank You! I am having a terrific 
 day. For dinner tonight I decided to join my parents at Cafe Del Sol in Montecito (my home town) 
 and order the Crab Cakes with Mango Relish (my current 
 favorite dish in SB). I am looking forward to having a *huge* piece of 
 bday cake which will be my first dessert since December 31st, 2008 (see 
 Monday&apos;s blog for an explanation).

 New In The Guide : 
 Today I added Yogurtland to the restaurant guide.

 Yogurtland Opens : Yogurtland has opened at 621 State Street. I stopped by to pay them a visit (with a 
 group of my friends) and was amazed to see such a huge selection of 
 flavors. Yogurtland has 16 different flavors available across eight 
 self-serve frozen yogurt stations in addition to offering a whopping 29 
 toppings. Currently they are the only self-serve frozen yogurt shop 
 downtown. The total cost is 30 cents per ounce which resulted in a 
 significant savings (about a dollar) when compared to another yogurt 
 place we had visited earlier that day. Hours are Sun-Thu 11am-11pm, 
 Fri-Sat 11am-12:30am. For more information call 564-8680 or visit yogurt-land.com .
   
 

 Off Topic : This 
 
 Wednesday I get a one-day reprieve from my New Years 
 resolution . Last year I decided to avoid desserts for all of 2009 
 and I have successfully remained faithful to that vow. The resolution 
 gets easier with each passing day but at the beginning it was quite 
 difficult. I could never have done this Yogurtland story last January 
 without ordering some! Fortunately that pledge had an asterisk that allowed me one 
 exception during the year: birthday cake!

Hi there John,

You may want to post that we are now serving ROCO coffee/espresso 
 instead of Peet&apos;s in an effort to keep it local... :) We are also doing 
 GREAT... We are breaking record sales that we didn&apos;t think we would hit 
 until this summer.... We continue to offer free live music every 
 night... and we just got a new Chef&quot;Daniel Bohl&quot;who is putting out 
 incredible panini and salads... Our patio is now enclosed so we can 
 serve wine outside... We are planning on having our grand opening the 
 first or 2nd week on June....

Hi John, I know it&apos;s a little late notice... but boy has this fire 
 slowed life down a little... so devastating.... but I wanted to let 
 everyone know that on Mother&apos;s Day, Los Arroyos (both locations) 
 is supporting Santa Barbara&apos;s oldest nonprofit, St. Vincent&apos;s (150 years 
 in our community) and the single mothers with their children they serve 
 by donating 10% of our sales. We hope you will all come out to support 
 St. Vincent&apos;s and hopefully learn about their mission a little. We wish 
 all Mother&apos;s a very special Mother&apos;s Day! Also, our prayers are with all 
 evacuees, firefighters and law enforcement! Thanks John! Maria Arroyo

 Cadena&apos;s Fresh Fish : There is a 
 company in town that offers home delivery (and restaurant delivery) of fresh fish. Cadena Yules, owner

 specializes in locally caught seafood. We offer home delivery and 
 service to restaurants providing seafood caught off our local coast and 
 islands. Cadena&apos;s is commited to minimizing the time between the boat

 Here Comes California Crisp : A 
 sandwiches&amp;salads cafe named California Crisp will be 
 opening in the downtown area this summer at 718 State Street, the 
 former home of Fatburger.
   
  California Crisp was established in 1979 with the mission&quot;to 
 provide delicious, healthy food made to order, using fresh 
 ingredients, in a fast service format.&quot;They have grown to fourteen 
 stores located in regional shopping centers and food courts that span 
 from San Diego to Portland, Oregon.
   
  Their first store was located in the original Sherman Oaks Galleria 
 named&quot;Potatoes Potatoes Potatoes&quot;since the menu featured only Baked 
 Potatoes, Potato Skins, French Fries. In 1984 California Crisp&apos;s 
 concept changed and the menu now features sandwiches and their 
 signature specialty salads, which are assembled and tossed to order 
 with house made dressings. Wraps are made with fresh lahvosh and their 
 panini sandwiches are served on freshly baked ciabatta. Both are 
 served with their&quot;famous jumbo potato chips&quot;that are made on the 
 premises.

 April Surprise : For the first time 
 since I started keeping restaurant statistics three years ago, the 
 South Coast went an entire month without a single closure . 
 During the month of April all area restaurants, bakeries and coffee 
 shops remained in business. I dont know if this means that the local 
 economy has passed a magic threshold on the way to prosperity but it 
 certainly is great news.

 Rumor Machine : Yesterday I was 
 dusting off the Rumor Machine as part of my annual spring cleaning 
 when I noticed what appeared to be a headline from a supermarket 
 tabloid sticking out of the paper tray. Upon closer inspection I could 
 see the words Actress Reese Witherspoon is looking to buy 
 commercial retail space on/near State Street to open a restaurant 
 here. As always, this rumor might be completely false or a brilliant 
 forecast of future events. Your call.

 Teavana : A tipster tells me that the 
 new specialty tea store Teavana might open tomorrow (Friday) in the 
 Paseo Nuevo shopping center downtown. It replaces the now-closed Santa Barbara 
 Roasting Co. I have no clue if this is true but I thought I 
 would throw it out there in case it is...

 Drinking Coffee With A Straw : I was at Anna&apos;s Bakery in Goleta with a friend recently and noticed that she was drinking her 
 coffee with a straw (in this case, a hollow plastic stir stick poked 
 through the sipping hole in the lid). I told her that, in my entire 
 life, I have never seen anyone drink coffee with a straw before. She 
 said that she drinks all colored beverages with a straw to keep her teeth 
 from becoming stained. Even though she had never used teeth whiteners 
 before she did, indeed, have a bright white smile. This habit makes a 
 lot of sense though I don&apos;t see myself changing my traditional coffee sipping ways 
 anytime soon. Do you drink coffee with a straw?

 Reader Geno says:&quot;My wife and myself do drink thru a straw, but only 
 while driving on a vacation or on a long drive....it is safer driving 
 that way and I was convinced to this method after complaints from the 
 boys down below.&quot; Reader Aimee says:&quot;I&apos;m writing in response to your blog entry about 
 drinking coffee through a straw. My mother always warned me against 
 drinking hot beverages that way, lest I inadvertently burn my esophagus! 
 Sage advice, I think...&quot; Reader Ken says:&quot;Just read your note about drinking coffee with a 
 straw. Here&apos;s one for you: Have you ever thought about why in Asian 
 cultures you never see people drinking tea from a cup with a handle? 
 That is, why is it you never see handles on tea cups in Japanese or 
 Chinese restaurants?
  I don&apos;t know if this is true or not, but I was once told that in 
 the Asian cultures the lips are very sacred and therefore to be 
 protected from the possibility of extremely hot water. With handle-less 
 cups the drinker can feel whether the cup is hot or not. In Western 
 cultures, on the other hand, having handles can deceive a drinker to the 
 temperature of the cups&apos; contents by never getting a&quot;true&quot;feel of the 
 cups&apos; heat. Seems pretty logical.&quot; Reader Linda says:&quot;I always get a straw for my coffee at Starbucks! 
 Without a straw I seem to get tiny coffee stains on my shirt. What can I 
 say - the straw does the trick. Never thought avoiding straining my 
 teeth, but good for me!&quot; 

 And The Survey Says... : Based on 
 SantaBarbara.com web site statistics, here are the most viewed photos 
 in this week&apos;s pictures galleries of Reds (60 photos) and Wine Futures 
 (58 photos). It is interesting to note that the lady on the right in the 
 winning Reds #1 photo is the same lady from the #2-ranked photo from last week&apos;s Nights gallery. She is on a roll!

 Turning Two : Two years ago today The 
 Restaurant Guy debuted in the Daily Sound newspaper. The current issue is 
 my 105th consecutive weekly food news column. What was the chain of 
 events that lead to its creation?
   
  Having run my SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide for more than a 
 decade, I found myself surrounded with a lot of restaurant news that I 
 would pass on to my friends. One day in mid-December 2006 I decided to 
 create a food news blog called As If You Care where I started posting everything I knew about the South Coast dining scene. The 
 blog title later was changed to The Food Forum and finally The 
 Restaurant Guy.
   
  I first met Daily Sound publisher Jeramy Gordon at a Christmas 
 party in Carpinteria just after I started the blog and we ran into each 
 other from time to time in early 2007. Each time we met the conversation 
 eventually turned to a discussion of publishing my food news blog in his 
 paper. On a Monday in mid-April 2007 I decided to send Jeramy an email 
 with a weeks worth of blog material that he published the very next 
 day.

 Salsa Especial : The next time you 
 are in Trader Joe&apos;s pick up a jar of Salsa Especial under the 
 Trader Joe&apos;s label. It is made by local resident David Hernandez. David 
 tells me the story about how this family recipe came to be:
 
My mother moved to Santa Barbara when she was just four years old. The 
 eldest of four children she grew up then raised her own family in the 
 Carpinteria area. Through the years, being such a wonderful cook, I 
 think all that had visited our home had tasted her homemade salsa at one 
 point or another. She was always told that she should do something with 
 her recipe, but caring for her family of seven was top priority! She was 
 such a wonderful mother.

One day I told her that if she wasnt going to do anything with the 
 recipe that I would like to. She never thought it would amount to 
 anything. I persisted and through a mutual friend got it introduced to 
 Trader Joes. Out of 13 products initially be introduced, the salsa was 
 the first to be accepted. I was so thrilled informing my mother, still 
 having doubts that it would ever make it to market.

Well, it did and it has now been there almost 7 years. She passed away 
 at 78 right before it was to hit the market. As a lasting to tribute to 
 her, it remains to be one of their best sellers. I know she is very 
 proud and continues to look after her family. Thanks mom! All who knew 
 her remember and continue to buy the salsa making this a lasting tribute 
 to her. - David Hernandez, Carpinteria

 Blush Opens : Blush restaurant 
 and lounge at 630 State Street, the former location of Zelo , had a 
 soft opening this week. Owner Asaf Dimant sent me an email with details about Blush:
 
Hi John,

In an attempt to iron out the kinks and streamline our restaurant 
 operations, we have been conducting mock service, soft openings and 
 limited restaurant openings this week. Since we are still in the process 
 of completing our build out (our outdoor patio in particular) and intend 
 to truly create a unique restaurant/lounge atmosphere that operates for 
 extended hours and does not fit your standard dinner house mold, we will 
 be opening in a limited capacity over the next several weeks. Our grand 
 opening is scheduled for memorial day weekend. At that time, we will be 
 unveiling our final product including:

- Complete dinner&amp;cocktail menus
- Late night dining menu (kitchen open till midnight)
- Entertainment programming for dinner, lounge&amp;brunch (a gospel brunch 
 with a live gospel choir is in the works)

We hope that Blush stands out in the competitive Santa Barbara 
 marketplace as a standalone restaurant&amp;lounge that combines refined 
 dining with a social atmosphere that transcends from evening to

 Cookbook : Chef and cookbook author Michele Carbone , a Montecito resident, will be having a book 
 signing May 1st, 7pm at downtown Borders. In addition to signing copies 
 of her book&quot;Friday Evening: Creating La Dolce Vita, one bite at a time&quot;Carbone will conduct a short demonstration by breaking down a complete 
 chicken. People think its hard to do, so instead they spend a lot more 
 money purchasing chicken breasts to cook. But I can do it quickly and 
 easily, to show people just how its done, Carbone explains. She will 
 also conduct a food tasting, using simple recipes from her book.

 Island Brew : The Island Brewing 
 company on Linden Avenue in Carpinteria has just completed their new patio . This means that the hugely popular local gathering spot 
 can once again be an indoor and outdoor experience.

 Off Topic : Universal Pictures moved 
 up the movie 
 shoot from Thursday to today . I have to be on the 
 set at 8:00am. They also asked me if they can use my Prius for the 
 shoot because they apparently think it seems&quot;local.&quot;I guess we&apos;re all 
 Prius lovers here in SB in the eyes of Hollywood.
 On a side note, reader Primetime tells me this morning that Global Gardens in Los Olivos has been specially asked to make gift baskets for the 
 movie stars in the film.
   
  FYI, this blog has a Twitter account. It&apos;s online at: http://twitter.com/sbdotcom .
 I might just tweet throughout the day since I likely will have a lot of 
 idle time. I&apos;ll try to get Meryl Streep to leave a message!

 Wine Cask To Reopen : 
 The Wine Cask disappeared just over a year and a half after long-time owner Doug 
 Margerum sold the popular restaurant in 2007. It now appears that Knight 
 Margerum has donned his shining armor, mounted a white horse and is 
 galloping in to rescue the restaurant-in-distress. Here is an email I 
 received from Margerum last weekend:
 
The Wine Cask closure has captivated everyone and I&apos;ve been quoted 
 as saying that I may try to save part of the historic business. It is in 
 process. Cant comment on it right now but it looks like a Phoenix will 
 rise from the ashes and I expect to be along for the ride. - Doug 
 Margerum
 
 Jake&apos;s Closes : 
 Reader Shane let me know that Jake&apos;s Cottage Cuisine at 2911 De La Vina Street went out of business last

 Chicken Fried Steak Poll Results :
 Here are the results of last Friday&apos;s poll to determine which local 
 restaurants offer Chicken Fried Steak. FYI, it&apos;s the largest poll response 
 this blog has ever had!

 Reader John says:&quot; Chile&apos;s has chicken fried steak.&quot; Chef David says:&quot;At the Harbor/Longboards , we have Chicken 
 Fried Steak and Eggs for Breakfast Sat/Sun.
Also I have a special eggs benedict: Chicken Fried Steak Benedict, 
 Chicken fried sirloin steak, melted fontina cheese, buttermilk 
 biscuits and country gravy.&quot; Reader Diego says:&quot;It&apos;s everywhere! Besides Denny&apos;s and IHOP , I&apos;ve had chicken fried steak recently at Cajun Kitchen , Beachbreak Caf , and the Breakwater Restaurant .&quot; Reader Tiffani says:&quot;My boyfriend just ordered chicken fried steak 
 the other day at the Cajun on De La Vina . I am sure they have 
 that on all the Canjun Kitchens menu. Garretts on Mission and 
 State makes a pretty good one too.&quot; Reader Huyen says:&quot;You have probably already had people tell you 
 this, but Jake&apos;s on De La Vina serves it.&quot; Reader Lauren says:&quot;I &apos;believe&apos; that the Beachbreak Cafe serves chicken fried steak, although I cannot seem to find it on their 
 online menu.&quot; Reader Anita says:&quot;I tasted the chicken fried steak at Tupelo 
 Junction the other day and it was the absolute best and the gravy 
 is amazing! Esau&apos;s is very good too!&quot; Reader J says:&quot; Cajun Kitchen has chicken fried steak and eggs 
 that&apos;s very good. I don&apos;t know about how authentic it is but dang 
 good.&quot; Reader Deena says:&quot; Cajun Kitchen Caf has Chicken Fried 
 Steak.&quot; Reader Anonymous says:&quot; Cody&apos;s Cafe severs a good chicken fried 
 steak. I really not recommend the one at Cajun Kitchen . The 
 best I know of in the area is in Santa Ynez at a little place called 
 the Long Horn Cafe .&quot; Reader Glenn says:&quot;From a websearch: Cody&apos;s Cafe , Jake&apos;s , Tupelo Junction Cafe , Esau&apos;s Cafe &quot; Reader Jeff says:&quot;Sorry, I dont have any suggestions for chicken 
 fried steak in the immediate Santa Barbara area, but I do know that 
 just down the road in Ventura, the Busy Bee Caf serves both 
 chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken. Ive not visited in 
 some time, but I found both to be delicious whenever I tried them!&quot; Reader Laurie says :&quot; Cajun Kitchen does on their breakfast 
 menu as one of the meat/side options for 2 eggs. Esaus too!&quot; Reader Cory says:&quot;My favorite place for Chicken Fried Steak is Cajun Kitchen . When I was at UCSB, I would go to the Caj at Storke&amp;Hollister and get the Chicken Fried Steak with two eggs, bran 
 muffins, and their delicious home fries. Sambo&apos;s has it too, but I 
 preferred Cajun Kitchen&apos;s. But I will say, being from Texas, the size 
 of the Chicken Fried Steak at Cajun Kitchen might not whet his 
 appetite. I&apos;ve seen CFS in Texas, and it&apos;s at least twice the size as 
 the one from Cajun Kitchen.&quot; Reader Justine says:&quot;I haven&apos;t had it there myself, but a good friend 
 of mine has ordered chicken fried steak several times at Jake&apos;s and loves it.&quot; Reader Jonathon says:&quot;Chicken Fried steak is one of my guilty 
 pleasures and I feel it&apos;s a great way to judge a &apos;greasy spoon&apos; type 
 place. There&apos;s a TON of places in SB that serve Chicken Fried Steak 
 and I&apos;ve sampled most of them; quite a few good ones and of course 
 some greasy chewy disappointments. I&apos;d say Jake&apos;s Cottage Cuisine on De La Vina just might be my favorite. Fried perfectly, not super 
 greasy, tasty gravy, and perfect with their excellent homemade 
 biscuits!&quot; Reader Jon says:&quot; Farmer Boys does a good chicken Fried 
 Steak. Not for the heart healthy but good !!!&quot; Reader Ben says:&quot;I think Chili&apos;s serves chicken fried steak.&quot; 

 Off Topic : Last Friday I met with Universal Studios wardrobe/casting department to try on outfits that I 
 will wear as an extra in a movie 
 scene with Meryl Streep this Thursday. What&apos;s interesting is 
 that, as an extra, we bring our own clothes (several outfits) and 
 they mix&amp;match. I had always thought one wears duds supplied by 
 the studio. Welcome to life at the bottom of the Hollywood totem 
 pole!
   
  They then took several photographs of me wearing various combinations 
 of clothes and emailed them to the director (Nancy Meyers) in New York. I&apos;ll probably 
 be wearing blue jeans/gray t-shirt/green pull-over or blue jeans/white 
 collar shirt/olive sport jacket. I bring all the outfit choices with me 
 and the director will decide what I wear at the last moment.
   
  They handed me 
 a sheet of paper indicating the 
 rules extras must obey on the set which was kind of interesting so I 
 included it in today&apos;s blog.
   
  FYI, all the extras get paid $8/hr for 8 hours, even if we are only 
 there for a short while, and they supply free food all day. I will be somewhere downtown this Thursday, 
 not sure exactly where. The sheet says&quot;State Street pedestrian&quot;(not a 
 glamorous title for sure) but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they substituted an 
 off-State location to create less disruption. I will call them after 6pm Wednesday evening to find out 
 exactly where the extras go.

 Poll: Who Serves Chicken Fried Steak? Reader Jonathan is from Texas and grew up eating Chicken Fried Steak . 
 He asked me to ask you if you know of any local restaurants that serve 
 it. If you can help Jonathan please email 
 me and I will post your answer here.

 El Hombre Restaurante : I had a 
 meeting yesterday with the kind and 
 generous folks who bring you the annual Old Spanish Days celebration 
 and they have asked me to be their unofficial Fiesta foodie. They will be sending 
 me information about food vendors and restaurants that contribute to the 
 various events (parties, Mercados) and I will post it on a new&quot;Foods of 
 Fiesta&quot;page in this restaurant guide. I have been trying to think of 
 what my title would be and&quot;Fiesta Food Czar&quot;seemed a bit too important 
 so I am leaning towards El Hombre Restaurante .

 Anonymous Tip Line : Starting today I 
 have setup a way for you to send messages to me 
 anonymously . There is a permanent new link in this blog 
 (upper-right) to a submission form that simply has a message box and a 
 submit button. Now this doesn&apos;t mean the blog will suddenly start 
 dishing out dirt from sordid tips. That&apos;s unlikely. But hopefully it 
 does result in more information coming my way about the South Coast 
 restaurant scene.

 Off Topic : I have put together a tribute page for Lynne Carpenter Martyniuk (a Santa Barbara native and my high school 
 classmate) who passed away on April 4th.
 
 Thursday, April 9, 2009 

 Earth Day : The Community Environmental Councils 39th Annual Earth Day Festival -- featuring a wine and beer garden, live music, healthy

 sandwich and get a free side.

 Off Topic : News stories have been 
 written recently about Lynne Carpenter Martyniuk who took her own 
 life last weekend at Cold Spring Bridge. Like many others, I graduated 
 from Santa Barbara High School with her and she was just the most 
 wonderful and kind lady. She will be missed. Her funeral is this Friday 
 at 11:00 a.m. at Free Methodist Church, 1435 Cliff Drive on the Mesa. 
 Here is a photo of Paul, Lynne and their children Sydney, Shayne and 
 Jason.

 New In The Guide : Today I added Root 246 to the restaurant guide.

 Solvang Welcomes&quot;Root 
 246&quot; : Celebrity chef Bradley Ogden brings his 
 James Beard Award-winning experience to the Santa Ynez Valley with the 
 soft opening of his newest restaurant Root 246 last Friday evening. The 
 eatery, located at 420 Alisal Road in Solvang, is part of the new Hotel Corque (formerly the Royal Scandinavian Inn) and is owned by the Santa 
 Ynez Band of Chumash Indians. The grand opening of the restaurant and 
 hotel will be in June.
   
  Jonathan Hall is executive chef, John Church is chef de cuisine and 
 Bradley Ogden is chef/consultant. Root 246 features fresh, contemporary 
 American cuisine using local, organic ingredients in Ogdens signature 
 farm-to-table dishes. The menu changes frequently.

Starters include:

 Finley Farms 
 garden party, goat cheese and spring onion croquettes Twice-baked blue 
 cheese souffle, wild watercress, Hibbits walnuts Local squid frito 
 misto, citrus glaze, lemon dill Berkshire pork 
 belly, tamale pancakes, avocado salad 

Entrees include:

 Grilled Artic 
 Char, spring vegetables, late harvest citrus Prime rib eye 
 steak, root vegetable gratin, broccoli di cicco Santa Barbara 
 sole, house made linguini bloomsdale spinach Double lamb chop, 
 wild mushrooms, fennel and fava bean salad 

Desserts include:

 Root 246 banana 
 split, house made fluff, local strawberries, hot fudge Double dark 
 chocolate pudding cake, chocolate malt ice cream 

  Last Saturday evening I was given a personal 
 tour of the restaurant and it was obvious that no expense was spared to 
 make it beautiful, comfortable yet very functional. Local 
 architecture/interior design firm DesignARC worked closely with Ogden 
 during development. Outside there is a patio with a fireplace. Once inside you first 
 encounter a glass display case with 1,800 wines (90% local) that has 
 separate temperature controls for red and white wines. The restaurant 
 includes a 47-seat dining room, a 12-seat glass-walled Chefs Room for 
 private dining, a bar area, a lounge and a banquet room.
   
  Root 246 is open for dinner daily 5:30 pm-10 pm and for brunch on 
 Sundays 10:30 am - 2:30 pm. Lunch will be available Wednesday - Saturday 
 starting April 15 th . For more information call 688-9003.

 New In The Guide : Today I added Hummingbird Cafe to the restaurant guide.

 Dinner Buffet : Uncle Chen at 1025 Casitas Pass Rd in Carpinteria now has an 
 all-you-can-eat dinner buffet Fri-Sat 5-8pm for $10.95. Uncle Chen&apos;s 
 cuisine includes Mandarin, Szechuan, vegetarian and seafood.

 Name Change : Reader Glenn let me 
 know that Manhattan Bagel at 2000 Cliff Drive is now&quot; Bagel 
 Market Cafe .&quot;I suppose the lack of 80-story skyscrapers on the 
 Mesa contributed to the change.

 Photo Blog : Here are 58 pictures 
 from Friday&apos;s&quot; Dressed 
 in White &quot;benefit party at Stateside Restaurant&amp;Lounge 

 Off Topic : The Restaurant Guy has been asked to be 
 in a movie 
 scene with Meryl Streep being filmed on State Street in 
 mid-April. No need to ask for my autograph though. Apparently I will 
 just walk by in the background. Perhaps if I walk by with intense 
 emotion, battling my personal demons, yet have humor and sensitivity in 
 my stride, I&apos;ll be discovered?
 
 Friday, April 3, 2009 

 Photo Blog : I took pictures last 
 night at First 
 Thursday (Carr Winery, 33 Jewels&amp;Live Culture) and at the Costa Verde 
 International Art Exhibit&amp;Concert at 1129 State Street.

 Gelato : Spoon at 1222 
 State Street is featuring Olive Oil Gelato this week and next.

 Now Serving Dinner : Hugo&apos;s Restaurant at 1029 Casitas Pass Rd in Carpinteria now serves dinner Tue-Sat 5-8pm

 Off Topic : An arrest has been made in the hit-and-run that killed Santa Barbaran Adrianna Bachan . 
 A memorial page for people to leave messages for her family is online 
 now at: SantaBarbara.com/adrianna . 
 Information about a memorial service and memorial fund have been added 
 to the site.

 April Fools : Not to say that anyone 
 was actually fooled, but it is my obligation to inform you that Brophy Bros. is, of course, not being replaced by In-N-Out Burger. On April Fools day 
 2007 Brophy&apos;s became a McDonald&apos;s (and Joe&apos;s Cafe became a non-alcoholic 
 juice bar). Last year Brophy&apos;s was replaced by a Taco Bell ( see 
 photo ).

 Survey: Easter Brunch : I would like 
 to put together a list of restaurants that offer Easter Brunch this 
 year. If you know for sure that a local eatery is planning to have a bunny 
 buffet, please send me an email .

 The Restaurant Guy knows about Fess 
 Parker&apos;s
 Doubletree and Root 246 Owner Justin suggests Julienne Reader Nicole suggests Stonehouse Owner Michelle suggests Epiphany Chef David suggests Harbor Restaurant - see menu Chef Brian suggests Coast at Canary Hotel - see menu Owner Clay suggests Holdren&apos;s Reader Jacquie suggests El Paseo Director Scott suggests Glen Annie Golf Course Owner Philippe suggests Stella Mare&apos;s - see menu Reader Cindy suggests Marriott in Buellton - see menu Reader Anne suggests Bacara 

 European Market : Reader Glenn tells 
 me that the recently closed International Deli&amp;Market has a new sign out front that reads&quot;European Market 
 Opening Soon&quot;

 Off Topic : I have been contacted by 
 the family of Adrianna Bachan (the Santa Barbara girl who died in 
 a hit-and-run at USC) and was asked to setup an official memorial page 
 for people to leave messages. It is online now at: santabarbara.com/adrianna 
 
 Wednesday, April 1, 2009 

 Brophy&apos;s To Become An 
 In-N-Out Burger : In another sign of the recession&apos;s heavy 
 toll on local restaurants, it has come to my attention this morning that Brophy Bros. at the harbor is scheduled to be replaced by an In-N-Out Burger . 
 In-N-Out spokesman Carl Van Fleet said in a press-release:&quot;Brophy 
 Bros has always had long lines of happy customers and we intend to 
 continue the same tradition with the new In-N-Out Burger at the Santa 
 Barbara harbor.&quot; See artist&apos;s 
 rendering of the new facility . This new restaurant will have the 
 nation&apos;s only&quot; sail-up window &quot;where you can order a burger&amp;fries without getting out of your 
 boat. Construction is set to begin in the fall.

 Google Stalks Restaurant 
 Guy : If you view 1219 State Street on Google Maps (the address of Unity Shoppe) and 
 click on&quot; Street View &quot;you will see the Restaurant Guy standing on the curb talking on 
 a cell phone. I am wearing a bright red shirt and blue jeans. The Google 
 Cam drive by apparently 
 occurred last December while I was waiting to open my Santa 
 Claus Call Center . Also pictured are Mrs. Claus volunteers Elizabeth 
 Castillo (blue shirt) and Carol Sauceda (Santa hat).

 Hummingbird Ready To Fly : Hummingbird Cafe opens this Thursday at 1101 State Street, the 
 former home of Java 
 Jones . Hummingbird offers breakfast, organic local salads, 
 sandwiches, soups, wraps, tamales, specialty desserts, organic fair 
 trade coffee and teas, green juices, smoothies and more. They will also 
 offer raw and vegan options as well as organic free range chicken.

 worked at John Givens organic farm for 6 years and worked as the 
 director of Shape of Voice, a local youth newspaper focusing on social 
 justice.
   
  Curtis describes her new caf this way:&quot;We are creating a conscious 
 community caf, providing a total eco-friendly atmosphere where you can 
 feed your belly and your spirit. Most of our food is from local organic 
 farmers and has been intentionally selected handmade with love. While 
 feeding the community we hope to educate and inspire people to nourish 
 themselves and become socially conscious.&quot;
   
  Hummingbird Caf is supporting as many local businesses as possible 
 including Arcobaleno Trade , a fair trade global import store which 
 occupies the back section of the caf. The cafe will also provide 
 exhibit space for artists and community organizations. Restaurant hours

 Off Topic : I 
 think it may be time to call Eric David Greenspan at Make It Work and 
 have him send over a red Mini Cooper to give the Rumor Machine a 
 tune-up. Yesterday the Rumor Machine popped out some 
 non-restaurant-related news that its faded, coffee-stained manual says 
 should never happen. Specifically the print-out read: The retail space 
 formerly occupied by Linens&amp;Things in Camino Real Marketplace 
 may become a Kohls department store. Kohl&apos;s sells 
 moderately-priced apparel, footwear, accessories and soft home products 
 in 1004 stores in 48 states. As always, this rumor might be completely 
 false or a brilliant forecast of future events. Your call.
   
  Speaking of Camino Real Marketplace, Best Buy is scheduled to 
 have a soft opening on May 8 th and their grand opening is May 
 15 th .

 Bread For Bread : The Summer 
 Solstice Parade committee has launched a&quot; Bread for Bread &quot;fundraiser based entirely on food donated by Pascucci restaurant at 729 State Street: Here is the press-release:
 
 Pascucci is donating 1,000 loaves of their famous and yummy garlic cheese bread 
 to Solstice. If you go into Pascucci restaurant to purchase a loaf of 
 bread to go, it is normally $7. Solstice is selling coupons for the 
 bread for $5 per loaf, and all proceeds go to the Summer Solstice who is 
 experiencing ever-rising costs of putting on the beloved Solstice 
 parade.
   
People can order the coupons for the bread on-line, at www.solsticeparde.com using their secure Paypal account and have the 
 coupons will be mailed to them; or they may come into the Solstice 
 office and purchase directly 924 Anacapa ST.#B-1F, please call first to 
 be sure office is open 965-3396.
   
Coupons may be ordered by phone 965-3396 using a credit card or by mail 
 sending your check to Solstice, PO Box 21141, Santa Barbara, CA 93121. 
 This makes a wonderful gift for employers to purchase for their staff, 
 and the coupons have no expiration date. The coupons are NOT 
 available at Pascucci , only through Solstice and you save $2.00.
 
 Speaking Of Solstice : I have been 
 asked to be a waiter again this year at Pascucci on 
 June 3rd, a night when 100% of proceeds (that&apos;s right, 100%) go to 
 Solstice. Be sure to come dine at Pascucci that night and ask to be 
 seated in my section!
 
 Welcome Back Shari : Recently in this 
 column I mentioned that I was seeking an intern to help with the 
 workload at SantaBarbara.com. Interest in SantaBarbara.com (the whole 
 site, not just the dining guide) has exploded in the last year and I can 
 no longer keep up with the demands of businesses that want to be 
 included on the site. Plus I now answer dozens of emails&amp;phone calls 
 every day from tourists asking for tips about Santa Barbara.
   
 I ended up going in a different 
 direction and brought in Shari Falter , a talented web designer, 
 graphic artist&amp;writer to work in a paid position. Shari 
 worked on SantaBarbara.com briefly ten years ago and created the winery 
 guide, beaches guide, parks guide and many other sections of 
 SantaBarbara.com. I may still bring on an intern to help out with 
 additional duties.

 Yellow Pages : In your 2009 phone book&apos;s yellow pages you may have noticed that some restaurants try harder than others to get your 
 attention. Some restaurants list just a name and phone number. Others 
 have 1/8 page, 1/4 page, 1/2 page and 3/4 page ads. A select few 
 
 restaurants, however, have gone the extra mile to let their 
 services be known by taking out a full-page color ad. They are:

 Photo Blog : Here are pictures from 
 last night&apos;s Santa Barbara 
 Downtown Organization mixer at Hotel Santa Barbara. The food at the 
 mixer was donated by four Downtown Organization restaurants: The Greek 
 House Caf, Pascucci, Pierre Lafond Wine Bistro and Silvergreens. 

 Off Topic : I recently noticed an oddity in the numbering system of downtown Santa Barbara addresses on 
 the east-west roads (for example Carrillo St). West of State Street, on 
 the north side, address numbers are all even . Yet east of State 
 Street, on the north side, address numbers are all odd . Why does 
 the address numbering system change once you cross State Street? If you 
 know the answer, or care to offer a wild guess, please send me an email and I will post it here.

 
Reader TG says: Generally speaking (and I emphasize, it only generally) 
 as you travel a street from its origin (#1) through increasing street 
 address numbers, the even numbered address will be on the right and the 
 odd numbers on the left. Since street addresses on Carrillo (and other&quot;east-west&quot;streets) find their origin at State St., the the north 
 side/south side orientation of even and odd addresses will naturally be 
 reversed. Notice that State Street, with origin at Stearns Wharf, 
 follows the same even-right and odd-left pattern, as does the wharf 
 itself, with the Harbor Restaurant (on the right) at 210 Stearns Wharf, 
 and Char West (on the left) at 221. Warning, this is not necessarily 
 true everywhere, especially in places like New York, specifically 
 Manhattan, where to the uninitiated, figuring out address numbers 
 requires an advanced degree in mathematics. - TG
 
Reader Deena says: The following information is drawn from the Santa 
 Barbara News-Press obituary of August 28, 1988:
Richard S. Whitehead was born July 11, 1907, in Cambridge, 
 Massachusetts. He moved to San Mateo, California, in 1913. He later 
 received his BS and MA degrees from MIT. From 1946 to 1969 he worked for 
 the County of Santa Barbara, as director of planning. Among his projects 
 were the first master plan for airports in the county and planning for 
 the Lake Cachuma recreational area. He also helped acquire six county 
 beach parks and several inland parks, as well as establishing a uniform 
 street numbering system in the county. He was a licensed land surveyor 
 and registered civil engineer, a member of the State Water Pollution 
 Control Board, the American Institute of Planners, the American Society 
 of Civil Engineers, and the Channel City Club. He also was the author of 
 Citadel on the Channel: The Royal Presidio of Santa Barbara, Its 
 Founding and Construction, 1782-1798, edited by Donald C. Cutter. 
 Whitehead died in Santa Barbara, August 25, 1988.

 Restaurant Stats : I put together 
 some restaurant stats comparing South Coast openings/closings during the first three 
 months of this year with that of previous years. The stats include 
 restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and dessert destinations. Though it appears that closings are 
 on the rise, there has been an even larger percentage increase in the 
 openings, which is welcome news.

 2009 January - March: 15 openings, 14 closings 2008 January - March: 9 openings, 11 closings 2007 January - March: 10 openings, 7 closings 

 New Kahuna Special : Beginning 
 in April, Kahuna Grill , located in Camino Real Marketplace and 
 Paseo Nuevo, launches their&quot; Monday Stimulus Special &quot;which will 
 be available Monday evenings after 5pm. Order any burger and turn it 
 into a combo at no extra charge. The free fries and drink with your 
 burger is a big savings and this special will undoubtedly be popular. 
 Kahuna Grill&apos;s recently ended&quot;Big Wednesday&quot;offering was a smash hit 
 by every measure and the new Monday Stimulus Special looks to be the 
 same. Way to go Dale!

 Off Topic : The Muscular Dystrophy 
 Association&apos;s annual Black&amp;Blue Ball has been canceled this year. Here is a message from Steve Golis, director of this year&apos;s 
 fundraiser:
 
&quot;It was sad news that MDA Corporate in light of our current economic 
 climate has decided to postpone this years Black and Blue Ball. They 
 will revisit at the end of the year and decide on if the event will 
 happen in 2010. MDA National on the events they have done this year so 
 far have all brought in substantially less revenues than the previous 
 years so they feel they kind of see the writing on the wall for this 
 year. MDA Corporate has instructed Regional and Local Offices to focus 
 on small projects that folks can contribute a dollar or two, like fill 
 the boot, and buy a shamrock.&quot;- Steve Golis

 A new late-night restaurant named QuesaDilla Rilla is coming to the 
 downtown area. They will be open until 4am and offer a variety of 
 popular and specialty quesadillas (with salsa) including the sprouted soy cheese adilla. Other menu options include chocolate-dipped bananas and fresh 
 juices. They will support the local community by using fresh, local 
 ingredients.

 Melting Pot Events : Owner Jeb 
 Wilson sent me information about events at the Melting 
 Pot restaurant, 608 Anacapa Street:

 Happy Hour : Sun-Thu 5-7pm in the bar area, $6 Skyy martinis 
 (all varieties), $6 select house wines, 2 for $22 deal: 2 glasses of

 available for this event. 

 Whole Foods Update : Whole Foods market will be opening this Winter (instead of Fall) at 3761 
 State Street, the former home of Circuit City.

 Off Topic : It appears that rental photo booths are all the rage now. Last week I took 
 pictures at the&quot;Saks&amp;the City&quot;benefit for the 
 Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation and saw everyone lining up to take their turn at a very 
 popular photo booth. I spoke with Ricky Mia, owner of&quot;Photobooth 
 Santa Barbara,&quot;and he tells me that the booths are popular at all 
 events including birthdays and weddings. At wedding receptions the new trend is 
 to give guests at each table an empty picture frame that they can then 
 fill with a 4x6 mosaic of photos while still at the party. For more 
 information visit photoboothsantabarbara.com .

 Sushi 7 : Sushi 7 restaurant next to Vons in Montecito has closed and is planning to 
 reopen soon in a new location on Coast Village Rd.

 Burger Place : Construction has 
 stopped at a new 
 restaurant named&quot; Burger Place &quot;next to Vons in Montecito and plans to open the eatery have ended.

 Speaking Of Burgers : Santa Barbara&apos;s mobile cheese burger service called the&quot; Burger Bus &quot;is 
 planning an early May launch. The roving restaurant will have its 
 home base at Earl Warren Showgrounds. Burger Bus will be featured in the&quot;around the town&quot;section of Santa Barbara Magazine in the May/June 
 issue.

 Yogurtland : Yogurtland was 
 scheduled to open at 621 State Street in early March. I stopped by 
 yesterday to see the progress and it seems to be way behind schedule 
 (see photo). It appears that a summer opening is more likely.

 Mediterra Cafe&amp;Market Closes : 
 Reader Mike passed this message to me:&quot; Mediterra in Goleta has closed its doors - sign on the door saying that they&apos;re 
 seeking someone to operate the facility before reopening.&quot;I called 
 Mediterra and their voice mail says they will be closed&quot;until we can 
 find qualified personnel.&quot;

 Bug Squashed : I fixed a nasty bug in 
 the restaurant guide&apos;s search engine. It used to explode anytime you 
 searched for a restaurant name that included an apostrophe. Now you can 
 search for Chuck&apos;s of 
 Hawaii , D&apos;Angelo Bread and Woody&apos;s BBQ to 
 your heart&apos;s content!

 New In The Guide : I gave a friend 
 the Sideways tour last weekend in 
 the Santa Ynez Valley. While passing through 
 Buellton I was able to take pictures of AJ Spurs (highlighted in the movie) and added them to the guide today. 
 I had never been there before and it is an amazing experience. Think of it as Cold Spring Tavern on steroids.

 Pizza has opened at 1905 Cliff Drive on the Mesa. I stopped

 St. Patrick&apos;s Day : Today is the 
 national holiday of Ireland, a day that has also been celebrated in 
 North America since March 17, 1737, when the Irish Society of 
 Boston organized what was the first Saint Patrick&apos;s Day Parade in the 
 colonies. Locals interested in enjoying today&apos;s green scene have many 
 entertainment venue choices across town. Here are three for your 
 consideration:

 Dargan&apos;s 
 Irish Pub&amp;Restaurant , 18 E. Ortega Street - Open 10 am. 
 Abbreviated menu all day: Corn Beef and Cabbage, Irish lamb stew, 
 bangers and mash, fish n&apos; chips and chicken Caesar salad. Irish Folk 
 Music: Shepherd Pie 12:30pm to 2:30pm, Dannsair from 6:30pm to 8:30pm, 
 Bagpipers from 6:00pm to 6:30pm. SOhO Restaurant&amp;Music Club , 1221 State Street - Spencer at SOhO: Back 
 from an extended stay in Mexico and just in time for St. Patricks Day

 Worried Lads&quot;, live and direct at SOhO, 5-9pm. Kids of all ages welcome. Coast 
 Restaurant&amp;Bar , 31 W. Carrillo Street - Coast will be offering 
 festive St. Patrick&apos;s Day-inspired cocktails, including an&quot;Irish 
 Manhattan&quot;and of course green beer. Happy Hour from 4 - 7pm features 
 special pricing on Smithwicks, Jameson, and Bushmills, as well as a 
 great selection of Irish beers. Chef Brian Parks creates amusing Happy 
 Hour appetizers, specially priced in honor of St. Patrick. 

 Teavana : Specialty tea retailer Teavana , with more than 80 locations nationwide, will be replacing 
 the recently-closed Santa 
 Barbara Roasting Co. in Paseo Nuevo. Their website teavana.com offers 
 the following description:
 
&quot;The Teavana dream began with an idea that people would enjoy fresh, 
 high-quality tea in a place that was part Tea Bar, part Tea Emporium. We 
 wanted to introduce people to the aromas, textures, and beneficial 
 qualities of loose leaf teas while enlightening them with the history 
 and variety of teas available. And this is how Teavana was born.
   
As our name implies, Teavana&apos;s goal is to be a heaven of tea and to 
 offer our customers the healthy lifestyle and wonderful tastes of tea. 
 This unique name is meant to describe the experience each customer has 
 with our tea and our staff.
   
After considerable research, only those teas with rich flavors and 
 superior health benefits are selected for Teavana. We opened our first 
 teahouse in Atlanta, Georgia. Since then we have opened over 80 Teavana 
 locations throughout the US and Mexico.&quot;
 
 Rumor Machine : To minimize my 
 electric bill during the recession I have kept the Rumor Machine 
 unplugged. I turn it on occasionally to keep the parts in working order 
 and when I did so yesterday, the inkjet motor suddenly fired up and a 
 printed message popped out that read:&quot;A Brazilian restaurant is 
 considering moving into 113 W. De La Guerra Street, the former home of Saffron .&quot;As always, this rumor might be completely false or a brilliant forecast 
 of future events. Your call.

 Rest In Peace : 
 Here is a list of all local dining destinations that have closed in the 
 last six months.

 OmniFresco : I received an email from 
 Jill Brouillard, owner of Fresco Cafe , letting me know the status of the catering 
 business that was recently spun off from Fresco:
 
Hi John,
I just wanted to let you know that Fresco catering is now OmniFresco 
 Catering. We have recently put the finishing touches on creating our 
 partnership and are excited about bringing new services to our clients 
 in Santa Barbara. Heather Story and Sarah Dandona and I have created 
 this new company and are branching out into weddings, cooking classes 
 and continued community involvement.
Although our plan to work with The Isla Vista Youth Project fell through 
 because of a Goleta zoning issue, we are still involved in many 
 philanthropic activities and will continue to be, in the new year. We 
 have all been through a lot and many businesses have suffered as of 
 late, and we want to thank everyone in Santa Barbara for the support 
 they have shown to our catering business as well as Fresco Five Pts. 
 Cafe and Fresco Cafe North. Mom&amp;Pop businesses are so vital to the 
 health of our local economy and beyond and we need to continue to 
 support those who support us.
Best,
Jill Brouillard
 
 Off Topic : Twenty years ago today Tim Berners-Lee published a proposal to create the World Wide Web. The first web 
 site went online August 6, 1991. It provided an explanation about what 
 the World Wide Web was, how one could own a browser and how to set up a 
 Web server. It was also the world&apos;s first Web directory, since 
 Berners-Lee maintained a list of other Web sites apart from his own.
  Being a software programmer, I subscribed to lots of geek magazines&amp;journals and first heard about the web in early 1993. I remember being 
 amazed by the whole concept and excited about the possibilities of 
 creating something at home that could be seen across the entire world.
  By 1994 I read an article about a child surfing the web and went into a full-blown panic that I had missed the entire web revolution. In 
 May 1994 the first Santa Barbara web conference was held and a live web 
 demonstration was presented. Then-Mayor Hal Conklin spoke at the 
 conference and talked about the revolution that was starting to unfold. 
 I remember being impressed that he understood that this new thing called 
 the Web would change the world.
   Soon after that conference I signed up 
 for my first home dial-up Internet service. The first thing I did was
 deconstruct another web site to figure out how HTML works so 
 I could create my very first web site (that I still run to this 
 day): WebDirectory.com .

 Winter Wine Down : Last weekend I 
 attended the Muscular Dystrophy Association&apos;s Winter Wine Down and 
 Culinary Competition at Roblar Winery where I was a food judge . 
 My personal favorite food items were the pulled pork sandwich from Joe&apos;s Cafe and 
 the bacon-wrapped scallops from Mongo&apos;s Saloon in Grover beach. 
 Both items were mind-blowing amazing. Here is my photo album of 
 the event .

 Speaking Of Santa Ynez : While I was 
 in the Santa Ynez Valley last weekend for the Winter Wine Down I took 
 pictures of five Santa Ynez eateries that had no photos in the 
 restaurant guide, including: Burger Barn , Dos Carlitos , Pizza Shack , Roasted Bean Coffee 
 House , and  Santa Cota Market&amp;Deli .

 Off Topic : Yesterday I visited Griffith Observatory with a class from Santa Barbara City College. 
 This was my first visit since they completed a $93 million renovation 
 two years ago. 
 The renovation added a restaurant, science displays, a movie theater and 
 a new planetarium - all below ground. 
 I highly recommend you see a show at the new planetarium - it&apos;s the best 
 in the nation. The picture on the far right is a night view from Griffith of downtown Los 
 Angeles.

 Hot Spots Opens Saturday : Reopening 
 in their original location at 36 State Street, the hugely popular Hot 
 Spots coffee shop makes a triumphant return this Saturday, March 
 14th. Hot Spots was one of the busiest 24/7 coffee shops in all of Santa 
 Barbara when they closed in January 2005 to make room for the La 
 Entrada redevelopment project. The hours will initially be 5am 2am 
 and then in a couple of weeks Hot Spots will transition to a 24/7 
 schedule. Hot Spots is run by locals Eric&amp;Kristin Hamor who were born 
 and raised in Santa Barbara.
   
Hot Spots will include coffee from Caribbean Coffee, pastries from 
 Debbies Delights, bagels from I.V. Bagel Company, sandwiches, Yerba Mate 
 teas and more. The Santa Barbara Hot Spots free hotel reservation 
 service will also return and there will be a touch screen kiosk that 
 gives you lots of local information, including bus routes. A free Wi-Fi 
 hotspot will be available in addition to several Internet computers for 
 rent by the minute. The popular Hot Spots outdoor patio also returns to 
 its former glory.
   
The return of Hot Spots marks the beginning of the restoration of the 
 entire neighborhood into a clean, vibrant area. In addition to the 
 extensive interior remodel, Hot Spots built a new roof, fixed the 
 exterior lighting, replaced windows that had been covered with graffiti 
 and have given the building a fresh coat of paint. Neighboring business 
 Wheel Fun Rentals has reopened their bike rental service.
   
&quot;We are ecstatic to be at the beach again and are thankful for all the 
 local support we have been getting,&quot;said owner Eric Hamor.

 Restaurant Marcella Closes : Reader 
 Tony let me know that Restaurant 
 Marcella at 2860 Grand Ave in Los Olivos has closed. The eatery 
 was inside Fess Parkers Wine Country Inn&amp;Spa. I called the Inn and 
 they told me that Marcella will be replaced by Petros Kafe , a 
 Greek/Mediterranean restaurant that opens in May.

 The Crystal Ball : After intense 
 concentration and a wave of my hand over the all-knowing Crystal Ball, 
 my eatery oracle has revealed a list of locations appearing in the 
 future:

 Hot Spots (downtown) March 14 Yogurtland (downtown) March Three Pickles (Goleta) March Blush (downtown) April Petros Kafe (Los Olivos) May Yo Yum Yum (Goleta) May Holdrens (Goleta) July Pastavino (Goleta) July Burger Place (Montecito) 2009 Giovanni&apos;s Pizza (Mesa) 2009 Hummingbird Cafe (downtown) 2009 On The Side (Isla Vista) 2009 Red Mango (Upper State) 2009 Saigon In&amp;Out (downtown) 2009 Whole Foods Market (Upper State) 2009

 Blush : I recently reported that the 
 restaurant formerly known as&quot; Zelo &quot;(630 State Street) was being renovated, will offer California cuisine 
 and will have a walkway to neighboring nightclub Tonic. I am told that 
 the name of the new restaurant/lounge will be&quot; Blush &quot;and it is expected 
 to open in April.

 Euro Deli For Sale :  European Deli at 149 N. Fairview Ave has been listed for sale for $107,000 on a local realtor web site.

 Happy Harry&apos;s : I received this email 
 from the folks at the new Happy Harry&apos;s produce stand in Goleta:
 
Hi John,
Referring to your post of February 17, about Happy Harry&apos;s opening...I 
 am happy to tell you that we finally opened our doors to the public 
 (March 6, 2009). It has been over eleven years since we closed the 
 Patterson/Hollister location in October 1997 and we are looking forward 
 to seeing all of our old customers as well as a lot of new faces. In our 
 new incarnation, we have more to offer than we had before. We have a 
 selection of wines and beer, a lot of organic, locally grown produce and 
 much more. We are in a brand-new, beautiful building right next to the 
 Mobil gas station at the Glen Annie/Storke Road exit in Goleta. Our 
 address is 7020 Calle Real and the phone number is 685-6868. Please come 
 and check out our new store!!!
Thanks,
Barbara Abbass Ali
 
 

 Accept No Substitutes : File this one 
 away under B for&quot;bizarre.&quot;I was told a story last weekend by my friend 
 Katie. Katie was with a group of friends recently, standing outside of 
 The Melting Pot restaurant after an enjoyable dinner. A guy walked up to 
 their group and joined the conversation. Soon he told the group&quot;I am 
 The Restaurant Guy&quot;and started talking about restaurants. Katie asked him what he meant by that. He replied 
 to the group&quot;I&apos;m the The Restaurant Guy - the one from the newspaper.&quot;Katie told him&quot;No you&apos;re 
 not. John is a friend of mine. You&apos;re not the Restaurant Guy!&quot;Apparently he sullenly looked down and then walked away.

 For more information on ticket sales contact Courtney Wick, Muscular 
 Dystrophy Association, 805-560-7651.

 New In The Guide : Today I added China Express to the restaurant guide.

 China Express Opens : The Pavilion Garden that closed last month at 414 N. Milpas Street has returned as China Express with a new concept and a new name. The eatery, owned by China Pavilion , 
 no longer has a buffet but instead uses a concept similar to Panda 
 Express where the food is out on display and you just tell the server 
 which items you want. General Manager Ryan Yoshinaga sent me a message 
 about the new restaurant:
 
Hello John,

Just wanted to tell you that Pavilion Garden has now reopened as China 
 Express and has changed the concept to more of a fast food restaurant. 
 You can do a combo plate or a simple rice bowl. The Appetizers are made 
 fresh per order and we are also available to do a family pack meal. Same 
 chefs, same recipes, same great food, but in a different style of 
 service.

Thanks,

Ryan Yoshinaga
General Manager
China Pavilion
 
 Live Culture Opens : Live Culture 
 Lounge has opened at 11 W. De La Guerra in Paseo Nuevo in the 
 location formerly occupied by Pierre Lafond . 
 Here is a description of the eatery from their web site liveculturelounge.com :
 
Live Culture Frozen Yogurt Lounge, Cafe&amp;Wine Bar is the vision of 
 three Santa Barbarans who want to share their love of: life, live music, 
 art, specialty foods and good company in a comfortable yet stimulating 
 environment. Most of all we are creating a gathering place for our 
 friends, family, like-minded locals and out of town visitors to relax 
 and take in all that a nice meal and/or treat in a beautiful surrounding 
 has to offer. We are dedicated to giving back to the community and will 
 host charitable events for local&amp;global causes. A community seating 
 area with Wi-Fi access will be provided to encourage community and 
 social development. We look forward to incorporating you into Our 
 Culture!
 
 Speaking Of Paseo Nuevo : I confirmed 
 that Santa Barbara 
 Roasting Co. - Paseo Nuevo has closed their doors.

 Food For Thought : Last night was a 
 bit hectic, to say the least. I finished work at my office at about 7:30pm 
 and at 9:00pm had to leave for LAX (to pick up my sister). However, also 
 last night, I had previously put in my schedule the task of taking 
 pictures of restaurants all across the South Coast that were 
 participating in the Alzheimer&apos;s Association&apos;s&quot;Food for Thought&quot;campaign and donating 10% of proceeds to the non-profit. This left me just 90 minutes to 
 accomplish my goal.
   
  The ironic twist to this episode is that I was hungry, yet I had 
 no time to stop for dinner or grab a munchie. From 8:04pm to 8:41pm 
 I was literally sprinting down State Street from restaurant to 
 restaurant, smelling the delicious aromas while my stomach growled 
 something fierce.
   
  I took my last photo at 9:02pm (at Giovanni&apos;s Pizza in Montecito) and then raced off to LAX where I arrived just in time to greet my 
 sister. And as luck would have it, my sister brought a box of&quot;Pollo 
 Campero&quot;chicken with her from El Salvador. Of course she made a point of 
 telling me that she 
 thought it was funny that I visited 16 restaurants spanning from Goleta 
 to Montecito yet was saved from starvation by a box of wings in Los 
 Angeles that were flown in from Central America...
   
  Without further delay, here are the 
 photos taken last night and here is a log of last night&apos;s activity 
 (based on the time stamps of the photos in my camera):

7:26pm - Hollister Brewing Co. (Goleta)
7:37pm - Woody&apos;s BBQ (Goleta)
7:48pm - Via Maestra 42 (Upper State)
8:04pm - Carlitos Cafe (State)
8:05pm - Opal (State)
8:09pm - Chef Karim&apos;s (State)
8:11pm - McDonalds (State)
8:15pm - State&amp;A (State)
8:18pm - Olio e Limon (Victoria)
8:28pm - California Pizza Kitchen (Chapala)
8:30pm - Blenders in the Grass (State)
8:35pm - Pierre Lafond Wine Bistro (State)
8:37pm - Holdren&apos;s (State)
8:41pm - Cold Stone Creamery (State)
8:56pm - Cafe Del Sol (Montecito, Bird Refuge)
9:02pm - Giovanni&apos;s Pizza (Montecito, Coast Village Rd)

Many more restaurants participated than I was able to visit but I can 
 safely say I did my best .

 Celebrating 13 Years : The 
 SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide became a teenager today. I started 
 the guide on March 4th, 1996 . The Harbor 
 Restaurant and Moby Dick 
 Restaurant were the first locations added to the guide. 
 SantaBarbara.coms first office was at 1114 State Street #308 in La 
 Arcada, above what is now Stateside 
 Restaurant&amp;Lounge.
   
  The first digital 
 camera ( Kodak DC-40 ) that I purchased for the guide 
 (I&apos;m on my 6th one now) 
 had a non-removable memory chip, a maximum capacity of 32 photos and 
 cost $750. My camera was subsequently taken to McMurdo Station in Antarctica by a researcher friend of mine to photograph penguins . Because it had no movable parts and was built 
 like a tank, researchers told me that it was the only digital camera 
 that could survive the cold. All other cameras broke. In 1997 Kodak featured those penguin photos in national 
 advertising that touted their product&apos;s durability. 
    
   Below is a photo of yours truly in early 1996 
 (complete with messy desk and ancient computer system) taken in my 
 State Street office just after launch of 
 SantaBarbara.com and the SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide.
   
 

 Decaffeinated? Reader Thomas tells 
 me that the Santa 
 Barbara Roasting Co. in Paseo Nuevo has closed. I tried calling 
 and the phone just rings. I&apos;ll check it out tonight.

 Food For Thought : At the Alzheimer&apos;s 
 Associations&apos; request, I will be racing from one restaurant to 
 another tonight taking pictures of eateries that are participating 
 in the Food For Thought fundraiser (see Monday&apos;s blog). I hope to hit a 
 dozen or more...

 Paella Poll : Reader Gina is trying 
 to find out which restaurants offer Paella on their menus. If you 
 have any suggestions please send me an email and 
 I will post it here!

 
Reader Lemonjelly:&quot;I thought the paella at Patrick&apos;s Side Street 
 Cafe in Los Olivos was good and fresh. Of course, it doesn&apos;t 
 beat my homemade paella, but that&apos;s not available to the public.&quot;
 
Reader Danny:&quot;At the Plow&amp;Angel we serve Paella every Tuesday, as our &apos;Friends 
 and Neighbors&apos; special it comes with soup or salad and a dessert.&quot;
 
Reader Stephen:&quot; Beachside 
 Bar Cafe makes a good seafood paella.&quot;
 
Reader Anita:&quot;I had a Paella at Emilio&apos;s a few 
 years ago that was excellent!&quot;
 
Reader John:&quot;Every time I go to Opal I see 
 paella on the menu and order it. Very nice.&quot;
 
Reader Cyrus:&quot; Opal makes a good Paella. Next time do a Chippino poll! The Enterprise Fish 
 Company makes one to die for!&quot;
 
Reader Margie:&quot; Cava in Montecito?&quot;

 more information call 962-8500.

 New In Five Points : Milano 
 Italian Kitchen in Five Points Shopping Center has been sold and 
 will become a California Pasta . Jim Craddock, owner of California Pasta in 
 Paseo Nuevo, sent me an email about his plans:
 
&quot;We have been hoping to expand our well-received 
 concept and feel the Five Points location will be a good addition. We 
 will be changing the menus to include items from California Pasta and 
 the current Milano menus. Eventually the name will be changed to 
 California Pasta, probably early April. We hope that everyone will be 
 excited about the changes ahead and will come to see us. Just as 
 downtown we believe in giving great food&amp;service, big portions with 
 value in mind.&quot;- Jim Craddock, California Pasta
 
 10th Anniversaries : Chuck&apos;s 
 Waterfront Grill at 113 Harbor Way is celebrating their 10th

 offering a complete meal of Alaskan Halibut for only $14.95 . 
 Discounts will also be available on Prime Top Sirloin Steak and Hawaiian 
 Chicken. There will also be discounts on drinks including $3.95 Mai Tais.

 closed for remodel .&quot;

 Restaurant Of the Month : Silvergreens - 
 Downtown is restaurant of the month for March!

 New In The Guide : Today I added Sweet Alley at 955 Embarcadero del Mar 
 in Isla Vista to the guide. They have 10 self-serve non-fat yogurt 
 machines with an endless toppings bar. Plus, McConnell&apos;s ice cream, bulk 
 candy and a cereal bar. It appears to be a smash hit from day one. The 
 owner tells me that the frozen yogurt is so popular that he has had to 
 add extra refrigerators and nearly every day he contacts his suppliers 
 with and an&quot;emergency order&quot;to restock.

 Pastavino&amp;Holdren&apos;s Update : I 
 received an update from owner Clay Holdren about the two new restaurants 
 he is bringing to Camino Real Marketplace. One is an Italian restaurant 
 named Pastavino while the other will be a Holdren&apos;s Steaks&amp;Seafood.
 
Just an update for you John. We went in front of the city of Goleta 
 yesterday and got preliminary approval for the project. Looks like we 
 will begin construction in the beginning of April and we are targeting 
 mid-July for opening the doors. I am very excited to get these two 
 restaurants going... I will keep you updated. With all of the bad news 
 going around, I thought you might want to hear a bit of good news. Keep 
 up the good work!!

Thanks,
Clay Holdren

 Retrieval Corporation that you guessed it picks up abandoned

 a shopping cart loitering around your neighborhood, be sure to call 800-252-4613 .

 The Hungry Cat Purrs : 
 Positive news is always welcome in this economy and the Hungry Cat restaurant at 1134 Chapala Street has plenty to share. Starting March 
 17th Hungry Cat begins offering lunch service Tuesday Saturday 
 11:30 a.m. 2:30 p.m. and brunch service on Sundays. Hungry Cat 
 has also started accepting reservations for the first time. In April or 
 May Hungry Cat will expand the restaurant by adding a second dining 
 room , using part of the space currently occupied by neighboring 
 business Don Q Billiards.

 Favorite Places : 
 This is the first in a series where I ask locals to tell me about 
 their favorite places to eat and drink. For today&apos;s blog I 
 interviewed 12 local columnists , listed below and sorted 
 alphabetically by the name of their media outlet.

 Toni Thompson ( Coastal View News ):&quot;The Corktree - the amazing (and affordable) wine selection, lobster 
 mac n cheese, and Murph Panini keep us coming back for more! When we 
 are looking for a romantic spot to celebrate a big occasion in Santa 
 Barbara, we head to Elements Restaurant. When we are looking for a bit 
 of international flare, we go to Cafe Buenos Aires in Santa Barbara, 
 sit on the patio and enjoy the flamenco dancers doing their thing!&quot; Craig Smith ( Craig 
 Smiths Blog ): On Sunday evenings we walk down to Brophy Bros. 
 from the Mesa. I always have a Bloody Mary and the shrimp and chips. 
 Wednesdays, I&apos;m often at the Sandbar for dinner. The extended happy 
 hour is great (2 for 1 Mexican beers) and I always order the 
 enchiladas marisco (seafood enchiladas). Craig&apos;s other favorites 
 include Norton&apos;s Pastrami, Los Arroyos, The Habit, The James Joyce 
 (Irish coffee), Good Cup, Daily Grind and the Coffee Cat. Jenni Perez ( Daily Nexus ): 
 My favorite place is Freebirds. It&apos;s pretty clich to say that but 
 there is a reason why there is a line out the door at 2 a.m. on 
 weekends. Their burritos are hard to resist. I also like Pascucci and 
 their classic Italian menu. Loretta Redd ( Daily Sound ):&quot;My favorites: Opal for business lunch or nice dinner, Paradise Grill 
 for burgers and Louie&apos;s on the deck (the Upham) For a &apos;splurge&apos; meal, 
 make it either Seagrass or Ruth&apos;s Chris.&quot; Karen Lee 
 Stevens ( Daily 
 Sound , Examiner.com ):&quot;I like to go to the Natural Cafe (tasty tostada 
 salad), Sizzler (as a vegetarian, I appreciate their vegetable soup 
 and variety of veggies at the salad bar), and Lazy Acres (their 
 make-it-yourself salad bar is the best in town). When I&apos;m not eating 
 salads, I like the cheese enchiladas with beans&amp;rice combo at Rose 
 Cafe (on the Mesa).&quot; Barney 
 Brantingham ( Independent ):&quot;Among my favorites are Opal, Max&apos;s, Petrini&apos;s, Harry&apos;s, Via Maestro 
 42, Pascucci, Pan e Vino, Trattoria Vittoria, Chase Cafe, Ichiban, 
 Madam Lu, Endless Summer, Dargan&apos;s, Los Arroyos, Boathouse. Tre Luna, 
 Paradise and too many more to mention.&quot; Penny Patterson ( Independent ): 
 Cajun Kitchen on Canon Perdido is by far the best place for 
 breakfast. Panino is our favorite place to get my favorite food, 
 sandwiches. Dinner will usually find my girlfriend and I at Fresco or 
 the Natural Cafe. Going out to eat for breakfast is one of my 
 girlfriend&apos;s and my favorite things in the world to do, so if you are 
 looking for an overarching favorite, I&apos;d have to go with Cajun. Starshine 
 Roshell ( Independent ):&quot;We love love love Sly&apos;s in Carpinteria. The artichoke makes me weep. 
 Big fan of Tupelo, Zaytoon (who can resist a hookah?) and Los Arroyos. 
 Flavor of India. Just had a killer meal at Louie&apos;s last night.&quot; Tim Buckley ( Montecito 
 Journal ):&quot;I&apos;m going to have to say that for lunch I eat at the 
 Montecito Deli almost every single day (try the tri-tip sandwich). For 
 dinner I like Tre Lune, Sly&apos;s and Edomasa. For a drink I recommend 
 Joe&apos;s, Lucky&apos;s and the Biltmore (margaritas!)&quot; Arthur von 
 Wiesenberger ( News-Press , Nippers.com ): My 
 favorite places keep evolving as new restaurants come on the scene. 
 Jane is a case in point. I have always loved the Montecito Cafe for 
 food, service and value and only wished there was one closer to 
 downtown. Recently my prayers were answered! I love Olio e Limone for 
 refined Italian cuisine. Harry&apos;s does a great job on steak and drinks 
 at reasonable prices. Leslie Dinaberg ( Noozhawk , Daily Sound , SBParent.com ): If 
 I could afford it, I would eat at Arigato every day. Since I can&apos;t, my 
 almost-daily splurge is Latte&apos;s at Java Station. My favorite place for 
 cocktails is Chuck&apos;s, although Harry&apos;s is a close second. Henry Dubroff ( Pacific Coast 
 Business Times ): I really like the Chase Grill on State Street 
 for lunch as it is a place to be seen and the Italian-style food is 
 unfailingly great. The owners are wonderful and you can get a smaller, 
 less expensive portion if you order an eggplant or chicken parmesan 
 sandwich without the bread. I&apos;m also a big fan of Coast in the Canary 
 Hotel. The fare is more traditional California and the shaved prime 
 rib sandwich is to die for. It&apos;s got lots of booths so you can have a 
 quiet and confidential chat. One of the hidden aspects of South Coast 
 dining is great breakfasts on the cheap. The Cajun Kitchen is awesome 
 for home fries, especially the one on Linden Ave in Carp. Also East 
 Beach Grill on East Beach (blueberry pancakes) and Long Horn Coffee 
 Shop in Santa Ynez.

 Yogurt Invasion : Reader Tony let me know that Yo Yum Yum , a self-serve-style yogurt shop, is 
 coming to 5915A Calle Real in Goleta next to Zodo&apos;s Bowling. It was widely reported last year 
 that the South Coast experienced a Cupcake Invasion . This 
 year it appears that a Yogurt Invasion is underway with the first 
 shot fired by Pinkberry which opened downtown in January. Pinkberry&apos;s 
 supporting troops will arrive over the next few months including Yogurtland (downtown), Live Culture (downtown), Red Mango (Five Points) and now Yo Yum Yum (Goleta). Yo Yum Yum opened 
 their first regional location in Carpinteria last September.

 Reds Cafe Update : 
 This just in from Dana Walters at Reds Cafe :
 
Hi John,

There&apos;s a rumor around town that Reds has closed. Not True. We&apos;re 
 house
cleaning and doing a bit of a facelift. New colors, hours, menu (cheese
plates, tapas, and champagne brunch, wine and beer menu, homemade 
 desserts,
etc. A new and improved Reds. We&apos;re joining the Urban Wine Trail down
here and becoming an &apos;Urban Wine Bar&apos;. Exciting!
Can you help spread the word?

Thanks,
Dana
 
 Oscar Party : Ruth&apos;s Chris 
 Steakhouse is hosting an Oscar party fundraiser dinner this 
 Sunday.

 Specials : Almost daily for as long 
 as I can remember I am asked the same question:&quot;Why don&apos;t you list 
 restaurant specials?&quot;And almost daily for as long as I can remember I 
 reply with the same answer:&quot;It&apos;s too much work to gather and maintain 
 specials information because it changes so frequently.&quot;
   
  I am now considering creating a restaurant Specials category that will be limited to sponsors-only which would allow me to give it 
 the kind of attention it needs to succeed. Restaurants listed in the 
 Specials category will also have a marker next to their name wherever 
 they appear in the guide that lets people know Specials are available.
   
  This will be the first advertising option available to all 
 restaurants, coffee shops, etc in the nearly 13 year history of this 
 guide. It will take several weeks for me to write the software and 
 restructure the dining database to create this functionality. The launch will likely be in March or April.
   
  If your business is currently listed in the restaurant guide and 
 you are interested in publicizing your Specials, please send 
 me an email .

 Reds Cafe Closing? : This just in from 
 reader Kristen:&quot;Time to pull Reds Cafe off 
 the restaurant guide. They were closed and liquidating this past 
 weekend.&quot;Others tell me that they are under a 3 week renovation to 
 become a wine bar. I am investigating.

 A Word From Doug : After receiving 
 news that the Wine Cask closed yesterday, I contacted the man who owned and managed the restaurant 
 from 1981 to 2007, Doug Margerum . We chatted back&amp;forth via 
 email and he clearly has been moved by the turn of events. Margerum offered this official statement:&quot;I was saddened to hear that 
 the Wine Cask has closed. I feel for the Rosenson family, this must be a 
 very difficult time for them. My hope is that Wine Cask could begin anew 
 now that this chapter has ended.&quot;The Independent reports that the closure resulted from an eviction that was triggered by several months of unpaid rent.

 Pizza Mizza Specials : Sean Ebadi, 
 owner of Pizza Mizza , 
 sent me information about some new specials:

 Wine Cask&amp;Intermezzo Close : On 
 Monday evening I spoke with the Wine Cask restaurant and they told me that starting this week they will cut back 
 their dinner schedule to just Thursday-Saturday. Tuesday evening a Wine 
 Cask employee wrote me to say that now the restaurant has decided to go 
 out of business.
   
  I am told that neighboring Intermezzo (same ownership) was locked during posted business hours Tuesday evening 
 so I am assuming they are closed unless I hear otherwise. Wine Cask owner Bernie Rosenson 
 bought the restaurant from previous owner Doug Margerum in 2007.

 Prime Rib Special : On Friday 
 evenings Marmalade 
 Cafe in La Cumbre Plaza has started a $19.95 Prime Rib Dinner 
 special that includes a 10 oz cut of Prime Rib with Au Jus, mashed 
 potatoes and a Marmalade vegetable medley. For more information call 
 682-5246.

 Creekside Is Fine : On Monday I 
 published a list of all restaurants that have closed in the last six 
 months that included JR&apos;s 
 BBQ at Creekside . Apparently some people incorrectly think that 
 the Creekside (4444 Hollister Ave) is closed, which is not the case. 
 Only neighboring JR&apos;s is gone. Here is an email I received from 
 the Creekside this morning:
 
Dear John,

Hey it&apos;s Jules at the Creekside. Everybody&apos;s calling thinking the 
 Creekside is closed, when in fact J.R.&apos;s is the only thing that closed. 
 We have a full kitchen that is open and serving food, and the dining 
 room will be open in the springtime. Bar menu starts at 4pm- 10pm 
 Mon-Thurs and 4pm-11 or until people stop getting hungry on weekends. If 
 you can please retract your article with this new info.

Thank You very much,
Jules

 The Barbecue Company Opens : Last 
 Saturday a new restaurant opened for business at 3807 Santa Claus Lane 
 in Carpinteria. The Barbecue 
 Company (added to the guide today) is a full service family 
 restaurant serving lunch and dinner with an emphasis on multi-regional 
 American barbecue. In addition to barbecue, the menu offers grilled and 
 sauted items representing some of Chef Garys favorite dishes from his 
 years as an executive hotel chef and private chef.
   
The entire menu is a good representation of the many diverse styles of 
 barbecue our country enjoys, says co-owner Jackie Nielson. From the 
 Kentucky and Carolina style barbecue sauces to the Texas brisket and the 
 perfectly moist pulled pork sandwich (a Lexington favorite); we have 
 something for every barbecue lover.
   
Local musical talent will fill the evenings on weekends and large flat 
 screen televisions are in place for sports fans.
   
The Barbecue Company was conceptualized in 2008 by Gary and Jackie 
 Nielsen, both long-time Carpinteria residents. Many local people will 
 remember Gary as the former Carpinteria mayor and city councilman who 
 served the community in these capacities for eight years. Hours are: 
 Wed-Thu 11am-9pm, Fri-Sat 11am-10pm, Sun-Mon 11am-9pm, Closed Tue. View their full menu online . For more 
 information call 684-2209 or visit thebarbecuecompany.net .

 The Story Of Starbucks : 
 The original Starbucks was opened at Pike Place Market in Seattle, 
 Washington in 1971 by three partners: English teacher Jerry Baldwin , 
 history teacher Zev Siegel , and writer Gordon Bowker . They chose the 
 name Starbucks in honor of Starbuck, the coffee-loving first mate in 
 Herman Melville&apos;s Moby Dick . During the first 
 year of operation they bought all their beans from Peet&apos;s Coffee which 
 was the original inspiration for their store. The three founders of 
 Starbucks knew Alfred Peet personally. In the early years, Starbucks 
 focused on selling roasted coffee beans and equipment.
  Entrepreneur Howard Schultz joined the company in 1982. Schultz 
 soon went on a trip to Milan, Italy where he saw espresso bars 
 everywhere (1,500 in Milan alone). Schultz&apos;s days in Milan produced a 
 revelation: The Starbucks stores in Seattle completely missed the point. 
 Starbucks, he decided, needed to serve fresh-brewed coffee, 
 espresso, and cappuccino in its stores (in addition to beans and coffee 
 equipment).
  The owners rejected this idea and eventually 
 sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz in 1987 who grew the company to what 
 it is today. Ironically, rival Peet&apos;s Coffee is now owned, in part, by 
 Starbucks founder Jerry Baldwin. In 2003 Starbucks bought their other 
 rival, Seattle&apos;s Best Coffee.
  Starbucks has more than 15,000 stores in 44 countries, more than 
 150,000 employees and offers 87,000 different beverage combinations.
   
 

 Speaking Of Starbucks : Starbucks took a cue from fast-food chains and announced a plan yesterday to sell 
 pairings of coffee and breakfast for $3.95 , citing the economic 
 downturn. With the $3.95 breakfast offer, customers will be able to get 
 a 12-ounce coffee with a breakfast sandwich or roll or a 12-ounce latte 
 with either oatmeal or a coffee cake.

 Dine&amp;Dance : 
 The building at 630 State Street, formerly known as Zelo 
 Restaurant , is undergoing major renovation at the moment. I have 
 been told that the plan is to open a new restaurant at that location 
 later this year, serving California cuisine. The rear of the building 
 will include access to the neighboring Tonic night club.

 Left Is Alright : More than a few 
 people emailed me their concerns about the new for lease signs 
 that have appear on the exterior walls of Left At 
 Albuquerque , 700 State Street. A gentleman working the bar at 
 Lefty&apos;s told 
 me that every thing is ok and that Left at Albuquerque is NOT planning 
 to close. He said that some paperwork was filed late and by law the 
 building owner had to put up the signs that will be taken down soon.
 

 Party At Carl&apos;s : There is a ribbon 
 cutting ceremony today 2/10/09 at 10:30 a.m. for the newly opened Carl&apos;s Jr. at 4610 Carpinteria Ave in Carpinteria. CKE Restaurants CEO Andy 
 Puzder and local dignitaries will be there for the official grand 
 opening celebration.

 Off Topic : A new superstore opened 
 today 2/10/09 next to Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta. Pacific Sales (Kitchen, 
 Bath&amp;Electronics) replaces the old Rite Aid in University Plaza, a 
 stone&apos;s throw from Costco. Pacific Sales is a subsidiary of Best Buy 
 which is planning an opening of its own later this year just across the 
 parking lot, replacing CompUSA.

 New In The Guide : Today I added Hotcookie.com (new on the Mesa) to the restaurant guide.

 Holdren&apos;s Specials : This just in 
 from Holdren&apos;s Steaks&amp;Seafood at 512 State Street:
 
Hi John. I wanted to let you know that we are starting a new special 
 this week that people might want to know about: $20 Prime Rib 
 Wednesdays . We will be serving a 12 ounce Prime Rib for only $20, a 
 stimulus special of sorts... Just so you know, we also have all u can 
 eat baby back ribs on Monday for $20 and surf and turf, 8 ounce Prime 
 sirloin and BBQ prawns, on Tuesday for $20. Clay Holdren
 
 Hot Spots Update : Hot Spots 
 coffee shop , coming to 36 State Street, has moved the grand re-opening 
 celebration to March. Owner Eric Hamor gave me a tour last weekend and I 
 could see that he is making many improvements while retaining the cozy 
 feel locals love.

 Picture Of The Day : While on 
 State Street last Saturday I snapped a picture of these three youngsters anxiously 
 waiting for their owner to return from a store.

 Wine Cask For Sale : Last Wednesday Wine Cask and Intermezzo were officially listed 
 for sale for $517,500 on bizben.com. Wine Cask owner Bernie Rosenson 
 bought the restaurant from previous owner Doug Margerum in April 2007. 
 The advertisement says&quot;This is a very unique opportunity for a high 
 profile gourmet chef operator to acquire a venue that must be seen to 
 truly be appreciated for literally pennies on the seller&apos;s original 
 investment dollars.&quot;

 Blood Drive : Silvergreens restaurant on Chapala Street is having a Blood Drive this Saturday (2/7) 
 from 11am-3pm. Sign up sheets are available at the restaurant, and 
 donors can ask a cashier to sign up before hand.

 Decaf Dilemma : Starbucks no 
 longer automatically brews decaf coffee after 2pm. They will, however, 
 brew a pot of the unleaded stuff for you upon request.

 Prix Fixe Menu : Rodney&apos;s Steakhouse at 
 Doubletree sent me a message about their new offering:
 
Hi John the Restaurant Guy,

We would like to share the debut of a special $39 Prix Fixe menu at 
 Rodney&apos;s
Steakhouse in Fess Parker&apos;s Doubletree Resort. Starters include Caesar

 Pastavino Coming To Goleta : 
 Clay Holdren, owner of Holdren&apos;s 
 Steaks&amp;Seafood downtown, gave me an update on the Italian 
 restaurant he is bringing to Goleta. Holdren tells me: Pastavino is going to be the name of the Italian restaurant in the Camino Real 
 Marketplace. We are in the permit process right now and expect to begin 
 construction around the first of April. It should take three to four 
 months to finish which would put us opening in mid to late summer. It 
 will be very affordable, $10 to $15 a person on average.
   
  Holdren also gave me an update to his new Holdrens Steaks&amp;Seafood restaurant that is opening right next to Pastavino this 
 September. He tells me that the new Goleta Holdrens will have an exact 
 replica of the 1918-era bar at downtown Holdrens (512 State Street). 
 This is the same bar that was used for decades by Joe&apos;s Cafe until they moved to their current location at the corner of State&amp;Cota. 
 An exact replica of this bar was created a few years ago for Holdrens 
 Steaks&amp;Seafood in Newbury Park.

 Saffron Evicted : Saffron restaurant at 113 W. De La Guerra Street has a Sheriff&apos;s Department notice on the window indicating that they have been evicted.

 Bougainvillea Closes : 
 Reader Susan tells me that Bougainvillea restaurant (formerly Paoli&apos;s ) at 202 State Street 
 closed their doors for the final time Sunday night.

 The Bright Side : 
 Though local restaurant closures are a hot topic these days, not many 
 people realize that the Santa Barbara region had nine openings in 
 January (see Restaurant Wrap Up at the end of today&apos;s blog).

 Carl&apos;s Jr. Opens : 
 Carl&apos;s Jr. Restaurant at 4610 Carpinteria Ave in Carpinteria had their

 Hot Spots Reopening 
 Downtown : Hot Spots at 36 State Street, one of the 
 busiest 24/7 coffee shops in all of Santa Barbara when they closed in 
 January 2005 to make room for the La Entrada redevelopment project , 
 is planning to reopen at their original location next month.
   
Owner Eric Hamor, a third generation local, tells me that they are 
 currently upgrading the facility and will again offer coffee, blended 
 mochas, pastries, fresh juices, sandwiches, smoothies, ice cream, Wi-Fi 
 and an Internet kiosk. Caribbean Coffee will provide beans freshly 
 roasted in Santa Barbara. Like before, Hot Spots will offer visitor 
 services to help the public find hotel rooms and information about Santa 
 Barbara.
   
I am a big advocate of the La Entrada project and am going to do my 
 best to help move it along, says Hamor. In the mean time we are going 
 to make sure the area is clean, safe and vibrant. Hamor tells me that 
 La Entrada is on a fast track to build phase 1 and that he hopes to move 
 from 36 State Street into phase 1 when it is complete. He added I 
 really appreciate that Mountain Funding is righting a wrong that was 
 done in the early days. Were excited to be back.
   
At the time of their closing four years ago Hot Spots had nearly 1,500 
 customers per day including students from Santa Barbara City College, 
 Westmont and UCSB that would study until 2 a.m. There are only four 
 24-hour eateries in Santa Barbara and none on the waterfront. The 
 addition of a fifth, just a half block from Stearns Wharf, is great news 
 to people who work all night long including ambulance drivers, police, 
 fisherman and fireman.

 HotCookie.com :

 country and 40 stores in the U.S. spanning from New York to Hawaii. For

 Sustainable Seafood : 
 The Ty Warner Sea Center (run by the SB Museum of Natural History) has 
 launched a Sustainable Seafood program .
  Their mission statement reads as follows:&quot;We want to shift our 
 communitys seafood consumption to sustainable sources, consumer by 
 consumer and restaurant by restaurant. By helping restaurants and 
 markets replace unsustainable seafood items with sustainable ones, we 
 hope to shift thousands of dollars spent supporting unsustainable 
 fisheries to supporting the new sustainable seafood movement. We also 
 work to spread awareness by educating and inspiring our community to 
 raise their standards for their seafood choices.&quot;
  Restaurant and seafood market partners include Aldos, Blue Agave, 
 Bouchon, Elements Restaurant and Bar, Downeys, Kanaloa Seafoods, 
 Seagrass Restaurant and State&amp;A Bar&amp;Grill.

FYI, I operate a live web cam at the sea center that you can remotely zoom in&amp;out 
 and move in any direction. If you all try to move the camera around at 
 once you&apos;ll just get into a tug-of-war, so chill out!

 Historic Hotels : 
 The Upham Hotel , home to Louie&apos;s Restaurant , has announced that it has been named to Historic Hotels of America, 
 a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Upham 
 Hotel opened its doors in 1871 as the Lincoln House. It became the Upham 
 Hotel in 1898 when the property was purchased by Cyrus Upham. The Upham 
 is Southern Californias oldest continuously operating hotel and 
 recently celebrated its 137th anniversary.

 Pep Boys : The 
 building formerly known as Pep Boys on lower State Street will be 
 divided up into multiple restaurants including a third location for Saigon In&amp;Out .

 Off Topic : 
 Times are tough for everyone right now so last weekend I went hunting 
 for discounts on services that I receive at home. I discovered that many 
 discounts are available if you ask.
   
  For example, I had been paying $2.99/week for Monday-Friday home 
 delivery of the Los Angeles Times. I call them last Saturday inquiring 
 about discounts and they offered me a 12 month special for seven day 
 service for only $1/week. That&apos;s a $103 savings and I now get two MORE 
 papers each week.
   
  I had been paying $49/mo for my&quot;Preferred&quot;Internet service plan 
 from Cox Cable (I don&apos;t have TV service). I called Cox last Saturday and 
 they offered me a special that lowered my rate to $31/mo for six months 
 (a $108 savings). Discount availability depends on what plan you have 
 and where you live.

 Caj Opens In Isla Vista : 
 As a new President was inaugurated today at our nation&apos;s capital, a new 
 coffee house was inaugurated at our student capital (Isla Vista). Caje , located 
 at 948 Embarcadero del Norte, is an expanded version of its successful sister location in Carpinteria.
   
Owner Ryan Patronyk tells me that the name Caj is an acronym for 
 Coffee, Art, Juice&amp;Entertainment. The staff at Caj all have 
 extensive training to pour finely detailed Rosettas which is a 
 popular form of artwork created in the top of your favorite latte. Caj 
 offers Jacks bagels, DAngelo baked goods and makes a lot of their own 
 chocolate&amp;syrups (using organic products) for the espresso-based 
 drinks.
   
Its really important to make our drinks be as healthy as possible, 
 says Patronyk. I want to have the high level of quality of an authentic 
 Italian coffee shop and offer flavors that you cant find anywhere 
 else, he added.
The highest sold coffee drink is the Caj Latte which has two shots in 
 a 12 oz cup. The most popular flavored offering is the Agave Latte 
 which is made from the cactus that tequila comes from. They also make a 
 Honey Latte using local bee pollen. Caj has two coffee production 
 lines to make multiple lattes simultaneously and speed up service.
   
Hours are 6am-2am every day and they have music outside on weekends. For 
 more information call 845-4612.
   
 
 Front (L-R): Maranda Gillum, Hannah Frawley, Katie Kobara 
 and Annie Kohn.

 Dos Carlitos : Dos Carlitos Restaurant&amp;Tequila Bar , an offshoot of Carlitos Cafe&amp;Cantina and Cava 
 Restaurant&amp;Bar , opens at 3544 Sagunto Street in Santa Ynez 
 this Wednesday. Owner Carlos Lopez-Hollis sent me an email with details:
 
John,

Happy New Year to you! I hope this e-mail finds you well. After months 
 of preparation I am delighted to announce the opening of my new 
 restaurant, Dos Carlitos Restaurant&amp;Tequila Bar, this upcoming 
 Wednesday, January 21st. Dos Carlitos was conceived from a long-standing 
 desire to bring the Santa Ynez Valley a hybridized version of my 
 familys two restaurants: Carlitos&amp;Cava. Incidentally, I signed the 
 lease for this new venture the day that my parents celebrated the 30th 
 Anniversary of Carlitos on State St., so its been a great excitement to 
 build on the tradition they started many years ago.

Dos Carlitos offers inspired, regional Mexican&amp;Latin cuisine 
 handcrafted from the freshest ingredients. Borrowing from the bold 
 flavors and lively ambiance of its sibling restaurants, Carlitos Caf y 
 Cantina in Santa Barbara (Est. 1979) and Cava Restaurant&amp;Bar in 
 Montecito (Est. 1997), Dos Carlitos combines the elements of delicious 
 cuisine in an inviting atmosphere with dedication to customer service.

The Dos Carlitos experience combines many elements: La Parrilla, our 
 open fire grill, imparts a smoky essence to our authentic grilled 
 especiales and delicious salsas; our comal fills the air with the aroma 
 of fresh handmade tortillas; the tequila bar offers an array of premium 
 100% Blue Agave tequilas for our generous margaritas.

Dos Carlitos is a place for friends and family to enjoy a relaxed 
 outdoor patio or casual indoor setting with sunflower colored walls and 
 a cozy fireplace. Our unique family-style bancos and comfortable 
 equipale chairs compliment the warm interior that includes original 
 artwork by renowned local artist Channing Peake, traditional Gorky 
 Gonzalez pottery and our custom-made tequila cabinets.

The private dining room and terrace, El Comedor, is available for 
 special events.

Thanks for reading and keep up the good work Restaurant Guy!

 Teavana Coming To Paseo 
 Nuevo : A fast 
 growing specialty tea retailer Teavana , with more 
 than 80 locations nationwide, will be opening soon in Paseo Nuevo. Their 
 website teavana.com offers the following description:
 
&quot;The Teavana dream began with an idea that people 
 would enjoy fresh, high-quality tea in a place that was part Tea Bar, 
 part Tea Emporium. We wanted to introduce people to the aromas, 
 textures, and beneficial qualities of loose leaf teas while enlightening 
 them with the history and variety of teas available. And this is how 
 Teavana was born.

  As our name implies, Teavana&apos;s goal is to be a heaven of tea and to 
 offer our customers the healthy lifestyle and wonderful tastes of tea. 
 This unique name is meant to describe the experience each customer has 
 with our tea and our staff.

  After considerable research, only those teas with rich flavors and 
 superior health benefits are selected for Teavana. We opened our first 
 teahouse in Atlanta, Georgia. Since then we have opened over 80 Teavana 
 locations throughout the US and Mexico. &quot;

 New In The Guide : 
 Today I added the new Cantwell&apos;s Cafe&amp;Deli on Figueroa Street (formerly Savoy Cafe&amp;Deli ) to the restaurant guide.

 Surf&amp;Turf : 
 Reader Margaret tells me that the Harbor Restaurant on Stearns Wharf is having a&quot;Surf&amp;Turf&quot;special that runs until 
 February 12th. After 5pm Monday -Thursday&amp;Sunday get an 8 oz. 
 Australian lobster tail, 8 oz steak, plus potato gratin and vegetable 
 for $25.

 Tea Tips : January is National Hot Tea Month and The Coffee Bean&amp;Tea Leafs 
 master tea blender, Dave De Candia has created a list of tips to brew 
 the perfect cup of tea:

 Water temperature : Never use boiling water 
 to make tea. Boiling water burns the tea leaves and diminishes the 
 flavor. The ideal temperature is between 185 and 190 degrees. If youve 
 let the kettle start to boil let the water sit for 30 seconds so the 
 water cools slightly. Amount of tea : Use one tea bag per 1-2 cups 
 of water or for loose tea use one teaspoon of tea leaves for every cup. 
 Never reuse a tea bag the flavor will have been used in the first cup. Steeping : Exactly how long you should steep 
 your tea depends on the type of tea; however, most teas begin tasting 
 bitter after seven minutes of steeping. Steep green tea for about three 
 minutes, oolong and black teas for about five minutes and herbal teas 
 for about seven minutes. Remove the tea bag immediately after use to 
 avoid burning the leaves this will make the tea taste bitter. Remember 
 that tea bags take less time to brew than loose tea leaves. Strength : Some people like strong tea. De Candia&apos;s 
 motto for strong tea is, Add more tea, not time. Steeping the tea for 
 more time will only reduce the flavor, not increase the strength. Additions : When adding both lemon and sugar, 
 add the sugar first. If the lemon is added first the citric acid will 
 prevent the sugar from dissolving. Cream should not be added to tea as 
 it interferes with the taste but personal preferences vary. 

 The Oprah Diet : 
 My mom (who lives in Montecito) has had good success with a new regimen 
 she calls the&quot; Oprah Diet .&quot;Every morning she walks one mile 
 uphill to 
 Oprah&apos;s house&amp;back.

 Alert: Pinkberry Opens 
 Today! This is the day local frozen yogurt fans have been 
 waiting for. This morning Pinkberry , located at 742 State Street 
 (formerly Jamba Juice), opened their doors to an eager public. Their 
 first store was opened by founders Shelly Hwang and Young Lee in West 
 Hollywood in January, 2005. Today, they operate more than 70 stores 
 throughout Southern California and New York. You can now add Santa 
 Barbara to the list.
   
  Pinkberry always features two principal fat-free flavors, Original 
 and Green Tea, as well as one seasonal flavor like Pomegranate. Toppings

 Melting Pot Opens Tomorrow : 
 On Wednesday, January 14 th Santa Barbara is being introduced 
 to the fondue concept courtesy of The Melting Pot restaurant at 
 608 Anacapa Street. The first Melting Pot opened in April of 1975 in 
 Maitland, FL - just outside of Orlando.
   
  Jeb Wilson, Operating Partner, Kenzie Lobacz (Partner) and Robin 
 Rainie-Lobacz (Partner) were inspired by an experience at The Melting 
 Pot four years ago and felt Santa Barbara would be a great place to 
 embrace the concept. Santa Barbara&apos;s newest dinner house will be 
 focusing on wine, service, and celebratory events.
   
  Wilson gave me a full tour of his new restaurant last week. The 
 restaurant has a unique layout the offers each table an intimate 
 setting. At the center of each table is a built-in heating pad for 
 fondue style cooking, which means&quot;to melt,&quot;in French. The restaurant 
 also has a room setup for large groups and special events.
   
  Starting with a selection of cheeses, guests begin by dipping 
 vegetables and bread in a communal pot of melted cheese with long fondue 
 forks. A traditional salad course follows with numerous options. Next, 
 the entree items, from which there are many combinations to choose, 
 arrive unprepared on platters with accompanying dipping sauces. Again a 
 communal pot of seasoned broth or oil is centered on the table, with 
 guests skewering the items on the platter, placing them into the pot, 
 and cooking them according to suggested durations. All fondue forks have 
 variously colored handles to avoid confusion.
   
  After the entree the guest can choose from a selection of chocolate 
 fondues that arrive with a dipping plate of strawberries, brownies, 
 bananas, and many other treats.
   
  Hours are Mon-Thu 5pm-10pm, Fri 5pm-11pm, Sat 4pm-11pm, Sun 4pm-10pm. 
 For more information call 845-4444 or visit meltingpot.com .

 Zizzo&apos;s Coffee Opens : 
 Last Saturday saw the grand opening of Zizzo&apos;s Coffee , 
 located at 370 Storke Road (formerly Storke Road Drive Inn ). 
 I added Zizzo&apos;s to the guide today and they are also Coffee House of the Month .
   
  Owners Michael and Sue McDonald tell me that Zizzo&apos;s in Goleta is a 
 family-oriented, locally owned store that brings to the Santa Barbara 
 area top quality specialty espresso drinks and food. Though specializing 
 in mochas, Zizzos also offers smoothies, pastries, baked goods, to go 
 sandwiches, breakfast burritos and breakfast bagels.
   
  Zizzos also includes something extremely rare on the South Coast: a 
 drive-up window. Moms can come by and get their favorite specialty 
 coffee and dont have to worry about hauling their kids out and running 
 them in, said Michael McDonald. At some point in the near future we 
 will have kids lunches. Moms can get their coffee, they can get their 
 breakfast and they can get their kids lunches all in a one-stop shop, 
 he added.
   
  Hours are Mon-Fri 5:30am-8:30pm, Sat 6am-9pm, Sun 6am-7pm. For 
 information call 571-8888 or visit zizzoscoffee.com .

 The&quot;Best Of&quot;2009 : 
 Without further delay, here are the results of your online votes for The&quot;Best Of&quot;2009 

 I Believe I Can Fly : 
 Having spent the last six (full) days tabulating thousands of votes, I&apos;m

 recharge my depleted batteries would be wing suit jumping in Norway .

 Still Working : 
 Happy New Year! I am busy tabulating results from the 2009 Santa Barbara 
 Survey of best restaurants in town. The results will be announced in 
 tomorrow&apos;s blog. Until then, I have a few questions for you:

 Can you cry under water? How important does a person have to be before they 
 are considered assassinated instead of just murdered? Why do you have to&quot;put your two cents in&quot;... but 
 it&apos;s only a&quot;penny for your thoughts&quot;? Where&apos;s that extra penny going 
 to? Once you&apos;re in heaven, do you get stuck wearing the 
 clothes you were buried in for eternity? Why does a round pizza come in a square box ? What disease did cured ham actually have? How is it that we put man on the moon before we 
 figured out it would be a good idea to put wheels on luggage? Why is it that people say they&quot;slept like a baby&quot;when babies wake up like every two hours? Why are you IN a movie, but you&apos;re ON TV? Why do people pay to go up tall buildings and then 
 put money in binoculars to look at things on the ground? Why do doctors leave the room while you change? 
 They&apos;re going to see you naked anyway. Why is&quot;bra&quot;singular and&quot;panties&quot;plural? Why do toasters always have a setting that burns 
 the toast to a horrible crisp, which no decent human being would eat ? If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there 
 a stupid song about him? If the professor on Gilligan&apos;s Island can make a 
 radio out of a coconut, why can&apos;t he fix a hole in a boat? Why does Goofy stand erect while Pluto remains on 
 all fours? They&apos;re both dogs! If Wile E. Coyote had enough money to buy all that 
 ACME crap, why didn&apos;t he just buy dinner? If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is 
 made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from? If electricity comes from electrons, does morality 
 come from morons? Do the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little 
 Star have the same tune? Why did you just try singing the two songs above? Why do they call it an asteroid when it&apos;s outside 
 the hemisphere, but call it a hemorrhoid when it&apos;s in your butt? Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog&apos;s 
 face, he gets mad at you, but when you take him for a car ride, he 
 sticks his head out the window? Why did Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?
