639. Who Slew Auntie Roo? (1971)
A great horror movie to watch at Christmas time. It has a creepy old mansion, great child actors. The plot centers around the disappearance of a child years before and some orphans who just happen to end up at the same mansion years later. Shelley Winters is great in this movie. It&apos;s really got a classic old british feel to this movie. Definitely a horror holiday classic, creepy, scary and fun to watch. Cast: Shelley Winters, Mark Lester, Chloe Franks and Ralph Richardson.
640.The Mad Room (1969)
In this horror tale, Ellen Hardy (Stella Stevens) shares a home with widow Gladys Armstrong (Shelley Winters). Ellen is engaged to marry Gladys&apos; stepson, Sam Aller (Skip Ward). Ellen receives word that her brother and sister are soon to be released from a mental institution and need a place to stay; Ellen asks Gladys if they can live with them, and Gladys agrees. But Ellen hasn&apos;t told Gladys the whole truth. It seems that the siblings were institutionalized because their parents were murdered, and it was widely believed that they were responsible (though their guilt in the crime could not be proven). Not long after the now-teenage brother and sister move in with Ellen and Gladys, Gladys finds out about their secret and she is soon discovered brutally murdered. The kids, however, both claim that they had nothing to do with Gladys&apos; death, and that the other must have done it. In the meantime, Ellen has to dispose of the body without raising suspicion, but after Ellen buries the corpse in the garden, the dog digs up a severed hand, and now Ellen must make sure the dog doesn&apos;t give away her family&apos;s ugly secret.
Cast: Shelley Winters, Stella Stevens, Skip Ward, Carol Cole, Severn Darden&amp;Beverly Garland.

Hopefully you are still here and have this tape. I have other interview shows with Ali Landry to trade for the Regis and Kelly (@1059) you have listed. Let me know.

Thanks
