 Report Copyright Violation California EBT Cards welcomed at casinos and many fast food restaurants in the state EBT (Food Stamp) Life: Is a series devoted to the many creative ways people have been using EBT (Food Stamp) Cards to subsidize their lifestyles. Please note that many of these methods are of dubious legality and are not recommended.

While many of you have been downing beers, smoking cigarettes, and doing drugs on the government dime for years, how many of you knew your EBT cards could be used to pay for your gambling expenses and to chow down on fast food too? Just when you thought it could not get any better, your California EBT Cards are now welcomed at almost half the casinos and many of the fast food restaurants in the state.

Gambling on the Suckas Dime

From the LA Times: California welfare cards can be used in many casino ATMs
[ link to www.latimes.com ]

Reporting from Sacramento California welfare recipients are able to use state-issued debit cards to withdraw cash on gaming floors in more than half of the casinos in the state, a Los Angeles Times review of records found.

The cards, provided by the Department of Social Services to help recipients feed and clothe their families, work in automated teller machines at 32 of 58 tribal casinos and 47 of 90 state-licensed poker rooms, the review found.&quot;

As with most government programs, the tax payer can shove it up their pipe if they expect to learn how their money is being squandered:

&quot;It&apos;s not clear which casinos are most frequently patronized by welfare recipients because social services officials denied a January request from The Times for data showing transaction information from all of the ATMs in their network. Department lawyers argued that federal law prohibits the state from releasing financial information about merchants who accept cards issued to welfare recipients.&quot;

Feasting on the Suckas Dime

In the juggernaut to expand welfare benefits into every facet of our live, Los Angeles County has implemented the Restaurant Meals Program: [ link to www.ladpss.org ]

&quot;Introducing the new Food Stamp Restaurant Meals Program that allows homeless, disabled, and elderly (age 60 and over) Food Stamp households to use their Golden State Advantage (EBT) cards to purchase meals from participating restaurants.

On July 25, 2005, the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) implemented the new Restaurant Meals Program throughout Los Angeles County. This program offers great benefits to eligible households since the homeless do not have a place to store and cook food, while the elderly and disabled may have difficulty preparing meals for themselves.&quot;


Lest your bleeding hearts start bleeting about how could anyone disagree with letting an ederly or disabled person use their food stamps to buy prepared food, please be advised that anyone with an EBT card can use it in a participating restaurant. The program relies on an honor system (see #3, from the FAQ Section):
 image of #3 here [ link to 2.bp.blogspot.com ]

 Best of all, unlike John Q Public your meal will be tax and gratuity free. Those things are for the suckas paying for your meal.
 


Finish this high pressure bullshit here

 Report Copyright Violation Re: California EBT Cards welcomed at casinos and many fast food restaurants in the state I saw a couple of things I wanted to comment on in your post.

First of all the EBT ( Electronic Benefit cards) not only have food stamps put on them ( if the user is approved for them ), They also have a cash section, for those on cash assistance and some childsupport payments as well 

The cash and child support part of the card can be used in any ATM machine for the most part, casino or otherwise.

Now the ones on cash aid, perhaps shouldn&apos;t be taking money out at a casino, but the ones that use it to recieve their child support payments, well IMHO that&apos;s their money to use as they need or want.

As far as the restaurant thing goes, They should have stuck to the old rules of not being able to buy prepared food or at least made some state issued ID that says they are eligable to use that service. BRIEF AND TO THE POINT

So, how does the child benefit from Mommy playing Black Jack?
 Poor people do poor people things, and rich people do rich people things.

You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.

What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.

The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.

When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is the beginning of the end of any nation.

you are wrong - that money is for the child not the mother and fathers have a set precedent to where they can LEGALLY demand that the money go to an agency where said agency will pay the childs bills, give money for cloths and needs and the mother must provide receipts.

 Report Copyright Violation Re: California EBT Cards welcomed at casinos and many fast food restaurants in the state This is Bullshit. I&apos;m so glad I left that failure of a state. I lived in a city that hadn&apos;t had one new mile of freeway built in 40 years. Unemployment rate in my county was officially over 16%.

How about this. Cut off welfare completely unless there is verifiable proof that the person was injures.

My father was in a car accident when I was three and is mentally and physically disabled. He cannot walk. He cannot remember things you told him 5 minutes ago. He has uncontrollable anger at times.

He was in a car accident and all he got from the state of California is 450/mo. Actually thats what he gets now. Originally it was 180/mo.

Meanwhile I saw people driving around in 50,000 dollar SUVs buying up 600 dollars worth of groceries on the EBT card.

That state is going down. All the productive people are leaving. I moved to Minnesota and guess what. I saw white people working on the farms. That threw out all of the arguments CNN told me. Anonymous Coward

 Report Copyright Violation Re: California EBT Cards welcomed at casinos and many fast food restaurants in the state I get my spousal and child support payments on my Epicc card from Pennsylvania.

I get 15 dollars and so does my son every two weeks, for a total of 30 bucks on my card.

I used it once at the casino, I refused to take my mac and I was waiting for the rest of my friends to finish up.

I knew it didn&apos;t look good but to hell with it I give my son more than that in allowance every two weeks.

15 bucks in child support every two weeks is what you get when you don&apos;t have a lawyer and your ex is a dead beat. _Storm_

 Report Copyright Violation Re: California EBT Cards welcomed at casinos and many fast food restaurants in the state I don&apos;t care what anyone does with their child support. That money goes from one parent to the other.

Let&apos;s say for example one parent is paying 100 dollars a week. Maybe the parent receiving it has paid all the bills already, and that money is just convenient to use at the time. The alternative is to use that exact money for the bills, and then their other money to play a little at the casino, but it ends up the same. Anonymous Coward

  Quoting: ArunaLuna 


Problem is, there really are people that need the extra help and only use the programs to get back on their feet - as the programs were initially created for. You can&apos;t expect hard working people who have paid into the system for years who suddenly find themselves in need of those services they have been paying for to just go hungry for a while so you can supposedly cut out the dead beats.

Unless any of you have or do work for an agency that approves food stamps and cash assistance, you have no right to comment because you aren&apos;t the ones who hear the situations. MANY applications are denied each and every day and all recipients are required to reapply after a certain amount of time. Some counties even require a police officer to come by the home and check to make sure everything listed on the application is correct, i.e. the amount of people actually in the home, the state of the home and any and all assets.
