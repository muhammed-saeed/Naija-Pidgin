No tip leads to trip in police cruiser for pair of local college students

 AP File Photo Buffalo wings Pope and Wagner, members of a party of eight during happy hour, refused to pay a $16.35 service charge on top of their $73.87 tab because of what they say was shoddy service as well as a surcharge that was nearly 5 percent higher than the 18 percent listed on the menu.
 “Gratuity is thanking you for your service,” Pope, 22, said. “You can’t give us terrible, terrible service and expect a tip.” 
 The group reportedly had to wait more than an hour for salad and wings and had to approach the bar themselves for drink refills and find their own napkins and silverware as their waitress smoked outside.

The general manager of the Lehigh Pub, at 4 S. New St., declined to comment.

Pope and Wagner, 24, have pleaded not guilty and await a summary trial before District Judge Nancy Matos Gonzalez .
 “It is minorly ridiculous,” Pope, a native of Pottsville, Pa., said.
 What do you think? Were Pope and Wagner correct in refusing to pay the required gratuity? Feel free to leave a comment below and take the time to participate in the online poll question.
 
 Should patrons be obligated to leave a gratuity mandated by an establishment if the service is poor? ( answers ) Related topics: crime , john wagner , lehigh pub , leslie pope

I like the way you frame your comments, saxon2, and I agree with you. I hope the &quot;perps&quot; weren&apos;t arrested for disorderly conduct, because with peaceful behavior on their part they might be bringing back the useful concept of civil disobedience (which should be civil in all meanings of the word).

I agree with their decision to under-tip (or lack of tip).
The &quot;mandatory&quot; gratuity is assuming reasonable service is rendered.
If the waitstaff had not done a single thing correct, would they still expect 18%?!?
On a side rant; I am also unhappy with resturants who charge the 18% gratuity on top of the sales tax. Why am I tipping on the portion of my bill that does not go to pay for the service/food I have just purchased? They didn&apos;t provide service for the sales tax, why should I tip as if they did?

I agree if the service was lousy that there is no justification in the 18% fee. Unfortunately, Restaurant owners are often greedy and pay a small wage that make waiters and waitresses expect the tips. But people go to restaurants for good food and service. It is the responsibility of the manager or owner to insure that the customers are being treated fairly.

Usually, a mandatory gratuity is found in your more high end resturants where service and food are exceptional, everytime! Even then, the idea of a manditory tip is ridiculous. A tip is a jesture of a job well done to show appreciation, and not a right to someone who does their job poorly! They should of never been arrested!

although it&apos;s hard to say much about the couple since i never witnessed it, (for all we know they COULD be some snotty never pleased whiners), but if it all panned out as stated???? i would stick to my guns, and if at all possible, take it to court and sue the lehigh pub for my troubles, (and arrest!) this is the lehigh pub for God&apos;s sake, not the four seasons! if the wait staff does its job and does it well and with a warm attitude, i&apos;m sure they will be rewarded. make ME go to the bar to get my own orders because you are out SMOKING??????? i don&apos;t think so. MY tip would be a napkin with the words &quot;pitiful service&quot; scrawled on it.

I agree with the customer has right to choose the amount for a tip. Unless you are in a group of 10 or more than the resturant usually has the right to charge a certain amount. Tip amount should be determined by the service. As a former waitress, I was taught to treat customers like you would want to be treated when you were at a resturant. And for those kids to be arrest, what a bunch of crap. If wish I worked there for 18% gratutity, that&apos;s way more than I ever got. These are college students at a Pub. It&apos;s like you are at Emeril&apos;s at the casino.

This is the quickest way I have seen to kill businesses.The tip= service.

A tip is voluntary, If you give lousy service you got no tip or a small one. The giving or not is at the discretion of the patron.

That is BS. Gratuity is NOT something yo uare entitled to, gratuity is given when server is satisfactory or better. It&apos;s a way of saying &quot;Thank You&quot;. The better waiter/waitress you are, the better the tip you&apos;ll receive. But is the service is as bad as they say it was, I would not tip either.

I say we do our best to BOYCOTT the Lehigh Pub until the cahrges are dropped.

Everybody wants something for nothing. Anymore you can&apos;t go anywhere without a tip jar staring you in the face. For what? For pouring my coffee at D&amp;D;as an example?

Only a fool would tip at a fast food Restaurant and I am NOT the least bit insulted for NOt tipping at a fast food restaurant for what IS someone&apos;s required job function!

A couple of very disturbing things here. First of all, not paying a tip is not the same as not paying for your meal. Unless these two signed an agreement prior to eating, having a small notation at the bottom of a menu indicating an 18% gratuity added for parties of 8 or more is not contractually binding. Even if it was, this would be a civil matter and NOT A THEFT. Even if the police attempted to make a legal argument for theft, they should have taken the individuals information and proceeded by summons, and not handcuffed them and taken them away. If the patrons explained their concerns to the manager, which seem reasonable, the manager had an obligation to rectify it with his employee, and not contact the police. The police had an obligation to recognize this for what it was. Nonsense! A civil matter at best. These two will have the charges dropped at the preliminary hearing, and successfully sue both the pub and police.

Any first year law student can beat this in court.

Lehigh Pub. Won&apos;t being going there in the future. They have lousy service and arrest their patrons who complain.

rbuskirk your wrong about high end restaurants !I am a server. I work and a 5 star restaurant and part time at a chain restaurant. The RESTAURANTS I work at BOTH require a automatic 18% on a table of 6 or more people.( which is stated on the meue at the bottom of EVERY page) The 18% is added to the bill BEFORE the tax. Computer systems in the restaurant are set up to add tax before the gratuity! I have also had to add a tip by hand writing it on the guest check BUT it was always BEFORE the tax. What some of you might not know is that a server/waitress/waiter is required to pay tax on YOUR tip even if you decide NOT to leave a tip. I&apos;m not sure of the % it&apos;s based on but I know servers pay !This is the law in N.J. and Pa. As a server I can tell you there a probably 2 sides to this story.

icanseeyou...Wow! So you&apos;re saying if you sell $5,000 of food and nobody tips, you&apos;re required to pay on a percentage of money that was never given? Sounds like theft by the government. I&apos;d call your local and state authorities and complain.

Icanseeyou, if you are paying taxes on tips you&apos;re not getting you my friend are a fool. If it&apos;s your employer forcing you to do this I would contact the local Labor Board as this is illegal and tax fraud.
