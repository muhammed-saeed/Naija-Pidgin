 Question of the Day 
The counter argument on tipping

 What

is the tipping etiquette for half service restaurants? Order at a

counter, but they bring it out to you and clean up after you. -- Kansas City Twitter user Half Monk . 

In the no man&apos;s land between tip jars and check sleeves, the casual dining restaurant with table service is a dilemma for diners. It doesn&apos;t have to be if you look at the actual service being provided. 


 
I&apos;ve stood behind the counter and helped bring out dishes to diners in a quick-serve restaurant. Many didn&apos;t tip because I was not a traditional server. I was operating the cash register and was not responsible for getting them a refill. But I was still making sure their orders were correct and clearing their tables when they were done. 

If there&apos;s a tip jar, you can wait until after your meal to decide what you&apos;re going to tip. There still is a service element involved. Base your tip on the difficulty of your order and whether the food came quickly. iTipping recommends 5 to 10 percent. I&apos;d lean closer to 10 percent or above if your server goes out of his or her way. 

On the flip side, if you&apos;re doing all the work, no tipping is necessary. A perfect example is Oklahoma Joe&apos;s. You pick up the food at the counter, fill your own drink, clear off your tray and pack up your own leftovers. If anything, you deserve a tip. And so here is a tip. Reheat your leftover seasoned fries on a nonstick skillet. Turn them frequently with a spatula or tongs to keep them from getting burned on one side.

Some of you are just cheap. Do you actually think that a Sonic Carhop making minimum wage to run in and out of the heat, cold, rain, snow, etc is OVERPAID? Get real - if you dont want to tip - USE THE DRIVE THRU! Those underpaid workers dont want need to run their butts off for you anyway!

And to the other dummies out there - if the weather is bad - dont park at the farthest stall across the lot and order a coke. Pull in near the door that they come out of so they dont have to run through the rain. Worse yet - for those who park in the farthest stall after dark - I would refuse to serve you - it just isnt safe!

THINK PEOPLE THINK!

I only tip people that I believe would be making a server&apos;s wage (sorry carhops, baristas&amp;other counter clerks). If there is any doubt in my mind, they&apos;ll get about 15%.

The only other exception would be bartenders, they get the $1-per-drink flat rate from me.

The art of tipping has been ruined by the lazy society we live in that asks for handouts continuously. Getting extra money from me is not a right, it&apos;s a privilege. If you make my dining experience better then I will make your wallet better. I&apos;m not going to tip a Sonic employee that already makes minimum wage just because they walked an order 15 feet after someone else made it.

The tip happy people need to realize they are making the rest of us look cheap when in fact we just want to pay appropriate for how the service is.

I don&apos;t even bother heating up my old fries, I just eat them cold when I come home from the bars!

Haha but Brian, if you are tipping up to 50% you&apos;re really not saving anything by going to the cheaper places, are you?

I agree with Bob. My wife and I generally leave 20% unless the service is especially terrible. But if we are getting everything half price (like at happy hour), or if the prices are just low (like a diner), we will tip up to 50% if the service is above average. For example, the people at Winstead&apos;s and even Waffle House are usually friendlier and more attentive than the average fine-dining server. We appreciate that, so we tip as if we were paying fine-dining prices.

It does get confusing! But I try to tip in proportion to the amount of service provided. It seems fair. I do have one inflexible rule: I never tip less than a buck, even for an order no bigger than a cup of coffee. I don&apos;t think a low bill excuses not paying a server who may be just as competent as someone working at a high dollar place.

Why tip at a restaurant that uses car hops? The food is considerably higher than at a non carhop fast food restaurant. The restaurant charges mores and pays the counter help half the wage. WTF!!!! I speak into a mic and get half ass service. I have to leave my trash without a tray next to the mic. Why should I pour more money into the pockets of operators that pay their counter help sub par pay. That&apos;s why I&apos;ll never go to a Sonic. At least McDonald&apos;s isn&apos;t that cheap. If I have to leave my seat to go place an order, then pick it up and it&apos;s not on washable china. I&apos;m not going to tip, let the cheap bastards that own the place pony up and pay a decent wage.

I work for tips and when I am not working for tips I write about working for tips. At the risk of greatly upsetting my tip karma, I look at the standard differently.

There are two reasons to tip:
1) Service
2) The Government has deemed that employers can pay their certain positions half of the minimum wage with the expectation that these people receive the difference in tips. This savings to the employer is passed on to the guest through lower food prices. This subsidy on the price of the food is made up for by the guest&apos;s tip provided to the server.

I am not sure why an employee making over the minimum wage is entitled to the half as much as a traditional server for bringing the food to the table and clearing the plates after I leave. In a full service restaurant the server who makes 15-20% and half minimum wage pays the food runner or busser out of their tip. This is particularly true if the person who receives the tip is not the one who took the order and you have to get your own refills. Most places I see set up like this have one person running the food and another on the register. Therefore the difficulty of your order, it&apos;s accuracy, and it&apos;s speed are most likely not primarily controlled by the person bringing your food to the table.

That being said, I still tip at these places. It is not a sense of obligation, but a reward for good service. I feel it is always best to err on the side of courtesy to a fellow human. Still, I worry that obligatory tipping to everyone with a tip jar creates a resentment that harms the professionals that provide outstanding service, depend on tips for their income, and take a mandatory pay cut to subsidize the price of a guest&apos;s meal.

Absolutely tip the carhops. Skip the tip if you&apos;re headed through the drive-through.

Thanks for the article! There were so many times where I get the guilt-inducing look for not tipping at the food court in a mall. All you did was spoon lo mein onto a plate or placed a slice of pizza on my tray. I don&apos;t think I should tip for that, so put away your tip jar and turn away your glaring eyes.

So...what about at Sonic? To tip or no tip?
