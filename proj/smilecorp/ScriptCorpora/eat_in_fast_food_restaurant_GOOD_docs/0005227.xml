Continental Airlines–Cheap tickets and Nothing But Bad Customer Service to Show For It!

Have you ever tried to find a plane ticket last minute, but couldn’t find one in your price range?  Just last week I had to make an emergency trip to NY.  I only had 2 days to find a flight so I checked several different websites including Delta.com, Cheaptickets.com, and Orbitz.com.  Each website had almost the same prices except for a few.  I really did not want to have a flight that left at 6am, since that would mean I would have to get up at around 3:30am to make it to the airport on time.

I searched around a little bit more and wound up finding a flight that left at 4:40pm through Continental Airlines.  This was around the perfect time that I wanted to leave and it was in my price range as well.  The ticket was $118 and it didn’t leave until later in the day, which was perfect for me!  I booked the flight and headed to the airport when it was time.  I was thinking this would be a hassle free trip back to NY, but I was mistaken.

Once I got on the first flight, there was a stewardess just standing in the back of the airplane.  I looked at her and smiled, but got nothing in return.  I sat down in my seat and watched her to see if she would interact with the other people who were just getting on the plane.  I noticed that all of the overhead compartments were opened and people started to put their stuff in them.

I then noticed that one man was trying to find room for his carry-on bag, and he went to put his stuff in one of the over-head compartments and the stewardess rudely started pushing his stuff out and saying “This is for flight attendants only”.  The man was very confused as to why this was because the compartment was practically empty.  So he had to struggle to find another location for his bag that was not near his seat.

A few minutes before we were getting ready to take off 2 families got on with little kids that needed high chairs.  Their parents put them on the seats so they could sit in them.  Just as we were about to leave the gate another stewardess comes back and rudely said to the parents “Are those high chairs?, they are not allowed during take-off or landing, they need to be removed right this minute.”  This was terrible because there was no more room in the overhead compartments, so they had to store them in the empty seats left on the plane.

After that last fiasco I thought the trouble was over.  This was until they came around with the snack cart and I was reading.  The one stewardess didn’t even ask me if I wanted pretzels or anything she just threw them on the seat next to me.  Once they got to me with the drinks I had stated that I wanted a ginger ale and when the stewardess gave me my drink I realized it was water.  At this point I didn’t even say anything because it seemed to me that the stewardess’ did not want to be at work that day.

So, in lieu of this bad experience, I recommend Continental Airlines for their prices, but don’t expect to be treated the greatest!

I can’t say much about Continental Airlines because I’ve never flown them, but I can definitely understand how you feel because I’ve had some terrible experiences on other airlines like USAir where a airline stewardess spilled orange juice all over my lap at the beginning of a five-hour flight to Los Angeles California. I had to sit with a lap full of orange juice for five hours and boy did I smell ripe when we landed and got off the plane.

You would think they would’ve offered me a discount or to pay for my dry cleaning or something. Nope, nothing. Unbelievable.

If there’s one thing I can’t stand it is bad customer service.

Just flew from Ohio to Los Angeles. Experienced the rudest flight staff in over 40 years of flying. Downright nasty and abusive flight attendants. Will never fly with this airline again.
