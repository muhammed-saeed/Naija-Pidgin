It was the Mets&apos; first loss in their last five games and it came before 42,122, the largest crowd in Citi Field history. NEWS

 Vote Reversal Grants Approval To Kfc On Randall Square Lot 
 By Lisa Sloan | November 20, 1997 In a reversal of their Nov. 3 vote, Geneva City Council members have approved the site plan for a KFC restaurant to be built on Randall Road. Council members voted 7-2 to approve a KFC restaurant on the western side of Randall Road in a lot of the Randall Square Shopping Center after the matter was brought before the council by Ald. Renee Brenner, who previously had opposed the plan. At the city&apos;s request, over the past several months, KFC had altered its original site plan substantially, changing the type and color of brick to coordinate with other Randall Square tenant buildings, replacing its standard bright red plastic awnings with a more muted red canvas, shortening its trademark cupola, adding to the landscaping around the garbage area, increasing the length of the drive-through lane, and removing the Col. Sanders image from all signs. ENTERTAINMENT 
 Reviews from Just for Laughs Chicago: Kevin Smith, Hannibal Buress, Janeane Garofalo + Kyle Kinane, Scott Adsit + Kevin Dorff, Patton Oswalt and Stephen Merchant 
 Steve Johnson and Tribune reporter | June 15, 2012 Going into &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith,&quot; it was difficult to imagine Smith answering audience questions as a Chicago Theatre show and one of the centerpieces of this year&apos;s TBS Just for Laughs Chicago comedy festival. Watching the 41-year-old director hold forth for two hours Thursday night on, mostly, sex, film, weight and weed didn&apos;t do much to change that opinion. Like the joke he made about seeing no need for a 3D version of &quot;Clerks&quot; - his talky, minimally produced breakthrough first feature - the show was a bit lost in one of the city&apos;s big, ornate, showcase spaces.

 PETA plans tactics to embarrass KFC

 Rectangle Oreos and cucumber gum, made in China for China 
 John Ruwitch and Reuters | June 7, 2012 SUZHOU, China (Reuters) - There are no bad ideas inside Kraft Foods&apos; biscuit research lab in China, according to director Maggie Wang. Not even the chewing gum Oreo cookie that a colleague asked her to bite into one day. Instead of creamy white &quot;stuff&quot; in the centre, a glob of gum was sandwiched neatly between a pair of Oreo&apos;s iconic dark chocolate biscuits. &quot;The taste was ok. The problem was that you could not swallow it,&quot; said Wang, a Kraft food scientist with two decades of experience in the biscuit industry. NEWS
