 Garbage Pail Kid Generator. 
 Garbage Pail Kids is a series of trading cards produced by the Topps Company, originally released in 1985. Each sticker card featured a Garbage Pail Kid character, with some comical abnormality or suffering some terrible fate, and a humorous, word play-rich character name.

Now you can make your own Garbage Pail Kid. You have to register first but you can type in anything you want and you don&apos;t have to give your email address. I created this Garbage Pail Kid.
