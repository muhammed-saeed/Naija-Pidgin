 I WENT TO BOSTON MARKET ON BLACK ROCK TURNPIKE IN FAIRFIELD,CT AND I WAS SERVED MACARONI AND CHEESE WITH THE ANTIBIOTIC CEPHALEXIN IN THE FOOD. I HAD AN IMMEDIATE ALLERGIC REACTION-MY HEART STARTED BEATING REALLY, REALLY FAST AND I DEVELOPED A RASH FRoM MY HEAD TO MY TOES THAT WAS VERY ITCHY AND UNPLEASANT AS WELL AS PAINFUL. I NOTIFIED BOSTON MARKET AND THEY SHOWED NO CONCERN FOR EITHER MY HEALTH OR FOR THE FACT THAT OTHER CUSTOMERS MIGHt ALSO HAVe EATEN tHE MACArONI AND CHeeSE CONTAINING THIS DRUG. FORTUNATELY FOR ME I ALWAYS HAVE ALLERGY MEDICATION WITH ME AND WHEN I REALIZED WhAT WAS HAPPENING I LEFT THE BOSTON MARKET LOCATION IMMEDIATELY. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON MAY 23, 2012 and BOSTON MARKET STILL HAS NOT RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY!!!! I AM WRITING THIS ON JUNE 4, 2012. PLEASE PROTECT YOUr CHILDREN AND EAT AT RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE To PREVENT THESE TYPE OF EVENTS FROM HAPPENING!!! I WAS ABLE TO FIND AND KEEP WHAT I NOW KNOW WAS A CEPHALEXIN CAPSULE IN MY MACARONI AND CHEESE!! MACARONI AND CHEESE WAS THE ONLY FOOD ITEM I ORDERED THAT DAY!!!! PLEASE BEWARE OF BOSTON MARKET!!! PROTECT THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE AND DO NOT EAT THERE!!!!!

 Your South Cooper, Arlington Texas store dropped the ball by closing the drive-thru line with me patiently waiting. I drove up and the lady said, &quot;Sorry we closed at 9:30pm and our registers shut down and there&apos;s nothing we can do.&quot; I asked her the time and she said 9:33. I left and wanted you to know that the person in front of me got their food. I know I was trying to order before 9:30 but no one answered. While typing, the employee just walked to her car with a of food- I hope she paid for it before the registers shut off.
Ps. The open sign is still on at 9:50.

 I enjoy Boston Market&apos;s food and usually serve it for dinner at least once a week. However, in my neighborhood, for the past several months each time I have purchased the chicken the wings have been hard, dried out, and they are inedible. Each time I spoke to management about this and each time I reported the inedible product to the contact line listed on the receipt. Last week Boston Market promised to send me coupons to my email address to reimburse me for some of the inedible purchases. Of course they have not/did not. I believe the mentality is they already got your money so they don&apos;t care. I will try once more to be reimbursed for some of the purchases and if I am unsuccessful I will then contact the better business bureau. Secondly, I believe the sides are not only too expensive but the size of them prove they also aren&apos;t worth the money. This is just not acceptable business practices. 



 H Levensohn 5/3/12 
 I went to the Boston Market on High Ridge Road in CT and bought a chicken pot pie for my son. The store was very badly managed. They ran out of side dishes and it took too long to refill them which caused a backup and a long very slow line. In addition, there was only one cashier.
Actually the worst part was when my son was eating the pot pie and came across a large BONE!!! Thank God he saw it. He could have choked and died on that bone due to someone&apos;s carelessness.
This store needs to review their procedures so this doesn&apos;t happen to anybody else.
I am disgusted 



 Bonnie Garthe 5/4/12 
 I have a very very stress job. Friday May 4, 2011 I went to Boston Market at Drum Hill in Chemlsford, Mass. First (manager) Jane a very big big simle! Took order, Just kidding I stated I did not like the skin or bones that I wish I could have my dinner with none.... She told me no problem That was so awsome!!!! c/omanager (greg) I seen him helping another customer with lots of orders to her car. And Keith at the register took the food to our table, and Emiley took it away when we where done. The guy cooking in the back did not get his name big smile also. That was the best night out to eat, Jane and all of her staff where so nice and friendly. I felt so pampered and spoiled by all of them. Everyone had the biggest smiles. They should get an award, for the best staff. Every Boston Market and other resturants should see them as a great example of kindness and friendly people. 



 Steve 5/17/12 
 I heard that employees do not get paid time and a half on thanksgiving and they had to work that day. I believe this is wrong and till I hear that you do pay time and a half I will no longer be eating at Boston Market. 



 james covert 5/1/12 
 To whom it may concern,i had applied for a job and i had my interview and my orientation and i was told by ginger that i would get paid for five and a half hours which i never got paid for and i want to know why. Thank You P.S.Please send me an e-mail to jamescovert42@yahoo.com 



 Jeremiah 2/23/12 
 I asked for a leave of absence and was granted one so I could concentrate on my finals at school. I come back after Christmas break and I am working now. Payday is tomorrow and I find out that I am terminated because the records show that I was inactive for too long. This I can understand. What I don&apos;t understand is that if it was noted on file that I was on a leave of absence I would have been fine. Obviously the problem lies with the GM that was in charge of the store. I will not be able to get paid unless I can reapply for the job. That is not a problem. The new problem is that I receive direct deposit and there is no Bank of American center within a bus stop. I don&apos;t have a car and now I have to resubmit all of my application forms. This is part of the problem. The biggest part is that I would have been fine if the GM at the Boston Market would have put on my record that I took a leave of absence instead of not doing anything but taking me off the clock. This person has told me that I have to skip midterms and test for work and this is unacceptable. I have reached my limit now. I have bills to pay with no money and there is nothing he can do about it because he claims that he doesn&apos;t have any of my records even though I worked there for over 4 months. The Boston Market in Cincinnati, OH on Madison Rd. needs new and improved management. Please do something about this before the store closes down. He has brought customer service complaints to an all time high and now people view the store as Walmart because the employees don&apos;t receive the benefit of the doubt if a customer calls and complains. We are all stressed there because of one man.... the temp GM! 



 Wendy 2/18/12 
 How can you advertise a position for this restraunt. When it doesn&apos;t exist anymore in Stroudsburg Pennsylvania. 



 very upset 2/1/12 
 I work at boston market in marlborough, ma. I do love my job and the people. but from the GM to us employees we get no communication. And one of our HSM&apos;s does very well for her postion, and never gets any credit. and we employees are expected to go above and beyond for this company and get paid 8.50/8.75 and get paid bi-weekly. how do you expect people to pay their bills getting paid that little? i need money like the rest of this country. It would be more than appreciated if we could get raises and appreciation for what we do for you guy, and also if we coulld get more money for updating our store. we need a lot of new things that are broken or dont work properly. Just getting sick of being told oh we have no money to fix to that. That my Gm actually does repairs himself. everyone in my store loves their job but is not happy with it right now because we are expected to do everything and not getting any credit and the pay sucks and nothing works. something has tto change and quickly before everyone leaves!!! 



 Barb 1/1/12 
 Well, I was going to ask that Boston Market consider setting up a store in our area here in Enfield, CT, as there is an old Kentucky Fried Chicken building that is now empty, in the middle of a busy shopping area, and we&apos;d love to have a Boston Market nearby, but after reading the TERRIBLE reviews, especially of customer service, I&apos;m reconsidering. The general attitudes of people toward other people have gone down the tubes everywhere, but Boston Market food has always been so good, some things could be ignored...until now. I went to a store on the Mass Pike recently and was really disappointed at the quality of the food, and the unhelpful attitude of the staff. I&apos;d thought it was just THAT store on THAT particular day, but I guess it&apos;s a trend. So sad. You had a good thing going. 



 Jim Dennis 12/30/11 
 I went to the Boston Market in Deptford, NJ for a late lunch on Saturday December 10th. The dining room was a mess, the sides in the hot case looked old, and the food was cold. I couldn&apos;t even get a pat of butter for my cornbread. The employees looked like they could&apos;ve cared less. I would&apos;ve expected a substantially better experience for the $11.11 I spent. I have sent two complaints into Boston Market through their website and have been told both times that I would be contacted within 24 to 48 business hours.......I&apos;m still waiting. My next step is escalating it to the Better Business Bureau and the Gloucester County Health Department. 



 12/15/11 
 I&apos;m so sick off goi n though the drive at the 15th location in plano tx. They never get your order right how hatd is a turkey plate an how do you get that confused with chicken. Then the soda machine that is for the drive though is horrible the carbonation is off and when you ask them to fill your drink up from the inside they give you a hard time. once when I asked they filled my cup up with the from the drive though soda machine then when I confronted then they told me I was wrong so I had to go on an full or my self. Now today I call ahead to order so my dad didn&apos;t mess up the order they told me it wwould take 30min to hove it ready and was supper rude. there are to many places to eat so instead of goin to boston market for bad drinks wrong food an horrible customer service I&apos;ll go some where else. 



 dan S 11/29/11 
 Simply put, I walked out of the Hicksville N.Y. Store at the Broadway Mall. Simply put. Cockroaches!! 



 bobbie keener 11/18/11 
 i worked at boston market in fairlawn ohio for almost 2 years as a back up. i was good at my job took pride in my work.my line was always full fresh and hot.my prep done,more times than not, by the end of my shift. unless my gm was in a bad mood. then my duties as a back up would change. i then would be the back up and the only dish washer in the store not to mention cornbread. it has an experation time of 4 hours befor its in the hot case so it is pluasable that if we have 10 pans to scoop cornbread in and all my pans have to be cleaned befor i leave i should and did make enouph to get through dinner as i was told that if my shift ended at 3pm then 14 dozen should be plenty on our busiest day, not if she was in a bad mood then it was my job to make enouph for the entire day.times meant nothing they get changed constantly. i am not proud of the way that i left as i gave no notice i just walked out. but after months of telling my gm and also my area manager nothing happed or changed. i was there for th new roll out food and plates,ect. my duties nearly doubled yet my starting pay stayed the same as did my hours so i was expected to work twice as hard for the exact same pay not to mentionthe rules changing daily and never the same for any 2 employees. u do qsc&apos;s and i wonder if when they are being conducted if anyone watches tapes to see what really happens on a daily basis because believe its alot different when upper management is not there. i clocked in late nearly every shift be cause i open and i would sit in the parking lot waiting on a manager to get there to open the door. i asked for a transfer and was told not until she got a replacement for me..she never hired any one for my position, it was going on 4 months since i had asked. i realize it sounds as though im tattling after the fact and maybe i am but from my experience of opening my mouth i felt it would be best left unsaid until i was no longer employed by ur company. i didnt want the backlash i would of and have gotten befor. i dont know what im expecting you to do and honestly i dont think you will do anything but i can tell you people can only take so much for so long. if you value your company then you need to value the employees that make it possible other wise your going to end up with a buch of teenagers who for the most part niether care nor understand the meaning of pride in what they do or how they do it. in turn creating a big problem for ur customers as well as your buisiness
 



 mad as heck 11/9/11 
 If I could rate you zero stars I would. I have never rated an establishment before but the food you are serving is SUB-STANDARD! The green beans which are my favorite were HORRIBLE!!! They taste like they came from a can. They probably did. The green beans were what kept me coming here to Boston Market and if this is what you are serving, I won&apos;t be back. I was offered a free meal and I refused, even in this economy. I can promise you if you don&apos;t bring the greens beans back the way they were originally made, your doors will close very soon!! 



 ???????? 9/2/11 
 Im a employee and boston market. Im afraid to leave my name because i will just be mistreated even more forcing me to quit so that i couldnt file for unemployment... I do my work well, always showing up never calling off. I believe im not the only employee that feels this way at my store, just the first to speak about it to anyone because they need money like myself and doesnt want their hours cut.... The managers at my store can get away with anything. Even when they become physical nothing happens even when its on camara....WHAT !!!say that again.. Yes even caught on camara nothing was done......I hope someone for the Top might spend a little more time on these complaints......If we gather in the MASSES we all cant be wrong..... 



 Ben&amp;Jane 9/13/11 
 Just wanted to say that in the past we have liked the food at Boston Market in Middletown NY. But after several visits with such poor customer service that we infact had to just walk out . We will not be back again. Non english speaking employees coupled with employees who no nothing about food service and a dirty dinning room, have left us looking for somewhere else to spend our money.
It&apos;s so sad because the food used to be good and Boston Market had a good concept unfortunately it&apos;s not working. 



 Ann Marie 9/9/11 
 Hello I just want to let you know courteous and helpful your manager in your Fort Lauderdale, South Fl store is. Her name is Ebony and when I had a problem she was so polite and helpful. She listened to me and never gave me an excuse as to why the problem occurred. As a matter of fact everyone in that store is very polite and I just want to commend their attitudes towards their job and customers. I will continue to frequent your store. Sincerely 



 Kelly Ann 7/8/11 
 I recently went to the Boston Market in Deptford, NJ, and I am very annoyed and mad with the service that I received there, I most likely will NEVER go back to that store, not even for a glass of water.

I purchased a meal during my lunch break, when I walked outside I looked in the bag and they never put the lid on my side of gravy, so the gravy spilled all over the bag, all over me and my shoes, along with the interior of my car, because it was dripping from the bag.

I turned around to go back in and see ALL of the employees laughing at me, because they were watching me from inside. When I was walking in, they said, Oh she&apos;s coming back in, needless to say they waited to late to say that, as I hear them when they were walking in.

This place has rude people and needs to be properly managed, I don&apos;t see how any of this was funny - it was pure laziness on their part! The sad part, this is not the first time this has happened to me with the gravy!

They are horrible and I will never go back there again! 

 

 sheila 7/17/11 
 There isn&apos;t a Boston Market any where I live and yet the newspaper offer coupons for online service and dining in.I don&apos;t ever order for on line service because i don&apos;t have any credit card or debit card because i don&apos;t want to go in to debit,I would purchase Boston Market food from the grocery store with using the coupons from the news paper if the coupons said they could be used for frozen meals or entrees.As long as they don&apos;t say that you have lost a lot of seniors as customers.I live in New London,CT. There used to be a Boston market in Groton,CT over 10 yrs ago or so.It was Boston Market on Long Hill or known as route 12,since then that site has become DeAngelos,Now it&apos;s a bank.Groton doesn&apos;t even have KFC anymore either.Yet we have the Navy Sub base,Electric Boat,Lots of people who would eat out,We don&apos;t have any Ihop, Cracker barrel,Papa John&apos;s or sonic, I would like cici pizza to come here.Anything would be improvement.Even a home town Buffet would help.Thanks for letting me vent. 



 Chris 8/4/11

 Anitra McKinney 8/3/11 
 I want to thank the staff at Boston Market in Milwaukee,WI near Bayshore Shopping Center for their excellent customer service! They were nice and understanding although I may have been an inconvenience to them. I arrived after store hours and my meal was still prepared plus extras since what I ordered was not available. I really appreciate Boston Market for their five star customer service and feeding my family and I, besides I&apos;m pregnant and needed it! Thanks again my family loved it! 



 mad as hell 6/7/11 
 This company should close down especially the one in doral Florida the food and the store is nasty the food the management sucks ass and they never get your order right and by the time you get your food it&apos;s cold as hell!!!!!! You need to fire Bill the gm at that store he&apos;s an asshole. 



 J. Gray 6/7/11 
 I never thought this would happen, but I took a bite out of a piece of cornbread and turned it on the otherside and found a water bug inside the bread. That was the first time I even ate at Boston Market. Something has to be done. People finding rats in monster cans, now bugs in the bread. 



 Becky Schalit 6/1/11 
 My husband and I were very good customers of Boston Market on State Bridge in Duluth, Ga. right off of Peachtree Ind. but we won&apos;t be stopping at any of them anymore. The management at this above store and the quality of food is so bad.
We had our last cold dinner on Memorial evening and we both said that was it for us.
We have spent a few $$$ over the years as customers but not anymore.

 This is to Boston Market...
To whom it may concern, please find one person in your company that will read all of this...

On Monday March 14th I experienced the worst service and product quality in my life. Im not the kind of person that contacts a company either to compliment nor complain, but this just needed to come to someones attention.

At around 6 PM of that day, I went to your website and ordered a meal online. When I noticed that my confirmation number contained the number-of-the-beast I should have known nothing good was going to come of it, but I continued to make the purchase. My pick up time was 6:21 and I arrived at the store at 6:20. After noting the store was not very clean despite there being few people in it, I was able to get someones attention at the counter. He asked how he could help me and I replied that I was there to pick up my internet order. He didnt seem to understand so he started pointing at the food. Twice more I said I was there to pick up my internet order. After looking at me in confusion for a minute I handed him the printout of the order hoping hed take it to someone who could translate. Finally he seemed to understand and took the papers to another person. The woman said that the order was not ready but it was someone elses fault because she just got on shift at 6 PM.
The woman, the manager as it turns out, proceeded to ask my name so she could fill the order and I gave her my name, the same one that was on the printout. By now its 6:30 and Im late getting home which is what prompted me to order the meal online... to save time. She handed the paper to the first gentleman who started carefully putting pieces of brisket into a white container and picking out ones that were either too heavy or not up to his careful scrutiny, with his bare fingers. After placing this in another container he mumbled something to the manager which prompted her to inform me that she doesnt have any turkey.
Disappointed due to the fact that was the part of the meal I was going to eat as soon as I got home and I dont care for beef (Im not from Texas) I asked her why the website didnt inform me that was a regional item so I wouldnt order it. She replied that they do serve it, but she didnt have any available because her shift just started and it wasnt her fault. After asking her how long Id have to wait for it to be ready (50 minutes, I think she really didnt want to make it) I reluctantly asked her to substitute it for the beef.
Sensing my frustration, a polite young lady employee offered me a free drink and the apology that her manager was unable to offer. I thanked her and indicated Id like a coke. She handed me a cup and I made my way to the beverage dispenser. I started filling my cup and noticed that there was tea coming out instead of coke. Being a picky eater, I dont much care for tea but took a sip knowing it was the best I was going to get. It tasted really gnarly but politely I informed the manager that the labels on the machine were wrong to which she replied no, it was coke but there was no syrup in it but it wasnt her fault because she just started her shift 45 minutes ago. Again, to make up for the apology her manager wouldnt give, the polite young lady offered me a bottled coke from a cooler. Before I could move my gaze to the cooler which housed the precious liquid, the manager whipped her head around and gave a NO! fast enough to make an auctioneer proud. Im sure it had something to do with her shift starting at 6 PM but I didnt ask and declined the rescinded offer.
Watching as the lady packed my food into the boxes and bags and checking against my original order, I noted that there was only one salad when I had ordered two. She informed me that was how they did it, they packed two orders onto one plate. But the dressing and crunchy bits were the same size as the single order on the plate of the person at the register next to me. I brought this to her attention and she politely nodded at me and said yes. I also noticed that the beef I had been given was less expensive than the turkey I had ordered. To this the politely young woman smiled at me, nodded, said farewell and hoped I enjoyed my meal.
Finally, I made the five minute trip home, eager to dip into that delicious macaroni and cheese I remembered from years back. I opened up the package and went straight to that orange, gooey goodness. I was so disappointed to see there was only like three tablespoons for each of the two orders I paid for and it was soaked in the brown stuff from the beef. Really, I am not exaggerating for the purpose of making a point. There was so little of the pasta that there was almost nothing left after sticking to the top of the plate cover. All of the food was cold. Well, not cold, but not hot and barely could even be called warm. The beef had so much fat and gristle in it that maybe half of it was edible by a picky person such as myself. I will admit that what was left was pretty good once put in the microwave, in a beef jerky kind of way. I had never had one of your chicken pot pies before, but the display is really very misleading and I think you know that. The crust is draped way over the sides and whats really there is a pie thats maybe an inch deep. It did have quite a bit of chicken in it but because it was so cold I had to put it into the microwave which really made it taste like chicken soup inside of pasta glue. The one saving grace could have been the chocolate chip cookies but even those were bad. You could see a circle on the bottom side where the cooking had stopped. I love that chewy taste in a tollhouse cookie, but the chewy part was like an uncooked cookie that was exactly and perfectly spliced into the center with the precision of a surgical procedure.

Thank you for taking time to read this email. I dont want any money back or a manager fired or an employee sent to school to learn remedial English. I am a single guy that can not cook and cant eat fast food every day. I really wanted to have a good meal at Boston Market because of its very close and convenient proximity to my home and being a former fan of your macaroni and cheese, sliced ham and delicious green beans. Even now Im rationalizing a way to call ahead so they can have the turkey ready and maybe bribing someone to fill a whole plastic container of of mac-n-cheese and a whole plate of those delicious green beans. But it is just fantasy. What happened? Are those items even available anymore? Do you impress on your managers to cut costs so deep that the most expensive part of the meal are the plastic plates and napkins? It was so depressing to see everything measured out so precisely and in such small portions that would not be considered a satisfying meal by anyone.
I really am not exaggerating about the managers behavior. She didnt greet me, ask how I was doing or show any interest in me enjoying my meal. All she cared about was making excuses. You guys really could have made a fortune off of me and I would have been happy giving it to you, but for thirty five dollars I need to be able to salvage at least one good meal from what goes in the bag. What happened to just giving the customer a satisfying meal? Isnt that what its all about? Even McDonalds can do that. And it looks like now Ill be back to alternating between them, Wendys and Subway instead of hoarding three meals at a time from what used to be such a fine establishment called Boston Market.

P.s. You forgot to put a place for a tip on the website.

 Loaded Mashed 2/26/11 
 My story:

I was laid off at the beginning of last summer (2010) and got a call about an ad I visited on Monster.com for a catering job at Boston Market. I went in, did the interview and was told that someone overheard me and thought Id be better as an Assistant Manager. That alone should have caused bells and whistles to go off, but I was out of work and I put the fact that I had exactly zero hours experience in the restaurant field. I took the job and was told my training would be 6 8 weeks, then I would be sent to my own store to act as a salaried AM. I began with another guy, who was obviously on some kind of upper (coke?) and was told he took the job because they were the only ones that saw past his criminal history. Shortly thereafter, another Hourly Salaried Manager began. She was just off unemployment and had the customer service skills of Charles Manson. Soon, both left the company while I stayed on with another fellow who was decent and hard working. The Area Manager flat out told me that Id be at a store that was about 1 mile from my home, only to have me sent to a location that nobody would work at (because the manager is a famous prick and he is). Some things that I noticed before accepting an offer at a different company:


1) I give it about 2 years before they are all out of business. They have laid off more and more staff from corporate and are now simply down to limiting things like salt packets and coffee creamers.
2) The two stores I worked at had a people doing backup and utility that spoke zero English. I heard other managers saying trouble with Immigration more than once.
3) Employees are verbally punished for taking a small break. 10 hours on your feet? Maybe 2 minutes of sitting down (if you are lucky).
4) Anyone above the Area Manager are clueless assholes. Manipulative, mean and outright stupid.
5) The support center in CO is anything but supportive.

I got the same bullshit about the 1,000 for an over 75 score one the QEC, which is a little like trying to play a carnival toss game blindfolded and on acid. There are no reviews and the only way youd get a raise is if you bought lifts.

Dont work at Boston Market.
 



 The Carver 2/21/11 
 I also work at store 136, I have a pretty good idea who left the last post, but I will stay quiet for now. Yes, there are some things that need to change, but I don&apos;t think that it is at the management level. I think that our store manager(mentioned above) does a pretty good job at running the store. She has to follow corporates rules just like the rest of us. I&apos;m not saying that I love my job and there are no problems, I am just saying you can&apos;t pin it all on her, because she has to do what corporate says.

 We were at Boston Market on Hwy 60 in Brandon Fla Feb. 14th 2011 around 7:30 pm. When we arrived there was a line, which is not unusual when they have coupons out. As we waited we watched the cooks and servers having a problem with the lack of food being prepared. &quot;It will be 15 min for the chicken to be done&quot; one said which is not a long wait. However we waited, waited and the poor man ahead of me had decided to get Turkey and as he was next, &quot;We have no more Turkey&quot; so he left. Plates were being served waiting for the Chicken to be done and I guess we were into 15, 20 min more as more people came in and they were told &quot;Chicken will be 15 min&quot;. We finally ordered sides and left for home. The staff servers and the carver did their best with what they had but the management just said, the register did not show this much production last year however being Valentines day and coupons being out the production should have been up in preparation. Very dissappointed in the management on that night.

 I would like to share my dad&apos;s Boston Market experience which occurred on Feb.18,2011 at the Route 46 Clifton location. My dad who is 87 yrs old purchased a chicken pot pie which he ate around 5 pm. about 45mins to 1 hour later he started to experience severe pains in his stomach and violent diarrhea. Dad lives alone and immediately called 911 for an ambulance. He was taken Hackensack Hospital in Hackensack NJ and was admitted for having food poisoning from the pot pie. The only food intake he had all day was a bagel in the morning and the pot pie. I notified managment to make them aware of this unfortunate experience. We are not looking for any discounts or coupons since I doubt or should I say KNOW that we won&apos;t be eating at any Boston Market ever again.

 Boston Market lost millions of dollars in 2010, the store I work at is responsible for 109,000 of the losses. When I was hired i was told that raises were given out twice a year, and there was tons of room for growth in the company. Obviously, this was all a lie. When it came time for reviews, I was told that there was no raises, and that there has not been any raises for three years.(the last time there were raises were when the McDonalds corporation owned it) I have tons of restaurant experience, and I can tell you that not paying or respecting your employees will end your company. Last month my manager &quot;Kim&quot; at store 136 was worried because corporate was in our region and everything needed to be perfect, because if &quot;she&quot; got over a 75, she would get a 1,000 bonus. Why do you tell your employees that they have to work harder to make you money? She is required to work 50 hours a week, but on most days leaves much earlier, while employees like me bust our buts to make her look good. If these corporate people would look at the cameras they install, they could see the actual laziness of their GM&apos;s. The problem with Boston Market(sun equity) is that they think that mistreating crew and rewarding managers will make them money. Let me tell you, they are wrong. Your company is only as strong as your foundation, and the foundation is the crew making minimum wage, and if Sun Equity continues to treat their employees with disrespect and treat lazy managers(like Kim)with respect, your company will fall.

 The worst service I have ever received in any Boston Market. This one was on Hillsboro Blvd and Military Trail in Deerfield Beach, FL . My check out ticket said 12:12PM 2/8/2011. I finally received my food @ 12:24PM.. Not a big order 1 Turkey with green beans and Macaroni and cheese to go. Oh and when they finally called my name said they were out of Turkey and would be another 10 min or so! I had to take chicken. But I stood there and watched how slow the staff was. This is the lunch hours and people need to get back to work and they are dilly dallying.. ALL OF THEM. They use the man who carves the meat to go and deliver the trays out to the table! Then the food gets cold sitting there waiting for the meat. They chat with one another on the line and move away from their stations when not necessary. I have been the manager of a fast food restaurant before and my staff would never have acted that way. One two three hop to it and get that food out that door. That MUST be the motto . I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! you should not either if you need to get back to work at lunch and eat also!

 I ALSO THINK BOSTON MARKET SUCKS AS WELL AS THEIR LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE...i WENT TO A LOCAL BOSTON MARKETS IN SUCCASUNNA , NJ EARLY ON THANKSGIVING DAY SND INSTEAD OF SEEING THE USUAL MENU AS I WAS PREPARED TO BUY A TURKEY DINNER FOR 6 THEY ONLY HAD 1 PLATE DINNERS FOR $9.95...WHEN I AND OTHERS ASKED WHY NO EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN I JOINED THE DOZEN OR SO PEOPLE THAT WALKED OUT VOWING NEVER TO VISIT THEM AGAIN...WHEN I CALLED THEIR 800 NUMBER THE PERSON THAT ANSWERED SAID &quot; TOUGH S**T STORES CAN SET THEIR OWN POLICIES AND PRICES NOW... I HAVE NOT BEEN BACK AS I ALSO SENT NUMEROUS E-MAILS AND FAXES WITH NO RESPONSE...I NOW SEE WITH LACK OF MANAGEMENT WHY MCDONALDS WALKED AWAY AND DUMPED BOSTON MARKET...DUR TO THEIR LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MANGEMENT I HOPE THEY FINALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS FOR GOOD... 



 J 1/28/11 
 I HAVE BEEN WORKING AT BOSTON MARKET FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS AND FROM THE START I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS PROBLEMS. IT STARTED WITH BEING SHUFFLED BETWEEN 2 STORES. THEN THE ONE MANAGER THREATENED THAT IF I DIDNT WORK FOR HIM ON THANKSGIVING THAT I WAS NO LONGER WELCOME TO WORK IN HIS STORE. I DID AS HE WISHED AND WORKED FOR HIM AND WAS PROMISED 30 PLUS HOURS A WEEK IF I DID THAT. WELL THAT NEVER HAPPENED. FROM THEN ON IT WAS ALL DOWNHILL. I WAS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN EVERY WAY SHAPE AND FORM. I WAS NOT ONLY PAID LESS THEN PEOPLE OF HIS ORIGIN. AS MUCH AS 1 DOLLAR AN HOUR, BUT MY HOURS WERE CUT WHEN HE HIRED SOMEONE OR HIS ORIGIN. AND DONT BE A WOMAN IN THIS STORE CAUSE YOU ARE WORTH EVEN LESS. WHEN YOU DONT GIVE IN TO HIS SUGGESTIVE PROPOSITIONS THEN AGAIN YOUR HOURS ARE CUT. AND DONT EVEN GET STARTED WITH FOLLOWING POLICIES CAUSE THEY ARE FOLLOWED WHEN THEY THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A VISIT, THEN EVERYTHING IS CRAZY. THE FOOD TEMPS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE ARENT, THEY ARE TAKEN ON ONE ITEM AND GUESSED THE REST. THE POLICY THAT DRAWS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COUNTED WHEN THE PERSON LEAVES, YEAH RIGHT, I CAN COUNT ON ONE HAND THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT I WAS THERE FOR THAT, AND I COULD PROVE IT BY PROVIDING A SIGNATURE IF WANTED. I WAS NOT THE PERFECT EMPLOYEE AND WAS WORKING THROUGH PERSONAL ISSUES THAT MY MANAGER KNEW ABOUT AND SAID HE WILL WORK WITH ME, BUT ON THE DAY I WAS LET GO IT WAS ABOUT 2PM AND HE HAD THE ASST MANAGER CLOSE MY DRAW AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE TIMES THAT I ACTUALLY WAS IN THE OFFICE WHEN IT WAS COUNTED, AND WAS TOLD TO GIVE HIM MY HAT AND APRON I WAS FIRED CAUSE I WAS NASTY TO THE CUSTOMERS. OH YES BY THE WAY MY LAWYER WOULD LIKE IT IN WRITING WHY I WAS FIRED, CAUSE ACCORDING TO LAW I HAVE TO BE GIVEN WRITTEN NOTICE AS TO WHY I WAS FIRED. AND I DID NOT RECIEVE A WRITE UP FOR THIS DAY I WAS NASTY TO THE CUSTOMERS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE NEVER DONE. ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS FOR A SURPRISE VISIT FROM OUR NEW AREA MANAGER JACK, TO SEE WHAT GOES ON. IT IS A SHAME THAT THE BACK UP PERSON DOESNT SPEAK ENGLISH CAUSE WITH OUT KNOWING ENGLISH HOW IS KNOWN IF HE IS COOKING THE FOOD RIGHT. IN ORDER TO GET THE FOOD THAT IS NEEDED THERE HAS TO BE A PERSON WHO SPEAKS ARABIC AND ENGLISH TO TELL HIM WHAT IS NEEDED AND HOW TO DO IT. THEN YOU HAVE THE PREP PERSON WHO DOESNT SPEAK ENGLISH AND GETS CLOSE TO 40 HRS A WEEK FOR DOING PREP WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY A CERTAIN TIME IN THE MORNING, BUT AGAIN SHE IS OF HIS ORIGIN SO HE LETS HER STAY AND WRAP FORKS AND KNIVES TIL 3 OR 4PM. DONT EAT OUT OF THE DISHES THAT ARE WASHED IN THAT STORE. THEY ARE DIRTY AND JUST RINSED NOT WASHED OR SANITISED. THERE ARE MANY CUSTOMERS THAT STILL USE THE TAKE OUT PLATES CAUSE THE OTHERS HAVE LEFTOVER FOOD ON THEM,OR HAIR, OR WHATEVER ELSE WAS IN THE SINK WHEN WASHED.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FRESHNESS OF THE DESERTS FORGET IT, THE DAY DOTS ARE JUST CHANGED. ON SLOW MOVING ITEMS LIKE WHOLE PUMPKIN PIES IT CAN AND IS CHANGED UP TO 4 TIMES. HOW DO I KNOW, I WAS TOLD TO DO IT BY MY MANAGER AND NOT TO THROW THEM AWAY. AND THE WAY YOU COULD TELL IS TO LOOK AT BOTTOM OF THE PACKAGE. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE OLD ONE WAS AND THE NEW ONE WAS PLACED. AND IF THE PACKAGE STARTED TO LOOK OLD YOU WAS TOLD TO CHANGE THE BOX THE PIE WAS IN, WHEN IT WAS IN THE PLASTIC IT WAS HARDER TO TELL BUT NOW THE CARDBOARD BOXES ARE BACK YOU COULD SEE IT EASIER.
DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY TELL IF THE CHICKEN IS OK TO BE USED FOR CHICKEN SALAD, THIS ONE IS THE BEST,,,,,, THEY USE THE SMELL TEST. IF IT SMELLS OK THEY USE IT NO MATTER WHAT THE DAY DOT SAYS!
AGAIN I WAS NOT A PERFECT EMPLOYEE AND I AM NOT A PERFECT PERSON IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM. BUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE STORE I WORKED AT IS ALOT WORSE THEN I COULD EVER HAVE BEEN. AND I THOUGHT THAT MANAGMENT COULDNT HAVE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER MANAGER IN THE SAME STORE.
I JUST HOPE THAT SOMEBODY IN CORPORATE READS THIS AND STARTS LOOKING AT STORES IN CENTERAL JERSEY AREA. THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A SHAKE UP AND MANAGER THAT GOT TO BE IN THAT POSITION BY DOING PERSONAL FAVORS FOR THE POSITION AND CANT RUN A STORE WORTH A CRAP GET WHAT IS DESERVED.
THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SO LONG!!!!

 My husband and I was dining Boston Market in Fayettevile, NC. We began eating our food and a white mouse ran from the kitchen towards our booth. From there it went somewhere in the dining area. We immediately got up and began getting our things. I went to the cashier and stated that i want to file a complaint. A person who was not working went to the back and brought me back a business card for the store. These people saw the mice and that what had drawn my attention to what they were looking at then I saw it run towards my table. No one tried to apologize or say anything to me. I had been a customer since it arrived in my city. I will no longer be a customer. I want my money back. I will continue to find restitution. It is virtually impossible to file a complaint properly. Why would I contact the manager at the store when it is obvious that they are aware of the problem. I need to speak to Corporate and have a satisfactory result. I will continue to inform people of the rodent problem this store has. It is a major health issue.

 My husband and I have eaten at Boston Market for many years. I like to call in the order and he leaves the office to go by and pick up the food. Now the policy has changed. To order the food from home I have to give a credit card number. I can no longer just order the food and have him come by to pay when he picks it up. Crazy, no? I just told them that we will order somewhere else from now on as I will not give out a credit card number that will not be used to pay for the food. This is one of the craziest policies I have heard from any restaurant anywhere. Is this a national policy or just local?

 I began visiting Boston Market when you went by the name Boston Chicken and have had good experiences until November 10, 2010.

Having made my purchase, I waited ten minutes when the manager told me the entree would be at least another ten minutes as the store was out of it.
I stated I could not wait that long and asked why I was not informed of the wait at the time of purchase and no answer was provided.
The manager would not and did not offer a substitute entree or a refund.

I consider this consumer fraud which I have reported.

 Boston Market does not provide its employees with pay stubs which is illegal in this state. Employees have to work through their breaks and meal times which is also illegal.

 I do not want to leave my name or relationship to any employee because I do not want them fired. The manager at Boston Market in Vineland, NJ is now asking his employee&apos;s to work &quot;off the clock&quot;. This is illegal and will be reported to the labor department if it continues. 



 Anonymous 11/17/10 
 I don&apos;t want to leave my name or relationship to any employee because I don&apos;t want them to get fired. I&apos;ve just started working at Boston Market on Baum Boulevard, Pittsburgh and I&apos;m already experiencing some very BIG problems with the general manager. So far for my first ten days there, the manager has been showing Racial acts and signs of Harassment! I haven&apos;t responded to any of these acts only for the facts that I have just started working there, I don&apos;t want to lose my job, and I don&apos;t want to set an bad example for myself. During my ten work days (Oct 27th-Nov 12th). I&apos;ve been being treated very Disrespectfully. I&apos;ve been Harassed, and treated VERY UNFAIRLY BY RACE! Now mind you that I am a VERY hard worker, I work to meet ALL my Expectations, and I&apos;m also a TRUE TEAM MEMBER! On one of the ten days I was working, the manager approached me and said &quot;SIR, MY BOSS and I HAVE BEEN TALKING and WE BEIEVE THAT YOU MOVE TOO SLOW, I&apos;M GETTING TOO COMFORTABLE IN MY POSITION and HE DOES&apos;T LIKE WHAT HE&apos;S SEEING AND BECAUSE OF YOUR ACTIONS, SIR I MAY HAVE TO TAKE SOME OF YOUR HOURS AWAY FROM YOU OR I MAY HAVE TO JUST FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR YOU&quot;. I&apos;ve also found out that this same manager has VERY, VERY POOR MANAGENT SKILLS. The manager waited until the day that i was sceduled to work that tell me &quot;SIR I&apos;M SORRY BUT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK HOME BECAUSE I&apos;VE WENT OVER THE TOTAL HOURS FOR WORK LABOR AND I CAN&apos;T FIT YOU IN FOR TODAY&quot; I just would like to include that I, for one, have NEVER met his boss and for from what I&apos;ve heard from existing employees, the manager&apos;s boss treats us employees the same EXACT WAY! VERY UNFAIR, UNKIND, and WITH NO RESPECT! I STRONGLY FEEL AS IF THIS manager and boss DO NOT DESERVE TO BE IN THESE POSITIONS! I STRONGLY FEEL AS IF THE MANAGER AT BOSTON MARKET SHOULD BE FIRED AND SHOULDN&apos;T BE CONSIDERED FOR ANY OTHER MANAGER POSITION AN ANY OTHER BOSTON MARKET COMPANY! And just to inform you, I&apos;ve contacted my manager at Boston Market on NOVEMBER 16th to see WHEN I will be RETURNING and he has NEVER CONTACTED me since! 



 The Delivery Guy 11/19/10 
 Again i did not get paid today. I cannot keep being late on my payments and bills. I need gas to do deliveries rite or do cars drive on air?.. I am not sure if colorodo bosten markets know this but in new york state it is ILLEGAL for you guys not to pay me in a timly fashion let alone be late on my paychecks everytime or force me into direct deposit. I dont have a bank account for a reason... I will file a complaint with the ny labor law if i have to which will be if it is not in the mail tomorow. The job is great the employers is great but i need to be paid according to the law. if you mail my check on payday i will not get it on payday. I think that is common sense last time it was a day late and no i am told it will be 5 days late. I Will not sleep on the side of the road cuz my employer cant pay me. I have an agreement with the landlord. I have nothing against bosten market or anyone for that matter who has nothing to do with payrole. the job has great moving up opertunity and i have a save serve certificate and went to schoool for resturaunt managment and would like to continue working for this company but please is it that hard for you to pay me in a TIMELY FASHION.

 First, i would like to say, I visit Boston Market AT LEAST 3 times a week. Im very familiar with the processes, foods, etc. About a month ago, $1 off coupons for individual meals were placed in the lobby for guests and placed in our bags. Today, when buying my and my daughter&apos;s lunch, the &quot;cashier&quot; ignored my coupon. I picked it up, handed it to her, she read over it, pushed a few buttons, then told me, the computer wouldnt take it b/c it was expired? Hmmm, why lie? I looked at the coupon, it has dates to be used 1/04-4/15/10. I told her i use a coupon everytime i come in and why did they still have the expired coupons right now in their lobby. She shrugged. I asked for a manager. She replied,&quot;we are all manaers&quot;. I said WOW! Paid for my food, then asked one of the other &quot;managers&quot; thats usually there when i come in. He said they havent gotten the new coupons in, but they were taking the one&apos;s that were expired in the lobby. Hmmm, no one apologized, or offered my dollar back. This is the most horrible cust service I think ive seen from a &quot;manager&quot; anywhere.

 i am currently an emloyee at boston market as an asst. manager and i take complete pride in my customers and would personally not serve food to them that i wouldnt serve my family or eat myself i am very disappointed in how this company treats there employees and even when you go up the corporate lader and complain it does no good...there are alot of things going on that i know corporate dont know about and its all because dms and area managers are covering people...this is suppose to be a zero tolerance company and customers are always right....ha!!!!!!that is a joke...i know there is health and osha regulations being broken and employees are treated like a piece of garbage..there is alot of discrimination and harassment and favoritism going on and messing with hours and paychecks and scheduling andsome people get in trouble for stuff that others dont...it is a shame that people work so hard to get where there at and then this type of stuff goes on...i wish someone would come into stores anonomously and investigate and see for themselves...i personally busted my bt for 8 months and went from shift supervisor to asst and ran a store for 8 weks while a manger was n vacation and now all of a sudden caus e i made a acomplaint about someone i am the bad guy and dont do my job. i got no writeups or complaints ive gotten wow reports and many compliments and all the employees ive worked withlove me its a ashame that a company treats the good employees like crap and honors the people who dont do there jobs... i have on numerous occassions come in on my days off and come in early and stayed late and did not get paid for it. ive put in plenty of hours in this company to help out that i havent gotten paid for caus epeople mess with hours andpaychecks, there is food being dropped on floor andpicked upand served and raw food being served cause its busy and they dont do cooking schedules properly and daydots are nt being used appropriately....they claim to talk to peple but ive yet to see it happen. ive never seen a company not back there good employees and take care of people that dont care and is losing money for the company.and when complaints come in on them there covered up....this company got some serious issues and needs to investigate more about whats going on in certsin stores before the state shuts them down.....(east brunswick) this woman who is running your store is a walking talking hostile enviroment is gonna get yous a big lawsuit...she is gonna get someone seriously hurt one day...shes already cut employees and harasses them and gets in there face and calls them idiots and pieces of shit and belittles them in front of other emplolyees and customers too...there is some serious issues in that store that need to be addressed and hope corporate does before it gets shut down..im still waiting to hear from human resources (suppose to protect emoployee rights) thats a joke...they say i need to be tranferred cause i dont get alot with her...well no one does....shes th problem tranfer her...i lovemy job and want to continue to work with company and the employees i am with but i was taken off schedule and told i am being transferred...that was a week ago and i havent heard anything yet. nice to see how this is a zero tolerance company and a family oriented company and an equal opportunity employee all people do is talk to employees about peopleand nothing is done...i have been told i made you i can break you and no one will fire me this comany knows how much ive done for them and theyll never get rid of me....and i dont care about hours i need help and im not paying license people to come into store i cant afford to. i hope corporate looks into this and takes care of this i would really like to keep my job but by the looks of it,it doesnt look that way

 You spend time and money advertising your &quot;on line survey&quot;... but the survey is not current. The instructions are not properly in sync with the cash register receipts I received from store number 1981 in Austin Texas today ( 10-3-2010)

Doesn&apos;t say much for your concern of customer service.... 



 Barbara Hochman 4/15/10 
 I am writing to praise the services of Erika Robinson, an employee, at store # 0279 who works in the Plantation, Florida store. We know her for a several years and want to acknowledge her for her wonderful, cheerful, friendly outgoing personality!!! We have written to your company before and was happy to still see her &apos;working&apos; the counter. We hope she gets the praise she deserves!!!

Thank you and hope we get a response from you too,

 I and my co-workers have just started ordering from Boston Market here in Melbourne, Fl, on the corner of Lake Washington Rd and Wickham Rd, and this is to say that the food it terrible! I received RAW chicken it was bloody and stringy, everytime we order from there something is wrong with it. my manager ordered the southwest santa fe salad and when she brought it back to work it did not have any corn or black beans in it, she took it back and they put 4 black beans in the salad. Are black beans that expensive that you can only put 4 in the salad? 



 Wanda Hamilton 9/4/10 
 Boston Market should close their doors immediately. Tonight&apos;s service was the straw that broke the Camel&apos;s back. Why is it that &quot;People of Color&quot; get smaller portions than others. This is not the first time, this happen to me. I starting going to Boston Market when I lived in the Philadelphia area. The portion size was great. It wasn&apos;t until I moved to Florida that I notice a change in the portion size. Didn&apos;t pay it any mind until tonight. But, this evening I was first in line, not really happy about the portion size I recieved again.Well, I have been waiting all day to eat. Fine. I turned around to realize that everyone else was receiving larger portions ( People of Another Color). I said to the clerk, I want my plate to look like theirs, she gave me a dumb look and continued checking me out. Maybe she thought I was joking. I was as serious as two heart attacks. I paid her and ask again. She said, that it would be messy if she filled my plate up. I said, it doesn&apos;t matter. She refused. I asked for the manager, to my surprise was standing right there; listening to everything I said. I requested that my order be fixed. She said that my plate&apos;s portion was correct and the other customer&apos;s behind portion were incorrect. Their plate&apos;s were over flowing with food. I said correct the problem and she refused. I requested my money back and ask for her manager&apos;s phone number. She gave me a number to a survey poll. I kindly went back into the store to get the store&apos;s number, I called Ms. Terry ( manager on duty, same lady I spoke with this evening)and ask her for her regional manager&apos;s phone number. For all I know she ay have given me her home phone number. I am not finish yet. Times are changes people need to get ready.

 Companies like Boston Market just don&apos;t get it. They advertise and tell you what great deals they have. Although, when you walk in, customer service SUCKS. The employees could care less about their custommers. They are there to spend time and get a paycheck.
The corporate office could care less about customer service. I was right when I said Red Lobster would go under some day. They closed over 200 stores and the company was sold. I tried to tell them but they wouldn&apos;t listen. Circuit City was told, get your customer service straightened out or you&apos;ll go out of business. They wouldn&apos;t listen to me. I&apos;ve spoken to hundreds of business owners, especially in food service where people who have money to spend in their business. Yet, so many are stupid and lose thosands of dollars and close their doors. It just goes on and on. 



 Nadine Hollingsworth 9/1/10 
 I used to like Boston Market, but now, you couldn&apos;t pay me to eat there nor take out food. I placed my order with the cashier on Monday, August 30, 2010, 6:30 pm, with a woman who was rubbing her nose and then handling food, forget it!!!. I asked for their chicken noodle soup (the family size) and what I received was 75% broth and the rest was leftover chicken from their chopping board. This included skin, gristle and tiny parts of chicken. I was totally disgusted. This was at Boston Market, in Downey, California, at the corner of Patton and Fireston Blvd. Would I ever eat at Boston Market again? Absolutely not!!!. I also belong to the Eastern Star in Downey, and I will express to my friends not to waste their money by eating there or becoming ill.
