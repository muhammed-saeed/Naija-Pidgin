 Work Product or Not? California Supreme Court Provides Insight on Recorded Statements in Coito v. Superior Court 
 Posted on July 9, 2012 by David Denton 
 Recorded Statements and Work Product Protection 

On June 25, 2012, the California Supreme Court rendered its decision on a critical issue for attorneys and investigators alike: Is a recorded statement taken by an attorney, or her/his agent, afforded attorney work product protection?

For years, most attorneys in Southern California would respond“of course it’s protected!” This is in part due to the California appellate decision of Nacht&amp;Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal. App. 4 th 214, which held that recorded witness statements are entitled to absolute work product protection and are never discoverable. Most California practitioners followed this general rule of thumb until the case of Coito v. Superior Court , (2010) 182 Cal. App. 4 th 758.

In Coito , the Appellate Court reviewed the decision of a trial court where production of recorded statements of eyewitnesses obtained by defense counsel were held to be absolute work product, therefore not discoverable. Upon review, the Appellate Court rejected the reasoning of Nacht&amp;Lewis Architects , and held that a recorded statement receives no attorney-work product protection because the statement did not contain an attorney’s impressions, conclusions, or opinions. Therefore, defendant was required to disclose recorded statements it took of the eyewitnesses. Defendant petitioned the California Supreme Court, and review was granted.

 California Supreme Court Review 

In the California Supreme Court’s review of Coito v. Superior Court,  the Court reversed the Appellate Court and held that recorded statements taken by an attorney or his/her agent are afforded work product protection. However, the Court took a step back from Nacht&amp;Lewis Architects , holding that recorded statements are afforded a minimum of qualified work product. In making this decision, the Court reasoned that witness statements may be entitled to absolute work product protection if the party claiming the privilege can show disclosure would reveal the“attorney’s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research and theories.” If not, then the items may be subject to discovery if the requesting party can show that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the requesting party in preparing its claim/defense, or will result in an injustice. In sum, parties may now be able to obtain a recorded statement that was previously undiscoverable if that recorded statement is of a witness that is not reasonably available (e.g. passed away, or is not in the country).

The California Supreme Court also addressed one other issue: Whether a party responding to California Judicial Council Form Interrogatory 12.3 can avoid disclosing the identity of witnesses. Specifically, the interrogatory requests:“Have you or anyone acting on your behalf obtained a written or recorded statement from any individual concerning the incident?” Under Nacht&amp;Lewis Architects , such information was provided qualified work product protection. The Supreme Court, however, has added a twist: A party can claim qualified work product protection as long as it can show that disclosing such information would reveal the attorney’s tactics, impressions, or case evaluation. While not much guidance was provided, perhaps the best example the Court gave was that if an attorney took a recorded statement from every eyewitness, then responding to this interrogatory would not be a violation of work-product protection since such individuals had to be disclosed anyway in other interrogatories. However, if an attorney chose a select few individuals to obtain statements from, then such information could invoke qualified work product protection.

 Conclusion 

The California Supreme Court’s recent decision provides California practitioners with a sense of relief, as the Appellate Court decision was a complete disregard for the attorney work-product doctrine. However, with the rough guidelines provided as to what is“absolute”or“qualified”work product, expect California courtrooms to have more motions filed on these issues in the near future.

 Illinois Adopts Rule Allowing Jurors to Question Witnesses 
 Posted on June 26, 2012 by Katherine O&apos;Malley 
 Imagine you are in the middle of a complicated fire subrogation case. Each side has multiple lay and expert witnesses. After your expert finishes testifying about the fire’s cause, one confused looking juror raises his hand with a clarification question for your expert. The judge informs the juror that this is not permitted, and you cringe wondering what the juror did or did not understand and how it would affect your case. Prior to this year, the juror would not have been allowed to find out the answer to his question. However, in Illinois, this is all about to change.

On April 3, 2012, the Illinois Supreme Court adopted new Rule 243, which will allow jurors to submit questions of witnesses during civil trials. Presently, half of the state court systems and all of the federal circuits allow jurors to submit questions to witnesses.

In a civil trial, the judge will have discretion on whether the rule will be implemented and which witnesses may be questioned. If allowed, the jury members may submit written questions to the judge initially. There is no limit to the number of questions allowed any one juror, and the jury members will not be required to submit questions. All questions will be marked as exhibits and made a part of the record. Outside the presence of the jury, the judge will review the questions with counsel and rule on all objections. The judge will then decide on which questions will be admitted or excluded. Questions may also be modified by the judge. After the appropriate questions have been decided upon, the judge will read them to the witness with an opportunity for follow-up questions from the attorneys limited to the scope of the new testimony.

The goal of Rule 243 is that jurors will better comprehend the testimony being offered, allowing for verdicts that are based on a correct understanding of the facts and testimony.  Rule 243 becomes effective on July 1, 2012 for all civil trials in Illinois.

 Personal Jurisdiction in Oregon--Contacts May Not Be Enough 
 Posted on June 18, 2012 by Kyle Farnam 
  A recent Oregon case offers a reminder that subrogating carriers need to carefully examine personal jurisdiction before pursuing an out-of-state defendant. In Robinson v. Harley Davidson Motor Company (Oregon Ct. App. 2012), Oregon resident Robinson was riding her Harley Davidson motorcycle in Idaho when she noticed a problem with the front wheel. Although she had purchased the motorcycle in Oregon, she took it to an Idaho dealer for warranty work. The next day, the wheel malfunctioned and Robinson was thrown from the motorcycle and injured.

Robinson sued the Idaho Harley dealer, among others, in Oregon state court. Although the Idaho dealer did not have a business located in Oregon, it maintained contacts there, including advertising in Oregon and selling parts, accessories and apparel to Oregon residents. Nevertheless, the Idaho dealer brought a motion to dismiss Robinson’s case, arguing that Oregon courts did not have personal jurisdiction over it.

The trial court agreed, and dismissed the Idaho dealer from Robinson’s case. In an opinion affirming the dismissal, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that“plaintiff’s claims do not arise out of or relate to defendant’s Oregon activities.”Since the Idaho dealer’s work on Robinson’s motorcycle did not take place in Oregon, the court found it was irrelevant that the dealer advertised or sold parts there. 

In light of recent U.S. Supreme Court cases (such as J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro ) holding foreign manufacturers are not subject to personal jurisdiction simply by placing products in the stream of commerce, Robinson v. Harley offers another example where“contacts”with a state may not be enough to create personal jurisdiction there.

 Good, Bad or Ambivalence: The Litigation Detour of Judicial Reference under California Law 
 Posted on May 21, 2012 by Ned E. Tolbert 
 Property subrogation cases that proceed against developers and seller-builders of homes are suddenly apt to being diverted from judicially engaged litigation into the province of Judicial Reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638. In essence, this Code section exercises to remove judicial litigation and substitute independent arbitration pursuant to a written agreement between the insured and the developer/builder that was entered into at the time of the purchase of the home. The result is that a negligence or products liability action against a seller-builder or developer is evaluated by a single or multiple arbitrators [three maximum] whose decision stands“as the decision of the Court”and judgment may be entered in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court.

In order to activate the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638, or other similar codified Judicial Reference laws in other states, there must be a written agreement between the insured and the builder/developer. Normally, these agreements are part of the purchase transaction in which the buyer and seller agree that any disputes between the parties will be regulated and decided by a neutral arbitrator.

The insurer in a subrogation matter“stands in the shoes”of the insured, and thus is bound by the agreement between their insured/buyer and the potential tortfeasor/developer/seller.

The benefits of Judicial Reference are speed, access to a decision-maker and potential cost savings. That is, the matter is immediately“stayed”if filed in a California Court and referred to an mutually agreed independent arbitrator. Written discovery, depositions and expert disclosures are thereafter controlled by agreement of the parties in conjunction with the arbitrator and Court dates and other judicially monitored actions are eliminated.

All parties to the potential dispute must either be signatories to the agreement to Judicial Referral or must accede to the process. Judicial Referral is“discretionary”to the Court if sought after litigation ensues.

Where multiple parties are involved, for instance in a fire case involving the construction of a home where the seller/manufacturer may be among many potential defendants [appliance manufacturers and sub-contractors may be others], the Court may deny Judicial Reference as being potentially prejudicial to other parties or leading to potentially conflicting findings of fact between an arbitrator and a Court proceeding.

While cost-saving and potentially expedient, the detriment to Judicial Reference is elimination of jury trials and Court supervised discovery. Placing decision making into the control of an independent arbitrator would require evaluation and vetting of that arbitrator with extreme scrutiny to eliminate any potential prejudice or preconceptions.

Hence, the Judicial Referral option has both advantages and disadvantages that must be evaluated on an individual case basis.

 Insurer&apos;s Right to Contractual Subrogation Trumps Equitable Made-Whole Doctrine Yet Again in Texas 
 Posted on May 14, 2012 by Jason S. Schulze 
In Fortis Benefits v. Cantu , 234 S.W.3d 642 (Tex.2007), the Texas Supreme Court held that the“made whole”doctrine does not apply where the parties’agreed contract provides a clear and specific right of subrogation. Despite this ruling, the Austin Court of Appeals was recently confronted with a situation where a trial court attempted to allocate the entirety of an $800,000.00 settlement in a negligence suit to the family of an individual who was injured in an oilfield explosion and spent 52 days in the hospital before eventually succumbing to his extensive injuries. Although the insurer had intervened in the underlying lawsuit and asserted a contract-based lien of over $330,000.00 on any recovery obtained by the family, the Austin Court of Appeals ultimately agreed with the trial court that equitable principles applied to the subrogation claim, and that where“a subrogation claim works an injustice, it shall not be allowed.”Citing the insurer’s solid financial position and the financial hardship that the family would suffer should the insurer’s subrogation rights be enforced, the entire settlement was ultimately allocated to the family under the“made whole”doctrine. 

In reversing the Austin Court of Appeals, the Texas Supreme Court held in Texas Health Ins. Risk Pool v. Sigmundik , 315 S.W.3d 12, 14 (Tex.2010) that the“made whole”doctrine was inapplicable, and that it was improper to cut the insurer out of a settlement to which it had a valid claim. Moreover, the Court noted that the trial court could not cut the insurer out of the settlement simply because it was an insurance company, or because the trial court believed the surviving family needed the money more than the insurer.

The Court further addressed arguments by the family that the insurer failed to carry its burden of establishing that settlement funds should be allocated to its lien. In rejecting this argument, the Court held that such evidence was in fact provided. Specifically, the insurer requested the full amount of the total medical expenses incurred beginning with its first petition in intervention, and also provided extensive medical records and testimony to support both the expenses it requested and the damages suffered by the deceased. The Court ultimately remanded the case to the trial court to determine what portion of the settlement funds should be allocated to the insurer.

The Sigmundik case provides even more persuasive authority for insurers to rely on when asserting contractual based rights of subrogation. Based on Fortis Benefits and Sigmundik , it is clear that the Texas Supreme Court will defer to clear policy language when addressing allocation issues between an insured and its insurer. Accordingly, it is imperative that these provisions be reviewed and analyzed at the outset of a claim so that the insurer is not forced to unfairly compromise its rights of subrogation. In addition, Sigmundik also provides a framework for what an insurer needs to do to adequately protect its contractual subrogation interest (namely, intervene and ensure that its damages are properly pled and supported). Adherence to these suggestions will allow an insurer to negotiate from a position of strength should recovery allocation issues arise.

 Turning an Implied Insured into a Co-insured 
 Posted on April 9, 2012 by Bryan Campbell 
Thinking about subrogating against a tenant in Washington? Think again because the Washington Court of Appeals has re-affirmed existing law and increased the risks of such a challenge. 

Since Cascade Trailer v. Beeson was decided 1988, Washington courts have held that tenants are implied co-insureds under a landlord’s property policy. This holding leaves the landlord’s insurer without a remedy when a tenant negligently causes damage. The holding is based on the notion that part of the rent paid by the tenant pays for the landlords property insurance. Because the tenant is a considered an insured, the landlord insurer cannot subrogate. 

In an unrelated insurance decision, the Olympic Steamship court determined that an insured who successfully sues an insurer to obtain coverage may recover the reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in the litigation.  Olympic Steamship Co. v. Centennial Insurance Co ., 117 Wn.2d 37, 811 P.2d 673 (1991). The decision to award attorney’s fees in a coverage dispute is based on equity and flows from the special fiduciary relationship that exists between an insurer and its insured.  McGreevy v. Oregon Mutual Insurance Co ., 904 P.2d 731 (1995). 

A recent decision that has yet to be published has intermixed these two unrelated holdings. In Community Association Underwriters of America v. Kalles, et. al ., the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed that a tenant is an implied co-insured and further held that, as an insured, the tenant was entitled to an award of attorney fees. In Kalles , the plaintiff insured a condominium complex. One of the units was owned by Elkins who ran a business out of the condominium unit. Elkins sold the business to the Kalles but maintained ownership of the condominium unit, renting the space to the Kalles. The Kalles negligently caused a fire which damaged the condominium building. CAU paid for the damage on behalf of the condominium association and pursued a subrogation claim against the Kalles for negligence.

The lawsuit challenged existing law because this particular scenario was not addressed in Cascade Trailer . In particular, the Kalles was not tenants of the condominium association, rather they were tenants of a unit owner. The Kalles court, however, applied Cascade Trailer  and found the Kalles were implied co-insureds under the condominium association’s policy. In a broad expansion of insurance law, the court also awarded the Kalles their attorney’s fees in defending the case against their“insurer,”under Olympic Steamship . 

The award of Olympic Steamship fees in the situation presented in Kalles is a significant expansion of the attorney’s fees penalty. It certainly raises the stakes when deciding whether to put a case into suit when it is questionable whether the lease language circumvents the implied co-insured rule.

 Utilizing Federal Rule 27--Depositions to Perpetuate Testimony 
 Posted on April 4, 2012 by James Campise 
 The sooner evidence can be evaluated and preserved, the better the prospects for a successful outcome. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford to potential plaintiffs and defendants a uniform standard when pre‐action“discovery”can be obtained. Strictly speaking, the relief sought is not discovery , as the rule is utilized to preserve evidence. Federal Rule 27, titled“ Depositions to Perpetuate Testimony ”permits the preservation of testimony, physical evidence, and documents that are not likely to be available at a later time.

Case law interpreting the rule permits the petitioner to demand production of documents and gain access to physical property for purposes of inspection by a party’s experts. A dying witness or a product or part which is leaving the United States, deteriorating, or changing for any reason, are examples where Rule 27 relief may be invoked. The rule is especially useful where witnesses, such as crew members, are temporarily in the United States, but reside in locations beyond the court’s jurisdiction. In Deiulemar Compagnia di Navigazione SpA v M/V Allegra , the court allowed depositions, as well as access to documentary and physical evidence in such a circumstance. 

In order to qualify for Rule 27 relief, a lawsuit must be able to be filed in a U.S. court. If the matter cannot be heard in a U.S. court, Rule 27 is not available. Where the matter is to be heard in a foreign tribunal, including overseas arbitrations, and witnesses and/or evidence is within the United States, 28 U.S.§1782 can be invoked in support of an application to allow for depositions that are to be utilized before foreign or international tribunals. Intel Corp. v Advanced Micro Devices . 

So before filing a lawsuit to obtain discovery, consider Rule 27 if evidence needs to be preserved and suit can be brought in the United States. Also consider 28 U.S.C.§1782 if the proceeding needs to be brought in a foreign tribunal.

 Expert Opinions in Wisconsin--What Has Changed? 
 Posted on March 19, 2012 by Thaddeus Baria 
 The Wisconsin legislature enacted a comprehensive tort reform package in early 2011. Part of the legislation changed Wisconsin’s evidence rules governing the admissibility of witness testimony on scientific, technical or specialized subjects. Wisconsin law now aligns with federal standards, which means that Wisconsin practitioners will have to identify any expert opinions they may need in a particular case and ensure that a suitable witness has been selected to render that opinion.

Under the old rules, a witness could offer an expert opinion as long as the judge determined that the witness was an expert in a particular field based on the person’s knowledge, skills, experience, training, or education. The old rule allowed lay witnesses with extensive practical work experience to testify about scientific, technical or specialized subjects. This meant that such a witness did not need degrees or certifications to qualify as an expert witness, and the testimony need only be relevant to be presented to a jury.

The new rules subject the bases for expert opinions to greater scrutiny. In addition to determining whether a witness is qualified to give an opinion on technical matters, a judge must now determine whether the expert’s testimony is based on sound data and methods. This evaluation also entails an assessment of whether the witness’s opinion is based on adequate facts and that the facts were properly used in forming the opinion. Under the new rule, it is important that a witness have the ability to articulate the principles underlying her opinion and the process she went through in forming her opinion.

These new requirements may lead some recovery practitioners to more closely scrutinize a potential witness’s educational background. Most importantly, when an expert opinion is needed, one must now be certain that the expert can state and explain the principles, facts and methods behind the opinion.

 Subrogating Against The Long Island Power Authority--Guidelines and Pitfalls 
 Posted on March 13, 2012 by Robert W. Phelan 
In situations where the Long Island electrical distribution system is involved in causing the loss, it is critically important to make sure that you adhere to certain particular Notice of Claim requirements, heed the shortened statute of limitations period, and also identify any additional maintenance vendors as potential targets for recovery. 

 LIPA 

The Long Island Power Authority (“LIPA”) was created by statute under N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law§§1020 et seq. which states, in part, as follows: “There is hereby created a corporate municipal instrumentality of the state to be known as the‘Long Island Power Authority,’which shall be a body corporate and politic and a political subdivision of the state, exercising essential governmental and public powers.” 

LIPA owns the retail electric system on Long Island and provides electric service to over 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. LIPA does not own any electric generation assets on Long Island, and it does not provide natural gas service. According to its own press releases, LIPA is the second largest municipal electric utility in the nation in terms of electric revenues, third largest in terms of customers served and the seventh largest in terms of electricity delivered.

 Notice of Claim 

Any notice of claim must be served upon LIPA within the time limited by and in compliance with all the requirements of section 50-e of the general municipal law. Service of a notice of claim within 90 days after accrual of the claim is a condition precedent to the commencement of any tort action against LIPA. See McShane v Town of Hempstead , 66 AD3d 652 (2d Dept 2009) (citing General Municipal Law§50-e [1] [a];§50-i [1]; Public Authorities Law§1020-y [3].)

 Statute of Limitations 

When an action, other than one for wrongful death, founded upon tort is brought against LIPA, the action must be commenced within one year and ninety days after the cause of action accrues. N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law§1020-y.

 New Rule for Hearings in Arbitration Forums 
 Posted on March 8, 2012 by Joseph F. Rich 
 Recovery professionals handling claims in Arbitration Forums, Inc.’s Property Arbitration Forum should be aware that, as of March 1, 2012, Arbitration Forums will be implementing new rules for hearings. Rule 3-7 now states that the written Contentions and supporting evidence submitted are all that is to be considered by an arbitrator, and that a party attending the hearing is not allowed to verbally present its case or offer any argument that is not included within the written Contentions. Rule 3-7(a) also provides that a representative who attends a hearing may only clarify, at the arbitrator’s request, his or her party’s Contentions and/or submitted evidence. Consequently, under the new rules, a recovery professional presenting a claim can only answer the questions of the arbitrators and can no longer present arguments.

Rule 3-7 has been also been amended to state that additional evidence can no longer be submitted at the time of the hearing, rather it must be uploaded or submitted to Arbitration Forums by the Materials Due Date.

These new changes to Rule 3-7 go along with the trend in Arbitration Forums of holding“staff hearings,”which are hearings held via a conference call in which the parties are only allowed to answer the questions of the arbitration panel. When preparing your arbitration package, try to anticipate all of the potential written evidence and file materials that you may need to rely upon in presenting your claim. Given these changes, recovery professionals should err on the side of being over inclusive when submitting evidence and supporting documentation.

 Remember the Basics--Make Sure the Insured Knows Whether Subrogation Counsel is Representing Their Interests 
 Posted on February 20, 2012 by William E. Gericke 
 

 It is not uncommon for subrogation counsel to file suit in the name of the insured for a variety of reasons. The most obvious is when counsel represents the insured for their uninsured losses or their deductible. However, there are times that for tactical reasons, counsel files suit in the name of the insured to try and avoid the bias that often accompanies an action filed in the name of the carrier. Although the deductible may be accounted for in a suit filed in the name of the insured, if the insured suffered any uninsured losses, they may not be included unless counsel has entered into a retention agreement with the insured. Unless a proper agreement is in place, the carrier and subrogation counsel run the risk of being sued by a disgruntled insured whose uninsured losses were not included in the carrier’s suit. There is a simple solution to avoid such a problem–make it clear to the insured whether or not their claims are included in the lawsuit, especially when suit is filed in the name of the insured. 

 

A perfect example of what can happen when the insured is not advised whether their uninsured losses are included in the carrier’s action occurred in Sandman v. Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co., et al. (Mass. App. No. 10–P-2080 January 25, 2012). The case stemmed from Quincy Mutual’s subrogation action against a heating oil delivery company that spilled 100 gallons of fuel oil in Elaine Sandman’s property during a delivery. Quincy Mutual covered the remediation costs to clean up the oil spill, which was over $200,000, but denied coverage for damage to Sandman’s personal property due to a policy exclusion. Quincy Mutual then retained subrogation counsel to recover its remediation costs from the oil delivery company.  

 

Approximately two weeks after the spill, as Sandman was looking for an attorney to represent her uninsured losses, Quincy Mutual’s subrogation counsel contacted her and introduced himself as the attorney hired by Quincy Mutual to pursue her claims against the oil delivery company. For the next five years, counsel consistently led Sandman to believe he represented her interests as well as those of Quincy Mutual. Most of those representations were oral, but in one letter counsel sent to Sandman, he referred to her as a client and stated that,“[o]nce we receive the final figure suit will be entered in the Superior Court against parties responsible for damages to your property.” Counsel never informed Sandman that he had not filed suit on her behalf and was only seeking to recover the damages Quincy Mutual paid out on her claim. Sandman assisted counsel in answering interrogatories, and he represented her at her deposition. When the case settled in the spring of 2009, counsel informed Sandman, for the first time, that he was only representing Quincy Mutual. Counsel then told Sandman he could not assist her in pursuing her claims against the oil delivery company because he had a conflict of interest as Quincy Mutual’s attorney. By that time, Sandman’s claims were barred by the statute of limitations.

 The Independent Contractor Doctrine is Not Always Applicable in Delivery and Installation Cases 
 Posted on February 13, 2012 by Joseph F. Rich 
 Defendants often claim that the negligent work they are being sued for was done by“an independent contractor”—thus attempting to alleviate their responsibility. This defense is often raised in cases where construction is being performed. However, it can also be raised when one party contracts with another for a specific type of installation or delivery work. In these cases, the independent contractor defense may not be applicable if you can establish that there was no prior disclosure to the owner that independent contractors would be used.

For a variety of reasons, the recovery professional may wish to craft an argument that will allow continued pursuit the primary target for the work done by the independent contractor. While not every jurisdiction has addressed this issue in the context of installations or deliveries, some have adopted Restatement (Second) of Torts§429. Under this section of the Restatement, you may be able to diffuse the defense that an independent contractor did the work if you are able to show the general contractor failed to disclose the use of independent contractors or subcontractors.

Massachusetts has adopted Section 429 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. In Harkins v. Colonial Floors , 8 Mass. L. Rptr. 127, 1998 WL 22075, * 8, No. CIV A 96 910 (Mass. Super. Ct. 1998), the court set forth a roadmap for how to defeat the defense of the independent contractor doctrine in a repair, installation or delivery setting.

When faced with the independent contractor doctrine in a setting that involves installation or delivery, recovery professionals should examine Section 429 of the Restatement to see whether it may apply in your state.

 Pennsylvania Rejects Independent Action for Negligent Spoliation 
 Posted on February 6, 2012 by Mark Mullen 
 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently joined“the overwhelming majority”of states that have declined to recognize a separate cause of action in tort for negligent spoliation of evidence. In Pyeritz v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, __ Pa. __, 32 A.2d 687 (2011), the Court held that“Pennsylvania law does not recognize a cause of action for negligent spoliation of evidence.”The case involved a suit against the Commonwealth for the actions of the Pennsylvania State police. Daniel Pyeritz was found dead at the base of a tree while hunting. He was alone and there were no witnesses. The remains of a black nylon belt were found 15 feet up in a tree stand. The Trooper in charge of the investigation into the death took the two pieces of belt as evidence and logged them into evidence.

The estate retained a lawyer to investigate a civil suit. Counsel wrote to the Trooper and asked if the evidence could be retained for the indefinite future, even after the coroner’s inquest, if able to do so. After the inquest finding an avoidable accidental death, counsel requested that the state police retain the evidence and the Trooper agreed. About 7 months later, the evidence was relocated when the state police barracks was moved. The Trooper in charge had been re-assigned to another post before the evidence was moved. The new Troopers, unaware of the communications between counsel and the original Trooper, authorized the destruction of the evidence. All that remained were some photographs and two envelopes with names of two tree stand belt manufacturers written on them.

 The estate filed and then settled for $200,000 an action against the two tree stand belt manufacturers. The estate also filed an action against the Commonwealth in negligence for failure to preserve the evidence. The trial court granted summary judgment for the Commonwealth and the intermediate appellate court affirmed. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized that the duty element in negligence required the Court to make a policy judgment whether it is in the public interest to impose damages for failure to conform conduct to a particular standard. The Court held“that as a matter of public policy, this is not a harm against which [a party] should be responsible to protect.”The primary reason relied upon by the Court was that such a cause of action would potentially allow liability where, due to the absence of evidence, it is impossible to determine whether the underlying litigation would have been successful. The Court noted that there were protections already in place to encourage the preservation of evidence and imposing tort liability would involve financial burdens that outweighed the benefit to encourage preservation. The overall public interest favored rejection of a tort based on speculation, the possibility of litigation proliferation, and one whose benefit was already sufficiently protected under existing law.

 New Discovery Rules in Utah may Streamline Your Subrogation Case 
 Posted on January 27, 2012 by Tom Regan 
 The Utah Supreme Court recently approved a number of amendments to the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure which limit discovery in civil actions. The amendments became effective for all cases filed after November 1, 2011.

The purpose of the amendments are to allow discovery in proportion to: needs of the case; amount in controversy; complexity of the case; the parties’resources; the importance of the issues; the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues–U.R.C.P. 26(b)(2)(A); the likely benefits of the proposed discovery outweigh the burden or expense - R.26(b)(2)(B); the discovery is consistent with the overall case management and will further the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of the case–R.26(b)(2)(C); the discovery is not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative–R.26(b)(2)(D); the information cannot be obtained from another source that is more convenient, less burdensome or less expensive–R.26(b)(2)(E); and the party seeking discovery has not had sufficient opportunity to obtain the information by discovery or otherwise, taking into account the party’s relative access to the information–R.26(b)(2)(F).

The new rules establish 3 tiers of cases based on the damages pled and set limits for standard discovery for each tier:

 


 
 Tier 
 
 Amount of Damages 
 
 Total Fact Deposition Hours 
 
 Rule 33 Interrogatories including all discrete subparts 
 
 Rule 34 Requests for Production 
 
 Rule 36 Requests for Admission 
 
 Days to Complete Standard Fact Discovery 
 
 1 
 
 $50,000 or less 
 
 3 
 
 0 
 
 5 
 
 5 
 
 120 
 
 2 
 
 More than $50,000 and less than $300,000 or non-monetary relief 
 
 15 
 
 10 
 
 10 
 
 10 
 
 180 
 
 3 
 
 $300,000 or more 
 
 30 
 
 20 
 
 20 
 
 20 
 
 210 
 


To obtain discovery beyond these standard limits, the parties may stipulate or a party may file a motion explaining why the extraordinary discovery is necessary. However, the stipulation or motion must be filed before the close of standard discovery and after reaching the limits of standard discovery. R.26(c).

Finally, the standard discovery and new rules on initial disclosures eliminate the need for case management orders, discovery plans and attorney planning conferences and those requirements have been removed from the rules. R.26(f). 

Plaintiff’s Initial Disclosures are required to be served within 14 days after the service of the first answer to the complaint. The Defendant must serve its Initial Disclosures within 28 days after Plaintiff’s first disclosures or after Defendant’s appearance in the case, whichever is later.

With respect to experts, within 7 days after the close of fact discovery, Plaintiff must disclose: (i) the expert’s curriculum vitae identifying the expert’s qualifications, publications, and prior testimony; (ii) compensation information; (iii) a brief summary of the opinions the expert will offer; and (iv) a complete copy of the expert’s file for the case.

Within 7 days after this disclosure, the party opposing the retained expert may elect either a deposition or a written report from the expert. A deposition is limited to four hours. The report or deposition must be completed within 28 days after the election is made. Designation of Defendant’s experts follows a similar schedule.

This is a brief summary of the changes to the discovery rules in Utah. From a subrogation perspective, the new rules should streamline discovery and move subrogation cases more quickly toward resolution or trial.

 Subrogation vs Contribution--Does it Matter? 
 Posted on January 10, 2012 by Mark Roth 
 Practitioners and judges frequently use the terms subrogation and contribution interchangeably. This is legally incorrect and, as one insurance company recently learned, the distinction between the two concepts can be fatal.

In American States Insurance Company v. National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford 2012 DJDAR 197, an insurance carrier attempted to subrogate against another carrier to recover defense and indemnity costs incurred on behalf of the same insureds. The trial court determined that the action was barred by the two year statute of limitations for equitable contribution. The carrier then attempted an&quot;end run&quot;by amending its complaint to assert a cause of action for equitable subrogation. The Court of Appeal held that the sustaining of a demurrer to the amended complaint on the grounds that the underlying case was one for equitable contribution and, therefore, was time-barred.

The Court of Appeal distinguished equitable contribution from equitable subrogation. It held that equitable contribution is the right to recover not from the party primarily liable for the loss, but rather from a co-obligor who shares liability with the party seeking contribution. Conversely, equitable subrogation is a purely derivative cause of action and may only be asserted against the wrongdoer who caused the loss incurred by the insured.

The moral of the story-it is essential to properly identify whether a case is for equitable contribution or equitable subrogation. The statute of limitations differs for the two causes of action and may time-bar an otherwise properly pled claim!

 Discovery of Confidential Settlement Information 
 Posted on December 20, 2011 by John Reis 
 How airtight is a confidentiality provision in a settlement agreement?   In a recent case out of Florida, the court protected a confidential settlement agreement from disclosure to a remaining party.    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Nicolette Strachan et al. , ___ So. 2d __, 36 Fla. L. Weekly D2262, Case No. 4D11-2539 (Fla. 4 th DCA Oct. 12, 2011). However, is the Wal-Mart decision particular to its facts and jurisdiction?  How do other courts view confidentiality provisions?  As illustrated below, there are three basic approaches to discoverability of confidential settlements. The prevailing approach is a balancing approach, but there are also two opposing bright-line approaches: the“not discoverable”approach (even if relevant) and the“discoverable”approach (if relevant).

 The Wal-Mart Case 

 

The Wal-Mart court hinged on the relevance of the settlement terms. The plaintiffs settled with three out of four defendants, leaving Wal-Mart as the only remaining defendant. Wal-Mart moved to compel production of the amount of the settlement paid by each of the settling defendants. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the Fourth District Court of Appeal agreed with the lower court.  But the reasons for non-disclosure were particular to a quirk of Florida law.  In 2006, the Florida legislature essentially abolished joint and several liability. Therefore, because Wal-Mart would not be responsible for the fault of anyone but itself, the amounts of the settlements could not lead to the discovery of admissible evidence at trial. The opinion does is consistent with the balancing approach of other jurisdictions.

 

 Balancing Approach 

 

The balancing approach weighs the interests of the party seeking disclosure against those of the settling parties, usually siding with the settling parties unless the terms are relevant.    A good example of the balancing approach is Hinshaw, Winkler, Draa, March&amp;Still v. Superior Court (Kauffman) , 51 Cal. App. 4 th 233, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 791 (1996). There, the California Court of Appeal balanced the constitutional right of privacy against the interests of“facilitating ascertainment of trust in connection with legal proceedings.”  

 

The balancing approach will sometimes allow for discovery of the agreement.   For example, l imited discovery of settlement amounts was allowed in the case of New York v. Solvent Chemical Co. , 214 F.R.D. 106 ( W.D.N.Y. 2003). There, a non-settling defendant/third-party plaintiff sought to take the deposition of a third-party defendant corporation still actively a party in the case. The party seeking discovery sought to explore the nature and extent of settlement negotiations. The court held that the amounts of the settlements were indeed relevant and allowed that issue to be explored. However, nothing else about the settlement agreement or the negotiations leading up to it were subject to discovery as they were irrelevant to the case and invaded the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine.

 Fine Art Losses: Details, Details, Details 
 Posted on December 5, 2011 by Stephen M. Halbeisen 
 Fine art losses come in many shapes and sizes. Oftentimes, fine art is a relatively small piece of a homeowner&apos;s or commercial property claim. Occasionally, however, the art represents the vast majority of a claim. You may have heard of the story in 2006 about casino mogul, Steve Wynn, who accidentally poked a hole in his own Picasso painting,&quot;La Reve&quot;, which he had previously agreed to sell to another collector for $139 million. Post-conservation, Wynn decided to keep the painting.

When an item of fine art is damaged, how do you quantify the damage? Art is considered personal property. In most jurisdictions, the amount that may be recovered in a subrogation claim for damage to personal property is market value, which is defined as the price the property would bring if it were offered for sale by a willing but not obligated seller and purchased by a willing but not obligated buyer. If market value cannot be determined or the property is not subject to market valuation, other methods of valuation may be used, such as replacement value, actual or intrinsic value, and sometimes sentimental value.

With a loss that involves damage to fine art, the nature and extent of the damage must be determined. Was the art damaged by fire, smoke, water, or physical impact? Transferring the art to a temperature and humidity controlled environment is essential to mitigate the damage. There, the art can be held for inspection, storage and preservation. Art handlers experienced in removing, crating, transporting and storing fine art should be considered depending on the value of the art in question.

To prove up damages on a fine art loss, the pre-loss market value of the art must be established. Relevant information, such as a description of the work of art, purchase price, photographs, condition reports, provenance (history of ownership), appraisals, etc., should be gathered. Auction sales of an artist&apos;s work may be available through online services such as www.artnet.com and www.askart.com . Market value of art can rise and fall significantly over relatively short periods of time. Relevant factors include economic conditions and the demand for a specific artist&apos;s work. Therefore, it is critical to establish the market value as of the time immediately before the damage occurred. It may be necessary to engage a someone with expertise in the market value of the specific type of art, or the specific artist, involved. Art appraisers are not all alike. Some have little or no experience in marketing or selling the work of a particular artist. Some are private art dealers or work at auction houses like Christie&apos;s or Sotheby&apos;s with expertise in that artist&apos;s work. While sales history and comparable sales are sometimes available, art valuation can be a subjective undertaking. The appraisal expert needs to be someone who is qualified, competent and credible, and someone who has done his or her homework.  

In addition, a determination must be made as to whether conservation efforts can help mitigate or remediate the damage. The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), with over 3,500 members, encompasses groups and individuals that specialize in specific formats and topics, such as paper, electronic media, objects, painting, photographs, textiles, wood, etc. Hiring the right conservator can also greatly mitigate the damage. The more valuable the work of art, the more valuable the selection of conservator. If the work of art is not totally destroyed and can be treated by a conservator, a treatment plan should be established before any conservation work is undertaken. In the best case scenario, the art can be completely restored to its pre-loss condition. More often, however, the damage can be treated only to the extent possible without risking or causing further harm to the artwork. In those cases, the artwork cannot be fully restored, and to a certain extent remains permanently damaged.

Therefore, it will also be necessary to establish the post-conservation market value of the art. This can be particularly challenging because the person or entity that owned the work of art before the loss usually retains ownership of the item after the loss. In those cases, the loss in market value can only be estimated in terms of a percentage loss. For example, if the work of art had a pre-loss market value of $100,000, and the post-conservation market value is 25% less than the pre-loss market value, the provable loss of market value would be $25,000. This may be established by the same expert who establishes the pre-loss market value of the art. If the art is actually sold shortly after conservation is completed, that price will probably be sufficient evidence of post-conservation market value.

Given the highly subjective nature of art and price volatility in the art market, paying attention to the damages aspects of fine arts losses will pay dividends with respect to your first-party exposure, and it will significantly improve your ability to maximize your subrogation recoveries.

 When is an Expert Report a Draft and When is it a Report? That is the Question. 
 Posted on November 28, 2011 by Jake Skaggs 
When to draft an expert report is an area of disagreement amongst subrogation professionals, attorneys and experts. Typically the attorney will request that an expert wait to draft a report until discovery is complete and the deadline to designate testifying experts is on the horizon. Conversely, most adjusters ask for a report as soon as possible in order to finalize the claim. Luckily, the recent changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure helps both the subrogation professional and adjuster achieve their goals. 

In 2011, Rule 26(b)(4) (expert disclosures) was amended to“protect drafts of any report or disclosure required under Rule 26(a)(2), regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.”Originally, drafts of an expert’s report were discoverable when the testifying expert was disclosed. The expert had one chance to draft a complete report. Any changes to the report that were suggested by counsel, however mundane, subjected the expert to a scathing cross-examination and an inference that the lawyer was telling the expert what to say. Now, all drafts are protected from disclosure by the work-product privilege. This permits the lawyer to work with the expert to craft a thorough report and avoid incomplete or lazy report writing that may provide opposing counsel the necessary ammunition to damage a case.

But the question is--what is a draft and what is a final report? Because the rule was only recently amended, the case law interpreting the rule has not yet developed. The only decision thus far is out of the Western District of Louisiana. Magistrate Judge Mark Hornsby denied the plaintiff’s request for a report that was drafted 5 months before counsel was retained and the lawsuit was filed. See Greenwood 950, LLC v. Chesapeake Louisiana , LP 2011 WL 1234735 (W.D. La). The opinion is unpublished and carries no precedential value, however, it may provide guidance to other district judges and magistrates that are confronted with this issue.

The Advisory Committee to the rule amendment noted that the work-product privilege was extended to draft reports because unlimited access to expert discovery has“had undesirable effects.” 2010 Notes of Advisory Committee ¶2. The Advisory Committee specifically noted that the changes to the rule were due to rising costs under the old rule and the old rule hindered the free exchange of information between the attorney and expert. Id. The notes from the Advisory Committee imply that the rule should be interpreted broadly. A court will likely consider whether the report was drafted in anticipation of litigation and when counsel was retained. Determining what is a draft report and what is a final report is yet to be settled, but we will be closely monitoring any new developments.

 Prescribed Burns: The Importance of Determining Your State&apos;s Approach to Liability 
 Posted on November 21, 2011 by Jason S. Schulze 
 Over the last several years, the insurance industry has experienced significant losses due to wildfires. In many instances, the wildfires resulted from the carelessness of a camper, or the criminal conduct of an arsonist. Wildfires have also been caused by damaged power lines, or fallen utility poles.

One other potential cause of large-scale wildfires involves situations where containment of a&quot;prescribed&quot;or&quot;controlled&quot;burn is lost. Although the terms are generally used interchangeably, prescribed and controlled burns are actually different. A prescribed burn is a fire set under specific weather conditions and with sufficient personnel and suppression equipment to achieve certain land management objectives. When utilized properly, a prescribed burn can enrich soil by adding nutrients and making the plant community healthy again. Conversely, a controlled burn is a fire set without specified weather conditions or vegetation management objectives. Common examples of controlled burns include burning brush piles or large quantities of trash.

Because of the inherent risk of either type of burn escaping, most states have enacted statutes governing liability for damages caused by an escaped fire. Many of the statutes actually recognize the importance of prescribed fires for wildfire risk mitigation, and provide specific instructions for ensuring that the burn is completed in a safe manner. Many of the statutes also have detailed procedures for notifying neighbors, applicable state agencies and local fire authorities before a burn is conducted.

In general, most states with prescribed burn statutes generally fall into one of two categories: those which follow the negligence rule, or those which adhere to a strict liability approach. For those states adhering to the negligence rule (and the vast majority do), it is necessary to show that the individual conducting the burn was negligent or failed to exercise the requisite degree of care to impose liability. Typical examples of acts and omissions that may constitute negligence include failing to properly utilize fireguards or barriers during the burn, attempting to burn at inopportune times, or failing to develop and follow a prescribed burn management plan (&quot;PBMP&quot;). 

Only four states (Connecticut, North Dakota, New Hampshire and Oklahoma) adhere to a strict-liability approach for prescribed burns. In general, those states impose liability on the landowner and/or individual responsible for the burn for damage from an escaped fire regardless of his or her efforts to safely implement or control the burn. For example, the prescribed burn statute in Oklahoma specifically imposes liability on the landowner who owns the land where the fire originated for actual damages sustained by third-parties. Essentially, if a fire escapes, negligence is assumed and the only remaining issue to determine is the amount of actual damages sustained by third-parties. Interestingly, research has shown that the frequency of escaped prescribed fires tends to be lower in those states with more stringent prescribed burn statutes.

If confronted with damages caused by a prescribed burn, it is essential to determine whether the state where the burn occurred has a specific prescribed fire law. When reviewing the statute, particular notice should be paid to whether notification requirements and/or prescribed burn procedures were followed. It should also be determined whether the state follows the negligence rule or adheres to a strict-liability approach. For those states that adhere to the strict liability approach, there will typically be statutory language

 Certificate of Merit Requirement in Federal Diversity Cases 
 Posted on November 17, 2011 by David Fisk 
In a recent opinion filed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Liggon-Redding v. Sugarman , the Third Circuit decided that Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1042.3, requiring the filing of a certificate of merit in malpractice cases, is substantive law that federal courts must apply under Erie v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64 (1938). Prior to the Third Circuit’s decision, several federal district courts had held that Rule 1042.3 is a substantive rule of law that applies in professional liability actions proceeding in federal court. The Third Circuit has now conclusively decided this issue in Pennsylvania. 

Although the Third Circuit’s opinion involved a legal malpractice case against an attorney, Rule 1042.3 applies to claims against any licensed professional, including architects and engineers. Several other states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas, have enacted similar laws that require a plaintiff to file a certificate or affidavit from a third-party design professional declaring that the plaintiff’s claim against an architect or engineer has merit. The general purpose of such laws is to provide a basis for the trial court to conclude that the plaintiff’s claims have merit and to prevent needless waste of judicial time and resources which would otherwise be spent on claims that have no material basis or justification in fact or in law.

Malpractice or negligence claims against architects and engineers that seek recovery for property damages caused by design defects can be brought in or removed to federal court if there is diversity of citizenship between the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Erie v. Tompkins , a federal court sitting in diversity must apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. Since certificate of merit laws have been enacted by states, federal courts must determine whether a certificate of merit law is substantive or procedural. As noted above, the Third Circuit recently concluded that Pennsylvania’s certificate of merit law is substantive state law. Therefore, a plaintiff must comply with Pennsylvania’s certificate of merit law when filing a lawsuit against an architect or engineer in a federal district court in Pennsylvania.

Not all certificate of merit laws are written the same and the filing requirements, including the deadline to file the certificate, may vary depending on the state, so not all of the Third Circuit’s reasoning in Liggon-Redding v. Sugarman will be applicable in other states. Prior to this most recent opinion, the Third Circuit had previously determined that the New Jersey certificate of merit law is substantive state law that plaintiffs in diversity cases must comply with. On the other hand, federal district courts in Georgia have found that Georgia’s certificate of merit law is not applicable to actions filed in federal court, but the Eleventh Circuit has declined to decide the issue. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has not determined whether Texas’certificate of merit law is substantive or procedural, but at least one federal district court has determined that it is a procedural rule that does not apply in a federal diversity case, while other courts have assumed, without examination or explanation, that Texas’certificate of merit law applies in a federal diversity case.

When faced with a claim for property damage caused by a design defect, it is important to determine whether state law requires a certificate of merit when filing a lawsuit against a design professional. If you intend to pursue the claim in federal court, the prudent practice is to retain a third-party design professional to review the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss and comply with the requirements of the applicable certificate of merit law.

 Crane Collapse Investigation - Recovering From the Tipping Point 
 Posted on November 14, 2011 by James D. Dendinger 
 A mobile crane collapse can cause devastating results in terms of production, property damage and personal injury. Despite the potential for significant costs, a mobile crane collapse can provide recovery opportunities depending upon the circumstances of the accident. The following is a summary of things to do and issues to consider to maximize your recovery potential for a crane collapse claim.

 1. Secure the Scene
 As with most subrogation investigations, maintaining the accident scene in its post-loss condition until the scene can be properly documented and photographed is critical. Experts need to examine the condition and location of the cranes after the accident, the site conditions and load configurations as they existed at the time of the accident.

 2. Locate the Witnesses-Obtain Statements 
As soon as possible after the accidents, identify and locate all of the witnesses who may have knowledge regarding the activities taking place at the time of the collapse. Construction workers are notorious for being transient if they don’t have any ties to the community. Critical witnesses may disappear shortly after the accident occurs. As soon as possible, obtain detailed recorded or written statements from all witnesses who may have relevant knowledge regarding the activities taking place at the time of the accident while memories are fresh. Be prepared to provide a qualified interpreter. Avoid using the witness’s supervisor as an interpreter if possible. 

 3. Establish Relationships and Responsibilities
 The use of a mobile crane on a construction site involves significant coordination between the crane owner, crane operator, crane user and lift director. Establish these relationships as soon as possible. Determine whether the crane owner is providing the crane as a service to the user or renting the crane to the user. Determine whether the crane operator is an employee of the crane owner or crane user. Obtain copies of the relevant contracts to determine whether the user was required to insure the crane and whether the contract contains a waiver of subrogation between the crane owner and crane user. Determine whether the crane operator was properly trained and certified on the type of crane involved in the accident. Also identify the lift director and site supervisor. The duties, responsibilities and qualifications for crane operators, site supervisors and lift directors are discussed in ASME B30.5, Mobile and Locomotive Cranes.

 4. Examine the Lift Plan–Was This a Critical Lift?
 The most frequent causes of crane accidents include instability caused by overloading, operating the crane on a site that is too soft or not level and a lack of communication between the crane operator, signalman and lift director. All of these causes can be attributed to improper planning or not adhering to a properly prepared lift plan.

 Super-Recoveries 
 Posted on October 18, 2011 by Kevin Caraher 
 There is a common misperception that a subrogee may never recover more than the amount of its subrogation interest. While it can be challenging to even make a 100% recovery, sometimes there are opportunities available to make a super-recovery–one in excess of the subrogation interest. 

The simplest way to recover more than the amount of the verdict is to seek taxable costs such as filing fees, witness fees, transcription fees, and expert preparation and testimony expenses. Whether, and which, costs are taxable vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but taxable costs are usually fairly limited and will not include all litigation expenses.

 

A number of jurisdictions allow for statutory pre-judgment interest on the amount of the judgment. Historically, recoverable pre-judgment interest has been as large as 12% per annum ( e.g ., Florida), but it is much more modest in this economy. Since the discovery process often takes several years before proceeding to trial, a pre-judgment interest award can be a very significant percentage of the gross recovery.

 

In cases in which there are multiple defendants, consider settling with one or more, but less than all, of the defendants. In some jurisdictions ( i.e ., Minnesota), by doing so, the plaintiff“assumes the fault”of the settling defendants and is limited to recovering at trial from the non-settling defendants no more than their own percentage of the damages as allocated by the jury. However, if the amount of the partial settlement exceeds the settling defendants’share of the damages allocated to them at trial, the plaintiff may recover more than its subrogation interest even before consideration of pre-judgment interest and taxable costs. While this methodology is not without risks and requires a keen understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the case, we recently used this strategy to obtain a 120% recovery of a client’s subrogation interest.

 Illinois Court Expands Reach of Implied Coinsured Doctrine 
 Posted on October 12, 2011 by Marisa L. Saber 
 An Illinois Appellate Court recently issued an opinion which may make subrogating against a negligent tenant more challenging.  Auto Owners Ins. Company a/s/o John Ellis v. Thomas Callaghan , 952 N.E.2d 119 (Ill.App.3d 2011) involved a landlord’s carrier that sued a tenant who was leasing a house. The plaintiff insurer alleged that the tenant was negligent in starting a fire that caused over $250,000 in damages to the house. The tenant filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit based on Illinois’implied coinsured doctrine. The trial court granted the tenant’s motion and the Third District Appellate Court affirmed. 

 The Court’s decision was based on its interpretation of the seminal case outlining the implied coinsured rule in Illinois, Dix Mutual Ins. Co. v. LaFramboise , 597 N.E.2d 622 (Ill. 1992). This Illinois Supreme Court case set forth the rule regarding tenant liability:“although a tenant is generally liable for the fire damage caused by his negligence, if the parties intended to exculpate the tenant from negligently caused fire damage, their intent will be enforced.” Because the language can vary, the courts were to interpret the lease“as a whole so as to give effect to the intent of the parties.” The Dix court ruled that the Defendant in that case was afforded implied coinsured status. A key factor in the decision was a provision in the lease requiring the landlord to maintain property insurance, which the court construed as the parties’intent that property insurance would cover losses to the property. The court held that the tenant’s rent payments contributed to the premium for the property insurance, making the tenant an implied coinsured. Further, in the Dix lease, there was no provision making the tenant responsible for damages that he caused. 

 

 The lease in Auto Owners contained no provision regarding insurance. It did contain a provision stating that the tenant’s security deposit would pay for any damages that the tenant, their guests or invitees may inflict upon the dwelling unit, and that the tenant’s liability is not limited to the amount of the security deposit. Despite these differences, the Auto Owners court ruled that there was no provision in the lease that imposed liability upon the tenant for fire damage. The court further found that by the tenant’s payment of rent, he obtained the status of a coinsured under the landlord’s policy, and could not be sued for fire damage by the landlord or its insurer. The Auto Owners court distorted the rule in Dix . Instead of applying the rule that the tenant is liable unless the lease demonstrates intent to exculpate the tenant from liability, Auto Owners suggests that the rule is that the lease provision needs to place liability on a tenant. Further, even though there was no mention of insurance in the Auto Owners lease, the holding suggests that the tenant can be considered an implied coinsured if the landlord has property insurance. 

 

 It is still viable for a landlord’s insurer to pursue a tenant in subrogation in Illinois. However, Auto Owners may signal a trend that certain additional factors will need to be demonstrated to subrogate against a negligent tenant.

 Recovering the Cost of Code Upgrades 
 Posted on October 3, 2011 by Bill Clark 
 A substantial body of law has emerged supporting the position that a plaintiff is entitled to recover the cost of conforming to updated building codes in repairing property damaged by a defendant&apos;s negligence. Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin all have authority affirming the recovery of code upgrade costs. The costs of code-compliance are recoverable because:

 (1) including such costs allows property owners to be placed in the position they occupied before the loss, by restoring the building to a condition in which it can be re-occupied; 

 (2) the upgrade expenses would not have been incurred but for the defendant’s negligence; and 

 (3) any other outcome would penalize property owners for the tortfeasor&apos;s negligence. 

A minority of jurisdictions refuses to include expenditures for code upgrades in the cost of repairs. (West Virginia, Mississippi and Colorado) As such, recovery of such costs as repair damages would unduly and unjustifiably enrich the plaintiff and require the defendant to pay a sum greater than that resulting proximately from his negligence.

In jurisdictions that have not yet addressed the issue, a strong argument can be made for following the path taken by the majority. That argument proceeds as follows. Either the defendant or plaintiff must bear the cost of code upgrades. That is, either a defendant will be forced to pay for more damage than it actually caused, or a plaintiff will not receive compensation that fully restores the use of its property. As such, one party will be treated somewhat inequitably. It seems more appropriate, however, for the defendant to bear that cost. The &apos;but for&apos; rationale is critical in this regard. If not for the defendant&apos;s negligence, the plaintiff&apos;s code upgrade costs would not have been incurred. As such, equity seems to favor the party necessitating the costs bearing those costs. A plaintiff should not be penalized, by having to bear the code upgrade costs, for a defendant&apos;s negligence. 

Including code upgrade costs in a plaintiff&apos;s damage award is generally consistent with the underlying purpose of assigning an award sufficient to compensate the plaintiff. If the cost of code upgrades is not included in a plaintiff&apos;s damage award, the plaintiff is not made whole without additional expenditure of its own funds. That is, the plaintiff is unable to return its property to its pre-injury use without the code upgrades. If the plaintiff is denied the code upgrade expenses, the plaintiff is denied completely-restored use of its property, and it has not been fully compensated for its injury.

In response, a defendant seemingly would argue allowing recovery of the cost of code upgrades provides the plaintiff with a windfall. Were a plaintiff to attempt to prove its damages, including the cost of code upgrades, using the repair measure, the defendant&apos;s most effective response would be to use the difference in fair market value measure to demonstrate the plaintiff&apos;s damages were actually of a lesser amount. Additionally, if including code upgrades drives the cost of repairs above the property&apos;s pre-injury market value, a defendant could assert a plaintiff&apos;s recovery may not exceed the value of its property prior to the injury. A defendant making these arguments, supported by the Colorado, Mississippi, and West Virginia decisions, would argue the policy of fashioning equitable damage awards requires the defendant pay for no more than the damages directly caused by its negligence.

As such, in jurisdictions where the issue has not yet been addressed, arguments can be made both for and against allowing a plaintiff to recover the cost of code upgrades in its damages. A majority of the jurisdictions to have addressed the issue allow recovery of such costs. Additionally, allowing recovery of code upgrade costs is consistent with the general principles underlying damages jurisprudence. Accordingly, the argument that such recovery should be permitted seems one worth making.

 What happened to my fire scene? 
 Posted on September 27, 2011 by Daniel J. Luccaro 
A call comes in regarding a new large fire loss. Based on the preliminary information from the insured, it sounds like there may be subrogation potential. The adjuster promptly retains a cause and origin investigator to go to the scene. However, the cause and origin investigator shows up only to find that an overzealous restoration or cleaning company has already gutted the scene and ruined any opportunity to determine the cause of the fire. 

This is a scenario that many property adjusters may be all too familiar with. I often get calls from clients inquiring whether there is any potential claim against the restoration company under this scenario. Unfortunately, in most instances, there is no recourse against the restoration company. In recent years, a number of jurisdictions have considered the issue of whether there is an independent cause of action against a third party for evidence spoliation. The vast majority of jurisdictions to consider the issue have refused to recognize such a cause of action. Those jurisdictions have taken the position that the only remedy against a spoliating party are the sanctions available against that party in litigation for the underlying claim. This remedy is obviously of no help when the spoliating party is a restoration company who has no potential liability for causing the fire.

Even if the loss occurs in one of the handful of jurisdictions that have recognized an independent cause of action for spoliation, it is still very difficult to maintain such a cause of action. First, you have to establish that the spoliating party was a aware of potential litigation and had a duty to preserve evidence. Most jurisdictions recognizing this cause of action require that the destruction of evidence be intentional and be done for the express purpose of depriving another party of its use and it is not sufficient to show the party negligently disposed of the evidence. In most circumstances, it would be difficult to establish this against a restoration company that cleans up a fire scene.

 Even if you can establish that the party has intentionally spoliated evidence, you still need to prove the damage aspect. To prove damages, you need to establish that the spoliation prevented you for proving the underlying claim and that but for the spoliation you would have been able to prevail on the underlying claim. However, if the restoration company cleans up the entire fire scene before you can even investigate, in almost all instances, it would be impossible to prove that but for the clean up, you could have prevailed on a subrogation claim against some other party. As a result, in most cases you will not have any legal recourse against a restoration company who cleans up a fire scene before you can investigate. The situation may be different if there is an express contractual agreement with the restoration company to preserve evidence and they fail to do so.

Given that there is likely no legal recourse against restoration companies for cleaning up a fire scene too soon, carriers need to educate everyone involved in the claims process to try to make sure it does not occur. Carriers should make sure that restoration companies they use frequently are aware that they should not do any cleanup until specifically authorized to do so. More importantly, carriers need to let insureds, agents and public adjusters know as soon as a claim is reported that the scene needs to be preserved for investigation and they are not permitted to let emergency services contactors clean up the scene until the carrier authorizes it.

 Holding Electric Utilities Responsible for Negligent Underground Installation Work 
 Posted on September 19, 2011 by Sean O&apos;Donnell 
After indignantly waving their tariff in your face, electric utilities are quick to claim&quot;lack of notice&quot;when confronted with claims alleging that an electrical malfunction in the utility&apos;s wiring and equipment caused a fire at your insured&apos;s property. Many times, this defense deters further recovery efforts. But a thorough investigation of the utility&apos;s pre-loss knowledge, likely only possible through litigation, may provide you with a viable subrogation claim. 

For example, your electrical expert tells you that the fire at your insured&apos;s property was caused by an electrical surge into the electric meter located on the exterior of your insured&apos;s house. The surge, in turn, resulted from shorting and electrical activity in the underground distribution bus buried beneath a box outside the property. Your expert also determines that the arcing and electrical activity at the bus probably resulted from settlement, which may have been caused by improperly compacted soil.

The utility claims it had no notice of any problems with the electrical service, settlement, or the compaction of the soil and consequently, no reason or duty to inspect its underground equipment before the fire. Moreover, the utility claims, it sub contracted the electrical service installation work and the developer was responsible for compacting the soil.

You can ask the utility for its internal records concerning service calls for any property serviced by the underground equipment, for records regarding the installation work, and for records regarding the utility&apos;s knowledge of problems with settlement at this development, and possibly studies in the utility&apos;s possession regarding the effects of settlement and their equipment&apos;s ability to withstand anticipated ground settlement. Of course, the utility is not going to voluntarily provide you with any information. So the reality is, if you have a good expert and the case is sufficiently large, it may be in your best interest to file suit to obtain the information and the utility&apos;s internal documents you need to support your claims, or to confirm that there is no basis for a claim against the utility.

 So, just how much do you earn, anyway? 
 Posted on August 26, 2011 by Vincent McGuinness 
 Lawyers deposing experts often delve into matters pertaining to the witnesses&apos; compensation. Indeed, FRCP 26(a)(2)(B)(vi) contemplates that an expert&apos;s report must contain&quot;a statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the case&quot;. However, at what point will questions probing the amount of income that an expert earns be considered intrusive and not relevant? While the federal courts often allow litigants liberal discovery of expert credentials, most courts now limit the scope of the inquiry when litigants overreach to learn details about the extent of an experts&apos; earnings outside the matter where he/she is testifying. In Young v. Pleasant Valley School , No. 3:07-CV-854 (M.D.Pa. Aug. 18, 2011), Chief Judge Yvette Kane ruled that absent a showing of relevance or necessity, the request of annual income information from an expert is&quot;overkill&quot;and not discoverable. Id . at 4. Plaintiffs filed this civil rights action based on claims that the minor plaintiff&apos;s high school teacher promoted a hostile classroom environment by showing explicit photos and directing student to read sexually graphic books. The defense retained Dr. Edward Dragan from the Educational Management Consulting firm to opine that the school district acted appropriately in reviewing the allegations, disciplining the teacher and monitoring the class to make certain potentially offensive materials were removed. Dr. Dragan was presented for a videotape deposition and during a voir dire of his credentials was asked:&quot;How much income did you achieve in the last year on . . .providing expert testimony, what&apos;s your income?&quot; Id . at 1. Dr. Dragan refused to answer, and claimed the information was personal. Id . at 2. On the eve of trial, the plaintiff&apos;s sought to exclude his testimony as a sanction contending that the plaintiffs have a right to all information showing the expert&apos;s bias and interest.

The court disagreed noting that this broad question was needlessly intrusive and lacked relevance. Chief Judge Kane noted that pertinent compensation information was previously disclosed, including the amount of Dr. Dragan&apos;s compensation for testifying in the matter, the cases in which Dr. Dragan testified over a seven year period, and the allocation of matters for which he testified on behalf of a plaintiff or defendant. The court referenced a line of cases from district courts in Maryland, Tennessee, California and Indiana holding that income an expert earns is not discoverable absent a showing that other information furnished is insufficient or that the financial information is otherwise probative.

As a practice tip, there may be instances where the amount of income of an expert may be discoverable. One such instance may be where an expert testifies exclusively on behalf of a plaintiff or defendant. In Young , Chief Judge Kane commented that Dr. Dragan testified equally on behalf of plaintiffs and defendants, so there was no showing that he had an economic incentive to show a bias toward either party in any particular case. If a party can show that an expert depends upon one party to earn his income, there may be grounds to seek discovery of an expert&apos;s income. Similarly, discovery may be permitted if there a showing that an expert has become a&quot;professional witness&quot;, demonstrated by a&quot;significant pattern of compensation that would support a reasonable inference that the witness might color, shade, or slant his testimony in light of the substantial financial incentives&quot; Cooper v. Schoffstall , 588 PA 505, 905 A.2d. 482, 495 9PA 2006). However, even with a proper showing, the court may still require a showing of why less intrusive financial information would not suffice to demonstrate the bias of a witness. Behler v. Hanlon , 199 FRD 533, 561-62 (D.Md. 2001).

 Failure To Warn: Read The Fine Print 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by Leslie Hulburt 
 When someone is injured or property is destroyed because a manufacturer did not warn about known dangers you may think your case is a slam dunk. But before you start your victory dance, make sure you can prove that the warning would have been read. Recently, the California Court of Appeal for the Fifth District overturned a jury verdict in excess of $12 million because the plaintiffs did not prove that the failure to warn caused their injuries.   Huitt v. Southern California Gas Company (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1586.  In Huitt, two plumbers were injured in a gas explosion due to a phenomenon called&quot;odor fade&quot;whereby the odorant added to natural gas was absorbed into new piping. Without the odorant the plumbers were unaware of the presence of natural gas. The plaintiffs argued that the gas company had a duty to warn that new pipes absorb the odorant. 

The appellate court found that even if the gas company had issued a warning, there was no evidence that the plumbers would have become aware of the warning. The court distinguished this case from those dealing with products such as cigarettes, where a warning can be placed directly on the product. In contrast, natural gas cannot be seen and has no packaging. The court found that the plaintiffs did not prove how the gas company could have delivered an effective warning. Examples offered at trial were a notice included in the customers&apos; bill or a posting on the company website. However, in these hypotheticals there is no evidence that the plumbers would have received the warnings.  The court reasoned that even if there had been a warning there is no evidence that the accident would have been avoided. Therefore, it does not make sense that a lack of warning caused the plaintiffs&apos; injuries. The court ultimately held that recovery was precluded because the plaintiffs failed to establish that a timely warning issued by the gas company would have prevented the accident. 

In conclusion, it is not enough to prove that the manufacturer knew of a dangerous condition and did not warn of it. A plaintiff must also prove that the lack of warning actually caused the harm .

 Ninth Circuit Holds Loss of Use Damages and Surveyor&apos;s Fees Recoverable in Maritime Subrogation Case 
 Posted on June 30, 2011 by Kyle Farnam 
A recent 9th Circuit Court of Appeals case included favorable holdings for subrogating carriers on the types of damages recoverable in maritime cases. The case, Oswalt v. Resolute Industries, Inc ., 2:08-cv-01600-MJP (June 16, 2011), stemmed from a fire on a vessel that originated at a heater that was being repaired by Resolute Industries. The vessel owner and its subrogating carrier sued Resolute, who in turn filed a third party complaint against the heater manufacturer, Webasto Products. On appeal, the 9th Circuit upheld a jury verdict against Resolute for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance, and likewise reversed summary judgment dismissal of Resolute’s product liability claim against Webasto. 

Perhaps the most notable aspect of the Oswalt decision, however, was the Court’s treatment of the plaintiffs’damages claims. First, the owner claimed that since he could not continue to use his vessel as a second home when he traveled to Oakland while working as a flight attendant, that he was entitled to loss of use damages (i.e. hotel costs). Although Resolute cited longstanding case law holding that loss of use damages were not recoverable for“pleasure crafts,”the Court rejected this argument, stating that the owner was not claiming lost“recreational”use, and that subject hotel costs were“both business-related and entirely nonspeculative.”Secondly, the subrogating carrier claimed that it was entitled to reimbursement of the cost of the marine surveyor it hired following the fire. The Court held that even though the insured did not participate in hiring the surveyor, and even though this cost was not on the subrogation receipt, that the subrogating carrier was still entitled to recover this aspect of its damages.

In summary, the 9th Circuit allowed the plaintiffs to recover their claims for loss of use and the surveyor’s fees stemming from the vessel fire. The damages holdings of the Oswalt case offer a reminder that subrogating carriers may be able to successfully recover diverse types of damages in the maritime context.

 Finding of Bad Faith Not Required in Arkansas for a Jury Instruction on Spoliation 
 Posted on June 6, 2011 by John R. Slattery 
 On May 26, 2011, the Supreme Court of Arkansas delivered an opinion on spoliation in a case that may be of interest to subrogation professionals. The Court clarified the law of spoliation in Arkansas and held that a finding of bad faith is not required for a spoliator to receive an adverse jury instruction.

The case involved a fire that occurred in the office space of the subrogating carrier’s insured. A painting contractor left a halogen light on in an area where lacquer had recently been applied to wall paneling. The fire investigators retained by the subrogating carrier determined that the fire was caused by the ignition of either vapors from the lacquer or the wood paneling by the heat from the halogen lamp. The halogen lamp and a receptacle were initially retained by the experts for future examination. Seven months after the loss, however, the evidence was discarded, which had been authorized by the carrier.

The contractor’s motion to dismiss the case on the basis of the carrier’s destruction of the evidence was denied, but the trial court granted the request for an adverse jury instruction on spoliation. Arkansas Model Instruction 106 was read to the jury at the conclusion of the evidence:

 &quot;If you find that a party intentionally destroyed the halogen light and electrical receptacles with knowledge that they might be material to a potential claim, you may draw the inference that an examination of them would have been unfavorable to plaintiff’s claim. When I use the term material, I mean evidence that would be a substantial factor in evaluating the merit of a claim or defense in this case.&quot; 

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the painting contractor.

On appeal, the subrogating carrier argued that the spoliation instruction was improper because there was no finding of bad faith. The carrier relied on a federal appellate court (applying Arkansas law) that previously held that a finding of“an intent to destroy the evidence for the purpose of obstructing or suppressing the truth is required.” Stevenson v. Union Pacific R.R. Co ., 354 F.3d 739, 747 (8th Cir. 2004). In declining to adopt the Eighth Circuit’s standard, the Arkansas Supreme Court held that“a circuit court is not required to make a specific finding of bad faith on the part of the spoliator prior to instructing the jury with AMI 106.”

This decision underscores the importance of having safeguards in place to ensure that evidence is not prematurely discarded. Until all potential avenues for a recovery are explored and foreclosed, a carrier should err on the side of keeping evidence that supports the claims and defenses of a case. If evidence is discarded, regardless of the motive, an adverse jury instruction can strike a damaging blow to a subrogation case. As the carrier learned here, what had been a promising $300,000 negligence claim against the painting contractor ended up being tossed in the dumpster along with the evidence.

 North Carolina Revisiting Contributory Negligence 
 Posted on May 31, 2011 by Svend H. Deal 
 In the United States, there are only 6 jurisdictions that continue to bar recovery for a plaintiff if their own negligence contributed in any way to the cause of their injuries- Virginia, Maryland, South Dakota, Alabama, the District of Columbia and North Carolina. (South Dakota does allow recovery where the plaintiff’s negligence is slight in comparison to the negligence of the tortfeasor.) While it is clear that the theory of contributory negligence is a dinosaur among legal doctrines, those jurisdictions that continue to follow it have shown little signs of giving it up- until now.

 North Carolina House Bill 732 , known as the Tort Reform Act of 2011, is currently under consideration in the North Carolina legislature. If it is passed, House Bill 732 could impact recoveries both in and out of North Carolina in a number of ways.

First, House Bill 732 would abolish contributory negligence in favor of a modified comparative negligence scheme. A“pure”comparative negligence scheme allows a plaintiff to recover that amount of damages that are attributable to the torfeasor regardless of any proportion of the plaintiff’s own negligence in causing their injuries. Under the modified scheme currently proposed in the bill, a plaintiff would be able to recover damages for injuries as long as the plaintiff’s own negligence was not equal to or greater than the combined responsibility of all other parties and released persons determined to have caused the injury. For subrogation purposes, this means that as long as your insured’s actions constitute less than half of the negligence leading to the injuries, you can recover the proportion of total damages caused by the tortfeasor(s).

Second, House Bill 732 would abolish sovereign immunity for governmental entities. Sovereign immunity currently bars most actions against state agencies and their employees from suit as long as the agency was performing a governmental function (police, fire, etc.). The Bill would limit the damages that are recoverable and would also make the Industrial Commission the forum of first impression for cases of negligence against the State, but this portion of the bill could potentially open up formerly unavailable avenues of recovery against governmental agencies.

Finally, as noted, these few hold-out jurisdictions have shown little inclination in the recent past to change their stance on contributory negligence. If North Carolina breaks ranks, it is possible that other jurisdictions will be spurred to follow suit. If so, large metropolitan areas like Baltimore, Richmond and Washington D.C. may soon be more fertile than ever for future recovery.

 Fourth Circuit Clarifies Removal Process 
 Posted on May 27, 2011 by Michael A. Durr 
 The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently clarified its interpretation of the procedure for removing a case to federal court in Barbour v. International Union , No. 08-1740, 2011 WL 242131 (4th Cir. Jan. 27, 2011). Courts strictly construe the removal statutes, 28 U.S.C.§§1441 and 1446, to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts. Doubts about the propriety of removal are resolved in favor of remanding the case to state court. Dixon v. Coburg Dairy, Inc ., 369 F.3d 811, 816 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc). Therefore, a defendant’s failure to comply with the statutes’requirements—and the relevant jurisdiction’s interpretation of those statutes—can defeat removal on technical grounds and keep the case in state court.

Section 1446 requires a defendant to remove a case within 30 days of being served with the complaint. When there is only one defendant this procedure is straightforward: when there is more than one, the situation is more complicated. Courts have universally applied the“rule of unanimity,”which requires all defendants in an action to formally“join in or consent to the notice of removal, otherwise the removal is defective.” See Getty Oil, Div. of Texaco, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of North Am ., 841 F.2d 1254, 1262 (5th Cir. 1998). Some courts have recognized exceptions to this rule where (1) the non-joining defendant has not been served; (2) the non-joining defendant is merely a nominal or formal party; or (3) the removed claim is independent. Parker v. Johnny Tart Enterprises, Inc. , 104 F. Supp. 2d 581, 584 (M.D. N.C. 1999).

The Fourth Circuit recently confirmed its long-standing position, which differs from every other Circuit that has addressed the issue, that the consent or joinder in the removal be simultaneous. In 1992, the Fourth Circuit articulated the“ McKinney Intermediate Rule”in a footnote, which provided that“where B is served more than 30 days after A is served, . . . if A petitions for removal within 30 days, the case may be removed, and B can either join in the petition or move for remand, [but] . . . if A does not petition for removal within 30 days, the case may not be removed.” McKinney v. Board of Trustees of Maryland Comm. College , 955 F.2d 924, 926 n.3 (4th Cir. 1992).

The McKinney rule varies markedly from the rules applied in other Circuits. The Fifth Circuit maintains the“First-Served Defendant Rule,”whereby the removal notice must be filed within 30 days of the first defendant receiving service, and all then-served defendants must join in that filing in order for it to be effective, even if they were served with the complaint the day before the 30-day window expired. The Sixth, Eighth, Ninth (as of this January) and Eleventh Circuits follow the“Last-Served Defendant Rule,”which allows any defendant to file a notice of removal within 30 days of being served. Under this interpretation, even if the earlier-served defendants chose not to seek removal within 30 days of service, a later-served defendant can try to persuade them to join its removal petition.

 California Fire Fighting Immunity Remains Strong but Not Without Exception 
 Posted on May 2, 2011 by Nicholas J. Neidzwski 
 How far does California&apos;s grant of immunity for the tortious acts of firefighters extend, and specifically, when can a fire department be liable for the negligent operation of its fire engine? The California Court of Appeal in Varshock v. Cal. Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection (2011) D057709 attempted to answer these questions in a case arising out of the 2007 San Diego County wildfires. Thomas Varshock lived with his wife, Dianne, and their son, Richard, within an area consumed by one of the 2007 wildfires. As the fire approached and burned the Varshock&apos;s property, the family evacuated and found a group of firefighters in the nearby area to whom they pled with to save their home. The firefighters agreed, drove to the Varshock&apos;s property with Thomas and Richard aboard, and attempted without success to put out the blaze, which at this point consumed the Varshock&apos;s residence. Realizing that the fire was uncontrollable, the fire captain told his crew, along with Thomas and Richard, to retreat into the fire engine. Tragically, when attempting to drive the fire engine away from the blaze, winds blew flames across the fire engine causing its engine to die and subjecting the vehicle to intense heat and smoke. Thomas died as a result, and Richard along with the other firefighters suffered severe burns.

 The Varshock family sued the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (&quot;CAL-FIRE&quot;) based primarily upon the alleged negligence of the fire captain in his decisions to (1) drive the fire engine to the Varshock&apos;s property with Thomas and Richard aboard without first verifying if there was an adequate escape route; (2) drive the fire engine into a location that had poor access and inadequate space to turn around; and (3) park the fire engine too close to the fire itself. CAL-FIRE moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was entitled to immunity under Government Code section 850.4, which the Varshocks argued did not apply to the case due to a particular exception established under Vehicle Code section 17001.

Government Code§850.4 provides the following grant of immunity:&quot;Neither a public entity, nor a public employee acting in the scope of his employment, is liable for any injury resulting from the condition of fire protection or firefighting equipment or facilities or, except as provided in Article I (commencing with Section 17000) of Chapter 1 of Division 9 of the Vehicle Code, for any injury caused in fighting fires.&quot;Among the statutory exceptions referred to in section 850.4 is Vehicle Code section 17001:&quot;A public entity is liable for death or injury to person or property proximately caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of any motor vehicle by an employee of the public entity acting within the scope of his employment .&quot;

 Subrogation in Louisiana: Differences and Opportunities 
 Posted on April 26, 2011 by Jake Skaggs 
Louisiana. Home of the Big Easy, Mardi Gras and drive-thru daiquiri bars. Louisiana is also home to a unique legal system called the civil code system, which the Pelican State inherited from French and Spanish settlers. Basically, a civil code legal system means that most of Louisiana law originates from codes and statutes, rather than from judge-made law (common law). For this reason, handling subrogation matters in Louisiana can present unique challenges, but it can also provide opportunities not found in common law states. 

In general, I found that Louisiana law is more supportive of subrogation actions than common law jurisdictions. For example, a subrogated carrier may assert claims against a defendant for causes of loss that are not covered under the policy. See Independent Fire Insurance Co. v. Kline , 454 So.2d 418, 419 (La. App. 3rd Cir. 1984). In Kline , the insured’s carport collapsed during high winds. Damages caused by high winds were covered under the insured’s policy. The subrogated insurer (that paid under the policy) sued the contractor that built the carport for construction defects. Defects in construction were not covered under the homeowner’s policy. The contractor-defendant asserted that the subrogated insurer did not have subrogation rights because the claims asserted in the petition were not covered losses under the homeowner’s policy. On appeal, the 3rd Circuit Court noted that the subrogation agreement assigned“all claims”to the insurer. The Court reasoned that the term“all claims”included all the claims that could have been asserted by insured against any potential defendant, including those claims not covered under the insurance policy. The Court returned the case to the trial court for a trial on the issue of causation (high winds or construction defects).

Another important difference in Louisiana is the general acceptance of subrogation rights arising from settling third-party liability claims. In general, Louisiana permits a liability insurance carrier to subrogate against a third-party tortfeasor after settling the plaintiff’s claims. Many times, this situation presents itself in environmental contamination or personal injury cases. In general, the settling plaintiff assigns his/her subrogation rights to the liability carrier through the settlement agreement and release, thereby granting the settling carrier conventional (contractual) subrogation rights.

While the vast majority of Louisiana law is conceptually the same as common law jurisdictions, a major difference is in the terminology. For example, a statute of limitations is referred to as“prescription,”and a statute of repose is referred to“peremption.”As I joked with my colleagues after obtaining my Louisiana bar license last year, the Louisiana bar should provide a Louisiana-to-common-law dictionary for those of us who started our practice at the common law.  Once the differences and opportunities in Louisiana are understood, as they say in Cajun country: Laissez les bon temps rouler—Let the good times roll.

 Missing a few links in the chain of causation? Don&apos;t give up, you may not need them. 
 Posted on April 15, 2011 by Mark Roth 
 A fire occurs in a garbage can causing damage to a home. Joe and John Smith, construction workers installing hardwood flooring in the home on and prior to the date of the fire, admit that they smoke each day near the job site. They further admit that they typically extinguish and then discard their cigarettes in the same garbage can where the fire began, including doing so on the date it occurred. The garbage can itself is almost completely destroyed in the fire, and no trace of any cigarettes are found. No witnesses saw the fire begin, and nobody saw the Smiths discard a smoldering cigarette in the garbage can. Finally, no evidence can be shown to exclude the possibility that a third-party, as opposed to the Smiths, left a smoldering cigarette in this garbage can. Think these facts are insufficient to prove that Joe and John caused the fire in a civil case? You may be surprised.

The hypo given above describes the essential facts in the California Court of Appeals case of Garbell v. Conejo Hardwoods, Inc. (LC076832). The Second Appellate District in Garbell reaffirmed the established tenet of California law that Plaintiffs in civil cases do not need to prove causation with absolute certainty, but rather only need to show that their theory is probable given the evidence at hand. In reaffirming this principle, the Garbell court rejected the Defendant&apos;s contention that expert testimony was required to establish every link in the chain of causation, and instead held the expert investigator&apos;s process of elimination based analysis to be sufficient.

The fire investigator in Garbell concluded that the fire began in the garbage can and eliminated all causes of the fire except for a smoldering discarded cigarette or spontaneous combustion. The court directed a verdict in favor of the defense on the spontaneous combustion theory, leaving the jury only the discarded cigarette theory of causation to consider. Since the investigator could not testify if it was more likely than not that the smoldering cigarette belonged to one of the Defendant&apos;s workers rather than some other third-party, the defense argued that there was insufficient evidence that the Defendant was responsible. The jury disagreed by ruling for the Plaintiff, and the court upheld the jury&apos;s finding permitting the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence that the Defendant was to blame.

The end result of this case provides two valuable lessons. First, the next time you can&apos;t affirmatively prove causation, don’t be dismayed, a process of elimination based analysis may be sufficient to prove your theory. Second and equally important, expert testimony, such as the fire investigator&apos;s above, is substantially more likely to be admissible in courts (such as in California state court) following the Kelly/Frye &quot;general acceptance test&quot;governing the admissibility of expert opinions, as opposed to Daubert (followed in federal court and in some states) whereby the test for admissibility of expert opinions is much more stringent. It is unlikely that the investigator&apos;s process of elimination based analysis in Garbell was tested or peer-reviewed, which are both significant factors that would be considered in determining the admissibility of this testimony under Daubert , unlike under the applicable Kelly/Frye standard where the theory must only be shown to be generally accepted in the particular field. Therefore, it&apos;s always important to analyze the expert opinions needed to establish your case in weighing whether to file in a court following Daubert as opposed to Kelly/Frye , as a court applying Daubert just might require your expert to prove those additional missing links in the chain.

 Inverse Condemnation Alive and Well in Oregon 
 Posted on April 8, 2011 by Kyle Farnam 
In February 2011, the Oregon Court of Appeals reaffirmed that the doctrine of&quot;inverse condemnation&quot;is alive and well in Oregon. Inverse condemnation claims do not require a showing of negligence, and instead arise by showing that a government actor (e.g. a city)“substantially interfered”with an owner’s right to use his or her property, and that therefore the owner is owed“just compensation”under the Constitution (in this case, Article I, Section 18 of the Oregon Constitution—the“Takings Clause”). The case, Dunn v. City of Milwaukie (CV07040247), stemmed from property damage caused when a municipal sewer system backed-up into a home. The City, at the time, had been“hydrocleaning”a nearby sewer (blasting high-pressure water from a tanker), allegedly causing the backup. While this cleaning was taking place, sewer water shot from bathroom fixtures into the home and caused substantial property damage throughout. 

The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court&apos;s $55,000 award based on the homeowner&apos;s inverse condemnation claim. In its decision, the Dunn Court rejected arguments from the City that it did not&quot;intend&quot;to harm the plaintiff, and that since the damage was repairable, that there was no&quot;substantial interference&quot;with the homeowner’s property rights. The Dunn case is a recent reminder of the subrogation opportunities that may arise in property damage cases stemming from government work or municipal systems. Even where a case does not involve negligent work performed by a municipality (or other government actor), a subrogating carrier may still pursue a recovery case if it can demonstrate that the government impeded its insured’s property rights.

 The Georgia Statute of Repose for Products: When Does Time Begin to Run? 
 Posted on April 5, 2011 by Karen Fultz 
 Georgia has a statute of repose for claims involving defective products. O.C.G.A.§51-11-11(b)(2) states that“no action shall be commenced pursuant to this subsection with respect to an injury after ten years from the date of the first sale for use or consumption of the personal property causing or otherwise bringing about the injury.”[Emphasis Added] Prior to 2006, based upon this statute, products claims were brought against product manufacturers within ten (10) years after the product was purchased by the first consumer or user. However, in 2006 the ruling in Johnson v. Ford Motor Company changed the game. In Johnson , the Georgia Court of Appeals held that a claim involving damage caused by a product’s component part must be filed within 10 years after the part was incorporated into the final design of the product by the manufacturer.

In Johnson , the plaintiff suffered property damage when her Lincoln Town Car erupted into flames inside of her neighbor’s garage. The fire spread from the neighbor’s home to the plaintiff’s home. The plaintiff alleged that the vehicle’s speed control deactivation switch failed and caused the fire. The plaintiff sued the vehicle and the switch manufacturers to recover the damage to her property. The Court upheld the lower court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the manufacturers and held that the 10 year statute of repose began to run“when Ford installed the switch in the car and the car became operable.”The Court reasoned that“when the car was driven off the assembly line, the starter had been actively placed in use, was in fact being used, and did not require purchase from the end user or consumer to be used for its“intended purpose.”

On February 7, 2011, the Georgia Supreme Court issued a ruling resolving the controversial issue raised in the Johnson case. See Campbell v. Altec Industries Inc ., 288 Ga. 535 (2011). In Campbell , the Eleventh Circuit certified the following question to the Georgia Supreme Court:“In a strict liability or negligence action, does the statute of repose in O.C.G.A§51-1-11 begin running when (1) a component part causing an injury is assembled or tested, (2) a finished product, which includes an injuring component part, is assembled, or (3) a finished product, which includes an injuring component part, is delivered to its initial purchaser?”

 Texas Tort Reform 2011: Back So Soon? 
 Posted on April 1, 2011 by Jason S. Schulze 
 Don&apos;t look now, but the Texas Legislature may be back up to its old tricks. That&apos;s right,&quot;tort reform&quot;has once again become a hot topic in Texas. On March 14, 2011, two separate bills were introduced in the state Senate and the state house of Representatives that could fundamentally alter civil litigation in Texas (yet again). The bills (referred to as S.B. 13 and H.B. 274, respectively) effectively creates a&quot;loser pays&quot;system to address what the legislature believes to a continuing&quot;lawsuit crisis&quot;in Texas. Governor Rick Perry has expressed his support of a loser pays tort reform initiative, and has publicly commented that he is fully committed to ensuring that the bills make their way through the legislative process.

Essentially, the bills would make the losing party - and in one of the bills, the losing lawyer - responsible for paying the prevailing party&apos;s attorneys&apos; fees and litigation costs. However, the bills approach this issue in different ways. Specifically, S.B. 13 allows a&quot;prevailing party&quot;to recovery attorneys&apos; fees in lawsuits for services, labor and materials; lost or damaged freight; killed or injured stock; contract claims and defamation actions. The bill further provides that a winning plaintiff shall pay litigation costs if the plaintiff refuses a settlement offer, a judgment is ultimately signed by the court and the amount of monetary relief in the judgment is more favorable to the defendant who made the settlement offer than the actual settlement offer itself. S.B. 13 also commissions a study to be conducted by the Texas Supreme Court to determine the most effective manner to implement a&quot;loser pays&quot;system. Under S.B. 13, the Texas Supreme Court would be required to report its findings to the legislature by 2012.

H.B. 274 contains similar language to S.B. 13, but also allows for attorney liability for litigation costs. Specifically, the bill would permit the trier of fact to determine whether the civil action prosecuted by a claimant was&quot;an abusive civil action,&quot;or&quot;a civil action that a reasonable person would conclude is an abuse of the civil justice process.&quot;If the trier of fact answered in the affirmative, the attorney would be individually responsible for his opponent&apos;s litigation costs which would include&quot;reasonable and necessary attorney&apos;s fees, reasonable and necessary travel expenses, reasonable fees for not more than two testifying expert witnesses and court costs.&quot;The bills also contain provisions for early dismissal of frivolous lawsuits, ensuring that new causes of action are not created unless expressly established by the legislature and speedier trials with reduced discovery for claims under $100,000.00.

Obviously many of the provisions could adversely affect subrogation claims and counsel who handle such claims. Fortunately, plaintiffs and subrogated carriers have an unlikely ally for this round of potential tort reform: civil defense lawyers. A recent article in&quot;Texas Lawyer&quot;noted comments from several prominent defense attorneys who are concerned with&quot;the integrity of the civil justice system.&quot;These lawyers publicly noted that extreme measures in tort reform fundamentally affect overall fairness in the legal system and could ultimately cause the system to&quot;collapse on itself.&quot;Moreover, Texas already has similar laws which allow defendants to recover attorney&apos;s fees making the new bills somewhat redundant.

As with any major legislative initiative that affects the rights of subrogated carriers, the Texas offices of Cozen O&apos;Connor will continue to monitor and provide periodic updates regarding the progress of both bills.

 California Court of Appeal Puts the Brakes on Contractually Exculpating Liability for Gross Negligence 
 Posted on March 31, 2011 by Bradley G. Grumbley 
Riding motocross has been part of my life for nearly twenty years. Every weekend as a kid, I would wake my parents up early, load my motorcycle in the back of a truck, and we would drive to the local motocross track. The line of trucks waiting to enter couldn’t move fast enough. I remember thinking–“Just sign in and let’s go!”Virtually all motocross tracks in the country have riders and spectators print and sign their name to a“sign-in sheet”at the entry gate. That sheet invariably contains language attempting to release the owner of the premises from liability. Today, I still anxiously wait in my truck to sign in and ride at motocross tracks throughout Southern California. But releases like these may not slow down your subrogation case. 

In Rosecrans v. Dover Images, Ltd. , plaintiff and motocross rider, Jerid Rosecrans, loaded his bike in the back of his truck and drove to Starwest Motocross Track in Perris, California. Before entering, an attendant at the entrance booth gave Jerid a clipboard with a document titled,“Release and Waiver of Liability Assumption of Risk and Indemnity Agreement.”Several paragraphs set forth the waiver and release of liability language. He signed the document and then started riding on the track after putting on his gear (helmet, goggles, chest protector, etc.).

Unfortunately, Jerid crashed on the downside of a blind jump. Luckily, he was not hurt as a result of the initial crash. But his luck ran out as he stood up to get back on his bike. Another rider who was going over the blind jump collided into and injured him. The track did not have a caution flagger stationed at the jump to alert the other rider. Jerid filed a lawsuit against the track alleging that Starwest“negligently owned, operated, maintained and/or controlled”the track because there was not a caution flagger stationed at the take off of the jump to signal that Jerid had crashed.

Starwest moved for summary judgment asserting the waiver as a complete defense to the asserted claims. The trial court agreed with Starwest and concluded that the Release completely barred Jerid’s claims. The California Court of Appeal upheld the Release to the extent that it barred claims for simple negligence. But the Court disagreed with the trial court and held that the Release did not bar claims for gross negligence. The plaintiff’s safety expert opined that not having a caution flagger stationed at a blind jump was“inexcusable, a blatant disregard for riders’safety, and criminal.”Accordingly, the Court concluded that a reasonable jury could find the track’s conduct to constitute an extreme departure from the standard of care. Ultimately, the Court refused to allow defendants to use a release of liability to shield them from extreme negligent conduct.

 Elimination of the &quot;Process of Elimination&quot;? Fuh-get About It 
 Posted on March 28, 2011 by Kevin Caraher 
Earlier this year, a fire investigator advised me that the 2011 edition of NFPA 921, Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations , would be coming out in February. He alerted me that the new edition was“doing away with the process of elimination method for determining the cause of a fire.”Not much later a client called me with similar news and to ask what that meant to the viability of our case which hinged on eliminating all possible causes for the fire, but one.

Indeed, in the 2011 edition of NFPA 921, the entirety of Chapter 18 dealing with Fire Cause Determination has been rewritten. Contrary to the concerns of the excited fire investigator and the worried client, the process of elimination remains alive and well.

I suspect that the trigger for their concern was the heading to section 18.6.5 (&quot;Improper Process of Elimination&quot;). Reading the title of the section without the content might lead one to conclude that the NFPA was advocating that the process of elimination may no longer be used to determine the cause of a fire. That is not the case. Section 18.6.5 relates to&quot;negative corpus&quot;or the process of determining the ignition source for a fire by eliminating all ignition sources found, known, or believed to have been present in the area of origin, and then claiming such methodology is proof of an ignition source for which there is no evidence of its existence.

In contrast, we sometimes can eliminate all ignition sources, but one, thereby revealing the cause of a fire. That is exactly the process advocated by the NFPA. Section 18.5 in NFPA 921 (2011 ed.) states that&quot;Systematic evaluation (hypothesis testing) is…conducted with the elimination of those hypotheses that are not supportable (or refuted) by the facts discovered through further examination.&quot;Section 18.5.2 instructs that the investigator should also carefully consider potential ignition sources which do not correspond to a physical device that can be recovered. Section 18.6 reads:&quot;Each of the alternate hypotheses that were developed must then be tested using the Scientific Method. If one remaining hypothesis is tested using the &apos;scientific method&apos; and is determined to be probable, then the cause of the fire is identified.&quot;

As Dr. Vytenis Babrauskas (renowned author of The Ignition Handbook ) commented in committee:&quot;The Process of Elimination is, in fact, the cornerstone of the Scientific Method.&quot;
