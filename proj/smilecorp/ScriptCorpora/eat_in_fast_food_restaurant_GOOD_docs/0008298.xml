Fast Food Eating Habit and Health Implications Research
 Posted on May 20, 2011 by natalieramos 
When is talked about fast food, it is usual to experience a mental picture containing hamburgers,    french fries, sandwiches, ice creams, and sodas. However, since there has been some increase in the interest in the nutritional value of fast food, as people become more health conscious ( Kara, Kaynak,&amp;Kucukemiroglu, 1997 ) it was claimed that the trend was that consumers wanted low-calorie, light, and low-fat menu items. In this situation, marketers who manage fast-food restaurants need to understand how their customers think of their menu items. On the other hand, according to both Cranage and Hwang (2010), despite the fact that many researchers and media report about the unhealthy nature of fast foods, American people have developed a taste for fast foods.

Nevertheless, these experts are in the right because it is curious to see how Americans being conscious about the damage of fast foods and also conscious about the importance of health, fast food restaurants are still popular. Important experts as Mary Story, Karen M. Kaphingst,Ramona Robinson-O’Brien, and Karen Glanz argue that “The number of food establishments in the U.S. has nearly doubled in the past three decades”, of which I totally agree. Another reason why this is still happening is presented by Shaharudin, Ismail, Mansor and other experts is that nowadays, in modern living, food choice is crucial for health conscious consumers who always place the importance on healthy living lifestyle and nutritional value products. Consumers are seeking quality, value and a desirable environment away from the daily life pressures (Soriano, 2002). In short, Americans tendency for dinning at fast food is a consequence of the technological advances and life pressure we all live. Ironically, as the popularity of healthier menus increases, so does the weight of many Americans. (Wansink&amp;Chandon, 2007).

Many studies have been conducted to understand Americans’ behavior while making their decisions of eating at fast foods. An interesting study conducted by Chandon and Wanskink  in 2010, “The Biasing Health Halos of Fast-Food Restaurant Health Claims: Lower Calorie Estimates and Higher Side-Dish Consumption Intentions”  reveals that even where the conscience of a healthier nutrition is increasing, the obesity of Americans have not declined because people burn fewer calories than they used to. This decrease in burning calories is because of technological progress and changing lifestyle that have been experienced in the last years. I agree that this new lifestyle is affecting the eating habits, now people do not have to walk to their food, now we have fast delivery services, less physical activities due to the computers and the facilities it offers.

This same publication, earlier mentioned, studies the perceptions differences between McDonalds and Subway which demonstrated that McDonalds is perceived to have the doubled calories that Subway’s eating options. A third study is published in the same article that interestingly the participants received a coupon to buy a BigMac at McDonalds or a BMT sandwich at Subway, a cookie and a Coke in which the contestant that purchased at Subway ate 56% more calories than the contestant purchasing at McDonalds. This occurred because the Subway contestant upgraded to larger beverage and ordered a cookie, while McDonalds contestant ordered a diet beverage and were less likely to order a cookie. In short, health claims at restaurants lead people to unknowingly choose side dishes containing more calories resulting this in eating the same amount of calories of a fast food restaurant that is considered as not healthy. What causes that no matter the healthier options offered by fast food chains consumers will tend to consume more calories and continue in the increasing trend of obesity. Even if consumer seek for  healthier way if marketing does an effective work and present food as high quality to the population it would be successful, this is subtended by Soriano investigation’s results published in 2002.

Fast foods are no longer a bunch of hamburgers and French fries, now they are offering a healthier menu selection. But, even the fast foods are attending the more conscious Americans, are the same Americans that are no conscious enough to make smart decisions when it comes to food selection. I t is made clear that nutrition as a matter of fact, an important issue that has to be covered by the American society. Is not to say, “I will eat in a helahty fast food restaurant” and when you come to see, the person eats the same amount of calories and fat than in a restaurant that is not perceived as healthy. The American population has the conscience of a healthier diet, but they are not choosing their diet wisely and it is a problem that would not reduce the obesity in the country.

The environment in which the food is consumed has an effect on people and such as their life.

Fast food intake everyday will make you weak from within as it contains many unwanted acids and salts content.

I know what you’re talking about. Years ago I had to eat outside all time because I had a very a difficult work schedule. I got 10 pounds over my regular weight. When I stopped eating outside so frequently I lost the same amount of pounds.

I used to go out eat and McDon all the time. Now if I contemplate eating it, I kind of have this“ugh”feeling. If I do eat any sort of fast food, I eat super healthy afterward just to make up for that one moment of unhealthiness.
