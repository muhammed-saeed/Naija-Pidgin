 REV. THOMAS PAINO III 

Posted by Jerry Lingle.
 
 REV. THOMAS PAINO III, 52, Carmel.The Rev. Tommy Paino III spent 20 years preaching the Christian promise of everlasting life and the last three being tested by it. 

Paino died of Lou Gehrig’s disease on Tuesday.
 
Rev. Paino was an Army veteran and a graduate of Fuller Theology Seminary. Pentecostal preacher who carried on the traditions of his Assembly of God denomination while welcoming spiritual seekers into the fold.

As pastor of Northview Christian Life in Carmel, Paino built a congregation rich in economic, ethnic and spiritual diversity. He was a third-generation

But many members of Northview say it was through his three-year battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease that Paino gave his greatest contribution to the congregation.

 He preached often about the anxiety, anger and even doubt he experienced in coming to terms with the fatal disease. Formally called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the disease attacks muscles. 

When he could no longer walk, Paino went to church in a wheelchair. And he allowed church members to see him in the last weeks of his life when he opened the doors of his home in December to 300 parishioners who came Christmas caroling.

 Paino wanted to help others face their own fears of dying and their own struggles in life, said Marily Ryerson, a Northview member.

She worked closely with Paino during the last two years of his life to write a book about his journey. She is calling it WELCOME HOME, TOMMY.

 I learned from Tommy how to live because he allowed us to watch him die,’ Ryerson said. ‘He taught me that the grace that God had to give him so that he could let go is the same grace God will have to give me to hang on.’ 

Born in Indianapolis, Paino grew up the son of the Rev. Thomas Paino II, legendary pastor of Lakeview Temple on Indianapolis’ Westside. He followed his father in ministry after serving in the Army during the Vietnam War and working as a public school teacher.

Paino joined the ministry staff at Lakeview during the late 1970′s, working mostly in youth ministry. In 1980, he left to start Northview Christian Life to minister to the growing suburb of Carmel. Forty people showed up for worship that first Sunday. Today, 1,600 people regularly attend weekly services.

Lois Paino believes it was her son’s genuine love for all people that attracted so many to the church.

‘Sometimes we can get so dogmatic in religion,’ she said. ‘We think our way is the only way. Tommy taught me to be more accepting of people, to live with differences.’

Even though many people in the congregation have told Lois Paino that her son’s death has deepened their faith, the loss leaves her and her husband with many questions. After all, the couple come from a long Pentecostal tradition of believing in the healing power of prayer .

 ‘Why didn’t God reach down and heal Tommy? What a testimony that would have been.’ Lois said. ‘But we’re not God. We think we can manipulate God, but we can’t. We have to trust.’ 

A year ago on Thanksgiving Day Paino called together his family in the chapel next to the church. Aware that so many people were praying for God to heal him, Paino made a staggering request of those who loved him most:

 ‘I want you to release me into God’s care,’ he told his family .

On Friday, family and friends will gather for the calling in that same chapel. Illuminated by a stained-glass window depicting the bibilical story of God testing Abraham, they will remember a preacher who used his own dying to strengthen others in faith.

This slow dismantling of my life has really positioned me in a place to become almost a living parable of what faith looks like under presure,’ Paino told THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR in October 1997.

‘I can’t say I relish these losses, but they are becoming the reminders to abandon myself to God.’

Memorial contributions may be made to the China Project , in care of the church

Services will be at 6:30 p.m. January 9th. in the church, with calling there from 3 to 8 p.m. January 8th.

Survivors: wife Sandra DeGaetan Paino; children Emily Paino-Brennaman, Sarah, Luke; parents Tom and Lois Tout Paino; brothers Tim Tracy, Troy Paino , sister Susan Rheude.
 Tommy Paino was a humble, loving, and very wise man - Thank you Lord for Tommy Paino–I am very thankful, and was privileged to attend Northview Christian Life while Tommy was pastor. J.Lingle–read this book about Pastor Tommy Paino– http://www.amazon.com/Revelations-Heavens-Doorway-Marilyn-Ryerson/dp/1883906407/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top Our past began in October 1980 when 30 people met in the cafeteria of Carmel Elementary School. Northview Christian Life Church started under the leadership of Pastor Tommy Paino and within the first year, Northview outgrew the cafeteria and moved into the gymnasium. Growth continued into the second year as Northview celebrated a ground-breaking ceremony to begin construction on its first permanent home at 131st Street and Gray Road in Carmel. Before Northview moved into its new home in July 1983, the final service at Carmel Elementary was attended by nearly 300 people. By 1985, weekly attendance rose to an all-time high of more than 1,000 people! In late 1985, Northview purchased 80 acres of land from Purdue University which would become the location of our current facility. Construction of a new campus was completed in 1995. At the first service in the new building, more than 1,200 people attended! However during that same year, Pastor Paino noticed the beginning symptoms of what was later diagnosed as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease). In 1997, Northview built and dedicated a prayer chapel as its first addition to the new facility. By May 1998, Pastor Paino’s condition had worsened and he soon recognized the need to form a pastoral search committee to help find a successor. Pastor Tommy Paino passed away in January 1999. A new chapter began for Northview in June 1999 when Steve Poe was elected to serve as Northview’s new Lead Pastor

 Stufff for Christians 

 When Westboro Baptist Pickets Your Church Turns out that this Sunday Westboro Baptist is going to be picketing the church I attend. I spoke there last weekend so this makes perfect sense to me. My message was on fire and they’re huge fans of talking about hell and who is going there and fire. My pastor, Pete Wilson, made a great [...] I want destiny, not a desert. We tend to romanticize the idea of “being called” by God. We imagine an adventure involving a machete, a rope bridge and a country with a lot of vowels in the name. It will be tough, but at the end of the day we’ll be so firmly planted in God’s will that even the hardest [...] The easiest way to write a country song. I laughed approximately 82 times during this 8 minute video. It’s from a musician named Andy Gullahorn. He and I did a youth retreat once together for a church out of Florida. Years later, I found this online and knew that although it focuses on “the easiest way to write a country song,” Andy Gullahorn [...] Not making a Christian version of “50 Shades of Gray.” Dear Christian Community, Can you and I please agree to never make a Christian version of the book “50 Shades of Gray?” Can we come together, maybe even do life together, walk through a season, perhaps avoid a slippery slope and promise each other that we won’t publish our own version?

Whenever we miss a few weeks of church, I feel compelled to explain the absence to my daughter’s Sunday school teacher, or anyone else who will listen for that matter. If we’ve been out of town for a few weekends in a row, I’ll make sure to use some not-so-subtle sentences that tell the teacher [...] Happy Fourth of July!

 5 Steps to Improve Your Church Email Marketing When it comes to impacting your community with the message of Christ, the internet is often considered one of the ultimate tools.

One way that churches can conne […] Tithing When Your Spouse Doesn’t Approve A friend of mine recently confided, “I always tithe from my income, but I would never tell my husband . . . he would not approve.” My initial response was respect for this act of devotion toward God in spite of the resistance her husband represents. However, as the conversation settled in, I began to question my friend’s actions.

However, there are ways that a homeowner can save money in taking care of their h […] What is the Home Affordable Refinance Program and Can it Help You? The Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) was created by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in March 2009 in response to the housing and mortgage crisis. The crisis began back in 2006 and wiped out home equity for millions of home owners while putting many more into negative equity situations. The purpose of the program is to allow those with less than 20 […] How to Anonymously Give Someone Money Giving is a basic principle of proper money management. It is not only commanded in Scripture, but it is truly the most fun one will ever have with money. The joy received when we see someone blessed by some type of gift–whether it is money, a service, or a present–far outweighs the cost of that gift. Check out the CPF iPad site!

 Ouch! Another Article At The New Blog 20 Ways To Outline A Sermon Unashamed Workman Has Moved Unashamed Workman has moved and relaunched. Find the new website here and update your Google Readers to www.unashamedworkman.org The first new post:“So What’s New?”The first new article:“God’s Word, My Voice.” Next Week Unashamed Workman Relaunch I wanted to announce that after a six month hiatus, Unashamed Workman will soon be relaunching. The emphasis on preaching will certainly continue. But we will be moving to a multiple author format on a brand new website. This should enhance the blog in terms of the frequency, quality and breadth of content.  Stay tuned. Keep preaching. Advertisement Apparently there have been some advertisements appearing at the bottom of Unashamed Workman blog posts. A kind brother informed me of this by email, and explained that WordPress have now started adding these adverts to the bottom of every blog post (usually a You Tube video). Annoyingly, I have been unable to see these myself [...] Common Sermon Mistakes David Murray talks about 10 common preaching mistakes: 1. Cramming 2. Skimming 3. Floating 4. Proof-texting 5. Quoting 6. Lecturing 7. Assuming 8. Confusing 9. Spraying 10. Complicating If God were mute, then so would the preacher be. But God has spoken. Preaching About Preaching Recently I preached about preaching. The sermon looked at the foundational basis of preaching (God achieves his purposes through His Word), the role of the preacher, and how the congregation should listen to sermons. The outline was: The Lord Speaks The Preacher Proclaims The Church Hears Here is the audio:“Preaching.” Tchividjian’s Preaching Notes Via Josh Harris, here are Tullian Tchividjian’s preaching notes.

 The Purple Cellar 

 &quot;Have No Anxiety&quot;--Really? Is anxiety a mental or emotional state we simply can’t escape? According to an article at the Christianity Today website, it is indeed: “Through no choice of our own, we live in a state of anxiety that is largely disconnected from the reality of our otherwise normal circumstances.”Reinforcing the view that we are helpless victims of anxiety is the label assi […] Quote of the Week Another from Paul Tripp. It ties in with a couple of issues we&apos;ve discussed here recently: waiting and envy. Paul writes: When God asks you to wait, what happens to your spiritual muscles? While you wait, do your spiritual muscles grow bigger and stronger or do they grow flaccid and atrophied? Waiting for the Lord isn’t about God forgetting you, forsaki […] Happy Mother&apos;s Day to Single Moms Some women dread church on Mother’s Day. They’ve learned what to expect. Perhaps they know that the holiday will be the focus of the entire worship service. For others, there’s just that inevitable mothers-please-stand-up-and-be-noticed moment. Single mothers can be among those who dread it.The term single mother indicates something’s gone wrong. It’s not wh […] A Tragic Death and the Gospel Last week the Christian Post published an obituary about the death of their much-loved friend and colleague, Gabrielle Devenish. The thirty-year-old woman died on April 19 from complications of the eating disorder anorexia. She weighed 66 pounds close to the time of her death.Gabrielle’s story is sad on so many levels. Sad, of course, is the fact that the li […] Waiting An unmet need, a perplexing circumstance, a hoped-for deliverance—where is God in the midst of all this, and why doesn’t he seem to answer? In times of waiting, we can find ourselves emotionally fragile, and if we’re not careful, our faith can also take a hit. That’s why it’s vital to see what Scripture says about waiting. 1) A Pattern of WaitingAbraham and […] Quote of the Week &quot;God won’t call us to keep one command in a way that would cause us to break another.&quot;--Paul Tripp, Dangerous Calling (Crossway, forthcoming) Pilgrim Broadcast Update We have solved the download problem!

He had become obviously, undeniably enamored with a girl named Katie. What was it about Katie that led to this cruel defection? I was sure I knew.

It just had to be her hai […] Pilgrim Radio Broadcasts Apr 14, 15:&quot;Building on Sand&quot;Apr 21, 22:&quot;Where Is Your Faith?&quot;Apr 28, 29:&quot;Resting in Christ&quot;UPDATE: For some reason, the file has limited the number of downloads.

You haven&apos;t quite grasped it if things go wrong and the first thing you do is anxiously try to dig up some unconfessed sin as the reason.

When we dip into Proverbs, we go there looking for wisdom. Sometimes we go there seeking wisdom in a particular area--relation wisdom, financial wisdom, moral wisdom--and that is good. But Proverbs is so much more than sage advice for getting along in the world. It shows us that wisdom isn&apos;t so much what we do as what we believe. Real wisdom is defined […] Blogging in 2011 Most of us go through seasons in which it seems as if the famous words of Robert Burns were written just for us:&quot;The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.&quot;It&apos;s not all bad when plans go awry. After all, it&apos;s humbling, and it teaches us that the truth underlying Burns&apos;s words is found in Scripture: Come now, you who say, […] Quote of the Week I came across a convicting message by John Piper called&quot;The Radical Cost of Following Jesus.&quot;Based on Jesus&apos;words in Luke 9:56-62, Piper talks about&quot;fickle following&quot;and&quot;the danger of indecisive discipleship.&quot;He says this:&quot;No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of Go […] Left Off the List Rejected. That&apos;s how we feel when the invitations go out, but one doesn&apos;t arrive in our mailbox. As we near the end of summer wedding season, maybe you know what I&apos;m talking about. You assumed you&apos;d be invited. In fact, you arranged your schedule in advance to be able to attend. Then, five weeks before the wedding, you realize your invita […] Taking Responsibility In a culture that sues McDonalds for our own obesity we should not then be surprised that many blame God for their problems. . . . Understand this vital principle — you will never grow in gospel holiness until you acknowledge you alone, not God or anyone else, are responsible for your own sinful behaviour. This may be easy to say but it is very hard to pract […] Spiritual Depression Why does God seem far off sometimes--especially when we&apos;re suffering? At such times, we most want to know his presence. Where is he? On the flipside, why is it that sometimes we find ourselves far off? We just can&apos;t get into reading the Word, and praying feelings like a chore on the to-do list. In either case, we wonder what&apos;s going on, and we […] Quote of the Week &quot;When what is due to the Lord is in question, it is with those nearest to you that you have to be most decided. . . . To take a definite stand for the Lord against influences which are not of him, even in those that you regard and truly love, secures great blessing.&quot;--A. W. Pink, Gleanings in Exodus Unequal Yoking, Part 2 Over the past few months I’ve received a significant number of emails from Christian women who are involved romantically with non-Christian men. The majority are struggling with one of two concerns—whether to stay in the relationship or how to get out of it. Believe me… I know from past personal experience how painfully hard this can be.For those of you who […] Quote of the Week Here is John Piper&apos;s take (a really good take) on gray hair: Age is a gift in the Bible. Getting old and, I suppose, losing your hair or having some gray hair is a gift. It&apos;s a sign of having been kept by God and having been brought toward ripening for heaven. And to resist it seems to me a kind of unbelief that heaven is really good, and living a […]

From USA Today, but of course not all agree (by the way, I recommend William Webb, Corporal Punishment in the Bible, if you want to see someone take on this issue with some hermeneutical finesse): Children who are spanked, hit, or pushed as a means of discipline may be at an increased risk of mental [...] When Pastors Shift Theology My questions are these: Does your church tolerate theological shifts on the part of the pastor? Do you know what your pastor/s believe about crucial topics? Pastors: What are your stories? Have you struggled? Where can you find a safe place for discussing your shifts, your theology, etc.? What happens if you, as a pastor, [...] The Deity Question Mike Nappa did a survey of 845 Christian teenagers, The Jesus Survey, and asked them the deity question—in particular, he asked if they thought Jesus was God. I have some quibbles with his own theological explanation and one of the questions, but the numbers below may surprise some but shouldn’t surprise those who [...] Walking Where They Walked The big picture: we will fly into Instanbul (Constantinople), tour some of the cities of Peter and Paul and John in Asia Minor, fly to Tel Aviv, get a bus to Nazareth, Jesus’home town, and then the unique part of this trip is that we will go on a four-day hike from Nazareth to [...] Life of David Gale (Michael O’Neil) This post is by Michael O’Neil, a friend of mine who teaches at Vose Seminary in Perth, Australia. Michael, a theologian, offers some reflections on a move, The Life of David Gale. “Gritty Movies” A few days ago my wife and I watched Alan Parker’s 2003 movie The Life of David Gale. It’s what we [...] Teenage Christians and the Bible Mike Nappa did a survey of 845 Christian teenagers—at least those who think they are Christians and who are involved in a youth group—to find out what they believe. He believes his study reflects Christian teenagers (he says his study has 4.44% margin of error), though I’d slightly modify that to [...] 
 
 O Me of Little Faith 

 Farewell, O Me of Little Faith You said you had a big announcement coming today. What is it? The announcement is this: Right now you are reading the final post on this blog. Ever. Ever? Ever. So you&apos;re shutting this blog down? Well, I&apos;m going to stop writing any new posts for it. But the blog will still be here. There&apos;s no deletion or anything. If, at some date in the futur […] My Introvert Interview Harold Camping: “Invisible Judgment Day” The Phases of Writing (Adam McHugh) 21 Things You Should Know About Harold Camping I’m Having an End-of-Days Sale My apologies for the shameless self-promotion, but while supplies last, I&apos;m having an apocalyptic blow-out sale right now at jasonboyett.com. Just in case we all need it this weekend, I&apos;m offering Is Judgment Day May 21? Rally to Restore Unity The Death of Osama bin Laden Fatherly Advice Needed

Senate Resolution on the Election of Fred Luter On June 29, Senator Mary Landrieu submitted a resolution in the United States Senate that congratulates the Southern Baptist Convention for electing Rev. Fred Luter as its first African American president. The resolution has been referred to the judiciary committee and awaits disposition. You can download a PDF of the resolution here, or you can [...] Presbyterians Denounce Corporal Punishment When the Presbyterian Church USA (PCUSA) met last week, it passed a recommendation calling on its members to adopt discipline methods that do not include corporal punishment. It not only calls on schools and orphanages to abandon spanking, but it also calls on parents to abandon it as well. The PCUSA issued a series of [...] Alan Chambers Talks Reparative Therapy on Hardball Alan Chambers is the President of Exodus International, an evangelical ministry to homosexuals. A couple of weeks ago, I noted that Chambers has changed his views on the usefulness reparative therapy. In the video above, Chambers appears on MSNBC’s“Hardball”to elaborate how his views have changed. What’s striking to me on these talking he […] A Trenchant and Hilarious Parody of Hipster Christianity This video is hilarious. It’s an ad for an upcoming conference hosted by Doug Wilson. It’s a parody of hipster Christianity, and it really hits the nail on the head. (HT: Patrick Schreiner) The Bible and Homosexuality I’ve been reading Matthew Lee Anderson’s excellent book Earthen Vessels: Why Our Bodies Matter to Our Faith (Bethany House, 2011). I’m probably not going to take the time to do a full review of this book, but I just came across something that I thought worth sharing. In his remarks about the Bible’s clear prohibitions [...] Black Pastors Withhold Support from President Obama over Same-Sex Marriage The Coalition of African-American Pastors represents about 1,300 congregations, and they are tired of their support being taken for granted by the Obama administration. In May, they came out strongly against President Obama’s announcement in support of gay marriage (see video above). In a recent letter, they call on black voters to withhold support from [... […] Requiem for a Nixon Man Russell Moore’s tribute to Chuck Colson in the most recent issue of Touchstone is a must-read. Really well done. It’s not just a reflection on Colson’s life, but also a meditation on what it meant for Colson to be a“Nixon man.”Here’s an excerpt: In the weeks and months after the death of Chuck [...] The Crime of Circumcision Michael Gerson begins his column today with a quotation from Genesis 17:10:“This is my covenant which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised.”As this text shows, the practice of circumcision is at the heart of Jewish piety, yet it is [...] Should churches display the American flag? Christianity Today hosts a forum on whether or not churches should display the American flag in their sanctuaries. Douglas Wilson says no, Lisa Velthouse says yes, and Russell Moore says“yes, but…”Wilson and Moore have some characteristic rhetorical greatness in their short reflections. After arguing against displaying the flag in the sanctuary […]

 As a Christian I have a deep faith, believing that God is Good ALL the time, and ALL the time, God is Good. My motto IS the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;. Do unto others, as you would have them do to you. Jeremiah 29:11 &quot;For I know the plans I have for you,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.&quot; Psalms 23:6 &quot;Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.&quot; ~Blessings to all~
