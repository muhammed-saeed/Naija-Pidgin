Business Overview:

 This pizza restaurant is one of the franchises growing number of stores in and around the Madison Area. The franchise has been in existence for nearly 20 years and is now looking to expand its territory. 

This particular store was built-out in the summer of 2009 by the franchisor and has been run as a corporate store to ensure it got off on the right foot. Now that the store has a dedicated customer base that has taken a liking to this restaurants broad selection of freshly made foods, the franchise is ready to put it in the hands of a qualified individual that can show their dedication to be successful and be active in their pursuit to make this location the best location that the franchise has to offer. THIS STORE DEFINITELY HAS A LOCATION THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO BE A PREMIER FOOD CHOICE IN THE AREA FOR A LONG TIME. 

The business is run with 3 managers at this point and the franchise believes that a dedicated new owner would be able to absorb the work of 1 or 2 managers and get paid for their efforts. Each manager is getting paid roughly $30,000-$35,000 yearly. The business has still been able to turn a profit while paying these individuals and that just goes to show the opportunity for a dedicated new owner to get paid for their time and effort that they are able to put into continuing to grow this location. If you have experience in the food industry and think you are capable of maintaining a small staff of employees, you may be a great fit for this business! Please inquire for more details.
