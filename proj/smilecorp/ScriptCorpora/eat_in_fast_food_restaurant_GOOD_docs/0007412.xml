 2nd Ave Deli Lower East Side kosher deli serving traditional Jewish delicacies since 1954. My brother and I love to nosh here when we&apos;re in New York City! Asiana Grille Fine restaurant on Mass Ave in Arlington featuring Thai, Korean, and Japanese food. Beef basil, no mushrooms, extra spicy. Mmmmm. You can get sushi if you like. Atlantic Fish Co Atlantic Fish is a marvelous Boston seafood restaurant. Sit out front in the cafe in nice weather, enjoy some blackened catfish, and ask the chef to steam a batch of littlenecks. Bison County BBQ With superb Tex-Mex food and a huge beer list, Bison County&apos;s baby backs w/Texas spicy sauce are hard to beat. Get &apos;em with garlic mashed and jalapeno rice, plus a catfish nuggets appetizer if you&apos;re extra hungry. Blue Ribbon Barbecue Terrific local BBQ chain with a broad menu where everything&apos;s great. Not much room to eat in, but works well for take-out. Not open late. Go easy on the XXX sauce. Boca Grande This inexpensive Mexican fast-food restaurant has branches in Cambridge and Brookline. The hearty carnitas Mexican plate makes for great take-out. Extra rice, hold the beans, lots of onion/cilantro and hot sauce. Border Cafe A terrific Mexican restaurant at Harvard Sq and in Saugus with especially good appetizers. Always busy. Callahan&apos;s Steak&amp;Seafood House A splendid place in Newton for filet mignon or other steaks, although crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Heid&apos;s of Liverpool Founded in 1883, we&apos;ve been going to this legendary upstate NY hot dog restaurant since we were kids. Yep, you still have to wait in the crowded wraparound line out front to get served. Joseph&apos;s II Easily the best breakfast in Waltham, which is served anytime, but their dinner fare is less impressive. Great service and bottomless coffee. Katz&apos;s Deli New York&apos;s oldest and best delicatessen: &apos;Send a salami to your boy in the army!&apos; You might remember Meg Ryan having a climactic experience here. Kimball Farm&apos;s Ice Cream Probably the best ice cream in the region. Located way out in Carlisle, it makes a perfect stop on a summer country bike ride. You can pet the animals too. Knotty Pine Restaurant Exactly what you&apos;d expect from this small family-owned diner in Auburndale near where I used to live. Tula is still there pouring a great cup of coffee. Little India Fine North Indian cuisine with especially good breads and appetizers. Pappadum always crunchy, mulligatawny soup always aromatic, tasty vindaloo. Very friendly service. Lizzy&apos;s Ice Cream Parlor An excellent ice cream shop in Waltham. They have overstuffed handpacked quarts and a wonderful eggnog flavor in the wintertime. RedBones BBQ A grand old southern BBQ restaurant at Davis Sq in Somerville. Excellent ribs and choice of beers. Rein&apos;s Deli Restaurant Located in Vernon CT off Rt 84, this is a favorite stopover point on the way to and from family in New York State. Their nova lox is exquisite. Try a hot corned beef on light seeded rye with russian. Open &apos;til midnight. Rubin&apos;s Kosher Restaurant A wonderful NY-style kosher deli in Brookline. Terrific food, especially their long cooked corned beef. Just don&apos;t go there on shabbos or high holidays. Sol Azteca - A touch of Old Mexico Fabulous restaurant in Brookline and Newton with gourmet and traditional Mexican food. Their &apos;Mixed Grill Azteca&apos; dish for two with coriander shrimp is beyond heavenly, esp. w/sangria and then Mexican coffee. Longtime favorite with family and friends. Stockyard Food&amp;Spirits This Brighton steakhouse has perhaps the finest filet mignon in the Boston area. Generous portions. Visible from the Mass Pike. Taqueria Mexico An inexpensive Waltham place favored by the local latino/a neighbors. Food is good homestyle, but what really stands out is their Pico de gallo salsa which is heavy on the cumin and cilantro. Tennessee&apos;s BBQ&amp;Grill Award-winning BBQ restaurant with several local branches featuring especially lean and tasty Memphis ribs. Their spicy Brickhouse sauce is not to be missed. Union Oyster House America&apos;s oldest restaurant, est. 1826. Wonderful Boston seafood and classy atmosphere with the spirit of Daniel Webster. Order a broiled (not boiled) lobster! Then visit Quincy Market next door. Vinny T&apos;s of Boston My favorite Italian restaurant with mind-blowing garlicky shrimp scampi. Order one of their &apos;uno&apos; meals, because you won&apos;t be able to finish their full-size meal. Excellent service. Woodman&apos;s of Essex Cape Ann restaurant famous for fried clams since 1914. Choose your lobster out front, pair it with onion rings and a beer, grab a wooden booth, and enjoy some awesome New England seafood.
