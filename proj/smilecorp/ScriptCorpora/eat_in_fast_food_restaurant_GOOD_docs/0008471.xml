 Sunday, 13 June 2010 Ridemakerz driven by self-service 
 Kiosks in the Ridemakerz store in Myrtle Beach, S.C.

The kiosk software was developed by Nanonation and is on the same platform as the software in Build-A-Bear in-store kiosks.   &quot;The kiosk allows customers to extend their experience on to the Web,&quot;said Dave Watkins, developbear supbearvisor for Build-A-Bear Inc.&quot;They can get a title for their Ride, create a custom license plate and have a way to share the Ride with their friends.&quot;   Ridemakerz is receiving $3 million in investments and $15 million in back-office support from Build-A-Bear Inc. Build-A-Bear is also providing the IT infrastructure, Watkins said.

The group found in a recent study that North American consumers are on pace to spend more than $525 billion at self-checkout lanes, ticketing kiosks and other self-service machines in 2007, an increase from $438 billion in 2006.

&quot;We expect that expenditures made at self-service kiosks will rise by about 20 percent this year and another 18 percent in 2008,&quot;said Greg Buzek, president of IHL Consulting Group.&quot;Demand for self-checkout systems and other kiosks should push the dollar value of transactions to nearly $1.3 trillion by 2011.&quot; 
 In the IHL study,&quot;2007 North American Self-Service Kiosks,&quot;IHL examines the increasing use of five types of self-service kiosks where payment is accepted: self-checkout systems, ticketing kiosks, check-in kiosks, food ordering and postal kiosks.

Motorola also says the solution is well-suited for applications in the transportation, hospitality, entertainment and healthcare verticals.   The MK4000’s features include: 
 A choice between laser barcode scanning or imaging technology Networking options, including wireless and Ethernet support A slim profile, at 2.43 inches by 6.17 centimeters Flexible mounting options–shelves, walls, tables and end-caps 12.1-inch color LCD touchscreen Microsoft Windows CE operating system Compatibility with Motorola’s Mobility Services Platform (MSP) Stereo speakers, microphone and headset jacks 
 Motorola says the micro kiosk solution can help retailers create a better shopping experience and retain valuable customers: The MK4000 enables the deployment of intuitive, on-demand, rich multimedia applications that provide your customers with instant and constant access to information —when and where they need it —eliminating wait times that can result in lost sales, well as customer attrition.

 According to a report from Britain&apos;s Daily Mail Online, Tesco has opened the country&apos;s first all self-checkout store. Tesco Express, located in King&apos;s Langley, Northampton, has five self-checkout terminals and no traditional checkout lanes, the report says, a model Tesco refers to as&quot;assisted self-service.&quot; 

 The U.K.-based chain already operates stores in the assisted-checkout model in the United States, with its Fresh&amp;Easy brand in California, Nevada and Arizona. 

 Self-service adoption in European countries has traditionally lagged behind that of North America, though, and the Daily Mail reports that some in the United Kingdom are critical of the new model: 
 
 Local Liberal Democrat County Coordinator Richard Church, who represents the Kingsley ward, said he was unimpressed with the self-scan store. 

 He said: &apos;If you like to speak to a real person when you do your shopping, you won&apos;t like it. At the moment, there are helpful assistants to tell you how to swipe the barcodes and make your payments, but that won&apos;t last.&apos; 
 
 But a Tesco spokesperson told the Daily Mail that staff always will be available to assist customers: 
 
 It&apos;s a lot quicker, but some people have never used them before, so a member of staff is there to assist. If needs be, there can be five members of staff assisting customers. We have had no negative feedback so far. 
 
 The Daily Mail says Tesco is the biggest supermarket employer in the country, with a workforce of more than 220,000. 
 POSTED BY: Caroline Cooper AT 12:23 pm  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Wednesday, 16 September 2009 NCR survey finds Canadian shoppers want more self-service New survey results from NCR Corp. and BuzzBack Market Research indicate Canadian shoppers want more self-service in retail.   According to an NCR news release, nearly 40 percent of Canadians surveyed say they would welcome a self-service kiosk in retail stores to help them locate products, as opposed to having to track down a staff member. Additional survey results indicate Canadians are using more cash, researching products on the Internet more frequently and shopping multiple retailers to find the best price, all of which is part of a broader trend of shoppers adjusting to an uncertain economy, NCR says.   Additionally, 35 percent of Canadians say their likelihood to use self-service has increased over the past year. That consumer desire for self-service is a trend retailers should take advantage of, NCR says: Retailers who adopt a broader range of self-service technology improve service and enhance the customer experience by redeploying staff in areas of their store where customers need more personal attention. This delivers great cost savings by allowing retailers to invest in the areas that matter most to the customer. For example, self-checkout systems decrease customer queue time by 40 percent. The survey of more than 500 Canadian respondents is part of NCR&apos;s larger 2009 self-service study, which assessed 8,400 consumers around the world and found that 85 percent prefer to shop with a retailer that offers the ability to interact via the online, mobile and self-service channels versus one that does not.

According to a news release from NCR, the deal will bring NCR&apos;s self-service solution together with ADFLOW&apos;s digital signage and software technology to create an interactive retail kiosk.   Steve Kartonchik, ADFLOW&apos;s executive vice president of sales and marketing, says the solution will enable retailers to better reach customers at the point-of-decision: Capturing attention and engaging customers through interaction at the point-of-decision is critical in achieving true one-to-one marketing. NCR, which leads how the world connects, interacts and transacts with business, and ADFLOW Networks, with its innovative assisted-selling solutions, offer retailers a means to redefine the in-store customer shopping experience while increasing sales, boosting store productivity and enhancing operational efficiency. We are delighted to be working with NCR to deliver these exciting solutions to the marketplace. NCR says the solution also will utilize ADFLOW&apos;s Retail Analytics reporting system, giving retailers valuable insight into customer buying behavior.

And, maybe even more beneficial is the fact that the lanes can be easily changed by adding (or) removing cabinet, hardware and software components as well as features, so they never become obsolete.

Lucidiom president Steve Giordano Jr. says the new model incorporates features that the company&apos;s retail customers have indicated are important to them:
   
 A major issue for retailers today is the look and feel of their shops, and the sleek and skinny APM 3700 is designed with that in mind.

For instance, the APM 3700 is 30 percent smaller in depth and will accommodate just about every retail fixture. It also boasts cable control—all the cables and cords can be contained within its shell, allowing retailers to better merchandise their fixtures without concern for bothersome cables. 

According to a news release from Lucidiom, the APM 3700 also features mounting screws for extra security, a built-in magnetic stripe reader, and a brighter screen and larger hard drive than previous models.

POSTED BY: AT 03:42 pm  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Thursday, 09 July 2009 NCR Corp. recognized for maintenance, support services DULUTH, Ga.—NCR Corp. has announced its No. 1 position in the hardware maintenance and support category in retail infrastructure support for 2006-2008, according to Gartner Inc.’s“Market Share: Infrastructure Support, Worldwide Market Share”database, published in May.
 
Gartner also reported that NCR ranked No. 7 worldwide in financial services infrastructure support and No. 10 worldwide across all verticals in infrastructure support for the same time period. More than 175 service vendors were evaluated for the report, and the database’s rankings are based on worldwide revenues.
 
“Maximizing system availability and managing total cost of ownership has taken on supercritical importance in today’s challenging economic and competitive environment,”said Christine Wallace, senior vice president of NCR Services.“These challenges are uppermost in the minds of the NCR Services teams that work with businesses around the world. Our dedication to making things easier for our customers, enabling them to move faster and helping them transform their businesses is reaffirmed, in my opinion, by these latest Gartner rankings.”
 
NCR offers a complete portfolio of services for retail, financial, travel, healthcare, hospitality, entertainment, gaming and public sector organizations.

No. 1 in global self-checkout market DULUTH, Ga.—NCR Corp. ranks No. 1 worldwide in the self-checkout market, according to Retail Banking Research Ltd., a strategic research and consulting firm headquartered in London.
 
The newly published“Global EPOS and Self-Checkout 2009”report from RBR shows that the adoption of self-checkout solutions has accelerated over the last two years. In addition, RBR predicts that the installed base of self-checkouts is due to nearly triple by 2012 to reach 250,000 units globally.
 
According to an NCR news release, more than 140 retailers from 12 different retail segments and more than 20 countries use NCR SelfServ Checkout. NCR attributes its market leadership to its continuous innovation and a consultative approach to helping retailers meet key business objectives with their self-checkout strategies.
 
“Two out of three self-checkouts shipped in the last five years are from NCR,”said Mike Webster, NCR&apos;s vice president and general manager for retail and hospitality.“This includes a‘who’s who’list of retailers. They value NCR’s relentless focus on improving store productivity and customer service levels. We are achieving this not only through innovations in the technology itself, but also the way in which it is deployed and managed.”
 
NCR believes the current challenging economic conditions will prove a stimulus for the wider adoption of self-checkouts. Industry initiatives, such as the introduction of GS1 DataBar barcodes, are expected to improve self-checkout ease of use even further. These new barcodes can be more than 50 percent smaller than current EAN/UPC barcodes, making them suitable for use on loose produce, such as fruit and vegetables. This can allow consumers to simply scan such items, rather than search for them on the screen or key in codes.

According to a news release, the Shop Hear and Service Hear upgrade kits combine sophisticated electronic induction loop circuitry with a system’s amplifier, microphone(s), power and connecting cables and signage to quickly convert any self-service or self-checkout counter to a hearing impaired-friendly point of communication.
 
The induction loop technology used in Shop Hear and Service Hear kits works with T-Coil technology, which is built into the majority of hearing aids. Deployers can identify the service positions by marking them with the internationally recognized symbol for T-Coil technology. By switching their hearing aids to the T position, customers enjoy direct, clear and confidential one-on-one communication without the interference of background noise or music.
 
Shop Hear and Service Hear upgrade kits easily integrate with virtually every existing counter or checkout/service technology available today. Companies and organizations using the Shop Hear or Service Hear kits will provide a valuable community service to a large segment of the population and comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, said Jim Vance, president of Pan-Oston.

Kennedy Greenway. Designed by creative technology leader Obscura Digital, the kiosk, anchored in the center of the Dewey Square Farmers Market, is available for use by the public on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. through Oct. 15.

“This kiosk represents a happy marriage between digital technology and a traditional farmer’s market,”said Steven Pleshette Murphy, president and chief executive of Rodale.“Deep content and useful features will help visitors get the most out of the market, and by providing a digital display in support of farmers and shoppers, as opposed to distributing paper marketing materials, we demonstrate our commitment to environmentally sound best practices.”

The kiosk will feature digital content that includes information about Rodale’s history, its magazines and international activities, Rodale.com, and the work of the Rodale Institute and the Rodale&apos;s Farmers Market Network. Rodale’s recipes and top-selling books, such as the New York Times bestseller“The End of Overeating,”Al Gore’s“An Inconvenient Truth,”“Eat This Not That”and“The Flat Belly Diet”will be featured on the kiosk.
 
Other kiosk features include a calendar of events highlighting Boston Farmers Market activities, the harvest season, farmer information and vendor Web sites, farm locations in 3D Google maps, interesting farm facts and a glossary of terms. Users will have the ability to e-mail information such as recipes and shopping lists from the kiosk.
“The new kiosk underscores Rodale’s leadership role in the organic food movement, its sponsorship of the Boston Public Market at Dewey Square and the RFK Greenway Conservancy and supports the ongoing effort to inspire people to shop locally and live healthy,”said Nancy Brennan, executive director of The Rose F. Kennedy Greenway Conservancy.

Based on Rodale’s commitment to support both farmers and shoppers with a wealth of in-depth information, Obscura designed a highly interactive touchscreen kiosk. By combining a 42-inch LCD panel with Obscura’s customized touchscreen overlay and custom interface, Obscura created a friendly and intuitive experience for shoppers to navigate through a wide range of valuable content.

&quot;We are very happy with the IKEA FAMILY registration kiosks that are installed in all Belgian IKEA stores,”said Tim Schroons of IKEA Belgium.“They allow us to have a much more efficient way of recruiting new IKEA FAMILY members without the presence of a coworker being required. This versatile solution allows us to recruit new members and have existing members print out a temporary card or update their customer profile in a user-friendly way.&quot;

According to a news release, Quant Marketing created the concept for the kiosk solution during its marketing-led IT projects in 2008 and selected Protouch as its hardware partner. The kiosks feature 19-inch touchscreens, 80mm receipt printers and keyboards.

“We are really excited to be involved in Quant’s kiosk solution for IKEA,”said Tom Quarry, managing director of Protouch.“It is great to see our touchscreen kiosks working so well within the project by improving IKEA’s operations and enhancing in-store experience for its customers.”

IKEA may continue the rollout in other European locations.

The study says the reasons for this finding include the failure of some self-checkouts to lock until an employee has verified the user’s ID and the ability of customers to override a system by swiping a credit card or scanning other items. The study also found a lack of adequate supervision of self-checkouts, with only one employee working the self-checkout area in 60 percent of store visits and no employee at all in 5 percent of the visits. In addition, although store personnel are supposed to check IDs for anyone who looks under the age of 30, the study says 32 percent of consumers under age 30 were not asked to show identification.

It also strengthens Wincor Nixdorf&apos;s position as a supplier of self-service and automation solutions for retail chains.   The contract conclusion was preceded by a very intensive project phase, in which Wincor Nixdorf laid the foundation for its relationship with the retailer through an internal optimization of the individual processes. The retailer has ordered Wincor Nixdorf&apos;s Revendo 7000 system for processing cans and disposable PET bottles, and the Revendo 8000, which accepts every kind of returnable container: glass bottles, PET bottles, cans and entire beverage crates.   At EuroCIS 2009, Wincor Nixdorf will demonstrate how its reverse vending systems can be integrated in the IT infrastructures of retail stores. The presentation will focus on the secure processing of transaction receipts. Through automatic posting of the receipts at the POS system, retailers can ensure that an individual transaction receipt issued by the reverse vending system is only paid or credited once. This results in a significant reduction of inventory discrepancies. And at the end of the day, an overview of transactions can be produced at the touch of a button.   Another feature, according to the release, is intelligent couponing -- the generation of discount coupons based on the type of empties returned. This generates considerable advantages for sales control of the store&apos;s beverage assortment.

As such, energy savings from this POS system are passed on to retailers by way of lower energy bills.   &quot;Intel-based technologies will ensure retailers are well-positioned to move through the current economy into a successful and profitable future, while giving their customers more information faster and easier than ever before,&quot;said Joe Jensen, general manager, Intel Embedded Computing Division.&quot;We hope the combination of improving a customer&apos;s retail experience, while also arming sales associates with more accurate information and reducing operations costs, such as electricity bills and maintenance, is a compelling proposition for the world&apos;s retailers to take advantage of what Intel technology innovation has to offer.&quot;   The proof-of-concept platform features Intel vPro technology with Intel Active Management Technology and offers lower maintenance costs, improved power management and security options such as system diagnosis. Intel vPro technology allows administrators to manage systems remotely, making it possible to turn off all systems overnight to increase energy savings and reduce the need for technicians to go on-site for system maintenance, resulting in decreased carbon emissions and lower operational expenses for retailers.   The modular design of the proof-of-concept system promotes easy upgrades to next-generation CPU platforms so retailers can remain in sync with the latest technology advancements. The POS demo is customizable with a removable PC board and individual modules that can be added on, taken off, interchanged or replaced to meet evolving business needs.

Hall said there will be eight t-shirt making stations at four kiosks deployed throughout the 1,100 square-foot store. Users will have the opportunity to select from various t-shirt sizes and styles and will be able to choose from a catalog of over 100 artwork images featuring a variety of Disney characters, which can be included on the shirt.   Once the user has designed the t-shirt via the touchscreen, the design will be processed and electronically communicated to the store&apos;s t-shirt printing machine. The artwork will then be printed on the shirt, which can be ready in as little as 15 minutes, though Hall said the wait may be longer if a large number of customers are using the kiosks at once. Hall said the Design-A-Tee store is currently the only deployment to be given the green light, but if the kiosks are successful, his company might roll out more.   &quot;We think it&apos;s a pretty big idea, so we think there will probably be an opportunity to expand within the Disney network,&quot;Hall said, adding that Hanes has a marketing partnership with the entertainment giant.   He said his company took its time developing the kiosks, as there were significant challenges to overcome.   &quot;It&apos;s taken us two years to get the technology to work - to be able to print on multiple colored shirts,&quot;Hall said.&quot;It&apos;s not only white shirts. You can print on dark shirts. And we&apos;re using water-based ink, so it&apos;s environmentally friendly.&quot;   A grand opening for the store will be held on Friday, Jan. 9, 2009, according to a news release from Walt Disney World Resort. The event will be accompanied by balloon decor, confetti cannons, a giant t-shirt cake and a special visit from Mickey Mouse.

MenuSOS is offered as an enhancement to the CSS kiosk platform, which, according to a news release, is the only kiosk system to accept credit/debit cards and cash, validate and count currency, and store it directly to a business rated safe. Notes are deposited directly into a business rated safe and CSS kiosk security can be made ready for armored car pick-up.   MenuSOS offers rapid self-configuration through a scripted, user-friendly process that non-technical users can complete within a few hours. Restaurant and retail establishments would then have a working kiosk platform that would provide benefits to both the business ower and customers.   According to the release, customers will now have the ability to order and pay for products and services through a touchscreen interface. The design objective for the user interface was a superior customer experience that shed associations with order entry via a personal computer.   Business owners are able to service a greater number of customers without hiring additional staff. The MenuSOS will also enable small business owners to offer their customers the self-service options that have become increasingly popular at larger competitors. The MenuSOS module can also be used as a digital chalkboard to communicate daily specials and other information to customers.

 DAYTON, Ohio —NCR Corporation and Toronto-based Autologic Innovations have partnered to offer the automotive dealership industry in Canada an innovative self-service solution to provide easier and faster tracking of vehicle inventory and free up more time for customer service. 

 The new self-service tool provides dealerships with on-demand vehicle location and status —whether for inventory management or for customer test driving —and helps them improve operational efficiency while simplifying the customer test-drive process. 

 Autologic Innovations is an independent software developer and integrator of turnkey, real-time vehicle inventory management solutions. The company&apos;s Track-A-Lot software application integrates RFID, Wi-Fi and other wired/wireless technology, and the Internet. The latest enhancement to its Track-A-Lot system leverages the NCR EasyPoint Advantage kiosk. 

 All vehicles on a dealership lot are equipped with semi-active RFID tags. Staffers then use the NCR kiosk to read, record and track the tags associated with each vehicle. This allows dealers to not only improve vehicle monitoring and inventory management, but also enhance their theft prevention processes and eliminate the need to have staff manually count vehicles located in on- and off-site lots. 

 When a customer wishes to take a test drive, the salesperson simply waves the vehicle key fob (which contains the vehicle information number) at an RFID reader on the NCR kiosk, and the information is recorded in the Track-A-Lot system. The employee then uses the kiosk touchscreen to input the customer&apos;s name and driver&apos;s license number to complete the transaction. 

 &quot;Automating this process through self-service can help dealerships transform their business —improving staff efficiency and reducing paper as employees no longer need to make a hard copy record of each driver&apos;s license prior to the test drive,&quot;said Paul Gautier, national director of Retail Channels for NCR in Canada.&quot;More importantly, employees spend less time searching for vehicles and more time with customers, which can ultimately help increase sales.&quot;

The program will be expanded to Los Angeles and San Diego Airports in California and Miami International and West Palm Beach Airports in Florida. In addition Simply Wheelz will be available at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.   First launched in September 2007, the expansion is based upon the success of Simply Wheelz in Orlando. With low, competitive rates starting as low as $99 a week through December 15, 2008, Simply Wheelz offers an easy-to-use Web site for reservations ( www.SimplyWheelz.com ), and a self-service rental kiosk to rent vehicles. Simply Wheelz accepts third party reservations, via travel agents and online booking channels, and reservations via its Web site. 
&quot;Following the consumer popularity of our pilot program in Orlando, it&apos;s only natural we expand Simply Wheelz into additional leisure destinations,&quot;said Mark P. Frissora, chairman and chief executive of The Hertz Corp.&quot;While there are numerous economic headwinds facing the American public, people continue to travel. Trip dynamics are evolving, and Simply Wheelz targets the 60 percent of leisure travelers who now book their car rentals online, as well as those primarily focused on price.&quot; 
Designed for online customers looking for a low price from recognized companies, Simply Wheelz makes car rental economical and hassle-free. Customers reserve one of the six vehicle types (from economy to fullsize plus SUVs and convertibles) offered and, when arriving at the Hertz airport location, rent cars using a self-service rental kiosk. The kiosk scans a bar code from a printed online reservation or the renter&apos;s driver&apos;s license, the customer selects a few additional options, such as child seats or GPS and insurance/waiver options, and then a vehicle is assigned and the kiosk prints the rental agreement. Once the rental transaction is completed, customers go can to their car and proceed off the lot.

The Netkey Software Platform is a scalable suite of applications and management software modules designed to help retailers quickly develop and operate media-rich kiosk and digital-signage systems. As a long-standing IBM business partner and independent software vendor, Netkey has several solutions that have been validated by IBM for use with the IBM Anyplace Kiosk.   &quot;In today&apos;s challenging economy, retailers are increasingly turning to self-service kiosks and digital signage as valuable tools to enhance the customer experience, improve employee performance, and generate sustainable returns,&quot;said V.

Even consumers who used to be inclined to purchase films are now renting instead, and as the winter approaches, this increase in rentals will be even more evident as people will want to stay indoors with their families.   As the rental industry continues to prosper, many savvy investors are making a relatively small investment in DVD rental kiosks in anticipation of large returns.   &quot;We can&apos;t control the economy, but we can control the way we react to it, and, whether we prosper or lose,&quot;said Scott McInnes, chief executive of DVDNow Kiosks. &quot;No one hopes for a recession, but I am pleased that our DVDNow kiosk owners are in a position to do very well regardless of the state of the economy.&quot; POSTED BY: AT 03:31 pm  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Thursday, 23 October 2008 U.K. retailer HMV to deploy MP3 download kiosks T3 Online: U.K. entertainment retailer HMV has announced plans for one of its&quot;next-generation&quot;stores to be opened in London. HMV&apos;s next-generation stores will be focusing on digital music, providing customers with interactive digital kiosks that allow them to preview, purchase and download MP3s that can then be stored on any USB stick or memory card. These kiosks, although not likely to make CDs redundant, could affect CD sales, as lack of packaging should in theory means lower prices for customers. If HMV wants its music-download kiosks to compete with the likes of iTunes, however, a pricing war with the download giants might be necessary.

Having installed SHOW/PRO kiosks in each of its five San Diego stores, Jerome&apos;s Furniture incorporated the consumer self-service kiosk system into its sales process, pre-approving consumers for in-store credit and registering customers for incentives. The result was a significant increase in average tickets for customers who first used the kiosk system to gain credit approval. When consumers know their own purchasing power, and the retailer&apos;s sales associates do as well, sales tickets tend to be larger.   Click to continue POSTED BY: AT 03:28 pm  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Tuesday, 21 October 2008 Fiserv, PayScan America partner for &apos;smart barcode&apos; self-service billpay solution BROOKFIELD, Wis.—Fiserv Inc., a provider of information technology services to the financial industry, announced that it has partnered with PayScan America Inc., obtaining exclusive rights to license PayScan&apos;s patented barcode bill payment process. By utilizing the PayScan barcode bill payment process and the Fiserv CheckFreePay Link platform, CheckFreePay will be able to offer an enhanced retail payment solution that will enable walk-in consumers to pay their household bills quickly and easily at retail checkout lanes and self-service kiosks.
 
This enhanced retail payment solution will use a&quot;smart barcode&quot;on the bill to record processing rules, including relevant payment data from a customer bill such as the account number. By scanning the bill at an existing retail point-of-sale terminal, a cashier or consumer can easily submit a payment without manual data entry.
 
&quot;We believe in-lane bill payment services will transform the walk-in bill payment landscape,&quot;said Paul Harrison, senior vice president and general manager of Fiserv&apos;s CheckFreePay business.&quot;For retailers, it will provide a more efficient walk-in bill payment process that leverages point-of-sale barcoding to reduce the chance for error. Billers could realize reduced processing costs, while their customers will enjoy a more convenient payment experience.&quot;
 
&quot;Retail locations provide a convenient and cost-effective option for the 40 million consumer households that prefer to pay their bills in cash and in person,&quot;said Jennifer Roth, research director, global payments, TowerGroup.&quot;Offering in-person, in-lane bill payments at retail point-of-sale registers will serve traditional walk-in bill payment customers, but will also appeal to consumers who typically pay by mail. This represents the next step in delivering automated efficiency and convenience in the walk-in bill payment market.&quot;
 
Today, retailers that offer walk-in bill payment services generally do so at customer service counters or other, separate locations within the store, because they cannot effectively handle bill payment in-lane. CheckFreePay Link with the in-lane bill payment option will offer retailers a solution that will allow consumers to pay their household bills while purchasing groceries and other household items in the checkout lane, creating a better customer service experience for consumers.

Dubbed the KIOSK Element, the NEMA-rated self-service device made its first public outing yesterday at the New York City edition of the KioskCom Self Service Expo, co-located again with The Digital Signage Show. 
The turnkey kiosk can work as a stand-alone or a through-the-wall, and can accommodate any feature mix with peripheral options, including an outdoor credit-card reader, keyboard, receipt printer and barcode scanner. Two high-brite LCDs (one 17-inch and one 19-inch) allow for second-screen advertising and attract-loops for branding, quick consumer adoption and faster ROI. An overhead customer shelter also is available.   “The benefit the KIOSK Element introduces is a new economy of standardized design in outdoor self-service, eliminating the key barrier of entry for many viable deployments,”said Tom Weaver, chief marketing officer for KIOSK, in a release.   “While the major ticketing and entertainment companies have paved the way for outdoor self-service, there are also a number of hospitality, rental, check-in and parking applications that are nicely positioned to reap the benefits of a much improved price point.” POSTED BY: AT 03:05 pm  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Thursday, 16 October 2008 KIOSKCOM: Curiosk wine kiosk in pilot NEW YORK— One of the newest kiosks on hand at the KioskCom Self-Service Expo Wednesday was Curiosk Marketing Solutions’wine kiosk.

Using a touchscreen, in less than a minute, users can select wines, get tasting notes and food pairing information, and create a preset or typed personal greeting to attach to the bottle of wine if given as a gift.   “The initial response from consumers using it is the wow factor,”said David Weinberg, president of Curiosk.“When they see the information and how easy it is to get, they’re excited. Then when they realize they can print a card, they’re ecstatic because it’s one-stop shopping. If they’re going to a dinner party, they can buy the wine, get the card.” POSTED BY: AT 03:04 pm  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Thursday, 16 October 2008 KIOSKCOM: NCR unveils SelfServ 60 kiosk line, announces reseller deal NEW YORK—The KioskCom Self Service Expo opened in the heart of Midtown, Manhattan, with two significant announcements from NCR Corp.   NCR pulled the sheet off its new point-of-decision kiosk—the NCR SelfServ 60, which is designed to provide an interactive experience for the consumer in order to buoy them along through the purchasing process.   According to a news release distributed at the show, the NCR SelfServ 60 is customizable to help enhance a business’s brand. Deployers can choose from a number of configuration and design options, such as brand color and logos. Multiple mounting options also are available.

 The NCR SelfServe 60 integrates Intel vPro technology, has a slim, sleek form-factor, and represents a leap forward from its predecessor, the EasyPoint 42. 
 The NCR SelfServ 60 integrates Intel vPro technology, including the next-generation Intel Core 2 Duo processor and Mobile Intel GM45 Express chipset. With these technologies, the kiosk can run more advanced, engaging self-service applications, NCR says, creating an enhanced experience for consumers and the opportunity for companies to offer increasingly complex transactions. Intel vPro technology maximizes system availability for businesses with“out-of-band”manageability and serviceability—meaning diagnostics can be accomplished remotely.   Donna Stevens, product manager for kiosk infrastructure at NCR, says the new SelfServ 60 is a substantial improvement over its predecessor, the EasyPoint 42.   “Nowadays, people want kiosks to have a slim, sleek form-factor to really show off that modern iPod look, and really capture the aesthetics and the marketing and the branding that (our) customers want to portray to their self-service customers–to the consumers,”Stevens said.   “The EasyPoint 42, while an all-in-one integrated footprint, didn’t have the feature functionality and the slim form-factor that this new unit has, because of the new technology and our ability to integrate that.”   During the show, Peter R. Charpentier used a SelfServ 60 kiosk to demo a retail application that lets users speak live, one-on-one, with customer-service representatives in remote locations. The customer-service representative, who just so happened to be on the West Coast, appeared on the screen during a demo at the show to greet show goers in New York.   That application is the result of a reseller agreement between NCR and Experticity. The agreement, also announced during the expo, allows NCR to resell the Experticity multichannel technology platform worldwide.   Attendance numbers for KioskCom are not yet available, though Lawrence Dvorchik, general manager of the show, says he expects a 32 percent increase in pre-qualified, pre-registered attendants from last year. KioskCom runs Oct. 15-16 in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York.

Building on the real-world intelligence gathered from thousands of existing Freedom deployments, MTI designed Universal 2.0 with both modern retail environments and unparalleled consumer experience in mind.   Like MTI&apos;s other Freedom platforms, Universal 2.0 continues to provide power and security to a broad range of handheld products such as digital cameras, camcorders, GPS products and mobile phones. However, Universal 2.0&apos;s new design provides a significantly reduced footprint, never distracting from or diminishing the&quot;hero&quot;effect of today&apos;s ever-smaller, must-have products. The new design also includes a host of new features such as: an integrated rotating 360-degree swivel to prevent cable twist and greatly increase retractor life; 270-degree viewable LED light ring to spotlight product and provide visual security; and enhanced security modules that feature advanced battery back-up capabilities.   Universal 2.0&apos;s programmable multi-color light rings not only enhance the look of the display, but can seamlessly connect with MTI&apos;s SKU activated merchandising system (Intuition Lift) for interactive content and color-guided product selection based on user engagement.   This system triggers sku-specific information based on customer interaction. Depending on the product displayed, messaging can drive sales through simulated ownership experiences, explanation of hidden features and benefits, product comparisons or suggestive selling of accessories. This interactive experience has been shown to both increase sales and decrease product returns, as an educated shopper becomes a more confident owner.     Freedom Universal 2.0 is also backwards compatible, allowing it to work seamlessly with Freedom 1.0 components, including smart cables, making it a more enhanced, low-cost upgrade option for retailers already using MTI&apos;s Freedom Universal line of displays.

The initiative will combine technologies developed by the companies, and is aimed at meeting the explosive demand for easier access to high-quality digital entertainment and other content.    Under the initiative, consumers will download digital content to Secure Digital cards and portable devices such as mobile phones through kiosks and other self-service devices deployed, integrated and maintained by NCR at retail stores, airports, quick-service restaurants and other outlets. Toshiba will develop dedicated set-top boxes for the service, and develop and market high-capacity SD cards for the system, improving the speed of downloads in the future.    The kiosks and other self-service devices will use the MOD Retail Enterprise System for&quot;multichannel&quot;digital media delivery, which enables digital content to be managed and distributed securely using portable devices and portable storage media, including SD memory cards.    &quot;This technology and initiative have tremendous potential,&quot;said Bill Nuti, chairman and chief executive of NCR.&quot;We continue to see opportunities to extend our experience in self-service to promising new industries like entertainment. Our initiative with MOD Systems is designed to offer consumers one of the fastest, most convenient ways to access high-quality digital entertainment.&quot;   MOD Systems provides retailers with a complete digital media system for consumers to load entertainment to portable devices and storage media, or burn content to an optical format (CD/DVD). The MOD Retail Enterprise System, deployed with leading global retailers, supports all content types and distribution scenarios including manufacturing-on-demand, delivery in optical or digital format, and hybrid online and in-store systems. Video entertainment content will be provided by major and independent studios, which will provide approximately 4,000 titles at the launch of the service. Initial content downloads will be in standard definition, and the service may also be applied to downloads of high definition content in the future.    &quot;Digital media has not been able to truly impact sales at retail and therefore has not become truly pervasive and accessible to all consumers,&quot;said Mark E.

New prescriptions are submitted via kiosk while refill requests can be made via kiosk, phone or Web. Once the request is made, the patient receives a barcoded receipt and the request is forwarded to the pharmacist. When the order is ready, an e-mail, phone or text alert is generated and sent directly to the customer, who presents the barcoded receipt to the cashier or pays for the prescription on the kiosk.   According to a 2007 study conducted by Wilson Health Information, an independent health-care consumer research company, convenience is one of the top three drivers of pharmacy customer satisfaction along with price and overall professional services. The same study also found that short lines, convenient store hours and 24-hour pharmacy access are key drivers to customer satisfaction.   A leader in self-service solutions across industries, NCR is extending the dependability, ease of use and convenience of its self-service solutions to new areas, including health care.   &quot;Retail pharmacies face a significant challenge when it comes to meeting consumer demands and building loyalty,&quot;said Chakri Toleti, vice president of health care industry marketing for NCR.&quot;Self-service technology gives pharmacies the opportunity to minimize wait times for their customers—a key factor for increasing satisfaction and overall convenience. It also enables pharmacists to spend less time receiving prescriptions, which frees them up to focus on more productive tasks, such as answering medication-specific questions.&quot;   The pharmacy drop off solution also allows pharmacies to target the distribution of relevant health information to customers. When picking up prescriptions, customers have the option of printing information about specific drugs or conditions at the kiosk or requesting that this information be sent to them as an e-mail.

Nero is able to deliver on this new content frontier because of its commitment to aligning and developing with industry open standards, such as those put in place by the DVD Forum, and platform interoperability.   Polar Frog Digital is the only on-demand company to offer the ability to burn, buy, download and rent multiple medias. This is made possible by their adoption of Nero’s vision for liquid content distribution and creation options for consumers. With the Polar Frog solution consumers have the ability to choose where and when they want to buy their media. Agnostic delivery options will serve to expand the sales of media in traditional and nontraditional retail channels alike.   Each year thousands of movies, television programs, educational and special-interest titles are created. However, due to shrinking shelf space and cost of manufacturing, only a fraction will become available on DVD, and fewer still will remain available six months after release. By using kiosks, retailers can stock an entire physical DVD inventory in as little as two square feet of store space. Gone are the days of needing to anticipate how many copies of a new title release to have on hand or worrying about DVD theft. With a kiosk format, inventory&quot;shrinkage&quot;can be eliminated and retailers are able to offer their consumers an unlimited quantity and assortment.   &quot; On-demand manufacturing of commercially released DVD video content will revolutionize both the retail marketplace and the way that consumers experience and access video,”said Todd Rosenbaum, chief executive of Polar Frog Digital.   With the joint Nero/Polar Frog Digital solution, consumers will have access to a full range of commercial video copy-protected content with Content Scrambling System (CSS) encryption.   Available in late 2008, the offering will be based on Polar Frog Digital&apos;s patented&quot;DVD On Demand&quot;software and licensed library of digital movie and television content. This library is the world&apos;s largest database of on-demand content available at retail.

Recruit Co Ltd., a company in Japan, is using a kiosk with a 42-inch LCD screen and a scent diffuser that emits the smell of delicious cooked food in an underground mall in Tokyo.

No other product globally has the technology and options that eSoles will provide countless retailers looking to enhance their customer experience and sales.&quot;   Through their years of fitting people with ePro footbeds, eSoles has retained the largest database of foot images in the world, allowing it to perfect the development and science behind its eFit semi-custom footbeds. By using its database and comparing it to scans that are performed by its 3D Kiosk, the patented eSoles technology can direct store personnel to construct an eFit semi- custom footbed by fitting it with unique modular components that are tailored to the customer&apos;s foot.   Replacing art with science, the 3D TruCapture Kiosk Scanning System is the only one of its kind that scans the foot with a Bio-Dynamic air pillow to get a truly three dimensional scan and includes a touchscreen computer monitor, a pressure mat, an air bladder foot receiver and a 3D image scanner and printer. The self-service kiosk can be used in virtually any retail setting and allows consumers to receive a complex scan of their foot. The kiosk then creates a personalized printout that the consumer can present to a participating retailer to purchase either an eFit footbed in less than five minutes or an ePro footbed within a week. The ePro product, ranging in price from $250 to $300, is a fully customized footbed that the customer can order from the company&apos;s production facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, and receive within five to seven business days. POSTED BY: AT 09:54 am  |   Permalink   |   0 Comments   |   E-mail this Thursday, 24 July 2008 Nisa trials DVD-rental kiosks for retail stores in Europe CHELTENHAM, England—Nisa, a retail brand in the U.K., recently has announced news of a trial of DVD-rental technology in one of its biggest U.K. stores, according to a news release.   In response to the growing demand for product diversification in the retail sector, Nisa have launched a DVD-rental kiosk in a Cardiff, Wales, store with a plan to roll the product out across the group should the trial prove successful. This is in addition to recent kiosk launches in both Threshers and Spar stores in England. The DVD kiosk retail complement model has proved extremely successful in the United States with Wal-Mart launching the kiosks in all of its stores across the country.   With the growing demand for convenience in the home entertainment industry, traditional DVD rental stores have seen a downturn in trade that has led to both independent and national store closures. However, DVD-rental kiosks have been touted as a modern, convenient alternative to traditional DVD rental. One Gloucestershire-based company recently has launched kiosks in some of the U.K. and Ireland&apos;s leading retail groups with a view to developing the product into an essential part of the modern retail outlet.   Carlos Marco, managing director at The Movie Booth, said,“We have been working in this sector for several years now and what we have learned is that the retail industry is by far the best market for our product. We are now well-placed in many of the biggest retail names in the business, and expect kiosks placed in supermarkets, off-licences and convenience stores to be the most successful that we launch.”   The kiosk deployed in Nisa Extra signals the group’s intention to place DVD kiosks in stores across the U.K. as a means of increasing the range of in-store product offerings. The kiosks also have recently launched in Centra and Applegreen stores in Ireland, and have spread to off-licences with the first Movie Booth kiosk being launched in a Threshers store last week. Store owner Deborah Harris said,“I see many people going to supermarkets to buy DVD’s that they will only watch once or twice, and they are expensive. Oswestry’s DVD store closed down several months ago and there was nowhere to rent a DVD in town. With money being a squeeze at the moment, it’s now a fact that people are spending more time at home with their friends and family. The kiosk enables us to fill that gap in the market.”The Spar group will launc its first DVD kiosk at the end of July in Formby, Liverpool.   The expansion of DVD vending across the retail sector mirrors the growth that has occurred in the United States in recent years. In America, DVD-rental machines now outnumber the amount of traditional DVD rental stores, and the 7,000 machines in operation have been placed predominantly in grocery and convenience stores.
