QSR vs. coffee house franchise success: the world of quick service restaurants, or QSR as industry insiders like to say, is a very specialized area of the retail business. Where else does a business procure inventory, process, package and sell its products all under one roof?

The specialty coffee industry is run under a similar business
model, which is that of QSR QSR Quick Service Restaurant

variables impacting the business. Yet the customer experience feels very
different in a coffee house than it does in a McDonald&apos;s,
Wendy&apos;s or a Pizza Hut. Even the &quot;fast casual&quot; players
like Baja Fresh Baja Fresh is a restaurant chain of Fresh Mex restaurants founded in Newbury Park, California, United States in 1990 by Jim and Linda Magglos. Categorized as a &quot;fast-casual&quot; restaurant, the quality and preparation time of its food is between that of a fast-food restaurant and a  and Rubio&apos;s feel and operate differently than a

What are some of the other basic differences between a QSR
franchise and coffee house franchise? And, as a potential franchisee, do
these differences matter? Also, would there be any operational barriers
to a QSR franchisee if he/she wanted to become a coffee house
franchisee? These questions become increasingly important as more coffee
house brands utilize franchising to expand their points of distribution.

necessary to build new units.

It is unlikely we will see another Starbucks-like system emerge in
the coffee house business, or even the QSR business. Therefore, the
logical alternative to the company-store expansion is franchising.

Franchise selection is an important process. When potential
franchisees seek the type of investment they are best suited for, they
should consider the fundamental differences in the types of businesses
they are analyzing.

Put The Serve in Customer Service

Some of the differences between QSR and traditional coffee houses,
such as &quot;Peet&apos;s&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s A Grind,&quot; are
based in two primary areas: service and menus.

One basic difference is service and service speed. QSR are
notorious for transactional service. The goal is to take the order,
collect payment and deliver the food within a very quick time period.
Experience is subordinated to speed. Timers are used and bonuses or
rewards delivered for the quickest service in a given period.

Equipment is calibrated cal·i·brate  
 tr.v. cal·i·brat·ed , cal·i·brat·ing , cal·i·brates 
 1. To check, adjust, or determine by comparison with a standard (the graduations of a quantitative measuring instrument):  and food is formulated to maximize cook
times and produce a product in as little time as possible. Meals are
also packaged with side items so customers can order more rapidly. While
QSR training has its elements of making the transaction pleasant, it
isn&apos;t called &quot;fast food&quot; for nothing!

Traditional coffee houses turn that notion around and place less
emphasis on speed of service. There is a little more emphasis on the
artistic nature of the product, as well as some customer interaction
during the process.

The barista barista 
 Noun 

a person who makes and sells coffee in a coffee bar  who knows the name of the customer, and can start the
drink before they even pay for it, is an invaluable marketer for a
coffee house. Interaction with the cashier CASHIER. An officer of a moneyed institution, who is entitled by virtue of his office to take care of the cash or money of such institution.
    2. The cashier of a bank is usually entrusted with all the funds of the bank, its notes, bills, and other choses in  and a comment about the daily
news are not only welcome, but are also expected.

The personal touch that is more prevalent in coffee houses includes
more interaction with the customers. It also requires a little loosening
of the rules. Taking the time to chat with a customer might mean that
the person behind them waits a little longer. A service time goal might
not be met, yet that brief interlude interlude,  development in the late 15th cent. of the English medieval morality play. Played between the acts of a long play, the interlude, treating intellectual rather than moral topics, often contained elements of satire or farce.  on the way to work makes people
come back, creating loyalty. While it is commonplace at the neighborhood
coffee shop, you don&apos;t seem to find much of this at a
McDonald&apos;s or Burger King.

Customized Menus

Customization of menu items is another unique approach to coffee
houses. The non-fat, triple-shot mocha Mocha   (mō`kə) , town (1990 est. pop. 2,000), S Yemen, a port on the Red Sea. It was noted for the export of the coffee to which it gave its name but declined as a trading port in the late 19th cent. with the rise of Hodeida and Aden.  extra hot is easily and happily
accommodated, even when you don&apos;t find it on the menu. Baristas are
pleased to make your drink exactly like you want it. In a traditional
QSR, that type of customization does not work very well because of the
over-systemization of operations.

Equipment and processes are designed to produce a product only one
way, and that is their way. Ask a McDonald&apos;s cashier to leave the pickles Pickles may refer to
 Pickled cucumber Other vegetables that have been pickled Pickles (comic strip), a comic strip by Brian Crane Pickles (dog), the dog that found the World Cup trophy in 1966 &quot;Pickles&quot; ( 
  off your burger, and the whole place comes to a screeching halt
until your &quot;custom&quot; order is finished.

Relationship Marketing vs. Advertising

The strategy for marketing coffee houses also sets this category
apart from traditional QSRs. A slick, big-budget advertising campaign
that relies on a heavy media buy may not necessarily be the best way for
a coffee house chain to build its brand. Cause-related marketing and
community involvement are key components in the coffee house marketing
strategy.

 b. An innovative or unusual mechanical contrivance; a gadget.  characters may find the more sincere
approach a severe change from QSR marketing--and perhaps more
challenging. Coffee houses tend to be more integral members of the
community, and therefore foster more loyalty.

The Mystery of Coffee

Another basic difference between QSR and coffee houses is the
product itself. There is a bit of mystery about coffee. The origins of
coffee Coffee was first cultivated in the Ethiopian highlands. It remained confined to that country until coffee beans were exported from Ethiopia to Yemen. The Arabs called it qahwe (wine) and the Turks called it kahve . , the way it is roasted, and the flavor brings a mystique mys·tique  
 n. 
An aura of heightened value, interest, or meaning surrounding something, arising from attitudes and beliefs that impute special power or mystery to it: the cowboy mystique; the mystique of existentialism.  to the
business that is absent from traditional quick service restaurants.

Coffee is harvested in far-away places that most people will never
visit. Coffee houses are able to transport customers to exotic places
with the imagery and story of where the product is harvested. Generally
speaking, consumers know very little about coffee, yet they consume
large quantities of it. Their interest allows coffee retailers to tell
the story of coffee with all the interesting facts and lore 1. Lore - Object-oriented language for knowledge representation. &quot;Etude et Realisation d&apos;un Language Objet: LORE&quot;, Y. Caseau, These, Paris-Sud, Nov 1987.
 2. Lore - CGE, Marcoussis, France. Set-based language E-mail: Christophe Dony  of the bean.
Leveraging this mystique allows coffee house brands to differentiate
themselves from each other, and from other QSR.

Romancing hamburgers or fried chicken Fried chicken is chicken which is dipped in a breading mixture and then deep fried, pan fried or pressure fried. The breading seals in the juices but also absorbs the fat of the fryer, which is sometimes seen as unhealthy.  is quite different, since the
products themselves have little mystique, and any attempt to market
these products in a manner similar to coffee would be disingenuous dis·in·gen·u·ous  
 adj. 
 1. Not straightforward or candid; insincere or calculating: &quot;an ambitious, disingenuous, philistine, and hypocritical operator, who ... exemplified ...  and
likely to fail. Consumers basically know how beef and poultry products
are harvested. There is little mystery about the process, and when it
comes right down to it, consumers really don&apos;t want to know too
much about how those products got to their plate.

Management Groups as Franchisees

Big QSR companies also tend to prefer large, multi-unit franchise
management groups as franchisees. These groups are large companies with
their own corporate structures and hierarchies. QSR franchisors believe
these larger groups are better capitalized and easier to manage than the
individual franchisee.

The big QSR players didn&apos;t start out that way. They built
their systems with single-store franchisees that either evolved into
larger players, sold-out to the franchisor, or sold to a multi-unit
franchisee. While a few, like KFC KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken (restaurant chain) 
KFC Kenya Flower Council
KFC Kitchen Fresh Chicken (Kentucky Fried Chicken motto) 
KFC Kung Fu Cult (Cinema) 
KFC Kitchen Fixed Charge  have continued to resist
consolidation, large franchise brands have moved to larger multi-unit
franchise entities.

It is unclear whether coffee house franchisors will develop their
brands with large franchisees or go the route of the individual
franchisee. One thing is clear, however, and that is that successful
franchise brands usually go through a consolidation stage. The smaller
franchisees get gobbled up, creating larger franchisee entities.
Franchised coffee house brands will surely go through this same type of
consolidation.

As the mega QSR--like Dunkin Donuts donuts - (Obsolete) A collective noun for any set of memory bits. This usage is extremely archaic and may no longer be live jargon; it dates from the days of ferrite core memories in which each bit was implemented by a doughnut-shaped magnetic flip-flop. , with its fiercely loyal
customer base--rush into the specialty coffee business, there are
questions that remain. Will they build new specialty coffee lovers,
steal from your customer base, or fail to credibly cross the bridge from
a QSR mentality to the unique characteristics of a successful specialty
coffee house franchise chain? We will discuss this further in next
month&apos;s issue.
