 Displaying 1 - 3 of 3 Reviews Found Sort: Useful | Helpful | Reviews | Date Disgusting Food By epicurious of Burnaby, BC (507 Reviews) Submitted Thursday, April 21, 2011 - 3:34pm [Dine in] 
Yes, I brought it on myself to eat food here but I still feel the need to warn people.

I was in a hurry and was starving - I wanted something quick and hot. Well, hot it was, but quick it wasn&apos;t (took about 15 mins). I ordered the special of the day - easy, no hassle. It was a swiss and mushroom burger combo for $8.

I&apos;ve had ice-cream here and have no complaints, but the food...ugh. I was watching the line cook make my burger because there really wasn&apos;t anything else to do while I was waiting. He took a pre-cooked burger patty, threw it in the microwave zapper. Took a Styrofoam cup of mushrooms and threw that in another microwave - styrofoam!! Took out a block of cheese, fondled it with ungloved hands for a minute trying to get the pieces to separate. Then he put the &quot;burger&quot; together, wrapped up and threw it in the microwave yet again. The end product, an over-microwaved soppy mess. The only thing he &quot;cooked&quot; was the fries. Which were fresh and hot and the only thing I ate after bravely trying 2 bites of the burger.

So yes, I&apos;ve learned my lesson. Eat somewhere else.

 Good Place For Casual Meetings By A Fatty of North Burnaby, BC (75 Reviews) Submitted Sunday, April 25, 2010 - 10:48pm [Dine in] 
Although this place is small, usually there aren&apos;t many people. This place is also a good place to get ice cream cakes for birthdays, etc. The food here is just like any other fast food restaurant... Greasy and can&apos;t go wrong. However, this branch tends to overdo the beef patties in their burgers, making it hard to chew on.

 Small Portions!!! By Balmy of Burnaby (51 Reviews) Submitted Monday, May 18, 2009 - 11:42am [Dine in] 
I was in the area and decided to order off of the DQ Sweet Deals. It is a menu of nine food different items. I choose the 3 items for $5 option. The size isn&apos;t consistent between locations. In this location, the chicken wrap only had one small piece of lettuce that looked like leftovers from the original bag it came from. There was barely any sauce in the wrap. So basicially, I paid for the piece of chicken and the shell. Cheeseburger was decent. Can&apos;t go wrong with that one. Small chocolate dipped cone was half the usual size you would normally get. Maybe it&apos;s just a bad day in which they were running out of supplies or the staff just didn&apos;t know how to make items that are consistent with other locations. I ordered take out so I didn&apos;t get a good look of my food and didn&apos;t say anything about the chocolate dipped cone. The staff were making them really small for other customers so I figured to not bother asking them to fix it. I will go to a different location next time.

Service was fine. You order and wait for your food. Ambiance is like any other fast food restaurant.
