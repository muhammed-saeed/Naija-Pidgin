 How do I get a quote and book a shipment ?

In some cases our rates are competitive with airline shipping. Final pricing will
be determined by distance of transport, size of dog and location of pick up and
drop off. All shipping rates are flat rate fees with no added or hidden costs.
Tipping is appreciated! Call or text for quotes (985-516-6713)

To book a transport a work order must be completed and to guarantee the
transport a $100.00 per dog deposit must be provided. The deposit reserves a
crate on our van for your dog.

In some cases full payment for transport may be required. We accept Master
Card, Visa, Paypal and Moneygram. A work order includes name, city and
phone number of shipper and receiver. Number of dog(s), size, weight, breed
and color. Pick and drop off locations, ect.

 What does it cost to ship a dog ?

To determine shipping costs you must call David and he will provide you with a
quote. All quotes are flat rates with no additional fees involved. We have not
raised our rates for three years but our cost of doing business, fuel and
expenses has gone up. In order to remain competitive, we provide two rates.
Interstate to Interstate and Door to Door. We have found over the years that
most people would prefer to save the money and drive a few miles to meet us
at an interstate exit closest to their house. We have also found that door to
door is a hassle for some people that work for a living. Most people are not
home during the day and find it easier to meet near or at their place of work of
close to the interstate or major 4 lane highway but the option is left up to you.

 Do you coordinate around our work, vacation and holiday schedule for
transports ?

We are like UPS or FED EX and it is very difficult to work around someones
work schedule for pick up and deliveries. You will have to provide a backup plan
if you are unavailable during a pick up or drop off. We have tried to work
around work schedules, vacations and holiday plans in the past but have found
it impossible to coordinate. Have a friend or relative on standby in the event
that you cannot make the pick up or drop off. We provide a minimum 24 hour
notice on meeting clients. We also have our daily schedule posted on our site.
 ROUTE.

 We learned that communication is very important and we normally call or text
numerous times to update the route and schedule. We also update our
schedule on our web site daily. ROUTE You will find that we are easy to get in
touch with while on the road. 

NOTE: We pride ourself of being on time. Delivery and Pick Up times are not
guaranteed until 24 hours before the appointment. Weather, Highway 
Construction, Accidents and other delays occur and may alter a schedule. Dog
Transport is not an exact science . We do provide a rough 7-10 or so day
schedule but normally it changes due to above conditions. During winter
months all bets are off and safety concerns are our top priority. Ice and Snow
storms delay all pet transporters.

 Why should you use ground shipping?

 As a breeder for 25 years we had used airline shipping but became
disenchanted with dealing with heat restrictions, cold restrictions, cancellations
and discrimination. In 2002 we began using ground shipping and found it to be
a much easier less traumatic on the pet and less hassle. For us ground shipping
is a much better alternative. In some situations airline shipping may be your
best option. Our position has always been that ground shipping is an alternative
to airline shipping.

 Are you a coast to coast transporter?

 No Coast to Coast at this time but we have professional business associates
that we can recommend.

 Do I need a crate or do you provide crates ?

One of the advantages to ground shipping is that you do not need to buy a
crate. Crates now cost from $30 - $100. We provide the crates in our van.
Note: You do not receive a crate when the delivery is made. Our crates are of
the highest quality and are disinfected after each use.

 If my puppy of dog dies in transport will you cover the damages ?

 Cajun P et Express provides u p to $1 200.00 insurance police free of charge for
 injury, death lost or stolen sustained during our care due to negligence.
 Note: We have never had a puppy or dog die while in our transport due to our
negligence, although it is possible death may occur but highly unlikely. Death
from pre-existing health conditions are not covered. See Insurance We take
the utmost care for your dog. We treat your animal as if it was our own! We
have 6 years of injury and accident free experience shipping dogs to back up
our disclaimer.

 How long does it take to transport my dog ?

 It depends on the route. We start our route in the New Orleans area. The
national average for a transport, according to the U.S.D.A., is 3.5 days. Our
goal is to keep your pup or dog in our care as minimal as possible. Our average
transport takes 1 to 5 days. Some transports may take up to 5.5 days and in
very rare cased 7 days. All parties involved will be informed prior to shipping
arrangements as to the approximate length of shipping time before any final
agreement is made. Normally we will not take on a job if we know in advance it
will take more that 7 days while other companies will.

 Health Certificate and Rabies Tags ?

 While a health certificate does not guarantee that an animal is 100% healthy or
free from infectious diseases, it does provide some benefits for not only the
shipper but also the receiver of the pet. A licensed veterinarian will not issue a
health certificate on an animal that is sick or unhealthy or has been used for
fighting. This protects the buyer from getting stuck with a sick pet. It also
protects the shipper from boarding a pet that may infect other pets in the van.
A health certificate also provides clues as to why and when a puppy may have
contracted a disease. Rabies Tag are required for ground shippers by State
regulations if a pet is shipped across states lines.

 Do you board dogs at your facility ?

 We do not board dogs at our facility.
