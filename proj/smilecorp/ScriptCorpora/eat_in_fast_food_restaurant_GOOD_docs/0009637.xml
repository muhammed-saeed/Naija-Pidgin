Standing in line for an hour for two pieces of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and corn is not worth it. But when it comes to seeing a glimpse of filipino heaven (fried chicken and cute pinays) then it&apos;s a whole different story.

Securities all over the place and the line backing up all the way to Waipahu Cafe i kept telling myself that this place better be worth it. Looking over the menu you only have a few selections to choose from, from fried chicken, burgers, spaghetti/palabok with chicken, to burger steak and desserts.

The service was alright with people directing you where to stand in line but my cashier wasn&apos;t really trained well. She didn&apos;t know how to refill the receipt paper, and i kept repeating my order to her because she kept forgetting. The portions seemed a bit small at first but honestly it&apos;s just right. The corn was really good with a nice bite to it and the chicken was alright but once you dip it in gravy then it&apos;s a lot better. My friend got the spaghetti with chicken and he said it was alright as well.

If you want to try this place then i suggest you wait a week or so for the hype to die down, and Red Ribbon isn&apos;t even open yet.

Did this place live up to it&apos;s fast food expectations, SURE DID! Is it worth the drive from town to Waipahu? NEGATIVE!

**my advice, learn how to make your own Spaghetti and Palabok and just order fried chicken from KFC or POPEYES CHICKEN if you&apos;re in the town area and crave those food item. Save you the trip, gas and waiting in line LOL**

Finally checked this place out, line wasn&apos;t that long. Thank gosh! After hearing how crazy this place was I was afraid I was gonna be trapped in Waipahu for days!!!

It was still busy with a handful of crowds but surprisingly their service was quick, knowing I wasn&apos;t planning to come back here for a while the bf and I wanted to make the trip worthwhile and each got a combo plate #9 - fried chicken w/ spaghetti and a #10 - fried chicken w/ Palabok, didn&apos;t bother to order the burgers  and fries because we can always get those anywhere else.

The food was quite tasty. Chicken was crispy and not greasy at all, they also give you a side of gravy to go with your chicken the bf loved it, me not so much. I like my fried chicken with HOT SAUCE. Spaghetti was your typical Filipino style sweet with hot dogs kinda tasted like chef boyardee with a FILIPINO kick to it! Palabok was yummy a little on the dry side and not enough sauce and the main condiments you would normally have on there but the taste was there, wished they gave real calamansi instead of a lemon juice packet.

Of course we had to go with a bang and order HALO HALO, that was refreshing! but again could&apos;ve added more leche flan and ube ice cream portion of the two were   tiny!

Rating overall 3 STARS: LOCATION, SERVICE, PRICE&amp;FOOD

I finally gave in to this place after staying away for months! I never heard of Jollibee until it came to the Hawaii, I know a little disappointing on my part because I am Filipino! But never the less I did not want to be a part of this grand opening, because I am a very impatient person! I do not like lines and I do not like crowds!

After a few months of opening I gave in and decided to see what this best chicken place, or the McDonalds of Filipinos was all about. I walked in it was still crowded and there was still a line to the register. However the process went really fast, waiting in line there was a waitress taking your orders, but it was so hard to decide because I could not read the menu well enough from where I was standing.

As I got to the register and when I finally had a clear view of the menu I ordered a pancit palabok meal w/ an ube pearl drink and a spaghetti plate with chicken. It was quite expensive because it cost me a little over $19, yeah just for two plates that is packed in a mini container.

I enjoyed the ube pearl drink, its sorta like a sweet taro shake with pearl balls, it is so delicious during a hot day! The pancit palabok was okay, it is a different kind of noodle plate that has eggs, small pieces of shrimp and a sauce that you mix up with the vermicelli noodles. The chicken was good, I loved the crispy flaky skin but when I got pass the skin, it was bland and tasteless. The spaghetti plate was just okay, it is spaghetti noodles with a sweet tomato sauce with some slices of redondo hot dogs.

But I will be back for some more.. I need to try the burgers. The pearl drinks and the desserts are always something to look forward to. They also do serve breakfast!

Alright so this place has created quite a buzz (hehe, pardon the pun) over its short existence. I think it&apos;s great that Waipahu has a Jollibee but that&apos;s just because it gives Filipinos a small piece of home with them. But let&apos;s get real here, this place is overpriced. Yes it delivers authentic and to the average American even exotic flavors, but for their average tasting burgers I don&apos;t think so.

Their Palabok is great, their chicken is definitely delicious. It&apos;s a place worth visiting for a new experience, but for the price they are selling their food items, I think that there are better places to spend your hard earned cash.

If you must have Jollibee, their Peach Mango pie is heavenly.

I was hoping the line would be gone after a month from its opening day but unfortunately no, waited in line for 30 minutes.
I didn&apos;t expect much from this place as it serves the same generic chicken and burger like any place but I was wrong. I had the palabok, chicken, cheeseburger and ube pearl coolers and I really liked it.

To move the line quickly they had one staff member moving through the line taking orders and hands out the ticket order before going to the cashier.

They  have a small selection on their menu serving fried &quot;chickenjoy&quot;, burgers, spaghetti, palabok and for deserts halo halo, pearl coolers and mango pie.

I am one to appreciate a good fried chicken, and boy did I appreciate this one. The skin was golden, hot and crispy. I thought it could have used a little more seasoning, but I guess that&apos;s why they give a side of gravy. I didn&apos;t like the dipping action though cause it takes away from the crispiness of the chicken skin.

As for the palabok, I had very low expectations just because I have had some really good homemade palabok, but I was pleasantly surprised. I can see why they specialize in it.

The decor was impersonal and had a food court vibe - spacious with simple tables and chairs. Nothing special.

The service went quickly even with a like halfway through the store. If you see a line when you go, don&apos;t be discouraged and turn away. It goes really fast and the food is ready for you by the time your are done paying.

A taste of home finally hits Hawaii... I missed Jollibee a lot and after moving to Hawaii, was surprised there wasn&apos;t one here even with the large Filipino population.

I stood in line for about an hour after work on the grand opening day just to get some food. It was crazy to see a line like that especially since there is never such hype about it anywhere else.

First, the positives: The food is pretty much exactly as I remember. The portions are definitely small compared to the big Hawaii style portions most people are used to seeing here, but just right for me. The Chickenjoy is what Jollibee is primarily known for and it is light and crispy. It&apos;s not as heavily battered and crunchy as what most people expect with fried chicken, but that is something I appreciate about it. The peach mango pie is also delicious as always - it makes me believe in world peace, if only for a few bites. For those who never had it, imagine a McDonalds type pie with a peach and mango filling. Service was also top notch for a fast food establishment. It was just as I remember, down to the workers calling you &quot;ma&apos;amsir&quot;.

The big negative: Definitely on the pricey side, especially for fast food. More expensive than Zippy&apos;s, but seeing as though I don&apos;t frequent any fast food, I am willing to pay for it. A large bucket of chicken runs about $30 and there were other people in line familiar with Jollibee that were a little shocked about the prices.

Might be worth the occasional drive for those who are homesick, but I can&apos;t say that it represents a value. The distance from town and the price of the food is the only thing that lowers my rating of the place. I won&apos;t be a regular by any means, but will definitely be going back from time to time.

The bee dances on special occasions only.  There are two twin brothers that work there so don&apos;t get shocked if someone asks for your order and then all of a sudden is wiping tables...

This place is ok.  I had the palabok and chicken...just one piece.  Not bad.  Place is huge and clean.

The first time I actually tried going to a Jolibee was in the Philippines.  I remember I didn&apos;t like it...  But the one here...I can deal with.  No offense... nothing I crave though.

I had a meeting with my boss that was suddenly cancelled when she decided two days prior that she didn&apos;t want to come to work. I wasn&apos;t made aware of it until I drove the spare 12 miles from my office to hers. Either way, the sudden opening in my schedule made for a perfect opportunity to try a restaurant that had opened in the area that I have been thinking about since my days back home... In San Diego, not the Philippines. It always intrigued me that California was able to open up hundreds of Filipino McDonalds before Hawaii could ever get one.  This store is so new that it isn&apos;t even listed in the website for Jollibee-USA.

The GOOD: SUPER massive store as it is paired up with the Red Ribbon Bakery. I felt like I was walking through an airport with so much space between... everything. For getting a quick burger, the quality is right where I expected, way better (and bigger) than McDonalds, not as tasty as an In-N-Out, far less quality than an actual restaurant. I also ordered an ube bubble drink - a purple slush with black balls... BIG black balls. The drink was sweet, but not insane - and I think pared well with the burger.

The BAD: I know they are &quot;new&quot; like almost a year ago, but when I came in, there was not much of a line and a serious amount of confusion behind the counter. I had the feeling maybe they maybe were changing shifts, or maybe they were confused with a non-Pinoy ordering... &quot;Ham-burGer&quot;. Also, I was unaware, but apparently the Filipinos must love their mayonnaise, because my burger came with GOBS of it. I didn&apos;t mind scraping it off, but I kind of wish I knew it was going to come with a whole jar under the top bun. It would help if I could have put it on myself too.

Overall, they are the only Jollibee in the middle of the Pacific. Pinoy or not, you have to appreciate it just for that. The boba (or bubble) in my ube slushee were cooked well, no hard or crunchy bits to mess up my teeth. I am sure to return, especially when I am in little-Manilla..err Waipahu. A solid three stars, but really, and honestly, if I had to choose any fast food burger place (on the island) to eat at, I would drive out to Waipahu for every &quot;Ham-burGer&quot;.

Animal migration is an incredible sight in nature.  I find it amazing that birds  can fly miles and navigate by instinct to get to their destination.  So it was apparent when I found myself gravitating towards the new Jollibee Restaurant which is located miles from the comforts of my home.  With only the scent of their friend chicken, only familiar to me from my childhood, I navigated through the Island to find the chef hat-wearing jolly Bee with his hand raised high, welcomgin guests to Filipino mecca.  Many Filipino favorite establishments, such as Max of Manila, Red Ribbon, and Pacific Supermarket, are found in the same strip mall.

Bright-eyed and hungry, I stood in a looong line patiently waiting to order my food.  Sadly during my visit, the Red Ribbon section wasn&apos;t open.  Jollibee is supposed to be a typical American-style fast-food restaurant serving affordable burgers, fried chicken and Filipino-inspired dishes such as palabok and halo halo.

The line did not move fast but since service was courteous and friendly I didn&apos;t bite their head off out of total hunger.  Once I got my food and grabbed a seat in the freezing restaurant, I was satisfied.  The food tasted similar to what I remember from Philippines&apos; Jollibee.

I&apos;ve always wanted a Jollibee here in Hawaii because it&apos; really popular in the Philippines. I was born there and re-visited three times so I have a decent idea of how the Jollibee in Philippines tastes like.

When I first went to Jollibee the line wasn&apos;t as long. The customer service was superb, and the workers greeted you with a smile. I ordered the chicken with spaghetti meal, while my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger.

The spaghetti was really good! It reminded me of Philippines and tasted quite like the original one. The chicken on the other hand is alright. After eating their chicken four different times I would have to say Popeyes may be a tiny bit better than Jollibee&apos;s chicken joy here. Although, if you love gravy Jollibee&apos;s gravy is just mouthwatering!

I took a bite of their burger, but I have to agree with my bf. Their meat doesn&apos;t taste quite right.

Other than that the quality of the food is pretty good, the environment and appearance is awesome, and the customer service is darn good thus my rating of a 4. I would have loved to rate it five, but nothing can beat the original Jollibee&apos;s in the Philippines.

You must be warned you may just find yourself craving for their spaghetti. :P

First of, I&apos;ve been to the Philippines many times and have gone to the Jollibee&apos;s there.  So it&apos;s almost bias to say the Jollibee there is MUCH better..but anyways, the review..

The place is a mad house in the day time with lines snaking twice while inside and the first couple weeks, it nearly looked like the Black Friday line for Victoria Secret (I passed by).  Instantly, the interior is HUGE! With obvious signs of Filipino flavor with 8 foot pics of Pinoys painted on the walls.  The place is considerably big with a &quot;soon to be party room&quot; in the back right of the establishment.  Seating is pretty good both AM and PM considering it&apos;s dumb crowded.  With the snaking line in the AM, there is an employee that takes your order while on the home stretch of the line RIGHT before you hit the cashier desk; obviously for expediting reasons.

The chicken and spaghetti combo has to be top priority and without comparing it to the Jollibee in the mother land, the chicken is crunchy and moist; putting it up there with Popeyes.  The spaghetti is different and not your usual Italian, filled with herbs and spices.  Basically, it&apos;s on the sweeter side with small bite size chunks of Filipino hot dog.

The burgers are different from your typical McD&apos;s, BK&amp;Jacks but for a $1.09 price, it&apos;s worth it on the side.  Another fave is the Palabok which is a mix between spaghetti (sauce over the pasta) and pancit (Filipino noodles).  The sauce has an orange look to it with crumbs of chicharon (pork grinds), chopped green onion, shrimp and slices of hard boiled egg.  The sauce it self is slightly tangy but mixed with the rice noodle, is a great combination.

HALO-HALO!  I perhaps would boldly say that I have found THE BEST HALO-HALO on the island.  Unlike most Filipino restaurants that don&apos;t even serve the shave ice-condense milk-random sweets mixed dessert, it is topped off with a scoop of Ube (sweet potato) ice cream, and a bite size chunk of Leche Flan (custard).  Mixed to perfection, caps off a great meal.

Jollibee... Finally in Hawaii.  I&apos;ve been to Jollibee in the Philippines too so there was sort of a comparison when I went...

The food is okay. And because of the CRAZY lines at the general meal times, I would only go again if it was during an off time. When I went, I got there right before the rush... Its not really that worth it if you ask me.

The Ube Pearl Drink is YUMMY! I ordered the Buko Pandan Pearl Drink for variety and its okay, but tasted like it was watered down compared to the Ube one.

I&apos;m just waiting for the line to get shorter so they open up the Red Ribbon side...

For people who have never gone to the Philippines before, its like a place to go to understand a little bit of the national culture there... Chicken is MAJOR there, especially fried chicken. The spaghetti is sweeter. *I like the chicken because it doesn&apos;t have as much breading as other places like KFC and its not dry like Max&apos;s.

Something to remember: It&apos;s a fast food FRANCHISE from the Philippines. Being a franchise comes with its own set of rules and vendors you have to go with. So of course items are not going to taste the same as its American counterparts because everything is going to taste ::different:: Not in a bad way, but the recipes are just different because the taste preferences are different in the Philippines.

Oh and the parking on weekends SUCKS! And the stalls seems to be a little smaller... :\

Jollibee has arrived. I love it. Over two weeks since opening and I still had to wait in line for 15 minutes. Had I have been in the Philippines some one would have taken my order while I was in line. There are also a few Jollibee classics missing from this location. Where is the Jolly hot dog.?

I ordered the Big Yum combo. It was great. They season the ground beef so it doesn&apos;t taste like cardboard. Jollibee has a great burger. I thought it rivaled the competition.

One thing thats cool is that clean up is like the Philippines. You just leave your trays at the table and some one clears it for you. I&apos;m coming back for the Chicken Joy.

I have been to the PI just recently and have has the opportunity to give patronage to a few Jollibee cafes around Philippines.

Food portions: You can expect the same portion of food from what you get in Jollibee in Waipahu as you would get in the Philippines.

Food taste: I order the combo # 9 and a peach mango pie. The # 9 comes with 1 piece of Chickenjoy and 1 portion of their spaghetti.
The Chickenjoy is much better, compared to Philippines Jollibee Chickenjoy because the breading did not make it taste like card board.
The spaghetti didn&apos;t do too well in being duplicated as the one in the Philippines. I think the Waipahu store used a different type of tomato paste--watered down. the cheese was not the same cheese as you would find in the Philippines, which is part of the essence of the Spaghetti. Waipahu Jollibee also uses ham and some sort of Vienna Sausage in the spaghetti, not ground beef and red hotdog.
The peach mango pie has the same taste as the one in Philippines.

Service: Because I came to its grand opening, service was as you would get in the Philippines, which is spot on. The cashiers verify with you the amount of money they&apos;ve received as your payment. The staff puts away your trays and trash and wipes up the table after you leave. Service may degrade as time goes on. Only time will tell.

I believe this will be one of many Jollibee stores and I look forward to sampling some Red Ribbon cakes in the future.

So one fine day we (me and the fams. my asawa, anak, and kapatid..ok so maybe we&apos;re all just friends, but nicknames are importante!) decided to go galavanting....if you&apos;re filipino you already know galavanting is a word from our parents&apos; vocabulary that seems to escape their lips whenever you go out.  my friends and i decide to use this term more lovingly and we love our galavanting....

on this particular day we decided to venture to filipino fast food central...jollibee here we come.

the line is still long, but it went fast.  thank goodness because we were hungry.  they even give you some menus as you wait in line.

venue: very clean and bright, the staff looked great uniforms with a bee on them, very nice.

chicken joy: I liked the spaghetti, but i have to say i&apos;ve had better, but this is what people come here for.

chicken: super good.  crispy, just oily enough to hit the spot.

peach/mango pie: love love love. i had two. it reminds me of mcdonalds FRIED apple pies from vallejo. did i say i love the peach mango pie?

ube cooler: was kinda not as good as i remember.  it tasted a little more like mixed powder than ube...

palabok: was a good balance of sauce and noodle.  we shared a family platter and i really liked the container.  who can&apos;t resist jollibee&apos;s face on an eco friendly container with a lid!

i do have to mention an unfortunate incident at our cashier had us standing there for and extra 30 mins. anak was overcharged twice, but it was remedied by our cashier and the supervisor.  too bad they couldn&apos;t have thrown in an extra pie for the inconvenience.

overall i will definitely go back to jollibee when i am out in waipahu and i get that craving for chicken and pie.

Didn&apos;t see what was all the hype about.  Totally different from what I had in the P.I.  But still good food.

Didn&apos;t expect the Spicy fried chicken to have a hint of Calamasi.  So crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The Palabok was good and garlicy.  Its better than the place next door.

The service was good just like the P.I.  Got usuall Sir Mam,  and the Mam Sir.

I&apos;m one of those Filipino kids who last visited the Motherland when she was 3.  That said, the only interaction I&apos;ve had with Jollibee has been vicariously through others.

I visited the Waipahu location late in the evening, around 9:30pm.  There were no lines and we were able to order quickly.  However, upon ordering we find out that it would be another 15 minutes before anyone got their Chicken Joy.  Marvin the cashier had a permanent smile on so it was tough trying to be irritated with the service.  Good thing for us, the 15 minute wait turned into about 5 minutes right away thanks to a quick thinking manager.  It was hot, crispy, and fresh.  Definitely worth the short wait.

I settled for the Chicken Joy and was pleased with the taste but not the portion size.  My haole boyfriend enjoyed the Pancit Palabok/Chicken Joy combo.  I&apos;m not sure how accurate his review is, considering he&apos;ll eat anything that starts in &quot;Pancit&quot; and contains shrimp.

It&apos;s definitely worth another visit, maybe another late night visit to avoid the crowds.  Hopefully they&apos;ll have enough Chicken Joy this time.

They&apos;re located in a large parking lot they share with Savers and Golden Coin and it might get a little sketchy at night.  Might be best to use the Buddy System when roaming about Waipahu at night.

This was like the second time I&apos;ve been here.  The first time was about two months ago.  The first time I went I got the Chicken Joy, 2 pieces.  I didn&apos;t know it came with the gravy, which I thought was delicious.  Again I ordered the 2 pieces Chicken Joy with mash and arazaldo.  Little did I know I had to order the arazaldo in the other line?  Why? I don&apos;t know.  Waited in line longer than I should have, due to the person in front was trying to get some free food or something.  Jealous that I don&apos;t know anyone who works there!
Anyways, the chicken was just too oily.  The mash potato and gravy was okay. The arazaldo was pretty good.  I like the mushrooms that are inside.  My mom thought it was pretty good too.  I would order that again.  I still need to try their palabok and their pastries.
I still prefer fried chicken in another fast food place, which I won&apos;t mention.
They have lots of parking within the area.  The inside was clean and big.  You can eat and go grocery shopping afterwards.

I&apos;ve never been to the motherland (Philippines) and I guess going to Jollibee would somewhat give me an idea as to what it would be like hanging out with the fellow country man or woman would feel like. Aside from this cultural experience, my food experience was alright. I guess I had a very high expectation for this fast food joint that popped up in the middle of Waipahu.

I got to try the #11 which consisted of pancit palabok and a fried drumstick, with brown gravy on the side. I also ordered a spaghetti to share with a couple friends who I dragged on this excursion to Little Manila (aka Waipahu). Pancit palabok was good and tasty, but lacked the right amount of noodles. Fried chicken was OK, nothing special, and the brown gravy on the side didn&apos;t elevate it to the next level either. The spaghetti was interesting. Sweet with bits of hot dog in it. Once again, this was okay, but so glad it wasn&apos;t tangy. I&apos;d rather have sweet over tangy any day.

Overall, I don&apos;t know why there&apos;s a long line for people to come and eat here. If I was craving Filipino food, I guess I would have sat myself down at the Golden Coin next door... but oh well.. it was worth a try after hearing all this hype. Not sure if I&apos;d trek it back here, but if I was nearby, maybe I would to hang out with my fellow peeps.

Went to Jollibee on Sunday still hanging from the night before. I was feeling lousy on the drive to Waipahu from town and needed food in my stomach and fast! I&apos;ve never heard of Jollibee before, other than that it was a filipino fast food joint. So I&apos;m thinking, ok good, fast food. We get there and there&apos;s a looooong as line from the counter to the front back towards the counter again. Nooo!

Anyway, I was looking forward to having some filipino food. I was thinking pancet, pinakbet, sari sari, adobo, etc. I wasn&apos;t expecting chicken and burgers?! Oh well. The drumstick was good. The skin wasn&apos;t super crunchy, but it had some slight peanutty flavor to it, and the meat was juicy. The spaghetti was really bland. Don&apos;t order it. The palabok was interesting. I&apos;ve never had it before. It was really tasty, I just wish there was more of it. The staff was friendly. They even had a guy handing out a checklist of their menu to help speed up the line. It had a loud but clean cafeteria type atmosphere.

The food was ok, but nothing special. I can get fried chicken and burgers anywhere else. However, at most fast food chains you can either get burgers or fried chicken, but at Jollibee you can get both. I mean real chicken with bone in it, not deep fried chicken-flavored cardboard paste ;) I probably won&apos;t be driving to Waipahu just to go to Jollibee again, but if I&apos;m in the area, I wanna try the halo halo and mango pie.

Many of you may have recently heard of Jollibee, but might not be familiar with who they are.  Admittedly, I was one of them.  They&apos;re a fast food chain based in the Philippines and have locations throughout the United States as well.  I&apos;m Filipino, but never been to the Philippines.  Quite honestly, I think I first heard of Jollibee was when I was in San Francisco!

Jollibee&apos;s first location is right in the heart of Waipahu, which makes a whole lot of sense.  It&apos;s in the Waipahu Shopping Plaza, kitty corner to Pacific Supermarket.  The parking lot is kinda tight, so you may want to park a little further away and walk.  Since they just opened, they have security and the line forms to the left.  What&apos;s nice is an employee came by and gave the people waiting in line a menu so you can think of what you want to order while you stand in line.

The line moved pretty fast.  I&apos;d guesstimate there was about 60 people in front of me.  Many of the people were either families or friends.  It&apos;s also fast food, so all the food&apos;s already made.  The service was pretty good.  The employees were courteous and repeated my order to make sure I got everything I needed.

Now for the part you&apos;re probably waiting for...the food!  I ordered to-go the family style spaghetti, 12 pieces of chicken (6 spicy and 6 regular), and an ube pearl drink.  I ordered for my family - and it came out to about $41.  So about $10 per person.  Not too bad.

The spaghetti was your typically Filipino spaghetti - a little sweet.  I think with just about almost anything, homemade is better.  What&apos;s good with the family style spaghetti is that it probably feeds about 4, and comes in a nice tupperware-ish container.  If you&apos;re Filipino, you know where I&apos;m going with this.  Either you nana or mother is going to save the container, which is a nice bonus!  Cost was about $14.

The chicken was pretty good.  It kinda reminded me of Zippy&apos;s.  It was light and not oily at all.  The spicy version to me was pretty good.  My brother shared that it was quite spicy, so use your judgment.  12 pieces was a little expensive, about $22, but a still cheaper than Zippy&apos;s, I think.

The ube pearl drink was pretty good.  I&apos;m not a big fan of pearl drinks, but just wanted to try.  Cost was about $4.

Overall my visit to the motherland fast food chain was pretty good.  A little expensive, but I&apos;d go back once the hype dies down.

what motivated every filipino on the island to wait hours to get a meal here on opening day i&apos;ll never figure out.

i&apos;ve loved jollibee ever since my first experience in the PI. but on the real, c&apos;mon, what&apos;s all the hype about. opening day drowned my facebook newsfeed.
after it calmed down, i tried it about a month after it opened. it wasn&apos;t as good as the one in the PI, it was okay, not bad or anything, just okay.

-the portions aren&apos;t very big depending on what you order, they still have the classic chicken joy combo like the original. the chicken is probably the highlight of all the menu items. it&apos;s tasty and not as greasy as your usual fried chicken joint. never really was a fan of sweet filipino style spaghetti so you don&apos;t want my biassed opinion on that
-the service is great, always fast and friendly
-parking isn&apos;t bad considering it&apos;s shared with a supermarket.
-price is about your usual fast food prices, but sometimes you get shafted.

bottom line: i never understood the hype, it&apos;s a fast food joint, you want REAL filipino food? then hit up a filipino party or simply go to thelmas down the street. foreel. it&apos;s good, but not great

Decided to make a stop here after dropping off my mom to grab some food at Pacific Supermarket.  On this particular afternoon, the line only went up to the middle part.  This time there was someone in the line to take down my order.  I hope they start serving most of the items on the order sheet soon, such as the breakfast items.  A cheery duo of high school kids working at the register greeted me with a loud &quot;Welcome to Jollibee! How may we help you?&quot;  Nice to see workers enjoying their job and making their customer smile.  Ordered two cheeseburger deluxe ($1.70 each) and a halo halo. Order was out in about two minutes.  As I left, the duo wished me happy holidays. As I left, even the guy wiping the door thanked me for coming.  +1 star for the workers&apos; great attitudes that day.

Shared the burgers and halo halo with my parents. They thought the burgers were good.  My mom complained though that the top part of the halo halo was packed too hard and should&apos;ve been grinded finer.  I thought the burger was alright.  The deluxe came with tomato, lettuce and onions.  The patty tasted like McD&apos;s but not as greasy.  However the buns were really good and fresh.

Being born in the Philippines I always remembered and loved eating at Jollibee and whenever I get the chance to visit SF, LA, or LV I always make sure to stop by to get a taste of their spicy chicken joy.

Being that me and my gf are heifers we decided to take the long drive from Honolulu to Waipahu during the &quot;grand&quot; opening week. We got the around 7pm&apos;ish and the line was out the door and around the building NO JOKE! so, we went to Pearlridge for a little while to kill time while the line dies down. After being tired of shopping at Pearlridge we headed back to Jollibee around 9pm and I&apos;m not kidding the line looked like it never moved! being all irritated for being stupid coming here during opening week we decided to be like those crazy people and wait in line.

We stood in line for over an hour just to order our food. The place was very bright and clean with lots of workers constantly cleaning tables, and handing customers to-go boxes and bags.

The food was just as good as I remembered it to be but definitely not worth the over an hour wait. I guess it wouldn&apos;t have been so bad if this one rascal boy wasn&apos;t so obnoxious and everyone there being so nuts about Jollibee opening with all their Milli orders and constant photo taking with the mascot outside.

The next time I&apos;m eating at Jollibee will be when I visit their other mainland locations since I almost never visit Waipahu.

I&apos;ve only ate their chicken once, which wasn&apos;t a fresh because my auntie did takeout from Waipahu to Ewa Beach. She left it in the fridge then microwaved it, so I never got to really taste a the good chicken everyone has been saying when it comes out. The reason why I rated this place a 4 star was because of how nice and clean this place looked. How everything was organized&amp;how the bakery was right next to them. The most reason why I keep coming to Jollibee was because of their halohalo subtracting all the beans. But mostly because of their UBE PEARL COOLERS! The taro, purple one tastes so dreamy. Makes me crave it every time. You guys have to try it, your going to get hooked on it! So good!

Whew, haven&apos;t had Jollibee in a longtime. I wonder how long this place is gonna stay busy? at least the lines are significantly shorter, especially on off hours. I came at around 3pm, and I hardly had to wait to order.

Spaghetti - Sweet tasting! Just like I remember. =9 probably not exactly like how it is in Philippines... but eh, its okay that its close enough.

Palabok - I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ve tried it before, so I can&apos;t compare it to what its &quot;supposed&quot; to taste like. To me it was kind of salty, but not bad. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering it again.

peach mango pie... this reminded me of the mcdonalds mango pie that never ever came back... and I don&apos;t think the pineapple pie came back either.... but I liked this one better. It wasn&apos;t too sweet, and the creamy mango filling had pieces of what tasted like canned peaches in it, all in that crisp pie shell.

Ube bubble drink! Super viscous... and just how my first bubble drink ever tasted before it even started getting popular here. I remember I had it at and SM when I was visiting family in the Philippines.

My wife said we needed to try this new place. So we did today.
The chicken by itself was ok, but with the gravy it was better. The line was long and waited about 10-15 mins total.
Parking is terrible, stalls are tiny.
Service was your typical fast food service, nothing special.
Clean and plenty of space to dine in. Menu was hard to read(bad eyes) and didn&apos;t show all the options. Was worth a try, but nothing to rave about. I would go again if in the area.

I&apos;ve been to Jollies in the Philippines and admit it&apos;s way better there but I guess you could just as well say a huli huli chicken is better here than made someplace else. All in all it&apos;s great and tasty  the fast food Filipino way although you could eat at Max&apos;s with the same amount of moola. I mean the prices really add up for the combos. I was hoping the price was in pesos and not dollars. All in all it&apos;s good, I hope more locations pop up especially in town for the Kalihi crowd. Kinda making a trip out to Waipahu for fast food but right place for the 1st Jollie in paradise!

It is what it is. Fast food. If you&apos;ve been to the one in the Philippines it&apos;s the same....same crispy chicken, spaghetti, bland palabok, and yum burgers...even the same uniforms. Although they do have an &apos;aloha burger&apos; with a piece of pineapple.

That being said, this franchise has a done a good job being a franchise...nice and consistent.

Being coined the &quot;McDonalds of the Philippines&quot; Jolliebee keeps it real. Their chicken tastes different in comparison to some of the fast food chains like KFC and Popeyes, but I can&apos;t help but feel that the mystery ingredient must be something terribly unhealthy. They&apos;ve got pretty awesome spaghetti. Kind of overrated, but I like the feel. The fact that when I bring home a bucket of chicken, poloboc, and spaghetti puts smile on my moms face, puts an additional smile on mines (wow that sounded terribly confusing). Seriously worth a try. Great chicken, great spaghetti, great atmosphere. Lines can get pretty long, but they usually got tons of registers open which makes it go by faster.

So, since it has been open for a while, my sister and i figured the line would not be that long and decided to take my mom to check it out.  We got there at about 11:45am so of course there was a pretty long line but there were only 4 cashiers open so the line went pretty slow.
We decided to order those that Jollibee is supposedly known for:  chicken joy, palabok, and spaghetti.   The chicken had no taste and was pretty oily.  The meats in the spaghetti were not good at all.  The only thing I would entertain getting again is the palabok.  But then again, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever go back again.
At the end of the meal, my mother asked for a toothpick and they didn&apos;t have any.
The assocciates that were cleaning the dining room were too busy speaking to one another and another associate that had just gotten off his shift.
