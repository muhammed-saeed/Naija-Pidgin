 Rachel&apos;s Cafe&amp;Deli .
5953 Main St.
(across from Williamsville South High School,
between Youngs&amp;Garrison Rds., just east of the Village of Williamsville),
&quot;Greater&quot; Williamsville.
635-1100.
 Typical American and not-so-typical Mediterranean cuisine.
Same owner as Rachel&apos;s Mediterranean
Food and Three Brothers Burgers . 
 [MTC, 2/12] says: &quot;I work near Rachel&apos;s Cafe&amp;Deli, so, when I am
in the mood for a gyro or beef shawarma, I make sure to stop in. The gyro
is fantastic, unlike the‘strips’of processed gyro meat
you find in most‘Greek’places around Buffalo, the gyro
meat at Rachael&apos;s is more of a ground lamb/beef hybrid that is
infused with many different herbs and seasonings. I am a huge fan of the
way their meat is prepared, and they do not cheap out on portion size. It
is served on a hearty pita with lettuce, tomato, and onion. When I want
to mix things up, I tend to order the beef shawarma, which is thinly
shaved beef with a parsley-tahini sauce; the tahini sauce is the star of
the show here. If you are in Williamsville looking for some Greek grub,
skip
Village Grille
and Milos ,
and head to Rachael&apos;s.&quot;
 [JSB, 12/09] said: &quot;I am a frequent customer of Rachel&apos;s Cafe.
While their baklava doesn&apos;t hold a candle to Falafal Bar ,
the rest of Rachel&apos;s food is much more enjoyable, and the
tomatoes are always fresh.&quot;
 [2/08]
Several of us took a visiting UB speaker here for a light dinner.
It&apos;s a small, non-descript, storefront restaurant, with
about 6 tables. The manager (the owner&apos;s son) was very kind about
putting two tables together and &quot;reserving&quot; them until our full party of
7 arrived. We decided to share two &quot;house platters&quot;, each of which
entitled us to 3 choices from the Mediterranean Dinner section of the
menu, along with two side dishes per platter. We chose the NY strip
beef kabob, the chicken kabob, the kafta (steak) kabob, chicken shawarma
(a bit like chicken souvlaki), beef shawarma, and stuffed kibbie
(described as being like a Mediterranean meatloaf), along with hummus,
tabouli, and stuffed grape leaves as the sides. We also ordered some
falafel wraps with extra hummus. All the food was excellent, as was the
service (by the manager). The only disappointments were that they no
longer serve baba gannough (their spelling), and, somewhat surprisingly,
they had run out of teabags(!). 

 

 [a+] Rachel&apos;s Mediterranean Food .
UB Commons (520 Lee Entrance), UB North Campus, Amherst.
636-0049.
 Same owners as Rachel&apos;s Cafe and Three Brothers Burgers .
[Bill, 4/09] says: &quot;The newest addition to the food offerings at the UB
Commons. I had a tasty and satisyfing falafel‘sandwich’(actually, a wrap) with tomato, parsley, pickles, tahini sauce, hummus,
and onions. They also serve Mediterranean subs, hoagies, chicken
fingers, various Mediterranean sides (like grape leaves, spinach pie,
etc.), souvlaki, sandwiches, wraps, salads, and full dinners, plus a few
desserts.&quot; 

 

 Rainbow Deli .
403 Main St. #110
(in the Brisbane Building , at Lafayette Sq./Clinton St.,
downtown),
Buffalo.
855-3433.
 [CSS, 8/11] says: &quot;The Rainbow Deli is a small, downtown, lunch
deli (with a surprisingly comfortable seating area) that primarily
caters to the take-out crowd, offering daily specials including salads,
subs, soup, and pizza. What I love about this place is its abundant
salad bar. For $5, you can get a‘small’salad loaded with your choice of
about 10 different items (veggies, sunflower seeds, cheeses, sprouts,
etc.). Deli meat or tuna salad on top is about a buck extra. The‘small’is large. The‘huge’size is gargantuan (as in, you can&apos;t finish it in
one sitting). Two nice ladies assemble your salad for you. The dressings
are not homemade but are portioned generously and can be packed on the
side for take-out orders (they also have oil and vinegar at the counter,
to make your own). This place, IMO, has it all: super fast, fresh,
cheap, and good.&quot;

 

 Ray&apos;s Lounge and Catering .
2070 Clinton St.
(between S. Ogden St.&amp;S. Rossler Ave., in Kaisertown),
Buffalo.
824-3227.
 [LMR, 3/10] says: &quot;Went on Friday, March 19th, for the fish fry
and Polish buffet. A regular haddock, beer-battered fish fry was $11, and
the Polish buffet, which included soup, salad bar, breaded fish, fried
shrimp, and dessert, was $11.75. The buffet was decent. Had mashed
potatoes, gravy, macaroni salad, potato salad, coleslaw, applesauce,
potato pancakes, roasted chicken, fresh and smoked kielbasa, breaded
fish, fried shrimp, cabbage, corn, French fries, potato and kraut
pierogi, and lazy pierogi. All good, I thought. My boyfriend got a
regular haddock fish fry; he loved the sides, but his fish
wasn&apos;t cooked all the way. So he told them, and they gladly
remade him a piece of fish. Much better! Just think: The piece he had
was too big, and it wasn&apos;t cooked properly, but the second
piece was perfect; he ate it all. I was fairly happy with the buffet;
my aunt felt it wasn&apos;t as good as in the past, and my
boyfriend wasn&apos;t that crazy about it at all. The
décor is so outdated!! It&apos;s exactly the same as when
we had a family funeral breakfast there over 20 years ago, down to the
silk flowers, which are older than I. However, it&apos;s a local,
homey place that brings back memories. I would recommend it at least
once and then make your own opinions. I would go again; however, felt
the prices were a little too high for this type of place.
It&apos;s clean, and the service is very good. It&apos;s a
family place still run by the original family members.&quot;
 [BL] said:

 [9/06] Update: Buffet is now $10.95. Same good quality of food. Place was
crowded 
this past visit, but we were seated within a small wait time (5-10
minutes). 
Waitress told us previous week was quiet but other weeks are busy.
Also, there 
is an open menu if you wish this as opposed to the buffet. I did not
read the 
menu, but they serve a fish fry, pork chop dinner among other items
according 
to waitress.
Everything is good and fresh. Buffet food is replaced regularly, and
buffet 
presentation area is kept clean. It looked like the bar area was open,
if you 
wished to sit there. Most of us were heading for the buffet. We have
been back 
twice since last report, and the comfort food is consistently good.&quot;
 [1/06] &quot;Offers Friday night buffet, 4:00-8:00 P.M. Food
like your Grandmother made (if 
she was one of your favorite cooks!). American with Polish influence.
Clean, homey interior; polite service (expect to hear a Polish accent
here and 
there. Our variety of accents are a pleasure to hear at some of the area
restaurants). Relaxing atmosphere. Each item is well prepared: Fried,
baked or roasted 
chicken, excellent pork chops but once a month, Polish sausage, fried
fish, 
fried shrimp, pierogis (cheese, and very tender that evening), cabbage
rolls (use
your own European word), mashed potatoes, French fries, pasta, macaroni
and 
potato salads, sauerkraut, vegetables, rolls, very homemade soups, full
salad 
bar, dessert table, etc. Soda, $1.50, very large. Front bar was closed,
but 
alcohol served from inside bar. Buffet $9.95, all you can eat.
Kaisertown 
location diagonally across from Pumpernik and Pastry with easy parking
in lot or
street. Most of us probably
tasted 
the food first via their wedding receptions, funeral breakfasts,
showers. Will 
put on our list for our Friday night cycle of Western NY dining
locations.
Nice addition to the Polish cuisine, but lots of American
items 
here.&quot;


 

 Red Coach Inn .
2 Buffalo Ave. (at Main St.), Niagara Falls, NY.
282-1459 or 1-866-719-2070.
Same owners as Bistro at the Old Fort Inn .
 [MIL, 9/11] says: &quot;We stopped in for dinner after a visit to the Cave of the Winds on a Sunday evening in late September. After a long‘5 minute’wait, we were seated on the patio, which has a lovely view of a
park across the street and of the rapids approaching the falls. I
ordered a chicken marsala special, which had a liberal sprinkling of
mushrooms and was served on nicely chewy, corkscrew pasta. My partner had
the‘surf and turf’, with a raspberry sauce, and ostrich meat starring as
the‘turf’. We both enjoyed our food and the cozy ambiance. The service
was cordial, but slow, inattentive, and spotty—we never got the bread
that was supposed to come, and the promised iced-tea refill never
materialized, for example. The server said this was a difficult day for
them, and I&apos;m willing to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt…this time.&quot;
 [AFN, 6/09] said: &quot;My sister, our daughters, and I went to the
Lewiston Region Tour of Kitchens on Saturday, 6/13. Seven restaurants from
Lewiston, Niagara Falls, and Youngstown offered samples of their cuisine
at the various houses on the tour. The food served by most of the
participating restaurants was excellent, including
Mediterranean pasta with pesto,
artichoke hearts, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta from The Red
Coach Inn. Overall, the tour was like a multi-course tasting menu
experience. Excellent!&quot;
 [WHN, 7/06] said: &quot;We had our wedding reception here, but had not
been back in years. In 
the summer, there is an outdoor covered patio overlooking the rapids 
approaching the Falls. Upon arrival, we were promptly taken to our 
reserved table on the patio. We ordered a bottle of Wolf Blass 
Cabernet Sauvignon ($22.95; about 2x retail) from their somewhat 
limited, but reasonably priced, wine list. We both ordered strip 
steaks ($33.95), cooked medium rare, as requested. There are many 
accompanying sauces that can be added at no charge. I chose a 
mushroom and black pepper one; my wife chose a Port wine demi-glace. 
All meals include a salad, a choice of several potato dishes 
(personally, I&apos;m tired of the ubiquitous smashed potatoes that too 
many restaurants now serve) or rice, and a vegetable. There are many 
other main courses to choose from: fish and shellfish, prime rib and 
filet, veal, pork, chicken, and vegetarian dishes, starting around 
$21.95. Our meal and the service were both very, very good, and we 
enjoyed watching the tourists walk by.&quot;

 

 [] [a] Red Lobster . 
4010 Maple Rd. (at N. Bailey Ave., in the North Bailey neighborhood), Amherst.
837-0202.
 Also at other locations. 
Part of the chain.
Seafood.
 [HPK, 12/03] says: &quot;If you have not been to Red Lobster in a
while, it&apos;s time to check it out
again; this is not a place to go for fine seafood, but if you want a
quick bite and at a reasonable cost, I would suggest it. I had not
gone
back in a long time, as I was not happy with the quality of the food.
This has changed dramatically, and the chain has added many real &quot;fish&quot;
dishes to their menu, rather than just shrimp and scallops. I had the
blackened catfish. It was really good, served with nice vegetables on
the side. Plus, I was running really late and walked in at 10 p.m., when
they close. They said, &quot;no problem&quot;, and let my party in with no rush
to
leave.&quot;

 

 Red Osier Landmark Restaurant . WARNING: WEBSITE PLAYS A LOUD VIDEO! 
6492 Main Rd.(*) (Rt. 5)
(east of Morganville Rd., east of Batavia),
Stafford (Genesee County).
1-585-343-6972 or 1-888-343-6972.
 (*) Or possibly 6492 E. Main St., or 6492 E. Main St. Rd., or various
other combinations of &quot;east&quot;, &quot;main&quot;, &quot;street&quot;, and &quot;road&quot;,
very few of
which show up on Google Maps or MapQuest, though Bing Maps seems to do
well.
The address I cite above is the only one that worked on Google Maps.
Red Osier&apos;s webpage link to MapQuest doesn&apos;t work! 
 [JFG, 3/09] says: &quot;My wife and I went to celebrate her retirement
and had heard about this 
&quot;institution&quot; for years. As it was a bit of a trip—it&apos;s outside 
Batavia—it was quite a production to go there, but it was her pick.
We started out with escargot and their signature lobster bisque. I 
should know by now that escargot in Western New York isn&apos;t the same as,
say, in Toronto. The bisque was ordinary.
Prime rib—carved nearby (as you&apos;ll hear later in the review) was good,
and we both had that. The sides were passable at best. Desert was pretty
basic and, while billed as Peach Melba, was a local interpretation rather
than the real thing. Maybe it&apos;s a seasonal thing, as the peaches could 
have been fresh instead of canned.
I think the prime factor affecting diners&apos; visits to this institution is
the mere fact that it is an institution. They work hard to preserve an 
image that has been carefully cultivated to be a steak/beef-oriented 
restaurant with a history.
The food is non-exceptional and mundane, although an attempt is made at 
flourishes like the &quot;roaming&quot; carving cart and some tableside 
presentation—although the tables are too close together to make this 
very practical, and one views the theater from a distance. We almost 
viewed some of the dinner in our laps as the waitress spilled a tray of
fixings for salad.
If you are in the area and don&apos;t mind spending $40–$50 per person on 
the theater and ordinary food, by all means go.&quot;
 [J&amp;NS;, 5/06] said: &quot;Visited this restaurant for the first time ever
with a lot of good
referrals on their steaks and prime ribs. We made reservations, and,
although
it was a
Tuesday evening, the place was busy. Within 10 minutes, we were seated
and started the night out with a bowl of lobster bisque that was presented
in an empty bowl with a column of lobster in the middle. Once it was
placed in front of you, the server poured a ladle of broth in the bowl.
Nice touch.
The accompanying bread consists of mini chocolate-chip muffins and pieces
of sourdough bread, as well. Tasty as well. Then a choice of iceberg or
spinach
salad (we all chose spinach) with the hot sweet-sour dressing (with bacon)
followed;
that hit the spot. Finally, the cart pulled up at our table;
we
had heard of the cart. It consists of the prime rib we had ordered,
sliced in front of us, au jus. Choice of baked
potato, sweet potato, rice pilaf were options. The sweet potato was our
choice. For dessert, we split a serving of bananas Foster with coffee.
All
the food was excellent and well served. The Osier has very professional
people serving you, who are very attentive and friendly. We had a coupon
that is published in Gusto that was used for all four of us. We had
drinks, appetizers, main courses, 1 dessert, and coffees and tip that came to
$140. As we were enjoying our meal, we were already talking about the next time we were coming back to the Osier, coupon or not. It&apos;s worth the trip
from Buffalo, and if you want to take the slow and scenic way home, just
stay on Route 5 and avoid the NY State Thruway tolls! 4 stars for sure.&quot;
