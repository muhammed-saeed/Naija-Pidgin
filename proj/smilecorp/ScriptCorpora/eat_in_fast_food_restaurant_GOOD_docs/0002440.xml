 Suspect with Crowbar Shot Outside Carls Jr - Monterey Park,CA 
Shots fired at :40
MONTEREY PARK, Calif. (KABC) -- A suspect armed with a crowbar was shot outside of a Carl&apos;s Jr. restaurant in Monterey Park on Monday morning.

Authorities say the incident began with the suspect breaking windows at Carl&apos;s Jr. in the 1200 block of Avenida Cesar Chavez just before 9:30 a.m. The suspect then walked inside, while workers and customers ran outside.

Police arrived as the suspect was exiting the fast-food restaurant. After repeatedly telling the suspect to drop the weapon, the suspect was Tasered.

Police said the Taser was ineffective, and the suspect swung the three-foot metal bar at officers twice. At least one officer opened fire on the suspect.

The suspect was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

No one else was injured in the incident. The officer-involved shooting is under investigation.

shot ten times because the man threatned to swing a hammer at the police.

the 2 men firing should be jailed for that!!!! not a warning shot or wounding shot to the leg to dismantle the man?

just plain &apos;legal&apos; MURDER caught on tape.

Thats why you dont try and take a fucking swing at a cop, 10 shots maybe to much but that asshole was clearly asking for it...

One blow to the head from a metal bar like that could kill somebody. This guy was asking for it and got it.

Ok...I don&apos;t give a fuck about what anybody says...maybe the police handbook says that is ok. But everything about this video is absolutely wrong to me. I know cops have it tough down there in california....but for god&apos;s sake....beat the motherfucker before you straight up murder him. Because that is what that was, murder.

Watch his body language carefully, he wasn&apos;t going to hit the officer. That was an animal charge, something we all do subconsciously when someone gets too close, it was an attempt to make the policeman back off.

This could have easily been resolved without a fatality, police here in uk deal with this kinda thing daily with no guns or dogs.

Police in this case got too close too soon which made the kid react. That to me is bad training and just plain lack of common sense. As for the shooting bit More.. i get the impression they kinda enjoyed it. Where would Americans be without their guns hey? Less..

We didn&apos;t see the whole thing go down. We see the tape start rolling way after it started. We don&apos;t know the whole story so dont be so quick to judge. What we can take from this portion of the incident is, The man stops turns and makes a move to swing it at the officer that pepper sprayed him. That same cop can clearly be seen not being able to pull out his own firearm to protect himself before the K-9 officer fires protecting the other officer from a certain damaging and possibly deadly blow fr More.. om what ever that object was. Sad but completely justified as far as im concerned. When deadly force is executed you neutralize the threat. You dont shoot just once. Shooting someone once often wont stop a person acting violently. That was prolly a glock 22 .40cal and it holds 15 rounds so he didn&apos;t&quot;Unload a whole clip&quot;into anyone....The cops acted calm and steady from what i see in this clip. Less..

@Camacho 4 President No....you are way off base. I actually side with the police quite often. But seriously? You seriously think that what this video shows is okay? You need to get your mind right man because this is absolutely unacceptable. Police have multiple non-lethal means to subdue. Bullets should be the last line of defense/offense.

@Windolicker

Lets see. Mutiple non lethal means. From what i read about this story. Before the tape even started to roll, they did try tasing him inside. It wasnt effective. They then try OC spray. That dosent seem to do the job effective enough either. What other means are you talking about. You think baton vs crowbar/ax is smart choice? Ill give you a baton and ill take a crowbar lets see who wins. Most of the cops that were code 3 still had not arrived. If this person was to stay inside may More.. be they could have set up a perimeter and came up with a better tactical plan to defuse it. But that&apos;s not how the dynamics of this worked. He chose to come outside and confront the officers with a aggressive move which could have seriously hurt or killed that officer. Split second decisions and hesitations can be the difference between you or a fellow officer/co-worker going home at night or ending up in the hospital or morgue. Its sad but completely justified. And FYI there is quite a few departments in CA that don&apos;t have/use rubber bullets either. I know of many major departments that don&apos;t. Less..

The guy had to be taken down, no doubt. But executed like that?
Those cops surely go to church on sunday portaying what good followers of Jesus they are. But they have no problem with instantly killing somebody instead of trying everything else first to bring him down by just injuring the fucker. Religious people don&apos;t really value life. Cause they think they are forgiven everything by friggin&apos; Jesus, and cause they actually believe there is a life after this. Ridiculous. Not for their victims t More.. hough Less..

Excessive force or not, the guy is still going around with a weapon threatening others.

5 shots to stop, 5 more to make sure. 10 shots is way too excessive. Should have taken a bullet to the knee.
