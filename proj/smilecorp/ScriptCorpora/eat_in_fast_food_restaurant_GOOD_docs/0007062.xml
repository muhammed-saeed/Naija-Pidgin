When you visit your favorite fast food restaurant, the menu items are familiar, the menu board is easy to read, and the fare is -- about what you expect. That goes for your friendly neighborhood drive-through as well as its clone halfway across the country in a town you&apos;ve never even heard of. That&apos;s pretty consistent. It&apos;s also pretty scary when you consider the fat -laden, sodium-rich and calorie-packed offerings a lot of these chains are serving up to millions of Americans every day.

If you want to eat healthier without giving up your fast food habit, there are some low-cal, low-fat options out there that are still flavorful and filling. These 10 healthy fast food menu items taste great, so ordering one of them instead of your usual diet-busting indulgence will be less of a sacrifice.
