I cannot stop crying about this, I feel terrified?
 I am fifteen and I was working today at a fast food restaurant, not going to tell you which one. When I served this old man, I put in his order but he didn&apos;t explain it well, so I hesistately put it through, it was wrong, so I changed it, till it was right. I then asked for the money, he said it was wrong. He yelled at me, but gave me the money, then i gave back the change and he said it was wrong. I showed him the receipt but he kept yelling at me. He got his food and I was happy he left, but he came driving back and stormed inside and he said&quot;YOU FORGOT MY DRINK&quot;

The manager came out and fixed the problem, I felt bad cos I screwed up but I was freaking out real bad. The guy said I was hopeless and that I will fail at everything in life, I deserve to live nowhere and that I should be fired. No place should hire me, because I am not fit. He said you should fire her! She is bad to customers.

He left and I burst into tears in front of everyone, customers, staff members and I went out the back to calm down and suffered an anxiety attack. I kept stuffing up orders because I felt so sick and could not concentrate.

I got home, told my mother but I still feel bad. I went and cut my wrists and I am in my room crying. I found out he has abused other customers before, but I made it worse by screwing up the order and handing out the food.

I feel sick and I know I should toughen up but I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression and I just started taking anti depressants. I can&apos;t concentrate on my school work. I just keep thinking about what happened. I want to quit, but how do I? I can&apos;t put up with this fear. I am terrified he will come back, because he visits on a regular basis, even though he complains.

How do I quit? I can&apos;t deal with this, I don&apos;t care what my parents say.

 You know everyone gets a order wrong here and there, and no one is perfect, even machines or robots malfunction. You sound perfectly justified in feeling anxiety over a traumatic episode like that. I can&apos;t believe the manager didn&apos;t intervene or atleast pull you aside to make sure you were okay, if he didn&apos;t he&apos;s a even bigger jerk than the old fart...maybe iif your skin hadn&apos;t thickened enough yet to let it ruin his day not yours, you can use a sarcasm or humor, you know, like now that you know his number so to speak intentionally mess up his order, drop change, and apologize like you really mean it, if you get fired for having to go to such drastic measures to self protect since the manager didn&apos;t do it, then good! Your 15, this us when your suppose to trial and error and make mistakes. Or ya know since the sob upset you to the point you cut yourself, this part time job isn&apos;t helping your anxiety, clearly a job with less stress is better until your through with your treatments and have resolved depression. Good luck!

 I think you should talk to your doctor about different medication because clearly this one isnt working for you

 You need a break. You said you just started antidepressants--and they can take 4-8 weeks to even start to make a difference. While you are working with your doctor and getting a handle on the anxiety and depression, i think, you need a break from having to work.
Dealing with the public is no fun alot of the time. Some people walk around ready to explode at anyone and everyone.--and this is what this guy sounds like.

 Dear Gabby,
Wow!! That incident that you experienced would have upset anyone!! That man sounded like he was harrassing and provoking you!! I&apos;m sorry that happened!! Remember that just because he said critical and rude things about your work, doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s true. You&apos;re young and sound like you&apos;re doing your best!!

I hope that you don&apos;t allow him to push you out of your job!! Stay and learn to be stronger and deal with&quot;the difficult customers&quot;. Also, if you don&apos;t have a therapist, I hope you consider working with a therapist that specializes in work with teens. You sound like you could really benefit from a therapist right now, to help you with your anxiety!! Also, feel free to call us at the Boystown Hotline to discuss any issues or problems. We&apos;re here 24 hours a day!!

 Do not quit,i repeat do not quit.
this one incident was a learning lesson in which you shall push yurself to learn from.

That guy comes there often,n nobodys perfect,work on being more professional,
Dust yourself off n keep going...that crazy costumer knows nothing at all about yu,
N he may be one of those people tgat cause havoc n confusion where ever they go.

Some ppl are the type of ppl that complain daily,n its just apart of the job.

 In life you have to deal with A holes all the time. This guy wasn&apos;t mad at you, he was mad at his sad pathetic life. Anyone that&apos;s going to rip into a 15 year old girl at a fast food restaurant is a tool. I suspect that he sees youth and the life you have in you and resents it because he realizes he is nothing but a grumpy old man that nobody likes. But he will be dead soon and the world wont miss him. I can understand why your upset but you have to have a thick skin. Also stand up for yourself. If you are being treated with disrespect by a customer you don&apos;t have to take it. Any manager thats any kind of real manager will stand behind you. A manager shouldn&apos;t let his employees be treated like that. But don&apos;t quit. Like I said, in life you have to deal with A holes. There&apos;s no way around it. Jobs are hard to come by right now so you should stick it out. You will be a stronger person for it.

 i&apos;m sorry to hear that.
that old man is a total jerk.

dont worry. i know how you feel.i am just the same as you. i cry a lot whenever people call me a loser or reprimanded me. till now im sensitive and cry a lot..

but let me tell you there will always be people who are mean and try to hurt us and sometimes they take the win. but its ok. people with lots of failures always find a way to get back up.
i wont judge you, if you want to quit,just tell your manager.
you can always take up another job if you dont want ur parents to worry that you dont have a job. dont worry,anyone would hire anyone as long as they do their job.

 Gabby.....you are not perfect, nobody is. We all make mistakes in our lifetime. This was not your first mistake and it will not be your last. Stop being so hard on yourself. You make a mistake, you say I&apos;m sorry, correct it if you can and go about your business. The angry man is the one that has the problem. Don&apos;t blame yourself for his bad behavior. There are just some very bitter and angry people in this world, who knows what has happened in their lifetime to make them that way, but they are out there. Perhaps he&apos;s lost his wife and isn&apos;t dealing well with his loss. We just don&apos;t know. You need to focus on learning how to deal with others negativity, seek a positive attitude for yourself and move forward. Best of luck.
Cutting does not resolve anything! It is inflicting pain on yourself and can possibly cause an infection. You don&apos;t deserve either of those and it doesn&apos;t make anything better. I can&apos;t pretend to understand this and I apologize if this seems insensitive, but to me this is an issue you should be getting help with.
