 Rating: 2/5 Great while it lasted
 
 Pros: Cheap, easy plug and play installation. Worked like a champ for 6 months.

 Cons: Died after 6 months, lights flicker occasionally but I get no signal through switch.

 Other Thoughts: For the cost I wasn&apos;t expecting that much. But I would have hoped I could have at least gotten 1 year out of it. Not worth the expense to return under warranty. Will by another brand in future.

 Rating: 5/5 Nice!!
 
 Pros: Small(Size of a folded wallet)The Dedicated UP-Link Port is very usefull for&apos;touchy&apos;home networks.

Identifys All types of networks automaticaly and assigns dedicated IP Adresses for different devices.

*For Under$20 It&apos;s A Steal!!!

 Cons: Port 1 Runs at 50 MBPS Because the Up Link and Port 1 are wired together for some reason. No big deal, because I was only connecting 2 Computers.

 Other Thoughts: Due to the half speed(50 MBPS)on Port#1 if you are needing EXACTLY 5 ports, then look somewhere else, this is entended for 2-3 Computer Hook-up&apos;s.

Before I had this I had one PC Directly Hardwired to my Router.(It ran 100 MBPS)I had my Second PC using a Wireless adapter(WLAN)Due to the position of my computer setup it had very poor signal(12-36 MBPS AT BEST)
From what I can tell, this Switch keeps the EXACT Same speed as being directly Hard wired, and is able to do so for 2 or 3 Computers at one time.

 Rating: 5/5 Nice cheap switch
 
 Pros: No installation or configuration required, just plugged in my devices and everything worked right away. After a few months of owning it I hardly even notice it&apos;s there.

 Cons: Requires an ac adapter, some similarly priced switches can be powered with a USB cable. Only 100mbps, but unless you have an ultra-expensive internet connection or regularly find yourself copying hard drives over your network you probably don&apos;t need a more expensive gigabit switch.

 Other Thoughts: Got this to share the wired connection of my PC with a laptop and PS3, I&apos;m now enjoying much higher download speeds and a more stable connection for both. The switch is very small and light, about the same size and weight as a folded wallet. It definitely won&apos;t weigh down any cables connected to it, so if you want it to stay put on a shelf you better get velcro pads or tape.

Had one odd network connection problem a week into owning it, which was immediately solved by resetting the power to the switch. No problems since.

 Cons: Port#1 does not work, the rest work without a problem.

 Other Thoughts: For$10 you can&apos;t go wrong. I am working on getting wired access for my iconia a500 at work. I am waiting for a usb to ethernet adapter.

 Rating: 5/5 What more could you ask for?
 
 Pros: Set this up in my dorm room so that I could get ethernet connection to both my and my roommate&apos;s laptop, my pogoplug pro, and my Xbox 360. I haven&apos;t run any actual tests, but it works like a dream.

 Cons: Okay, so this is actually just a 4 port switch, but it&apos;s not that big of a deal. If you were actually planning on using 5 ports, why didn&apos;t you just buy an 8 port switch?That way you would have more room just in case...?That&apos;s just my logic though.

 Rating: 5/5 Randomly saves the day
 
 Pros: Works consistently, and more reliable than the Ethernet port in the wall where I work.

 Cons: Only 10/100

There is a piece of ceramic on the power adapter that is starting to crack. It is not affecting the usage, but may one day become a hard or a problem.

 Other Thoughts: Bring a cable 5 feet longer than you think you need, just in case.
