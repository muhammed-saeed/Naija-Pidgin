A 30-year-old Arlington Heights man who pleaded guilty earlier this month to the armed robbery of a Buffalo Grove fast-food restaurant has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Timothy Boyer, of the 1600 block of Fox Run Drive, appeared before Cook County Circuit Judge John Scotillo today at the Rolling Meadows courthouse.

Prosecutors said Boyer entered a Subway restaurant on the 800 block of South Buffalo Grove Road last Nov. 22 and ordered two sandwiches. When he approached the counter to pay, Boyer pointed a handgun at the cashier and demanded money.

The employee gave Boyer $540 in cash before Boyer fled.

The robbery was captured on the restaurant&apos;s video surveillance system and images were distributed to area police departments. An officer recognized Boyer and contacted Buffalo Grove police.

Boyer faced a sentence of six to 30 years in prison for being convicted of a Class X felony.
