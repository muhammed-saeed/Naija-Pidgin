 Applying For Jobs

By PhillipPortman 



 
  Letter From The Edior 

Finding a job in Australia is tougher than ever before. Businesses are closing due to the financial crisis, so the interest in existing positions has increased dramatically. I remember applying for about 20 positions, and not receiving a single response. I felt down and defeated, but picked myself up and kept applying. Eventually, I landed an interview which lead to my current position. The key is to keep trying. More often than not, a lack of responses will have nothing to do with you personally. If an employer is sorting through 50 cover letters or resumes, they&apos;re going to be looking for ones that are unique from the rest. Whether you are applying for your very first job at a fast food restaurant or have been in the work force for years, this is the guide for you. We&apos;re going to take you through the steps of applying for a job, which will hopefully lead to your employment. As you will discover, there are little things you can do that can make a big difference in how potential employers view you.

 The Resume And Cover Letter

Before you even start considering searching for jobs, you are going to need to set up a resume and cover letter. A resume is basically your pitch. It&apos;s going to tell the employer what your skills are and how your previous experience in work, life, and education will help you if you get the job. The cover letter should compliment your resume, but should not be too long. 



 
 

 Other Tips And Hints: 
 Use a professional sounding email address. Email accounts we used from our teenage years can be quite embarrassing, and employers may not take you seriously. Don&apos;t lie on your resume. If you start adding skills and making up false achievements, it could come back to haunt you. It&apos;s usually best to type out your resume and print it on A4 paper. If you are applying for a job through email, simply send the word document as an attachment. If you do print your resume, ensure it doesn&apos;t get folded or creased. Keeping it in a manilla folder   is a good idea. Employers often look for references on your resume. You should provide details of a previous employer or a school teacher who could verify your potential for the job. Keep your resume up to date at all times. 
 

 
 
 
 What To Include In A Resume: 
 Information about you : Your name, phone number, address, email address . Goals : What are you trying to achieve by seeking employment at this business? Education : What level of education have you had? Did you attend university or tafe? Work : Have you been previously employed or worked as a volunteer? If you&apos;ve have many jobs, only list a few that you feel would increase your chances of employment. Also include a brief description of what you did at each previous job. Special Skills : Do you have any skills or talents that will benefit the company, should they employ you? Accomplishments : Have you been recognised for doing something extraordinary that might boost your credibility?

 Finding A Job



 
Now that you&apos;ve sorted out your resume, the next part is to actually hunt for jobs. As you may have gathered, there are literally thousands of different jobs available, so ways of finding vacent positions will vary. 
 Careers Expo : This might be better suited to recent or soon to be graduates. Whether you want to be a police officer of flip burgers at Hungry Jacks, You&apos;ll find all the information and potential employers at these expos. There are usually one or two per year in each capital city. Online : A lot of businesses advertise vacant positions on the internet. Sites such as CareerOne.com.au and Seek.com.au list thousands of new jobs each day.  Shopping Centres : If you&apos;re looking for a job in retail, head down to your local shopping centre with a few copies of your resume. If you see a store that you think might suit you, introduce yourself and ask to leave a copy of your resume with the manager. Community Notice Boards : Think of these as the real life version of a Myspace bulletin or Caigslist. Many potential employers will leave signs explaining the vacant position available and instructions on what do do if you&apos;re interested in a position. School/University : Often the school or university you attend have a guidance officer who can point you in the right direction. This is also a great place to start if you are soon to be graduating and aren&apos;t entirely sure what career path you want to take. Networking : In this modern age, we are all a little bit addicted to online social networking. There&apos;s Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, Youtube, and the list goes on. If you&apos;ve got a dream job, you will probably need to know a lot about the industry, including the people. Friending someone will only take you part of the way, so you&apos;ll need to introduce yourself to people in person. This might be done at local events, functions, or even at expos. It&apos;s all about &quot;who you know&quot;. 

 

 The Interview

So you found a position that sounds pretty interesting and you&apos;ve been contacted for an interview. First of all, congratulations. This means that the employer was impressed by your resume and cover letter. This part of the process though is the real test, and can be quite stressful. it&apos;s where many people fall apart due to nerves and lack of preparation. An interview does not guarantee a job, so it&apos;s important that you remain calm and focussed.

 What To Wear 

One of the first things they are going to notice about you is your physical appearance. You&apos;re going to need to make sure that you are clean, tidy, and well presented. You also need to dress in a way that is appropriate to the business you are applying for. You wouldn&apos;t wear army cargo shorts   and converse sneakers   to an interview to become a lawyer. At the same time, you wouldn&apos;t wear a three button men&apos;s suit   if you were applying for a position at a fish and chips shop. We&apos;ve put together some items you might wear to an interview for an office environment job.



 For Men 
 Men&apos;s Button Down Business Shirt   

 Always ensure that your shirt has a collar. Although it might be uncomfortable, always tuck your shirt in for the interview. If you want to look really professional, try wearing a neck tie   . 
 
 Men&apos;s Dress Pants   

 To match your shirt, you&apos;ll need a nice pair of dress pants. Baggy jeans   and shorts are not acceptable to wear to most interviews. Wearing a men&apos;s leather belt   will also help make you look smart and sophisticated. 

 
 
 Men&apos;s Leather Dress Shoes   

 A pair of leather dress shoes would be great to pull off your entire look. Most work places require you to wear leather shoes anyway, so you know you will get use out of them. If you already have a pair of leather shoes, make sure they are polished and clean. 
 



 For Women 
 Women&apos;s Long Sleeve Business Blouse   

  Women have many options when it comes to their tops,but opting for a business blouse is usually a smart option. They come in many colours and styles, so you can still add your own style to your outfit at work. 
 
 High Waist Pencil Skirt   

 If you&apos;re opting for a skirt, get something that isn&apos;t too short. Pencil skirts have long been an office favourite, and they aren&apos;t too uncomfortable. 
 
 Leather Ballet Flats   

 You want a pair of shoes that are going to look good, but be comfortable to wear all day. Ballet flats come in a variety of colours, and usually match most outfits. 
 

 Are You Ready?

Once your appearance has been sorted out, you need to prepare yourself for the interview itself. It is normal to get nervous and intimidated in these situations, but you have to try and not let it show. 



 Be Prepared  
 


 Have everything ready the night before the big interview: This could include ironing and getting your outfit together, printing off any documents the interviewee might require, and so on. Know a bit about the company: It&apos;s always good to know a little bit about the company you are seeking employment at. Check their website, just so you cover yourself if they ask any tricky questions. Go over your resume: Have a read over your resume and make sure everything is truthful. If you can think of anything else to add to your resume, also do that Have some answers ready: It&apos;s impossible to know all the questions you might be asked, but you might want to start thinking about your strengths, weaknesses, availability, and what made you want to apply for a position at this company. Know where you are going: You don&apos;t want to be late to your interview, so know exactly where you are going. If you have never been there before, try finding it a day or two before your interview. 

 
 

 Other Helpful Hints 
 


 Be Polite: Shake the interviewers hand and thank them for the opportunity. Little things like this go a long way. Stay Confident: If you&apos;re at a group interview or you see some other people getting interviewed, don&apos;t let them throw you off. Focus on yourself and your strengths, and you will be fine. If you start doubting yourself, the interviewer might pick up on it too. Don&apos;t Lie: It is really important that you don&apos;t lie. You might be asked some challenging questions, but if you don&apos;t know the answer, it&apos;s better to let them know. Trying to bluff your way around a question might work for some people, but it&apos;s probably better not to risk it. Switch Your Phone Off: Interviews usually don&apos;t go any longer than 15 minutes, so switch your mobile phone off. You don&apos;t want it ringing or vibrating during the interview. Relax: The most valuable advice is to relax. Don&apos;t let the interview spook you or stress you out too much. You should find that you start to calm down once the interview starts taking place.
