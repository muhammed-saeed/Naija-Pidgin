 Always Carry a Napkin or Kleenex 
 Posted on October 29, 2009 | Leave a comment 
 A trip to a washroom/restroom/bathroom/toilet of a fast food restaurant or coffee shop and you’ll be surprised to find out that there are no paper towels in many of them. And while some of the hand dryers do a fine job, others could barely dry off a drip of sweat.

But that’s not necessarily the issue. My main concern is the incredible amount of bacteria on the of the door handle. It’s not always easy to to grab toilet paper. The stalls are either occupied or the wafer thin paper shreds at the slightest touch.

The solution–carry serviettes with you or grab some before you go in. It will save you much aggravation and fight off some of those nasty bugs.

 Fold your Cheque (Check) 
 Posted on October 22, 2009 | 2 Comments 
 

 With all the electronic banking we do we just don’t seem to use cheques (checks inthe US) as often as we used to. 

 Regardless, you get to the bank machine and you often have to rifle through your purse, wallet or pockets to find it. 

 Here’s a tip. 

 Instead of folding it so that the face of the cheque is hidden, fold it backwards so you can see the details. This way it will stand out more amongst the blizzard of receipts and scraps of paper, which are most often white, avoiding those jeers from those who are standing in line behind you.
