1 Circle Time Theme: Transportation 1. Air, Land, Or Water Materials: Pictures of motorcycles, cars, trucks, bulldozers, feet, saddled horses, wagons, ferries, helicopters, airplanes, hot air balloons, sail boats, motor boats, ships, submarines, rafts, garbage trucks, ambulances, sea planes, unicycles, snowmobiles, dog sleds, sleighs, trains, race cars, paddle boats, canoes, rocket ships/space shuttles, motorcycle, four-wheelers, etc. (note these can be downloaded from the internet or found in magazines).

Green, and blue tablecloths from the Dollar Tree or LARGE pieces of paper in each color. Before this activity begins, cut the blue cloth in Â½ creating a cwavy d edge (like water). Use the other half to create a sky complete with white, puffy clouds.

Assemble the cloths on the floor to create a cland, sea, and air d effect. Directions: 1. Begin by asking students about their own travel experiences ( cHas anyone ever flown in an airplane?

Ridden on a boat? A truck? d Etc.) Allow students to share their experiences. 2.

Explain that there are many ways to travel on the land, water, and in the air. Allow each student to choose a picture and ask them to tell the class about it. If necessary provide the name of the object and ... more. less. 
 
some details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Ask the students where they think the object belongs (land, water, or air) and have them explain their answers. If needed, help them by calling attention to specific details ( cSnowmobiles have special skis on the bottom so they can drive on top of snow. d).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Then have the student place their picture where it belongs. When this activity is finished you will have a cland, sea, and air d mural.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Encourage the students to clear it off and reassemble it during center time.

Using the pictures, create a graph titled cMy Favorite Way to Travel d. Be sure to have an cother d column so that everyone has the opportunity to list their favorite mode of transportation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Directions: 1. Begin by discussing the different modes of transportation. Show students the pictures and ask how they are alike and different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Encourage students to discuss their own travel experiences. 2. Explain to students that they are going to choose their favorite way to travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It 9s o.k. if they have not traveled that way before as long as they think they may like it best. 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before collecting the data ask the students to guess which mode of transportation will be most popular. 4. Graph the data as each student chooses their favorite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be sure to ask them why they made that choice. 5. Assist the students in counting the names in each column and comparing the quantities to discover the classes 9 most popular way to travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did they guess correctly? This activity can be extended into the art center where students may choose to paint a picture of their favorite way to travel. Be sure to ask them about their picture and write what they say across bottom of the paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;VPK Standards Addressed: II. D.1 Shows some planning and reflection III.

Transportation Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down Materials : 8-10 sentence strips and markers, large cards labeled True with a picture of a thumb up and False with a picture of a thumb down. Before this activity write a statement on each sentence strip (Trains need must travel on tracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cars have two wheels. Some planes can land o water. Ambulances have sirens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Submarines have sails. Etc). Be sure to include both true and false statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Directions: 1. Begin by reviewing some transportation concepts ( cWhat do we know about transportation? d) and encourage student response. If necessary assist them with reminders such as cWe know that planes have wings and travel in the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What else travels in the air? d 2. Explain that you are going to play a game that will require them to listen carefully and think hard . Tell the students that each time you make a true statement they will respond by giving the thumbs up signal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your statement is false they will give the thumbs down signal (model thumbs up and thumbs down as you explain). Be sure to explain that false means not true. 5 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Practice a few times using statements about student 9s clothing ( cChase is wearing blue pants today. Thumbs up or thumbs down. d ). Once they seem to understand the rules hold up each sentence strip and read it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ask the children cthumbs up or thumbs down d after each statement. Place the strip under the correct True or False card. 4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you have finished review the statements quickly. VPK Standards Addressed: I.
