A friend of mine and I went here for dinner one day, I being a Pho 99 virgin. Upon entering, it seemed it is a popular Asian restaurant, as all the customers were Asians. I mean, if natives think it is good, then it is a sign.

We each ordered a combo spring roll, which went really well with the peanut sauce. I then ordered a small raw beef and tripe pho. It was great, and the size of the small was big enough for my taste. The Asian mint and the bean sprouts were fresh, and I generally liked the flexibility of this dish. I think they did this well, with a very flavorful broth, and I actually finished everything in my bowl, including the broth. I rarely do that with phos.

So yes, the only unfortunate thing was that it took me seven years to actually visit this place. I wished I was here before, and not when I only have a few weeks left before I leave Buffalo for good. Hopefully I still have a few other chances to pay this neat little hole in the wall restaurant a visit.

while this polish girl is by no means an eleventh order foodie, i DO know good food when i taste it, and Pho 99 is good eats, plain and simple.

don&apos;t let the locale or the facade fool you, there is some high quality, fresh vietnamese yumminess being cooked up and served up in almost no time at all within those walls.  the vibe here is really kinda cool, because while Pho 99 appears to be your average take out joint, inside you will find a young and unpretentious ambiance (the fun music and UB regulars certainly help!).  the interior is always clean, and the service is always fast, accommodating, and friendly.

the man and i love the clean, crisp flavors of the beef pho, which is accompanied by plenty of fixings (thai basil, jalapenos, limes, and bean sprouts).  the pork bbq skewer is savory and is so tender it melts in your mouth, and the fresh veggie spring rolls are the bomb, wrapped in a raw rice wrap and served with a tasty dipping sauce.  now, the man and i patronize Pho 99 for the pho, of course, but we really come for the lemongrass chicken, which is HANDS DOWN the best i&apos;ve found in town...be forewarned, however, that this is a SPICY dish, and you&apos;re going to want to be sure you take your zantac that day (there is plenty of red pepper seasoning, but it is contained within a very well balanced, albeit zippy, sauce).

price points here are extremely reasonable, especially considering the generous (but not ridiculously so) portions.  you will definitely have lunch for the next day, guaranteed, and i bet you&apos;ll enjoy it just as much as the night before ;)

Today was a perfect pho day. Cool, foggy, misty and crying for some comfort.

I made my way over to Pho 99 because I didn&apos;t review it the first time I ate there, in November. Aside from parking (I prefer big black top lots that are FREE, I know, I know...) my experience couldn&apos;t have been better.

Walked in, seated myself at a booth, and ordered a Vietnamese Egg Roll and a large #27, the beef pho.

Egg roll was perfectly crispy and fresh and little dipping sauce was awesome... I like that their rolls are extra long. You&apos;d think $1.85 is a lot to pay for 1 roll, but it&apos;s equivalent to at least 1.5 rolls elsewhere. Great start to my meal! Within a few minutes, my piping hot mixing bowl of pho came out. I took one look and knew that I was in heaven!

It was definitely the best pho (&amp;egg roll) I&apos;ve had in Buffalo (a very important distinction!). And I know I may have said that about Pho Saigon or even New Saigon, but this time I REALLY mean it. I didn&apos;t have to add a thing to it, it was perfect in and of itself. I so enjoyed everything about my lunch experience, including the orchestral version of The Postal Service&apos;s &apos;Such Great Heights&apos; and other Yanni-type music playing throughout my meal.

This is a bit further for me than Pho Saigon and parking isn&apos;t nearly as convenient, but I think I&apos;ve found my new regular pho spot. :)

I have frequented 99 for several  years and I or any of the people I been with  have ever been dissatisfied , it is one of the best Asian takeaway/sitdown  places in Bflo.. I agree it lacks a certain style but remember they are in the business of supplying an authentic product to mostly students and the few people who can appreciate excellent  southeast asian  food. My wife is Thai and I also know many people of  asian descent  that have eaten at 99 and they all feel very strongly that the food and the cost are excellent. I enjoy the a place that sticks to bare bones style and quality product, I am not paying for ambiance. Don&apos;t  forget to try the Durian shake if you want something with  the taste of southeast asia. I hope 99 stays solid for many years to come........ love the placeand you will too.

I&apos;d never had pho. I knew, as a self proclaimed &quot;foodie&quot; this was a crime. On a cold, rainy day I decided to finally make a pho pilgrimage. I used to live very close to the restaurant so I wasn&apos;t put off by the neighborhood, but it can get pretty questionable. The restaurant was much larger than I thought it&apos;d be and I loved the aquarium.

My fiance and I each got a spring roll with pork. They were good, a little flavorless but I think I just don&apos;t like spring rolls. We both ordered the 27 pho with raw meat. Our bowls came out piping hot and came with the little plate of goodies along with it. Being pho noobs we were not entirely sure about the jalapenos and bean sprouts but assumed we dumped it in the soup.

This soup was hot! Leaning over the bowl caused my glasses to fog up. But it was really tasty. I added sriacha to  it, not sure if that is a pho sin, but it was really delicious. I got a small but I felt like I was in one of those never-ending-soup-bowl research studies. It was very filling!

I think I&apos;m officially a pho fan! Can&apos;t wait to try more.

After receiving multiple recommendations for Pho 99, it felt like a great day for pho! It&apos;s raining outside, so what can be better than a warm bowl of delicious pho on a chilly day, right?

Keep in mind that I&apos;m from SoCal, which includes Westminster, aka Little Saigon. So I hold Vietnamese food standards at its highest. I would give Pho 99 a higher rating, but overall, it&apos;s decent and great in this area. It&apos;ll do the trick for those cravings.

I had the Pho Tai, beef noodle soup with sliced rare steak ($6.50 for a small, $8.50 for a large). The small size is filling for my appetite, but to me, it&apos;s slightly overpriced.

The menu is very minimal. It&apos;s considered &apos;Japanese-Vietnamese&apos; so there&apos;s one side with things like Chicken Teriyaki, etc.

I also liked their music selection, a lot of EDM. It&apos;s rare to hear that around here!

Accepts credit cards!
Parking is pretty limited.

 2/2/2012 1 Check-in Here 
I had a craving for pho and did a quick Yelp search to find Pho99. So I drove here after work to get some take out for me and the hubs. Super tasty Pho Thai. Loved it. And I really loved all the different pho options! I&apos;d never seen so many at one restaurant- but I guess with &quot;pho&quot; in the title you have to take it up a notch. Well done!  Delicious broth, especially with the sriracha sauce and the perfect amount of noodles and veggies. Also happy they give you a lime and not a lemon- who uses lemon in pho? Come on! Well not Pho 99- they give you the lime! Yay! I was also very pleased with the beef, it was very thin and very tender and not fatty at all. It was SO delicious and cooked instantly as it hit the broth. Perfect. Service was polite and fast.

My only critique is the neighborhood. I drove here at night and was a little scared to leave my car. It was just a little jarring to drive through the neighborhood where everything has bars on it- everything. But that&apos;s not the restaurant&apos;s fault so I don&apos;t ding them for that. I would just maybe make sure I come here during the day next time or maybe bring a friend.

I&apos;ll definitely make this place my pho connection for my next craving!

Food - Okay, so I didn&apos;t get pho *dodges rotten tomato* and I&apos;ve never had pho *dodges head of lettuce* but I couldn&apos;t pass up one of the other dishes. I had never had Vietnamese and frankly it was excellent. I got a fresh vegetarian spring roll to start, not even thinking about the fact &quot;fresh&quot; = raw in some Asian cultures. The wrapper part (which is semi-translucent and somewhat chewy) was quite tasty, and I LOVED the dipping sauce but the inside was basically lettuce and some bean sprouts (albeit crisp ones). I would have enjoyed a variety of veggies instead, but again, I&apos;ve never had Vietnamese so this could be a traditional combination. The Vietnamese egg noodles with seafood and vegetables was my main course - hearty, vermicelli-style egg noodles with a sweet, savory and mildly spicy brown sauce that wasn&apos;t too thick or salty, tossed with very fresh veggies and seafood (and some krab, but I don&apos;t mind that). Very large portion for $8&apos;n&apos;change. The Jasmine tea was cheap and decent.

Service/Ambiance - Waiter was pretty fast, friendly and attentive, though strangely told us we were &quot;weird for not getting the soup&quot; when we went to pay because of the &quot;cold weather&quot; that day *shrug.* Apparently even he wanted to toot the pho&apos;s horn (though he threw no vegetables). The restaurant is simple, clean and nothing ostentatious but (I&apos;m going full white-girl here) was populated with 95% Asian folks and was quite busy for a dreary, cold day. Also, I feel I have to address the area as I got a lot of &quot;that&apos;s off Bailey right?&quot; questions accompanied by looks of fear when I mentioned the place to co-workers. This isn&apos;t a bad area at all and I&apos;ll add the East Side has many decent areas. Don&apos;t let hype deter you from good eats.

Buffalo has a ton of real high quality cheap eateries but the one I frequently crave is Pho 99 Fast Food.  Sure the name sucks, the location leaves much to be desired and the decor is a bit dated, but the food here is absolutely of the highest quality.  While there are plenty of stir fry menu options, which tend to range from decent to excellent, the real reason you go to this restaurant is for its namesake: Pho.  While I&apos;m no expert on Pho, I was in Vietnam several years back and I acquired an addiction to this meal-in-a-bowl-of-soup.  Pho is Vietnamese comfort food and once you get hooked you can not get enough.  However, there are just not enough people hooked, and I have found it VERY difficult to get a Buffalonian to eat Pho with you.  Therefore, as Pho lovers of the world, it is your duty, nay your sacred charge to convert your friends to this delight post haste!!

Now back to the review:  There are several restaurants in Buffalo that serve Pho, like Pho Saigon* (on NFBLVD) and Red Pepper (on Maple), but Pho 99 makes the best in town (in my ever so humble opinion).  Personally, I prefer a large variety of different meats in my Pho, so for me the variety choice: Meat Ball, Raw Meat, Tripe, and Tendon is the only way to go.  However for the less adventurous eater stick with more traditional meats.  For a cold Buffalo night, a steamy bowl of Pho on North Bailey can not be beat.  Just make sure you hide your valuables, lock your car and not look anyone in the eye on the way into the restaurant (I kid...or do I?).

While you are there you HAVE TO try the BBQ Beef Short Rib appetizer.  These are absolutely delicious thin slices of Short Rib that are fun to eat and will satisfy your craving for animal fats.  They also make refreshingly delicious milkshakes.  Though the avocado is always a nice standby, the Durian gives you that &quot;I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;m enjoying a fruit that tastes like stinky feet&quot; feeling.

Oh and if the owners are reading this: BRING BACK THE BANH MI!!! I can not find any Banh Mi in Buffalo and that my dear friends is a crime!!

So if the European Debt Crisis has got you down and your wallet is a bit tight, head over to Pho 99 and eat like the overindulgent capitalist that you are!!

*As a sidenote Pho Saigon is a close runnerup, with an EXCELLENT Vietnamese menu...try the Grilled Pork Paste, Vietnamese Chicken Wings and Soursop Milkshake there.  Pho Saigon&apos;s menu is FAR more extensive than Pho 99&apos;s (and frankly most of their meals are better), but their Pho broth does not top Pho 99&apos;s.

I always bring friends to Pho 99. It is sort of divey, and tucked away on Bailey Avenue, not far from the University. It is next to a weird impound lot. No one would ever guess the small brick building housed an awesome Vietnamese restaurant. Every time I walk in I am surprised by the sweet smell of mint and Thai basil. The surprise is part of the appeal for me, and why I like to bring others there. Hey pals: I&apos;m in the know. I have good taste.

Some friends from DC were visiting last summer. We decided to head to Pho 99. I asked if everyone liked Vietnamese because I knew of a really cool place. I wanted to impress them with my edgy taste. I had the Pho Tai, Vietnamese soup with slices of raw beef. (By the time you eat it, the beef it has been cooked in the hot broth.)

I don&apos;t remember what anyone else ordered, but I do know that I left my Ray-Bans at the restaurant. I was so bummed because I just received the Wayfarers a few weeks earlier, for my birthday. I felt so cool. They were the kind Tom Cruise wears in Risky Business. I didn&apos;t realize I left them until the next morning. The whole night I agonized about where I could&apos;ve put them. Were they at Pho 99? And if so, would anyone from the weird impound lot next door have yanked them?

As soon as Pho 99 opened the next day I called and asked if they had my shades. The wait staff knew exactly what I was looking for -- they put them aside the night before! I hopped into my car and sped to the restaurant. I ran up to the cash register like a crazy person and told the kid up front that I was the person who just called. He handed me my sunglasses. I put them on. I remembered I was still indoors so I took them off. I stayed for a bowl of Pho Tai.

I&apos;ve ordered the Pho Tai so many times. I toss some greens and some hot peppers and some sprouts into the broth. Sometimes I also sprinkle in some Sriracha. I like the taste just fine, but I do it because it&apos;s what I think people in the know do. Two years ago the New York Times published an article about the sauce&apos;s popularity. (You can read it here: http://www.nytimes.com/2… .)

That morning I dined alone. The Pho Tai was delicious, and that&apos;s no surprise. It always is.

It may be a sign of good taste to take friends out for Vietnamese, or to wear Wayfarers or to put Sriracha on your food. But, please, order the food at Pho 99 because it tastes good. Very good.

&quot;What the PHO!&quot; One of the best places in town, if your are looking for some PHO / Vietnamese cuisine. I&apos;ve tried various dishes on the menu, and everything tasted fantastic. My dad, who only eats Indian foods (even in foreign lands), was convinced to try Vietnamese food around the world. My only tiffs with 99 is the lack of servers during peak hours, lack of proper parking, and in a shady neighborhood.

I would highly recommend the Fresh OJ, and No.23 on the menu :)

Also the price to food taste ratio is simply too good to be true.

Out in Buffalo visiting my BF&apos;s family. I love pho, but pho in Buffalo just isn&apos;t the same as DC. The service was horrible, but the hip hop jams that were playing in the background helped me curb my frustration. The food was descent; I ordered the raw
meat pho.Would I go back? Probably not. I&apos;ll stick to Eden Center back home.

I went today, for my birthday.
It is a cold and rainy day.
It&apos;s also the first day I have ever had Pho here.
In all fairness, this nice little spot is close to home (less than a mile), so I don&apos;t get all of the neighborhood hate. There ARE much worse parts of the city. That being said...lets get to the food.

I ordered an:
Iced Coffee
Egg Roll
Small (Regular Size) Pho Tai Gan
Small (Regular Size) Lemon Grass Beef

The iced coffee was exactly how it was supposed to be, and tasted exactly like it should have for Vietnamese iced coffee. A definite winner!

The egg roll was also delicious. It came to my table quickly. It was piping hot, and not greasy. The dipping sauce was delicious with it, and rounded it out quite well.

The pho....well the pho was phenomenal! It was HUGE. Piping hot to the table, the basil and bean sprouts along with the other additions that came were fresh. None were wilted like some of the other reviews stated. I added just a touch of chili paste, as I like my food on the spicier side. I did not find the broth to be bland, or oily as also suggested in other reviews. I found the serving to be more than enough for one person, and very very tasty! The noodles were perfect, not overly cooked and not under cooked either.

I couldn&apos;t even finish the &quot;small&quot; bowl. So, I never to got the lemongrass beef, which I plan to have for dinner tonight.

For all of this my entire bill was less than $20. And TRUST ME when I tell you, for the average person, the regular size pho serving is enough to seriously fill you up.

The only regret I have is not going here sooner as I&apos;ve lived in the city almost my entire like, and now today, on my 28th birthday, I just went for the first time.

I will absolutely be going back.
Waitstaff was fast and curtious. When I told him that it was in fact my first time at the restaurant, he was very helpful (he even warned me that what I was ordering I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to finish...he was totally right)...

The worst part of the experience? The loud and obnoxious college students that were there....throwing straw wrappers around the restaurant, swearing across at other tables of friends, never minding the fact that there were several tables with small children there at the time......and It wasnt later on a friday, I went at 11am on a Sunday.

All in all, I WILL be going back again and again. Best soup ever on a cold dreary day like today! Can&apos;t wait to return.

I&apos;m a long time customer. I got out of a regular habit of visiting after they got railroaded out of downtown, and I don&apos;t often have occasion to be on Bailey Ave - especially since Anacone&apos;s closed (what wouldn&apos;t I chop off for one of their beef on wecks).
I&apos;ts well worth whatever detour you might have to make as any other pho anywhere around here will simply be inferior.

My wife and I were craving some good Pho - but we were in Buffalo and didn&apos;t know where to go.  We didn&apos;t want to venture too far because it was late - and Buffalo seems like a rough place.  Luckily - Yelp&apos;s top reviewed Vietnamese place was only a few miles from our hotel.  I have to admit - I was afraid to park my car on the street since area looked so sketchy at night.

In any case - my wife ordered the Eye of Round Pho (Pho Tai) - which was up to par with other Pho places we have been to in Maryland and New Jersey.

I ordered a steamed rice dish with pork and egg (I believe it was Com Tam Suon Bi Trung) because the waiter recommended it.  It was a very large portion - and it was delicious.  It had the right combination of flavor and texture.  Definitely more hearty than Pho.

To drink - I ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee which was as good as any other place I have had it.

The service was good - and the waiter was friendly and helpful.

If I am ever in Buffalo again - I&apos;ll definitely stop by again.

I have been coming to Pho99 for almost 8 years since I was an undergrad dorming close by at UB. Although it&apos;s not in Buffalo&apos;s best neighborhood, my friend took me here and told me it was the most authentic Asian food she could find in Buffalo.

The food is delicious, fast, healthy and reasonably priced.

It&apos;s nothing fancy, the restaurant definitely has a fast food feel, however the service is friendly and attentive and I&apos;ve never had not one complaint.

It&apos;s always an eclectic crowd comprised of academics, locals, students, families and tourists of all ethnicities and backgrounds...

I always order a small Pho, because the larger sizes are too much food for me. I highly recommend the iced coffee and jackfruit shake.

In a rough patch of Buffalo lies a gem of a restaurant.  This is the best viet food I have had in Buffalo and ranks high up there in the list of viet places I have tried anywhere.

I recommend the Com Tam Suon Bi Trung which is the grilled pork over broken rice.  Extremely flavorful and quite filling.  I had the large portion.  I also had the avocado shake which was good.  If you never have tried one, it&apos;s like ice cream and avocado all in one creamy drink.  Put it on your bucket list!

The neighborhood is run down and it is a bit hard to find on the road.  Be on the look out for it because it is easy to miss.  It will be on your right side if you are heading south on Bailey Ave when passing the VA hospital.

if you&apos;re asian-american and live in buffalo like i once did, i feel sorry for you. but pho 99 fast food can make things a little better. sure, the pho doesn&apos;t compare to other places in nyc or sf or la, but every item i have tried on the menu has been all-around good. some of my favorites incl: rice vermicelli w/ pork skewer, spring rolls, and avocado shake. the best part about this place is that i don&apos;t need to run a faucet down my mouth after eating here (unlike most asian restaurants in the city that just overload in msg). the worst part is trying to drive down bailey ave and having cops block off the street to check one car at a time for god knows what.

This place is great. the people who work here work hard and it pays off. they&apos;re always polite too! which is nice and surprising considering how busy it can get.

I usually start off with a $2.25 fresh 10&quot; shrimp spring roll. it&apos;s amazing, it&apos;s super refreshing and always smells, looks, and most importantly tastes fresh.

By the time I&apos;m done chowing down on that; my pho is usually ready. I go for a small #29 (something like $6-8). raw meat and tendon. it&apos;s always piping hot and super flavorful. The tendon adds a nice chewy texture that I believe adds quite a bit.

they&apos;ve got a great selection of sauces at the table including some hot, some super hot, and a nice fruity sauce too. they go well with the spring rolls and pho.

Ive tried there some of the non pho items such as the lemon grass chicken spicy beef. both were really good. The larges aren&apos;t much bigger than the small... I noticed more rice and a little more veggies/meat.

Note: the small bowl of Pho ain&apos;t small... It&apos;s a solid lunch/dinner portion
the Large is great when ordering with other dishes and sharing family style

I have been eating at pho 99 for a couple of years. I love the pho but lately they have had some issues with the kitchen hood. If you decide to go eat there you&apos;d better make sure you bring a change of clothes, visine and a face mask! It&apos;s awful!!! I have actually walked out because it is so smokey. I can&apos;t believe the health department hasn&apos;t had issues with this. It is so terrible I am not sure I will go back unless it gets fixed. Mr. Ho please help your daughter fix this hood because her husband is too cheap to do it right!!! I hope you come back from Florida to save your beloved restaurant!!!!

Quite average if you ask me. Maybe because I get use to eating $5 Pho in NYC, so when the Pho was ~$8 for a &quot;Large&quot;, I was like whoa.. already. When I got the &quot;large&quot;, I was like.. &quot;seriously?&quot;. The large is smaller than the size I get for $5. Well I can see why prices are so high, since it is located in Buffalo with no other Pho places around, so people would have to pay high prices for regular Pho.

The Pho was good, but nothing I would rave about.
Also, they only had 2 workers on a Saturday afternoon. Service is really slow. Takes about 15 minutes to rice dish out. And one of my friend&apos;s dish included a piece of hair in it too. Well, at least they offered another dish without questioning.

I&apos;ve had some of the best pho in NYC and LA, so to compare Pho 99 to them is quite a big deal. For pho in Buffalo, its hands down the best you will get. The sprouts, basil, jalapenos and other ingredients are fresh. The broth is tasty, the meat tender&amp;delicious; soup = hot. To top it off, the staff is friendly, very fast and accommodating for small or larger parties.

They even have something for everyone; from the veggie spring roll to the vietnamese egg roll. Not to mention, the lemon grass chicken! I suggest trying that if you aren&apos;t a fan of pho it&apos;s out of this world!

So here&apos;s the deal - I come from a place where I can get 24 hour Pho whenever I want.  After moving here I gave myself a few months to realize that this was no Seattle, and after going to four different Pho locations I&apos;d have to say this hit the spot the best.
The broth is ok, but tastes different depending on when I go.  What I like the best about it is that it&apos;s less oily than the other places I&apos;ve been too.  The noodles are usually perfect and the meat is always tender.  I like that they have &quot;teriyaki&quot; dishes so my brother can eat something while I get my Pho fix.
Something I&apos;m not used to is that when I order a &apos;large&apos; I expect some big ass bowls, just like Seattle, and every time I&apos;ve ordered a large over here the portion seems small to me.  But, nonetheless, I will keep going back here, because one, it tastes good, and two, it reminds me a little bit of home.

this place is tasty. forget about the spring roll; it&apos;s just not very good. The Pho, however, is good - not the best - but good.

I knew it&apos;d be good when I called and the person who answered spoke very little English. That&apos;s called authenticity.

Coming from NYC with so many Vietnamese places, this place can&apos;t compare. Actually, I think this place gave me and my friend tummy aches.

We all know that the thing that makes pho good is the broth and since I read raving reviews about it - I had to try it. So we ordered the broth with beef balls. The broth wasn&apos;t bad, but it was a bit off - I think Red Pepper has better broth. I also got the BBQ Pork, which I guess is the counterpart of pork chop over rice in NYC. It&apos;s a bit sweeter and all cut up for you, which is definitely convenient! But the NYC pork has this smoky flavor that is so so so good.

I think the only thing that is comparable is the coffee. It&apos;s strong and bold with condensed milk and tastes amazing. I wanted to get like two cups to go back to school with.

I also think that the dishes are a bit overpriced for what they are...like 2.50 for a mini bowl of broth and like 3 small beef balls cut in halves. They also have this one waiter who looks like he doesn&apos;t want to be there, but honestly doesn&apos;t have a choice.

The Pho was delicious.  I ordered the mixed meat, less tripe.  The broth was delicious, and the plate of fresh herbs was great.

I also had the BBQ Short Rib, for $2.20 it is definately a simple quick beef fix.

The spring rolls were huge (10&quot;) and filled with fresh basil and cilantro.

Service is prompt and friendly. Food is piping hot and delicious (I&apos;m talking about the pho here). They have tendon. I like tendon.

You really don&apos;t get much better value for this price, though I do know of a place in Philly, Nanzhou, that gives you more food for your buck. But Pho 99 is delicious. I loved how they have the hot version of the Sriracha sauce and that their peppers are hot hot hot!! Would love to come here again next time I&apos;m in Buffalo and spend some more time. My favorite thing about the place was definitely getting basil right off of the stem. Do you grow them in the back? Cause I want to live there.

First time at 99 and we did take-out.  I had the meat ball soup and lemon grass chicken with fried rice.  My wife had a veggie spring roll and chicken with vegetables and teriyaki.  Total price was $24. This will be go to for take-out.

Overall, very good and plenty of food (I had a large, and it&apos;s 2 meals).  The fried rice was light and tasty, not overly greasy.  It could have been more spicy for me, but good flavor.  The chicken was cut long and skinny.  My wife had lots of veggies and good flavor.

Service was excellent as far as takeout goes.

I&apos;ll do my best to give a fair review. I&apos;m a West Coaster and there are a ton of Vietnamese restaurants particularly in Garden Grove,CA because of the high Vietnamese population (Duh, right?) Next, to bubble tea and sushi I&apos;m a Pho nut. So I&apos;ve experience pho all over from NorCal to SoCal. We always went to Garden Grove for the best pho. My friends (especially my asian friends) would go out of the way (45 mins of driving) to get some.

I was not impressed with this place. Maybe I picked a bad time. I came in during the winter when it was slow

Unfortunately, when they served my Pho it wasn&apos;t very hot. And the sprouts and basil that came with it were slightly wilted. I was almost tempted to return the dish. However, the price was right. But I haven&apos;t been back since.

The location is not an issue for me because if I love a restaurant I will travel far to go specifically to that restaurant. I&apos;m a Cali driver so I&apos;m used to it.

I&apos;ve only experience this restaurant and the one on Niagara Falls Blvd. As fair as I can be I say go to the one on Niagara Falls Blvd. They fair more 3.9 stars. And the 15 minute drive is worth it. (I know how you Buffalonians think 20 mins is a long drive. :-) but this place is worth a few more minutes of driving, I think).

It still is decent pho and if your on a college budget and you want a break from nuked ramen then check this place out. Not too shabby.

The customer service was good and the Thai ice tea( which is another thing I try at every Pho restaurant )was good.

This is not super authentic Vietnamese, but they do the fast food portion of it well.  BBQ pork w/ egg pie on rice is SLAMMIN.  The Pho is decent.. but the prices are the big draw.  They could easily charge double with bad service (like most restaurants in the hood) since they&apos;re so unique in this part of town but they don&apos;t... 5 stars for keeping it real.

Pretty good! There wasn&apos;t a chicken option for Pho, only beef, and I&apos;m a little weird about meat sometimes and had to pick out some weird/fatty pieces, but I can&apos;t give less stars for it because I know it doesn&apos;t bother a lot of people.

Pho soups are fantastic here.  Generously sized, and all manner of ingredients available.  Appetizers are great as well, esp. the spring rolls.  Not a fan of some of the bbq dishes, which were a bit too sweet and otherwise bland for my taste, but again, portion sizes are impressive, so you won&apos;t leave hungry.

They used to have 6 varieties of Vietnamese sandwiches, but last time I visited they were no longer available.  Too bad, because they were excellent.

Try the Vietnamese coffee, BTW.  Excellent.

I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ve changed management but I&apos;ve noticed a bunch of new workers here recently and I feel like my portions have gotten bigger.  Their BBQ pork rice dish is every bit as good as I&apos;ve had anywhere.  But I tend to stick to take-out b/c service is really inconsistent - different ppl work on different days and some are significantly worse than others.

probably the best viet spot in Buffalo!

prices have risen over the years and portions have shrunk, but this place remains a staple to university students and locals.

order yourself an egg roll or a spring roll and then get a 36 large (bbq pork) or a 32 large (variety pho). Thats ALL YOU NEED!!! I think they have the best pho in Buffalo and no one can compare with their 36 large. So just stop in and try it!

I&apos;m not a fan but tons of ppl like the avacado shake. Viet coffee is also very good.

Great for those cold snowy months in buffalo.  The pho tai and the banh mi&apos;s they used to sell are/were the high points.  Tried other things on the menu but always regretted not getting the pho.  Now if only buffalo had a good ramen place.
