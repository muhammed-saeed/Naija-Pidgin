Consumers Can’t Sue Credit Card Companies for Deceptive Language and Hidden Fees

The Supreme Court this month affirmed the right of credit card companies to deny you the ability to take them to court, leaving consumers with little recourse to fight back against abusive practices and deceptive contracts.

 Consumers have few options to avoid binding arbitration clauses Arbitration clauses proliferating for all manner of products Arbitration Fairness Act in Congress could restore people’s right to fairly collect damages 

 No Day in Court 

In an eight to one decision in the case CompuCredit v. Greenwood , the Supreme Court ruled that consumers could not sue their credit card company for deceptive language and hidden fees, because of a small-print clause in their contracts mandating that disputes be settled by binding arbitration, not lawsuit.

The plaintiffs had hoped that the 1996 Credit Repair Organization Act , aimed at stopping deceptive credit card practices, would allow them to be heard in front of a jury. Not so, said the court—nothing in the act decisively prevents companies from including binding arbitration in contracts, even though the CROA explicitly says consumers have the right to sue.“Had Congress meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it would have done so in a manner less obtuse,”wrote majority opinion author Justice Antonin Scalia.

That means if you want to use a credit card, you have to play by the company’s rules. Worse, binding arbitration agreements are popping up in contracts for all kinds of other products as well, often as agreements you don’t even have to sign. The CompuCredit v. Greenwood decision continues a disturbing pattern of courts upholding the right of companies in any number of circumstances to preclude lawsuits and erode the right of consumers to have their day in court.

Greenwood decision continues a disturbing pattern of courts upholding the right of companies in any number of circumstances to preclude lawsuits and erode the right of consumers to have their day in court. A Huge Blow to Consumers Julia Duncan of the American Association for Justice “The CompuCredit decision was a huge blow to consumers, and really to all individuals in the country,” argues Julia Duncan, director of federal programs for the American Association for Justice, the world’s largest trial bar. “I think it’s fair to say most Americans are subject to forced arbitration clauses in some aspect of their lives.” Lawyers.com Website | Blog | LexisNexis If you are defrauded or otherwise have cause to bring damages against your credit card company, good luck. Not only can companies block you from suing them, they force plaintiffs into a rigged arbitration system where the company controls the entire environment. “The way companies are using it is really abusive to consumers,” Duncan says. “They decide which arbitration company will be chosen, and by virtue of being able to choose who the arbitrators are, they also choose the rules of the whole arbitration process.” Proceedings are often cloaked in secrecy, meaning other consumers might not ever hear about what the company did. What’s worse, the same provisions mandating binding arbitration can also prevent class action suits, so injured consumers have to go at it alone. “The average consumer is not going to have the resources to file a claim for a relatively small amount of money,” Duncan notes. “Especially when the corporation completely stacks the deck against the consumer.” The result? Faced with massive odds against a successful case, people just don’t bother to pursue their claims. Chalk up another loss for the little guy. Very Old Federal Law Why are companies able to circumvent what seems like basic consumer rights? Unfortunately, they are relying on long-settled law. The 1925 Federal Arbitration Act gave businesses the right to include arbitration clauses in their contracts with each other—but used language broad enough to encompass dealings with individual consumers as well. “Courts are looking at this very old federal law saying Congress didn’t write anything in here that makes it clear that there are limits,” Duncan explains. “It wasn’t really until the last few decades when companies started realizing there doesn’t seem to be any limit to the Federal Arbitration Act—there’s no reason we can’t use forced arbitration clauses in credit card contracts, employment contracts, nursing home admission contracts.” Want To Sue? Think Again With the barn door wide open, binding arbitration is now being applied to a shocking expanse of products. Consider: • A school field trip company has banned parents from suing in court if their child gets hurt. • A martial arts supplier mandates binding arbitration in the event of injury using its products. • Any dispute over Starbucks Gift Cards cannot be brought to court. • Want to sue over your Sony Playstation? Think again. • You will not be seeing Verizon Wireless in court. • Owed damages by Nieman Marcus? BINDING ARBITRATION! • Think the banks aren’t on board? Good luck suing Wells Fargo, Chase, Capitol One or Umqua Bank. The true height of absurdity was reached in Texas, where a note the door of a Whataburger fast food restaurant alerted customers that they had no right to litigate against the restaurant. Could that really hold up in court? “Is it outside the realm of possibility? No,” says Duncan. “What the Supreme Court has found overwhelmingly is that forced arbitration clauses will generally be upheld.” Lawyers.com Website | Blog | LexisNexis Generally Out of Luck So how can consumers fight back? Can you demand a better contract? Hire a lawyer and demand legal recourse? Not really. “There is very little opportunity to change the contract because they’re standardized,” Duncan says. “The response is normally, ‘if you don’t like this, go get another service.’” Appeals are available to consumers in binding arbitration in only very limited and narrow ways, and rarely succeed. The upshot? “Consumers are generally out of luck,” says Duncan. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Last year Congress introduced the Arbitration Fairness Act, which would ban companies from unilaterally including binding arbitration clauses in contracts that preclude lawsuits when there hasn’t even been a dispute yet. “It simply says that you as a consumer cannot be forced to give up your right to go to court before a problem has even arisen,” Duncan says. For frustrated consumers feeling their rights have been trampled on by big corporations, there is finally an outlet. Contact your representatives in Congress today and let them hear your thoughts on binding arbitration.
