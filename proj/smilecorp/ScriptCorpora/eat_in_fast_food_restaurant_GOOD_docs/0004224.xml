 This Holiday, Will Gift Cards Make A Comeback? 
 MediaPost News
by Sarah Mahoney

With retail sales expected to rise modestly this holiday season, many experts are keeping a close eye on gift cards, wondering just how card-weary people are.

Accenture recently predicted that 56% of Americans would buy at least one gift card this season, down from 59% last year.

On the one hand, this Christmas, experts say people want convenience, and cards certainly play to that pragmatism. &quot;They aren&apos;t the most creative gifts, but they&apos;re easy to buy and people like to get them,&quot; Sue Golden, SVP/Client services for MARS Advertising, tells Marketing Daily. &quot;It&apos;s just one more indication that this holiday, shoppers -- who will be buying fewer gifts this year -- are looking at everything through this lens of practicality.&quot;

On the other, &quot;this is likely to be a very promotional holiday, so if shoppers can get a great deal on a product, they may choose to give that over a gift card,&quot; Frank Badillo, VP/senior retail economist for Kantar Retail, tells Marketing Daily. &quot;That way, it can look as though they spent more than they really did.&quot;

The National Retail Federation says the dollar amount Americans spend on gift cards has been falling -- peaking at just under $160 prior to the recession, and receding to $140 last holiday season. The main reasons for the decline, it says, include the sense that gift cards are too impersonal (22%), concerns about expiration dates or added fees (12.6%) and shoppers&apos; preference for buying items on sale (9.1%.)

But for 27% of the population, they are the No. 1 gift choice. And those who buy them are heavy users -- purchasing an average of 3.5 cards, spending $39.80 on each. Restaurants are the most popular card choices, says the NRF, with a 31% share, followed by department stores, with 29.3%, and bookstores at 14.7%.

 The Recession is Over: Department Stores Expand Again 
 BNET
By Carol Tice

In the depths of the recession, it seemed that perhaps department stores were going the way of the dodo. But then, slowly, customers returned. Comparable-store sales began to rise, even at previously struggling luxury-end department stores such as Neiman Marcus. Earlier this month, both Macy’s (M) and JCPenney (JCP) turned in sales higher than their estimates.

Now, the once-unthinkable is occurring—chain after chain is announcing plans for new stores. It appears America isn’t done with shopping these old-time department-store brands. The evidence:

Target Corp. (TGT) opened 10 new stores Oct. 10. Five were even in economically hard-hit California. The chain is expanding its newer format that features more fresh produce.

JCPenney plans two new stores in suburbs of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., next year. The company plans to grow sales by $1 billion over the next five years through expansion, and is remodeling 76 stores to add upscale boutiques from LVMH Moeh Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC.FR) and Sephora.

Kohl’s (KSS), which took less of a recession hit than most of its competitors, announced plans to open 21 new stores in 15 states, and is remodeling 85 other stores.

Last spring, a former Gottschalks executive announced the launch of a new department-store chain, Gottschalk by Joe Levy, with the planned opening of a first store next month in Clovis, Calif.

Of course, all is not rosy yet in department-store land. Saks is still closing stores, announcing earlier this month it will shutter a store each in New York and Nevada and California. Those follow four closures earlier this year in markets around the country.

Still, it’s a big net gain for department stores, and that hasn’t been seen in a while. The Kohl’s openings alone will create 3,000 new jobs, not to mention the ripple effect of increased sales other mall stores may see with a new anchor in place. When big retailers place big bets on new stores, it’s usually based on a lot of market research that indicates where the economy is turning around. Smaller merchants can ride along on their coattails, skip the research costs, and still reap the rewards. Posted by Bill Buczak at 8:22 AM Email This BlogThis!

 Retail Apparel Sales, Prices Drop in Sept. 
 by Liza Casabona with contributions from Evan Clark
From WWD Issue 10/18/2010

Two government reports released Friday point to a weakening in demand for apparel, as retail sales fell and prices declined.

Clothing and accessory store sales dropped 0.2 percent in September compared with August to $18.1 billion and department store sales declined 0.1 percent to $15.5 billion, the U.S. Commerce Department said. General merchandise stores, a category that includes discounters and department stores, saw flat sales in September of $50.9 billion.

In yearly comparisons, specialty store sales were up 3.2 percent, but department store sales were off 0.8 percent. General merchandise stores saw a 2.6 increase in sales year-over-year.

Meanwhile, economic pressures drove retail apparel prices down a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in September, and decreased 1.2 percent compared with a year earlier, the Labor Department said in its Consumer Price Index.

Taken together, the two reports suggest“sluggishness, and perhaps early and deep markdowns,”said Charles McMillion, president and chief economist with MBG Information Services.

In the overall economy, retail sales eked out a 0.6 percent increase over a month earlier to $367.7 billion, slightly higher than expected and the third monthly increase in a row. Sales spiked 7.3 percent compared with September 2009, when the recession was in full swing.

“There’s no question that the industry is in a much better state than this time last year; however, consumers are still very reliant on sales and promotions,”said Matthew Shay, president and chief executive officer of the National Retail Federation.

The economy has not yet fully dug itself out of the hole created by the recession, with unemployment and underemployment rates still relatively high, and any gains in retail sales are likely to be“sluggish and hard-won,”said Sandy Kennedy, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

Women’s apparel prices fell 1.4 percent compared with a month earlier and dropped 0.8 percent year-to-year. Prices for men’s apparel were down 0.3 percent in September and declined 0.2 percent in 12-month comparisons.

The overall CPI rose 0.1 percent in September compared with August and increased 1.1 percent compared with a year earlier. The so-called“core index,”which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was flat month-to-month and rose 0.8 percent in 12-month comparisons.

Consumers appear to be holding out and waiting for prices to come down before committing to purchases, said Kevin Regan, senior managing director and retail industry expert with FTI Consulting.

“We’re seeing signs of a gradual comeback, a gradual loosening up, but it’s still a cautionary environment because the economy is unsure of itself,”Regan said.“If you look at the consumer mood as reflected in consumer confidence measures, they’re still grim.” Posted by Bill Buczak at 5:49 AM Email This BlogThis!

 Income Inequality: Too Big to Ignore 
 New York Times
By Robert H. Frank

PEOPLE often remember the past with exaggerated fondness. Sometimes, however, important aspects of life really were better in the old days.

During the three decades after World War II, for example, incomes in the United States rose rapidly and at about the same rate—almost 3 percent a year—for people at all income levels. America had an economically vibrant middle class. Roads and bridges were well maintained, and impressive new infrastructure was being built. People were optimistic.

By contrast, during the last three decades the economy has grown much more slowly, and our infrastructure has fallen into grave disrepair. Most troubling, all significant income growth has been concentrated at the top of the scale. The share of total income going to the top 1 percent of earners, which stood at 8.9 percent in 1976, rose to 23.5 percent by 2007, but during the same period, the average inflation-adjusted hourly wage declined by more than 7 percent.

Yet many economists are reluctant to confront rising income inequality directly, saying that whether this trend is good or bad requires a value judgment that is best left to philosophers. But that disclaimer rings hollow. Economics, after all, was founded by moral philosophers, and links between the disciplines remain strong. So economists are well positioned to address this question, and the answer is very clear.

Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow. His first book,“A Theory of Moral Sentiments,”was published more than 25 years before his celebrated“Wealth of Nations,”which was itself peppered with trenchant moral analysis.

Some moral philosophers address inequality by invoking principles of justice and fairness. But because they have been unable to forge broad agreement about what these abstract principles mean in practice, they’ve made little progress. The more pragmatic cost-benefit approach favored by Smith has proved more fruitful, for it turns out that rising inequality has created enormous losses and few gains, even for its ostensible beneficiaries.

Recent research on psychological well-being has taught us that beyond a certain point, across-the-board spending increases often do little more than raise the bar for what is considered enough. A C.E.O. may think he needs a 30,000-square-foot mansion, for example, just because each of his peers has one. Although they might all be just as happy in more modest dwellings, few would be willing to downsize on their own.

People do not exist in a social vacuum. Community norms define clear expectations about what people should spend on interview suits and birthday parties. Rising inequality has thus spawned a multitude of“expenditure cascades,”whose first step is increased spending by top earners.

The rich have been spending more simply because they have so much extra money. Their spending shifts the frame of reference that shapes the demands of those just below them, who travel in overlapping social circles. So this second group, too, spends more, which shifts the frame of reference for the group just below it, and so on, all the way down the income ladder. These cascades have made it substantially more expensive for middle-class families to achieve basic financial goals.

In a recent working paper based on census data for the 100 most populous counties in the United States, Adam Seth Levine (a postdoctoral researcher in political science at Vanderbilt University), Oege Dijk (an economics Ph.D. student at the European University Institute) and I found that the counties where income inequality grew fastest also showed the biggest increases in symptoms of financial distress.

For example, even after controlling for other factors, these counties had the largest increases in bankruptcy filings.

Divorce rates are another reliable indicator of financial distress, as marriage counselors report that a high proportion of couples they see are experiencing significant financial problems. The counties with the biggest increases in inequality also reported the largest increases in divorce rates.

Another footprint of financial distress is long commute times, because families who are short on cash often try to make ends meet by moving to where housing is cheaper—in many cases, farther from work. The counties where long commute times had grown the most were again those with the largest increases in inequality.

The middle-class squeeze has also reduced voters’willingness to support even basic public services. Rich and poor alike endure crumbling roads, weak bridges, an unreliable rail system, and cargo containers that enter our ports without scrutiny. And many Americans live in the shadow of poorly maintained dams that could collapse at any moment.

ECONOMISTS who say we should relegate questions about inequality to philosophers often advocate policies, like tax cuts for the wealthy, that increase inequality substantially. That greater inequality causes real harm is beyond doubt.

But are there offsetting benefits?

There is no persuasive evidence that greater inequality bolsters economic growth or enhances anyone’s well-being. Yes, the rich can now buy bigger mansions and host more expensive parties. But this appears to have made them no happier. And in our winner-take-all economy, one effect of the growing inequality has been to lure our most talented graduates to the largely unproductive chase for financial bonanzas on Wall Street.

In short, the economist’s cost-benefit approach—itself long an important arrow in the moral philosopher’s quiver—has much to say about the effects of rising inequality. We need not reach agreement on all philosophical principles of fairness to recognize that it has imposed considerable harm across the income scale without generating significant offsetting benefits.

No one dares to argue that rising inequality is required in the name of fairness. So maybe we should just agree that it’s a bad thing—and try to do something about it. Posted by Bill Buczak at 5:33 AM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Economy

 The Mall Goes High-Tech 
 SmartMoney Magazine
By Jen Wieczner

Think of it as the online equivalent of the entire city of Omaha converging on a single department store. Back in August, the big retailer Gap decided to go where few large retailers have gone before—using a popular discount Web site to hold a nationwide sale. Shoppers had 24 hours to go online at Groupon.com and buy half-price shopping vouchers good for everything from jeans to trendy messenger bags. And quite a few did; at one point more than 1,200 people a minute were snaring the coupons, so many that the site that arranged the“flash”sale had to redirect some shoppers and tell them to come back later. But by day’s end, almost 450,000 potential customers had bought into the deal.

It’s the new paradox for the American shopper: Just when buying online has become second nature for most consumers, retailers are shaking up the way they sell, now increasingly using the Internet to lure them back to Main Street or the mall. Electronic coupons, long a ho-hum corner of the e-commerce world, have acquired a whole new buzz, with more than 350 flash-sale Web sites springing up in the past two years, some of them generating monthly visitor traffic in the millions. And mobile phone shopping apps, once niche toys that used GPS to help the tech-obsessed find the nearest discounted latte, are moving into the shopping mainstream too. With the make-or-break holiday season approaching, big-box retailers are ramping up their technology so they can beam product offers directly to shoppers’phones—hoping to reach those buyers when they’re within a short walk or drive of the stores. About 33 percent of retailers plan to have“location-based marketing”technology in place by year’s end, up from almost nothing a year ago, according to the National Retail Federation.

Analysts describe this electronic push as the latest move in a psychological chess match, as retailers try to keep consumer budget-consciousness from casting a pall over the lucrative end-of-the-year shopping season. E-commerce has proved resilient, despite the recent recession; tech analysts at Forrester Research expect it to rise 11 percent this year, to $173 billion. But analysts point out that shoppers still make far more purchases in stores than online, and a well-targeted coupon can entice people out from behind their keyboards. At the same time, phones with the software and GPS technology to accommodate“geo-targeted”sales pitches are close to becoming ubiquitous: One in five online consumers now uses either an iPhone or another smartphone. Mobile phone–based deals, which target these folks while they are shopping and even right in the store, could be something of a perfect weapon.

Of course, much of the new technology has practical and even ethical kinks to work out. The tools give retailers more ways to track users’locations and habits, bringing up privacy concerns among consumer advocates. And some consumers are already reporting getting inundated by local retailers’offers. (Joel Osman, who heads a mobile-technology group for consulting firm Accenture, calls this emerging hassle geo­spam.) To help readers filter out that kind of hype, we’ve taken a close look at three of the fastest-evolving shopping tools.

 Comparison Tools 

Jose Gomez-Marquez can sometimes be spotted in elec-tronics outlets near his home in Cambridge, Mass., using his iPhone to methodically photograph items on the shelves. He’s taking pictures of barcodes, so he can use a mobile phone application called ShopSavvy. Once he’s taken the photo, the app searches a database of retailers—brick-and-mortar and online—for prices. Sometimes the best deal is in the store, but other times he’ll find, say, the same gadgets at Amazon.com for 30 percent less. Either way, he says,“that’s gratifying.”

When Black Friday rolls around this year, consumers will have plenty of support in hunting for discounts. Since the 2009 holiday season, the number of shopping apps available for the iPhone alone has grown 43 percent, to more than 700, according to mobile-advertising company Mob­clix. Because 93 percent of sales still happen in stores, app developers are trying to use mobile technology to enhance old-fashioned shopping, an effort that some industry insiders call Brick and Mortar 2.0. It’s not altruistic on the retailers’behalf, of course: Part of the idea is to give shoppers a quicker way to get information (“Is that Blu-ray player in stock?”“Will this sweater make me look paunchy?”), so they don’t leave and shop elsewhere. Matt Murphy, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, which has invested in an app called Shopkick, says the idea is to create“a constant conversation”between shopper and seller.

That conversation is generating data consumers need for comparison shopping. Sites like TheFind.com and Milo.com let shoppers find prices and real-time availability, and will e-mail them once a missing item is in stock. ShopItToMe.com, a clothing-oriented site, allows users to register which items they want and in what size, and then alerts them when those items get discounted. All these sites base their searches on a user’s zip code, steering shoppers to local deals. Some consumers lament that none of these tools are expansive enough to cover everything; because retailers vary so much in the data they put online, all the apps have gaps. And the infancy of the technology means there are occasional comic moments. When Gomez-Marquez recently tried to price-check a digital pen at a bookstore, he lost his cell signal—he had to carry the box to the other end of the store to find reception. And some of the systems, he says, remain too complicated even for him:“You don’t want to have to read a manual,”he says.

 Deals by GPS 

Here’s a“Big Brother is shopping with you”scenario: Picture a skier waiting in the lift line for an early-season downhill run. She’s bundled up, but the weather is colder than she expected. Anxious and chilly, she glances at her phone, where a text message tells her that she can buy a thermal fleece jacket at the local branch of The North Face, the outdoor gear retailer. Voilà, problem solved—thanks to her willingness to let the retailer track her exact location and push deals to her in-box.

Last year was the first since 1992 that consumers’coupon use increased. Part of that, of course, was due to people looking for bargains in the sluggish economy, but it’s also a sign of the popularity of online coupons, which consumers redeemed four times more often than a year earlier. Now marketers are seeking ways to turn coupons into a trigger for an impulse buy by beaming them directly to mobile devices. The North Face encourages customers to opt in to“geo-fencing”technology, which enables it to reach them when they’re near the store—or even when they’re someplace related to the store, like the slopes or a hiking trail. The app Shopkick uses geo-locating in partner stores like Best Buy and Macy’s to send users redeemable points and coupon offers when they’re in or near those stores. And for the holidays, consumers can expect a handful of retailers to experiment further, combining limited-time-offer psychology with locator technology to promote offers like a two-hour sale or an offer for the first 100 people to the door, says Julie Ask, a mobile analyst at Forrester Research.“That’s what mobile works for: immediacy, highly targeted,”she says.

Of course, any shopper who wants in on these services needs to forfeit some privacy.“I know what you’re doing and where you are,”says Accenture’s Osman. And so far, retailers aren’t offering huge deals in return for that scrutiny. At Best Buy, for example, Shopkick users can get 10 percent off smaller items like DVDs and video games, but bigger-ticket electronics remain off-limits. For now some consumers who are on board with the GPS movement have found that human error can still be a problem. Sandy Paben, a 50-year-old tech executive in Cazenovia, N.Y., says she’s been rejected twice by cashiers after presenting a coupon on her phone.“The kids behind the counter had no idea how to use them,”she says.

 Flash-Sale Sites 

This summer Ken Tisdel saw a deal on Gilt.com, a site that offers luxury items at huge discounts for very short windows of time. The terms: more than 70 percent off on Invicta watches, but only for shoppers who acted within three days. Ken called his sister, and within minutes she had bought more than a dozen, mostly for her husband. By now Ken has bought everything from luggage to perfume on the site, and he says the purchase process often triggers an adrenaline rush; after all, the deals can sell out incredibly quickly.“You’ve got to be ready to buy,”he says.

For consumers, the flash-sale trade-off is simple: They get big markdowns, but only on a limited selection and only for a day or two. Mark Beccue, an analyst at market-research firm ABI Research, calls the sales“impulse buying on steroids.”The retailers get access to big audiences of motivated shoppers, while the sites get a cut of the sales. Many of these sites have a mostly local focus—think discounts at the mom-and-pop pizzeria or at a new boutique looking to create buzz. But luxury-goods makers increasingly see them as a good place to unload inventory without having to advertise. That trend has let sites like Gilt.com and Rue La La build brands by focusing on designer apparel, jewelry and upscale home furnishings. And many sites are expanding their offerings for the holidays. Gilt.com says it’ll offer personalized advice from fashion experts, along with recommendations based on members’shopping patterns.

Although it’s growing, the selection on these sites pales next to that of even a modest department store, and flash-sale sites can leave customers frustrated when supplies run out. Most maintain calendars or blogs that give users a week or so of advance notice, but that hasn’t always helped Suzanne Hupy, a former retail executive in Milwaukee. She says she’s logged on to Gilt.com to buy clothes for herself and her kids only to find the items sold out—sometimes less than a minute after the announced launch.“When it’s gone, it’s gone,”she laments. She and other shoppers also point out another drawback in the flash-sale model: There’s often a much shorter time limit on returns than they’d see at a traditional retailer—in one case, as little as five days after purchase.

 Retail Sales in U.S. Climbed More Than Forecast in September 
 Bloomberg
By Bob Willis

Retail sales in the U.S. climbed more than forecast in September, easing concern consumer spending will weaken and endanger the recovery.

Purchases rose 0.6 percent following a 0.7 percent gain in August that was larger than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. Other reports showed inflation cooled even further last month and manufacturing in the New York region accelerated.

Retailers like Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are sweetening discounts and using promotions ahead of the holiday season to move merchandise as joblessness hovers near a 26-year high. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke today said gains in spending would probably be“uneven”because unemployment was too high, and indicated that additional monetary stimulus may be needed.

“They’re reasonably solid consumption numbers,”said Jim O’Sullivan, global chief economist at MF Global Ltd. in New York.“Momentum is going to be up again in the fourth quarter.”

Retail sales were projected to rise 0.4 percent after a 0.4 percent gain previously reported for August, according to the median estimate of 80 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Economists’estimates ranged from a decline of 0.1 percent to a gain of 0.8 percent.

Less Inflation

The cost of living rose 0.1 percent in September, less than forecast, showing companies are finding it difficult to raise prices, figures from the Labor Department showed today. Core prices, which exclude food and fuel costs, rose 0.8 percent in the past 12 months, the smallest year-over-year gain since 1961.

The Fed Bank of New York’s general economic index rose to 15.7 in October, the highest level in four months and more than twice the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Readings greater than zero signal gains in the so-called Empire State Index covering New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.

Stocks dropped, led by sliding financial shares as banks face mounting pressure to address mishandled mortgage and foreclosure documents. The Standard&amp;Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to 1,169.79 at 10:50 a.m. in New York. The S&amp;P Supercomposite Financial Index dropped 1.4 percent. Longer-term Treasury securities fell on the better-than-expected economic data.

Auto Dealers

The advance was broad-based, with clothing stores the only major category to show a decline in demand last month. Sales rose 1.6 percent at car dealers, their best performance since March and in line with industry figures released earlier this month.

Excluding auto dealers, purchases rose 0.4 percent, also exceeding the projected 0.3 percent increase, according to the survey median.

Demand at non-store merchants, which include Internet retailers, climbed 1 percent, and rose 1.5 percent at electronics and appliance stores, the most since February.

Excluding autos, gasoline and building materials, which are the figures used to calculate gross domestic product, sales improved 0.4 percent after a revised 1 percent gain the prior month that was larger than previously estimated. The updated figures may prompt economist to boost growth estimates for the third quarter.

Target, the second-biggest discount retailer behind Wal- Mart, said last week that it would lower prices on more than 1,000 toys to attract shoppers. Its larger rival responded this week with its own discounts, advertising savings on brands such as Barbie and Nerf toys.

Holiday Shopping

The National Retail Federation is forecasting holiday sales will be the best in four years and companies are planning on stepping up hiring as a result.

Toys“R”Us Inc., based in Wayne, New Jersey, last month said it would hire about 45,000 seasonal employees, doubling its U.S. workforce. The increase in seasonal employees is 10,000 more than last year.

Kohl’s Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. department store chain, plans to hire about 40,000 people this holiday season, 21 percent more than last year, the Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin- based company said in a statement last week.

A lack of jobs and Americans’drive to pay down debt and boost savings may remain hurdles for retailers. Company payrolls grew by 64,000 workers in September, the fewest in three months, and wages stagnated, Labor Department figures showed last week.

Unemployment will average more than 9 percent though 2011, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by

“There would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action,”Bernanke said today in the text of remarks given at a Boston Fed conference. He said the central bank could expand asset purchases or change the language in its statements, while saying“nonconventional policies have costs and limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether and how aggressively they should be used.” Posted by Bill Buczak at 8:42 AM Email This BlogThis!

 In Cities That Battle Wal-Mart, Target Gets a Welcome 
 Wall Street Journal
By Miguel Bustillo and Ann Zimmerman

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. remains a pariah to U.S. labor unions and urban activists who continue to hold the world&apos;s largest retailer to a different standard than rival Target Corp. as they block its plans to expand into the nation&apos;s biggest cities.

Hoping to improve its reputation, Wal-Mart in recent years has boosted employee health benefits, launched programs to reduce its environmental impacts, and paid hundreds of millions to settle lawsuits alleging that its workers were denied lunch and bathroom breaks.

Yet the Bentonville, Ark., retailer continues to serve as the archenemy of labor unions and urban foes, who believe that if they can make Wal-Mart change its practices, smaller retailers will more readily follow suit.

&quot;Wal-Mart is leading us on a race to the bottom,&quot; said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents some 100,000 New York workers. &quot;When we pick our battles it is the clear company to go after.&quot;

Wal-Mart executives maintain they are making headway against what they regard as outdated and inaccurate perceptions by arguing that the company can generate new construction and retail jobs at a time when cities desperately need the economic boost.

On Wednesday, Wal-Mart said it would begin opening small, urban stores in coming years in the hope of forestalling recent customer defections to low-cost rivals.

&quot;As people learn more about some of the things we do, they realize that in fact we are doing the right thing,&quot; said Hank Mullany, who oversees Wal-Mart&apos;s 19-state north region, which includes New York and Chicago.

Still, the opposition has caused Wal-Mart to lose ground to competitors—notably Minneapolis-based Target, which has moved into large cities in recent years with comparatively little opposition despite also employing nonunion workers.

In Chicago, Target amassed 10 stores, seven of which sell groceries in direct competition with unionized supermarkets, and it is planning several more. Wal-Mart only obtained permission to build its second and third stores there this summer, following a six-year fight.

The dynamic is similar in other big cities where Wal-Mart struggles to expand, such as Los Angeles, where it has just two stores, or New York, where it has none.

Target by contrast opened in Harlem in July with a red carpet gala attended by Jerry Seinfeld and New York politicians—and little hand-wringing about the consequences for shopkeepers or union cashiers.

&quot;I know they are going to hurt me,&quot; said Anthony Ciarletta, owner of the 85-year-old Leto-Ascione Pharmacy two blocks away from the Harlem Target. Mr. Ciarletta said no politicians had bothered to check if he was worried about Target.

The disparate treatment has even begun to rankle a few labor organizers, who note that Target&apos;s wages and benefits mirror Wal-Mart&apos;s.

Urban opposition to Wal-Mart has been led by the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which has argued that Wal-Mart, a company with a fiercely anti-union history that closed a store in Canada following a successful union drive, is a grave threat to unionized supermarket workers.

However, Target now is expanding its own grocery business to compete with Wal-Mart&apos;s supercenters. Last month, Target said it hopes to offer food in more than half of its about 1,500 U.S. department stores by the end of next year.

&quot;We&apos;ve complained to national folks, &apos;Why is Wal-Mart the bad guy?&apos;&quot; said Bernie Hesse, a UFCW official in Minneapolis who has tried to organize Target workers. &quot;But in places like Chicago, the union has zeroed in on Wal-Mart, because it&apos;s the retailer people love to hate,&quot; he said.

By most objective standards, Wal-Mart&apos;s compensation is quite similar to its publicly traded retail competitors, and sometimes better. It now offers a more generous health care plan than the retail average; nearly 80% of Wal-Mart&apos;s U.S. workers are eligible for health coverage, compared to just 58% for the retail sector as a whole according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Until recently, Target&apos;s heath benefits were in some ways worse. It made part-timers wait two years before being eligible for coverage, compared to six months for Wal-Mart. Target now makes part timers eligible after three months.

Target declines to disclose its pay, but workers in Chicago said wages for entry level jobs, such as cashiers and inventory stockers, start at the state&apos;s minimum of $8.25 an hour. That is lower than the $8.75 hourly wage that Wal-Mart has pledged to pay to start in the city, according to local politicians.

John Griffith, Target&apos;s executive vice president of property development, said the retailer&apos;s success in urban locales stems from a willingness to listen to neighborhood concerns and to give back.

In Harlem, where it recently opened its first New York City outlet, Target restored a community garden with metal tables and red awnings that subtly convey the company&apos;s red-and-white bulls-eye logo.

&quot;We pride ourselves in doing background legwork, site analysis and community outreach before we announce we are going to build a store,&quot; Target&apos;s Mr. Griffith said. Posted by Bill Buczak at 12:39 AM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Target , Wal-Mart

 Why Luxury Goods Are Scarce at Outlet Malls 
 With luxury inventories tighter, outlets must stock less tony goods

Bloomberg Businessweek
By Cotten Timberlake

As Jennifer Mason searched the racks at a Neiman Marcus Last Call outlet in Virginia this month, she was hoping to find Gucci or Prada as she did last year. No deal. &quot;I&apos;ve gotten a little skeptical,&quot; says Mason, who owns a printing supplies company and frequents the Potomac Mills mall outside Washington. &quot;It doesn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s really deals.&quot;

Not long ago, the upscale outlet was a secret weapon for fashionistas seeking leftover Dolce&amp;Gabbana dresses at 75 percent off. Over 30 years ago, almost all the clothes at upscale outlets came from the main locations of tony retailers like Nordstrom. Now as little as 10 percent is made up of designer goods actually sold at upscale retail stores. That means fewer bargains for chic-hunters like Jennifer Mason.

Increasingly, merchandise is made specifically for the outlets and sold nowhere else at full price (even though it may be made by a top brand like Calvin Klein), says retail consultant Steven Dennis, who dubs the phenomenon &quot;faux clearance.&quot; Explains Goldman Sachs (GS) analyst Adrianne Shapira: &quot;The perfect storm is when there is excess inventory and these guys are flush with great buys. That has reversed.&quot;

One reason: It&apos;s simply harder for outlets to get their hands on the real deal, Dennis says. U.S. department stores slashed inventory as consumers pulled back on spending over the past two years, leaving less to end up in the outlets. Inventories at Saks, for instance, were worth $649.2 million on Jan. 30, 2010, down 24 percent from two years earlier. Meanwhile, competition for the best goods has grown as outlets multiply and online purveyors such as Gilt Groupe, which offers discounted luxury goods during limited-time &quot;flash sales&quot; online, entered the market.

&quot;You don&apos;t have nearly the quality you had in the recent past and you don&apos;t have the degree of discounts,&quot; says Dennis, founder of Sageberry Consulting and a former Neiman Marcus senior vice-president. &quot;It&apos;s hard to believe all of these players can operate 50 to 100 outlets successfully. There&apos;s going to be a shakeout.&quot;

The outlet concept took off in the 1970s, when VF (VFC), the world&apos;s biggest apparel maker, began letting shoppers rummage through cardboard boxes of its excess hosiery at its mills, says Linda Humphers, editor-in-chief of Value Retail News. About the same time, Nordstrom opened the first Rack in the basement of its Seattle flagship store to get rid of its leftover shoes. Outlet malls proliferated in the early 1990s. By 2008, the U.S. had almost 13,000 stores in outlet centers, and everyone from Anne Klein to Kenneth Cole to Elie Tahari had hopped on the trend.

Outlet shoppers found plenty to buy that year, because the onset of the recession left upscale merchants holding huge stocks of luxury goods—which they unloaded at outlets at deep discounts. Then fashion overstock began to dry up as retailers bought less, forcing department stores to fill their outlets with faux clearance.

At Saks&apos; Off 5th stores, 10 percent to 20 percent of the merchandise is clearance from Saks&apos; full-priced stores, about 20 percent is Off 5th store-label goods, and most of the rest is made for the chain by vendors, says spokeswoman Julia Bentley. The clothes are in-season, she adds, and sold at substantial savings. Ginger Reeder, a spokeswoman at Neiman Marcus, declined to comment about the selection at its Last Call stores.

About 20 percent to 25 percent of the merchandise at Nordstrom&apos;s more than 80 Rack outlets is clearance from its full-price department stores, says spokesman Colin Johnson. The rest is mostly vendors&apos; excess inventory. &quot;Little&quot; is made-for-outlet, says Johnson. The challenge is obtaining the best quality merchandise, says Blake Nordstrom, the retailer&apos;s president: &quot;We&apos;re working on that.&quot;

Sales at Rack locations open at least a year fell 2.4 percent in August and September, compared with a 1.7 percent gain a year earlier. At Saks&apos; Off 5th stores, performance was below the company average for the second quarter, a reversal from a year ago.

Saks said last week it was closing its Off 5th store in Reno, Nev., because the store was underperforming. Similar disappointments may follow if shoppers like Mason head back to full-price stores seeking the genuine article. &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; she says, &quot;I think I&apos;m going to get the real clothes.&quot;

 The bottom line: Outlet stores selling designer goods have been forced to stock less glitzy merchandise as excess luxe inventories are harder to find. Posted by Bill Buczak at 10:14 PM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Neiman Marcus , Nordstrom , Outlet , Saks 
 Loehmann&apos;s To Close Stores In Next Year 
 Reuters

Department store chain Loehmann&apos;s will close up to 15 stores over the next 12 months and sell the inventory, the company said on Thursday.

Loehmann&apos;s Capital Corp, which is restructuring debt coming due next year, said more than half of its noteholders approved a consent solicitation that would let it close a quarter of its stores.

The company, owned by Dubai investment group Istithmar, a unit of Dubai World, is one of many clothing retailers struggling with a downturn in consumer spending linked to high U.S. unemployment.

Loehmann&apos;s, which opened in Brooklyn in 1921, has 60 stores in 16 states and sells designer brands such as Calvin Klein and Diane Von Furstenburg at steep discounts.

The consent solicitation allows for a higher cap on borrowing that will let it increase its revolving credit facility by $10 million, the company said.

Loehmann&apos;s in September opened a debt exchange due October 27 to exchange two classes of notes due in 2011 for corresponding notes due in 2014. It needs 97 percent of holders to approve the exchange.

According to an October 14 release, the deadline for holders to receive $1,000 of new notes in exchange for $1,000 of old notes is October 22.

Holders who exchange after October 22 will receive $970 in new notes for each $1,000 in old notes, the company said.

Loehmann&apos;s liquidity problems contrast with the robust sales growth of off-price rivals such as a TJX Cos Inc and Ross Stores Inc, which have won market share during the economic slowdown as consumers still want designer name brands despite being more cautious in how they spend.

Off-price retailers buy merchandise at below-wholesale prices and then sell them at up to 60 percent less than department stores and specialty retailers. Posted by Bill Buczak at 10:02 PM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Loehmann&apos;s , Ross , TJX 
 American Apparel Tests An Online Reservation System For Retail Stores 
 
 The apparel retailer uses the web to drive customers to try clothes in stores.

Internet Retailer

American Apparel Inc is testing an online system that enables customers to locate products they’ve found on AmericanApparel.com at a local retail storefront, and also have staff at that location reserve the items. The reservation system will roll out to all stores by late November in time to catch holiday shoppers, says American Apparel web director Raz Schionning.

The system works similarly to“find in stores”functions already in use by multichannel retailers such as Best Buy Co. and Borders Group Inc. A shopper selects the color and size of the product she is interested in and enters her ZIP code to find an American Apparel location nearby that has it in stock. She can then click to place the item on hold. Schionning says the system automatically sends an alert to the selected store that instructs staff to set the merchandise aside within 30 minutes. Once the merchandise is pulled, the system sends a confirmation e-mail to the shopper telling her it is ready.

“This is another way in which we’re trying to bridge that divide in online shopping and offline shopping,”Schionning says.“Apparel is ideal for this because we are dealing with a product that has a fairly high return rate. And if this can bring you into our store, then we can introduce you to other products,”he says.

Shoppers currently can find merchandise locally with a find-in-store function that instructs them to call the store directly.

American Apparel maintains its product inventory within one self-built inventory system, which means the retailer can locate a product whether it is in a warehouse used for online fulfillment or in a retail store, Schionning says. He says the company rolled out an internal inventory locator function about six months ago that uses retail store stock as backup when the fulfillment center for online orders runs out.“When possible, rather than have the customer wait days or weeks to have new garments produced, we send the request to a retail store,”Schionning says. An automated program then walks retail store staff through the packaging process, and the retail store ships the product directly to the consumer.

 Retail Group&apos;s Analysis Paints Dire Image Of A Value-Added Tax 
 Washington Post
By Lori Montgomery

Piling a European-style sales tax on top of the existing U.S. tax structure would immediately destroy 850,000 jobs and damage retail spending for years to come, according to an economic analysis commissioned by the National Retail Federation, a leading trade group.

The report studied the potential effect of a 10.3 percent value-added tax, or VAT, a form of sales tax applied at every stage of production. The tax is ubiquitous around the world, having been adopted in more than 130 countries.

NRF president Matthew Shay said the study is intended to push back against what he views as a rising tide of interest in the VAT in Washington, where policymakers are eager to reduce record budget deficits.

&quot;Supporters claim a VAT is the solution to the nation&apos;s economic ills, but nothing could be further from the truth,&quot; said Shay, who represents an industry that has long opposed a value-added tax. &quot;This report has found that a VAT would have negative economic consequences for most working Americans alive today.&quot;

The study, conducted by Ernst and Young and economic research firm Tax Policy Advisers, assumed a VAT would cover most consumer goods and services but exempt home sales, rent, groceries, medicine, health care, financial services and education to ease the impact on low-income families. Such a tax, they said, would raise close to $400 billion a year, a sum that would significantly reduce budget deficits projected to hover around $1 trillion over the next decade.

However, the economic consequences would be dramatic, Shay said, with 850,000 jobs lost in the first year alone. Retailers, such as those represented by NRF, would be among the hardest-hit sectors of the economy, losing $2.5 trillion in business over the first decade.

The overall economy would also suffer at first, the study found, with gross domestic product dropping slightly - by 0.2 percent - in the first year. However, the economy would benefit from a value-added tax by the 10th year, the study found, because &quot;lower deficits and debt would have positive long-run effects.&quot;

The report argues that reducing government spending by a comparable amount - $400 billion a year - is a preferable option for reducing deficits because it would boost economic growth by 0.1 percent in the first year and 0.7 percent in the 10th year. But cutting such a sum would be the equivalent of wiping out Medicare, and therefore politically difficult.

Shay said the NRF will submit the study to the bipartisan commission President Obama has appointed to develop a deficit-reduction plan. The commission is scheduled to issue its report in December. Shay said his group grew nervous about the value-added tax after seeing public comments from commission members, including co-directors Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson.

&quot;We take this very, very seriously,&quot; Shay said. &quot;We think it&apos;s essential that policymakers understand the ramifications of this proposal before they go any further into conversation about approaches they might take to reduce the deficit.&quot;

Bowles and Simpson have declined to rule out a VAT, saying all options are on the table in the commission&apos;s discusions. Bowles also said on Fox News in April that one could make &quot;good arguments for a value-added tax.&quot; But Bowles suggested that a VAT should be considered as an alternative to taxing wages, not as an add-on to the current system. And Simpson has said flatly, &quot;You can&apos;t do a value-added tax without dealing with the income tax.&quot;

Commission executive director Bruce Reed laughed when asked about the prospect of the commission&apos;s 18 members - including six GOP lawmakers - recommending a VAT. Under the commission&apos;s charter, 14 members must agree for any policy to be adopted.

&quot;The U.S. Senate got only 13 out of 100 members to support that policy,&quot; Reed said, referring to an April sense-of-the-Senate vote. &quot;It seems unlikely that we could get 14 out of 18.&quot; Posted by Bill Buczak at 12:05 PM Email This BlogThis!

 Poll: Why the Boss Sucks, By Employees 
 Fast Company
By Austin Carr

Not everyone can have their ideal boss--and in fact, most don&apos;t. Adecco&apos;s poll asked 700 employees and 300 bosses from blue and white collar industries about the relationship between workers and management. The results make all bosses seem a little more like Michael Scott of &quot;The Office&quot;--and might make them rethink their next interaction with employees.

 Commanders vs. Coaches 

When asked to report on leadership style, bosses and employees disagreed in certain categories. Only 15% of bosses described their own management style as commanding. About 23% of employees, on the other hand, reported their boss&apos;s style to be commanding, and just 11% said being commanding was the desired style. &quot;Bosses may not recognize how bossy they actually are,&quot; the report says.

 Similarly, bosses believe they are visionary leaders and good coaches; their employees disagree. &quot;Nearly one in three bosses may think they are using a coaching style, but only one in five employees agrees,&quot; concludes Adecco. Only 17% of bosses are self-styled visionaries, whereas close to 23% of employees view this as the preferred leadership style.

 Respect the Team Player 

More than one out of three employees think they are smarter than their bosses, even if they are more educated. Younger generations tend to think this way more: 41% of Millennials and Gen-X&apos;ers believe they are smarter than their bosses, compared with just 30% of Baby Boomers.

 Age difference is an integral part of respect. While the vast majority of bosses and employees share mutual respect, age disparity can cause significant problems with respect. Could you respect and work with a boss who is two years younger than you? 89% agreed. Ten years? Only 68% agreed. Twenty years? The number drops to 56% of respondents.

One area where most respondents agreed: Bosses must be willing to get their hands dirty. When asked whether a good boss is willing to roll up his or her sleeves to help the team get the job done, nearly three-quarters completely agreed, with another 14% somewhat agreeing.

 Do You Want the Top Spot? 

Interestingly, though many respondents offered criticism of their boss&apos; style and approach, very few are interested in a management position. A surprising 70% said they did not aspire to have their boss&apos; job.

Moreover, aspiration also varies based on age, gender, and other factors. Around 36% of men aspire to have their boss&apos; job, compared with just 23% of women. Only 18% of Boomers aspire to the same positions, compared with more than double the numbers of Gen-Xers and Millennials. Lastly, respondents with kids at home were more likely to aspire to their boss&apos; job (39%), compared to 23% without children.

 So what is your management style? Are you a visionary? A commander or a coach? Think again. Don&apos;t forget: A third of your employees believe they are smarter than you. Posted by Bill Buczak at 6:43 AM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Management 
 Charming Shoppes CEO Steps Down . 
 Wall Street Journal
By John Kell

Charming Shoppes Inc. said James Fogarty has resigned as chief executive and as a director, as the women&apos;s plus-size apparel retailer looks beyond the financial phase of its restructuring to focus on apparel.

In after-hours trading Wednesday, Charming Shoppes shares were down 9.2% at $3.95.

Struggling on the sales front, the operator of the Lane Bryant, Fashion Bug and Catherines chains has posted just two quarterly profits in the past three years. The company has lagged behind some other apparel retailers that got a boost this year from higher consumer spending. Due to the sales weakness, Charming Shoppes has cut jobs, closed stores and reshuffled management.

On Wednesday, Charming Shoppes said that after completing the financial and operational phase of its restructuring by improving its balance sheet, it would now move toward focusing on its apparel. Chairman Michael Goldstein said &quot;both Jim and the board feel the company is best served by having an individual with significant retail experience at our helm.&quot;

The company said Anthony Romano, a global sourcing executive, has been promoted to the position of chief operating officer, overseeing day-to-day operations. While the board conducts its search for a new CEO, the company&apos;s brand presidents and corporate functions will report to Mr. Romano.

Mr. Romano, 48 years old, joined Charming Shoppes in early 2009. He previously served in various executive roles at AnnTaylor Stores Corp.

Before joining Charming Shoppes, the 41-year-old Mr. Fogarty had served as president and chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and as a managing director at Alvarez&amp;Marsal, an independent professional-services firm. He also served as an executive at privately held Levi Strauss&amp;Co. and at Warnaco Group Inc.

Mr. Fogarty was appointed CEO and joined the company&apos;s board in April 2009, ending a nearly nine-month search to fill the job. He succeeded Alan Rosskamm, a non-executive chairman of the company. Mr. Rosskamm had been serving as interim CEO following the resignation of longtime chief Dorrit Bern, as the company felt it was time for a leadership change.

Last month, Charming Shoppes reported it swung to an unexpected fiscal second-quarter loss on higher overhead costs and lower margins. Posted by Bill Buczak at 4:13 AM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Charming Shoppes , Lane Bryant 
 Wal-Mart Sees Small Stores in Big Cities 
 Wall Street Journal
By Michael Bustillo

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is planning to open dozens of small stores in the nation&apos;s cities, in an effort to push back against the dollar chains and other competitors nibbling at its customers.

The prospect of Wal-Mart stores dotting America&apos;s biggest cities would change the urban landscape and the profile of the world&apos;s largest retailer, known for its blocky suburban edifices stocked with low-cost goods. The new stores, roughly a quarter to a third the size of a supercenter, largely will sell groceries.

Bill Simon, head of Wal-Mart&apos;s U.S. stores business, said Wal-Mart envisions opening in the next few years 30,000- to 60,000-square-foot Neighborhood Market groceries and new, smaller outlets modeled on the bodegas it operates in Latin America. Its supercenters average 185,000 square feet.

Mr. Simon said he believes there is room for &quot;hundreds&quot; of small Wal-Mart stores in the U.S., offering food and consumer staples. The retailer first will test their urban appeal with 30 to 40 stores over the next few years before a full-scale launch.

The move is an about-face for Wal-Mart. At the start of the recession, it focused on attracting more middle-class customers who were &quot;trading down&quot; to discount stores by remodeling to feature neater aisles, fashionable clothing, and eye-grabbing discounts on fewer items.

 But Wal-Mart now admits the gambit alienated many of the blue-collar customers who had made it a retail behemoth in the first place. So after shuffling executives, the company is hurriedly restoring the ungainly pallets of merchandise to its center-store aisles and reworking its marketing strategy to emphasize the &quot;every day low prices&quot; formula that the company&apos;s late founder Sam Walton made famous.

&quot;Sometimes we will try things, and sometimes they work and sometimes they don&apos;t,&quot; Chief Executive Mike Duke said. &quot;Getting back to every day low price across a wide assortment of products is really the right approach.&quot;

Sales have fallen for five consecutive quarters at Wal-Mart U.S. stores open at least a year, a key benchmark for retail businesses. The company&apos;s U.S. store growth has also stalled as it has begun running out of rural and suburban markets for its warehouse-sized supercenter stores, leaving large cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles as the company&apos;s last frontiers for domestic expansion.

Wal-Mart has made a push to show it is a socially responsible giant; it now, for instance, offers better health benefits than most of its retail rivals, and is requiring suppliers to limit their carbon emissions. Yet Wal-Mart has struggled at cracking the big cities amid stiff opposition from organized labor—even as its archrival, Target Corp., and other big-box chains such as Best Buy Co. make a steady march into urban areas with similar products, stores and nonunion workers.

Wal-Mart now discloses wages to convince critics that its pay is equal or better than competitors&apos;; in New York hourly wages average $12.20, nearly $5 more than the state&apos;s minimum wage and $2 above the New York City retail median, which was $10.04 in 2009 according to the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group financed by unions.

A spokesman for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he would welcome the company.

&quot;We shouldn&apos;t tell businesses that want to invest and create jobs in New York City that they can&apos;t,&quot; said spokesman Andrew Brent. &quot;New Yorkers are already voting with their feet when they drive outside the City to shop at stores that aren&apos;t in the five boroughs&quot; that make up New York.

Still, urban foes say they continue to battle every Wal-Mart with special reserves of vitriol, for a simple reason: It&apos;s Wal-Mart, a company with a history of anti-union tactics and worker disputes, including an ongoing gender discrimination lawsuit that is the largest ever.

Wal-Mart won the right to build its second and third stores in Chicago earlier this year after years of lobbying. But when New York politicians and union leaders learned Wal-Mart was eyeing a shopping center called Gateway II for its first store in the city earlier this year, they rallied at City Hall to deliver a rude message: &quot;Fuggedaboutit.&quot;

&quot;Wal-Mart can say they are a different company, but we are not going to roll the dice in New York City,&quot; said New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. &quot;Target in no way has the history of employment problems that Wal-Mart has. You can&apos;t teach an old dog new tricks.&quot;

Yet Wal-Mart&apos;s move to go small is about more than trying to sidestep longstanding urban foes with stores that require fewer zoning approvals. Wal-Mart faces new challenges from bare-bones outlets including Germany&apos;s Aldi and chains such as Dollar General Corp.

Lower cost rivals have expanded exponentially since the recession, offering small sizes of staple items such as milk and toilet paper to attract strapped consumers who in some cases could not afford the super-sized versions of the items sold at Wal-Mart.

&quot;I am not focused on any one competitor,&quot; Mr. Simon said when questioned by analysts about whether the small-store shift was spurred by dollar stores, but he added: &quot;Do they have a head start? Yeah, they do, they have 20,000 [stores].&quot;

Mr. Simon would not specify which cities Wal-Mart wants to enter, replying, &quot;Yes. All of that,&quot; when asked whether coastal cities such as California&apos;s were a possibility. But he joked that he had liked the musical selections during a dinner the prior evening, which included &quot;New York, New York&quot; being sung by a choir of Wal-Mart workers. Wal-Mart currently has no stores in the Big Apple.

Wal-Mart expects to build the new stores without raising overall capital expenditures by shifting money from supercenter remodeling budgets, he said. The company plans to spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on equipment, new stores and updates in the U.S. during its fiscal 2012, roughly the same as this year.

Wal-Mart did not detail how many workers the smaller stores would employ, but Wal-Mart&apos;s mid-sized groceries, called Neighborhood Market, average about 95 workers each at more than 180 stores, mainly in the south.

&quot;In this environment, we should be thriving,&quot; Mr. Simon said, explaining that weak economy posed an opportunity to gain market share.

In addition to convenience stores, Wal-Mart faces growing competition from Amazon.com Inc. and other e-commerce retailers that have added household staples to their selections of electronics, books and music.

To fend them off, Wal-Mart will begin allowing customers this month to place orders online and retrieve the goods at 800 stores, a program it called &quot;Pick Up Today.&quot;

Wal-Mart also said it was expanding an experiment in which customers who live in urban areas with few or no Wal-Mart stores can order merchandise online and have it delivered free to a nearby FedEx location. The test is expanding to New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., on Thursday, after beginning this summer in Boston and Los Angeles.

Yet Wal-Mart is recognizing that its biggest untapped market may be urban markets such as New York. There, potential customers such as retirees Marvin and Rhoda Treibitz say they would welcome a retailer they believe would bring greater variety and cheaper prices.

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind at all if Wal-Mart opened, and I am speaking as a retired union man,&quot; said Mr. Treibitz, a former motion picture operator, as he exited a Brooklyn shopping center where Target and Best Buy have already opened shop.

 At Polo Store, the Feel of a Mansion to Bolster a Brand 
 New York Times
By Stephanie Clifford

“Big cities have international people,”Ralph Lauren said.“Tourists come wanting to buy souvenirs.”

So the biggest one-man brand in fashion is getting bigger on Friday, when Polo Ralph Lauren opens a 22,000-square-foot store at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in Manhattan. The store, built to resemble a mansion, will be the brand’s largest women’s store and will also feature home collections and new lines of lingerie and fine jewelry.

The building and the products scream glamour, but despite the $159,000 diamond necklaces, retail analysts said rich tourists and New Yorkers were not the store’s only intended audience. In a classic effort of brand building, the store is also meant to excite more ordinary shoppers who sustain the company’s profitable polo-and-khaki business, the analysts said.

“They build these big stores, and when they open them, their critics may say,‘Polo doesn’t make any money on their stores—they’re not profitable,’”said Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS.“But when you go to the Macy’s or the Lord&amp;Taylor in the area, and you can touch that brand at attainable price points in those stores, that’s where the real juice is.”

In an interview at the store, Mr. Lauren, tanned and wearing paint-splattered jeans and a thin white T-shirt, agreed that the Madison Avenue store would help his company both in retail and at wholesale. Mr. Lauren began as a wholesaler, selling his men’s wear line to places like Bloomingdale’s in the late 1960s before opening his own store, on Rodeo Drive, in 1971.

“I know that as I started to build my own stores, the business got better,”he said.“It helped Neiman’s and it helped Saks, and it helped identify what we are all about.”

He was sitting on a white couch on the second floor, with sun slanting in through huge windows and a spa version of the Guns N’Roses song“Patience”playing overhead. With mannequins posed like bored socialites (one, apparently overcome with ennui, was draped over a coffee table), the store felt a lot like a Parisian hotel.

When two uniformed waiters materialized with cups of coffee on a silver tray, Mr. Lauren smiled.“Are you sensing this is a stage set?”he asked.“This is not about‘Look how glitzy we are.’”

Polo built the store to resemble a classic New York mansion. Since 1986, it has had a store in the former Rhinelander Mansion across the street at 72nd and Madison, but it added this one to give the women’s and home lines much more room. The company has also said recently that urban and tourist stores are doing better than regional and local ones, and this store is meant to be a draw for tourists.

Indeed, across the street at the men’s store, there was hardly an American accent to be found among the shoppers, and many carried New York City guidebooks.

“They’ve been there a long time, and it’s somewhat of a destination,”said Laura Pomerantz, principal at PBS Real Estate.“There is certainly traffic there as a result,”she said,“and it’s a well-heeled tourist.”

Though Mr. Lauren, the chairman and chief executive of the company, was dressed in his signature casual American style, the items he sells have broadened quite a bit, as the new women’s store shows.

The fourth floor sells home products in a setting that looks like a model apartment, with place settings and flower arrangements on tables, a living room decorated in black and purple, and bowls of macaroons dotting the space.

Down a limestone staircase with wrought-iron railings to the third floor, there are more casual lines not found in department stores. To the side is the RLX sportswear, like a neon pink jacket for $298, and in the main rooms, feathered sparkly pants, leather coats and cashmere sweaters. There are also hoodies for dogs.

The second floor houses the Purple Label line, which offers expensive versions of runway clothes, and the first floor is handbags, shoes and jewelry. The store has several firsts, including a lingerie line, fine jewelry and made-to-order suits for women. It is also introducing its version of fast fashion, where customers use an iPad to choose a clothing item and a monogram color and style, and a pair of seamstresses in the basement produce the order within minutes.

What is missing are the lower-end products that are sold wholesale to stores like Dillard’s and Macy’s: the piles of chinos, sweatshirts and socks emblazoned with the Polo horse.

In its fiscal year 2010, ended in April, wholesale and retail sales contributed around the same amount to the company’s revenue, $2.5 billion for wholesale, and $2.3 billion for retail. But wholesale contributed more than double the operating income, at $585 million, versus $254 million for retail. While revenue fell 1 percent in fiscal 2010, in the most recent quarter, it was up 13 percent from the same period a year earlier, and sales at stores open more than a year, an important indicator of retail health, rose 7 percent.

“You make your statement when you’re advertising and when you’re opening stores,”Mr. Lauren said.“When they shop your stuff in the department store, they see your things and they know it’s Lauren.” Posted by Bill Buczak at 3:52 AM Email This BlogThis!

 Bloomingdale&apos;s Hosts Benefit for CMI

Some kids are shy, and then there are those who are pathologically self-conscious.

“At home, she was a chatterbox,”said Debbie Perelman, speaking about her daughter, Maia. But outside the house,“Maia was frozen. She couldn’t interact with anybody. She wouldn’t speak at school. Worst of all, she couldn’t interact with other children in the park or at birthday parties. It was painfully hard for her.”

Perelman discussed her daughter’s disorder, known as“selective mutism,”and how the Brave Buddies program at the Child Mind Institute helped Maia open up, at a Bloomingdale’s luncheon on the designer selling floor Tuesday benefitting CMI. Perelman, vice chairman of CMI, said Maia improved so much so that she played Jack in“Jack and the Beanstalk”in her school play.

CMI’s mission is to transform mental health for children, enable them to reach their full potential and enlighten families about child psychiatric disorders.“There are 15 million kids in the U.S. who have a psychiatric disorder, and less than half get help,”said Dr. Harold Koplewicz, president of CMI. While CMI treats a range of mental disorders in children, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD) and hyperactivity, selective mutism became the afternoon’s focus.“Left untreated, in teens it’s likely to lead to alcoholism,”said Koplewicz.

Among those at the luncheon were Kate Spade, Nicole Miller, Fe Fendi, Shoshanna Gruss, Gail Pisano, Bloomingdale’s executives Michael Gould, Frank Doroff, Jack Hruska and Anne Keating, and Brooke Garber Neidich, chairman of the CMI board, whose sons, Jon and Stephen, both have ADD.“Bloomingdale’s support gives us a lot more credibility,”Neidich noted. The event drew a crowd of 155 and raised almost $100,000 for CMI through ticket sales, raffles and by donating 10 percent of certain purchases from Oct. 8-12.

 Regional Department Stores Battle National Chains 
 by Jean E. Palmieri
From WWD Issue 10/14/2010

Regional department stores are fighting back.

While Macy’s continues to flex its muscle as a national department store chain with high-profile exclusives and proprietary brands, local retailers aren’t prepared to roll over and play dead just yet. Those that remain are reaching into their arsenal for ammunition of their own, whether it’s designer associations or aggressive marketing plans designed to appeal to customers seeking that hometown department store experience.

In the past few weeks, The Bon-Ton Stores Inc., which operates 277 stores in the Northeast and Midwest, revealed it had signed a license and design agreement with Tharanco Lifestyles LLC and John Bartlett for Bartlett to take over the design of its Consensus private label men’s apparel and accessories collection. The line, which will include a full assortment of tailored clothing, sportswear and furnishings, will debut for fall and be called John Bartlett for Consensus. This followed on the heels of a deal a few days before, when Bon-Ton contracted with Casual Male Retail Group Inc. to supply big and tall men’s apparel through the store’s e-commerce site and, beginning in the spring, a limited number of its stores.

Bud Bergren, chairman and chief executive officer of Bon-Ton, said these deals were designed to fill holes in the company’s assortment.

“We look to fill gaps,”he said.“With Casual Male, their stores are mainly in strip centers, and around 80 percent of their customers are male. At our department stores, 75 to 80 percent of our customers are female, so this gives them a chance to reach a female customer, and that’s a plus for them. And for us, it gets us into a business that we weren’t in with somebody who knows that business.”

The Bartlett product, which Bergren expects to hit stores in June of next year, is also expected to bolster sales of the company’s existing private label. Although the initial push will be in men’s apparel, the plan is to expand into boys’, home and luggage down the line.“John is a Midwest guy, so he understands our customer,”he said.

Bergren said understanding the customer is key to the survival of the regional specialists.“Our relationship is with the customer,”he said.“They don’t look at a store and say,‘This is a regional department store.’Instead, they ask if we have the right product at the right price.”

In addition to these two deals, Bergren said Bon-Ton has exclusives with Ruff Hewn, a men’s outdoors-inspired brand, as well as Laura Ashley in home and Evan Picone in women’s. These exclusives are top performers, he said.“That’s the direction going forward,”he noted, adding that today, 85 percent of the mix at the Bon-Ton stable of stores—Bon-Ton, Bergner’s, Boston Store, Carson Pirie Scott, Elder-Beerman, Herberger’s, Younkers and Parisian—is different from that found at Kohl’s or J.C. Penney, and 40 percent is different from that at Macy’s.

Since 2006, he said, the percentage of private brands at Bon-Ton has risen from 14.5 percent to 21 percent, and sales have stabilized. In September, Bon-Ton posted a 5.9 percent increase in same-store sales, which was above plan. Best-performing categories included better missy sportswear, cosmetics, juniors and accessories; jewelry was also strong.

“We feel good about the fourth quarter,”said Bergren.“We have things that are working,”including furniture. Although that represents only 3 percent of the company’s sales, the willingness to spend on big-ticket items indicates improving consumer confidence, he said.

Bergren said the other significant regional players—namely Dillard’s and Belk—are also holding their own, which bodes well for the future.

“The business has been consolidated, and that was necessary, since there were too many stores carrying the same thing. But now that’s working itself out of the system and things look bright,”he said.

In September, Dillard’s reported same-store sales rose 3 percent. In the second quarter, the retailer posted net income of $6.8 million, or 10 cents a diluted share, against a year-ago loss of $26.7 million, or 36 cents. Total sales for the quarter ended July 31 fell 2.7 percent to $1.39 billion from $1.43 billion. Comps were flat for the three months.

For years, Dillard’s has used its exclusive Daniel Cremieux men’s collection as a point of differentiation. The line includes a complete assortment of products, everything from furnishings and tailored clothing to sportswear and young men’s.

Houston-based Stage Stores, which operates 780 units under the Bealls, Goody’s, Palais Royal, Peebles and Stage names, posted a comp-store increase of 1.8 percent in September, which marked the fifth consecutive month of improving same-store sales. This fall, the retailer unveiled a self-serve concept called Beauty Bar in 100 locations, which includes the addition of seven organic brands, including Burt’s Bees and Crabtree&amp;Evelyn. The goal, according to the company, is“to increase cosmetics sales during every visit.”

Although the retail slugfest continues, the regionals are taking the offensive. Belk Inc., the country’s largest private department store group, recently revealed that it will invest tens of millions of dollars over the next two to three years to update its stores and revamp its image. Part of that initiative includes a new, more sophisticated logo for store signs, shopping bags and credit cards. The new tag line is“Modern. Southern. Style.”Chairman and ceo Tim Belk said the retailer intends to“exploit”its Southern heritage and woo new customers with a more modern, trendy assortment.

Belk has also committed to spending around $70 million on branding over the next 18 months.

“It’s more than just a logo change,”Belk said.“It’s really how we do business, how we connect with our customer and…differentiate with the national competitors on our horizon and in our backyard.”

Part of that includes differentiated merchandise. Belk’s private label percentage has been inching up over the years and now accounts for around 30 percent of its $3.3 billion in volume, up from less than 10 percent nine years ago.

New York-based Lord&amp;Taylor has also found a way to compete against Macy’s, one that involves a hefty investment in remodelings, as well as a differentiated assortment and an ambitious new marketing program. NRDC Equity Partners has committed to spending $250 million to renovate Lord&amp;Taylor’s 46 stores, with $150 million earmarked for its New York City flagship. Next week, the company will unveil the results of that renovation at a party at the store Wednesday night. At the same time, L&amp;T is planning a new ad campaign around the project, entitled“The ultimate face lift.”

But L&amp;T’s strategy does not just involve spiffing up the stores. Over the past two years, management has worked to reposition the business and bring back moderate brands that had been dropped but still connected with customers. As a result, Gold Toe, Jockey, Calvin Klein and Levi’s, among others, were reinstated.

Additionally, the retailer hired Joseph Abboud to create a new men’s private label for the store, called Black Brown 1826. The line has been a perennial strong performer since its introduction, and the goal is for it to eventually account for 20 percent of men’s sales, according to Jonathan Greller, senior vice president and general merchandise manager of men’s for the store.

“If the playing field is equal on national brands, then the effort is for regionals to differentiate by having their own proprietary brands,”said Michael Setola, president and ceo of Tharanco Lifestyles, which negotiated the deal with Bon-Ton and John Bartlett.“It’s their way to compete and create separation from Macy’s. It’s definitely a winning formula and a way to build brand loyalty.”

The mission of Macy’s, Setola said, has been to create a national department store, a strategy that is working for the company.“They have massive buying power, and they’ve built excitement around the brands they have.”

For regionals to survive against a behemoth like that requires some creativity. Setola said he worked with Bon-Ton’s vice chairman and chief merchant, Tony Buccina, who had been“out there shaking trees to find ways to elevate his brand during this head-to-head battle”to connect the store with John Bartlett.

Setola said that with any private brand, however, the key is that it is“recognized and accepted as desirable and fashion-right.”He pointed to Dillard’s Daniel Cremieux label as an example.“They stuck with it and built a following. The product looks goods, it works for them and the margins are built in,”he said.

As a result, Setola said,“We will see more of these on a regional department store level.”

Allen Ellinger, senior managing partner of MMG, an investment banking firm, agreed.“Conceptually, this is a great idea because it creates individuality at a regional level where they don’t have the scale of a Macy’s,”he said.“But the success of any program like this is based on product and presentation.”

If the regional department stores can“create the ambiance and exciting product”that today’s customer is seeking,“then there’s a real future here,”he said.“And regionals know their customers the best.”

Ellinger expects to see regionals make more deals in the future, and there are some dormant brands or designer names in the market that can be reignited for this purpose.“This is not the whole future, but it’s part of it,”he said.“National brands are still very important, but [proprietary labels] will help individualize stores. It’s indicative of where the industry is moving.” Posted by Bill Buczak at 1:32 AM Email This BlogThis!

 Macy’s Lisa Gick, On Building Strong Employee Engagement 
 SmartBlog on Workforce
By Mary Ellen Slayter

An effective internal communications strategy can foster strong relationships in the work environment and help form the backbone of a successful organization. Lisa Gick, vice president of employee relations at Macy’s is among the speakers at the Marcus Evans 6th Annual Internal Communications&amp;Employee Engagement Conference next month in Orlando. In this edited interview, she explains the connection between communication and employee engagement and how investing in both can reap dividends for any organization.

 What are the hallmarks of effective internal communications? 

A strong internal communications strategy builds relationships and contributes to a sense of ownership within the organization. Both of these concepts are fundamental to employee engagement.

There are many considerations that help us get there.

 Evaluate the audiences for the message. What are the unique features about each that might require we tailor our message to convey the important meaning within it.

 Simply construct and execute. Overcomplication brings confusion and delay. Explaining for each audience“Why is this important to me?”as part of the message helps achieve understanding more quickly, and that means greater success with progress.

 Be clear, concise and conversational . To be accessible through our communication, we need to write like we would speak to someone—friendly and approachable.

 Don’t forget logistics of delivery. Not one single source of communication suits everyone. So how do we layer our messages to be sure those who need them capture them?

 Foster feedback . Without it, we can’t be sure our messages are understood. Creating strong and dependable pathways for feedback give us insight as to how we might tweak and adjust our messaging to achieve the alignment we need. At Macy’s, we are always identifying effective ways we can create feedback loops to be sure messages are well understood.
What role can effective internal communications play in providing better customer service?

At Macy’s, the customer is at the center of our thinking in everything we do. When we approach our internal communications strategies and tactics, we’re focused on creating alignment with our mission, values and priorities across the organization. Doing this provides a great platform for adopting key information and concepts that drive a great customer experience. A strong, internal communications program helps us make sure we have the greatest success in achieving that.

 How important is it that any internal communications strategy involves plenty of two-way communications? 

Communication can occur in many ways. But when we talk about communication as key to employee engagement, two-way communication is certainly what gives it meaning. Two-way communication that allows for dialogue creates strong relationships in the work environment, and that influences individual and organizational success. When relationships are strong, there is trust, pride, advocacy, and many other captivating features that drive an engaged work community. Being connected provides the kind of feedback that’s important for us to understand how our employees feel about the organization, fosters the kind of confidence that gives way to more innovative thinking and promotes highly productive and vital collaboration. The idea of two-way communication is fundamental to how we operate.

 In a down economy, change to working practices is inevitable. How can maximum benefit be harnessed through employee communications for the good of the organization? 

For a lot of organizations today, change has become a regular part of the landscape. The best way to lead through change is with information and the compelling way we develop and execute the communication program that supports it. I think it’s risky to underestimate the interest, need and value employees find in information during these times. When leaders“overly-filter”to arrive at their message, or don’t take the time to get the critical feedback on what they’re conveying, it can be viewed as less authentic and prolong gaining alignment. It’s a fine balance we must find, but the more timely, open and honest we can be, the more quickly we will gain trust, commitment and partnership with the change and raise our capacity for successfully moving through it.

 Across the U.S., Long Recovery Looks Like Recession 
 New York Times
By Michael Powell and Motoko Rich

This is not what a recovery is supposed to look like.

In Atlanta, the Bank of America tower, the tallest in the Southeast, is nearly a fifth vacant, and bank officials just wrestled a rent cut from the developer. In Cherry Hill, N.J., 10 percent of the houses on the market are so-called short sales, in which sellers ask for less than they owe lenders. And in Arizona, in sun-blasted desert subdivisions, owners speak of hours cut, jobs lost and meals at soup kitchens.

Less than a month before November elections, the United States is mired in a grim New Normal that could last for years. That has policy makers, particularly the Federal Reserve, considering a range of ever more extreme measures, as noted in the minutes of its last meeting, released Tuesday. Call it recession or recovery, for tens of millions of Americans, there’s little difference.

Born of a record financial collapse, this recession has been more severe than any since the Great Depression and has left an enormous oversupply of houses and office buildings and crippling debt. The decision last week by leading mortgage lenders to freeze foreclosures, and calls for a national moratorium, could cast a long shadow of uncertainty over banks and the housing market. Put simply, the national economy has fallen so far that it could take years to climb back.

The math yields somber conclusions, with implications not just for this autumn’s elections but also—barring a policy surprise or economic upturn—for 2012 as well:

¶At the current rate of job creation, the nation would need nine more years to recapture the jobs lost during the recession. And that doesn’t even account for five million or six million jobs needed in that time to keep pace with an expanding population. Even top Obama officials concede the unemployment rate could climb higher still.

¶Median house prices have dropped 20 percent since 2005. Given an inflation rate of about 2 percent—a common forecast—it would take 13 years for housing prices to climb back to their peak, according to Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics.

¶Commercial vacancies are soaring, and it could take a decade to absorb the excess in many of the largest cities. The vacancy rate, as of the end of June, stands at 21.4 percent in Phoenix, 19.7 percent in Las Vegas, 18.3 in Dallas/Fort Worth and 17.3 percent in Atlanta, in each case higher than last year, according to the data firm CoStar Group.

Demand is inert. Consumer confidence has tumbled as many are afraid or unable to spend. Families are still paying off—or walking away from—debt. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, estimates it will be the end of 2011 before the amount of income that households pay in interest recedes to levels seen before the run-up. Credit card delinquencies are rising.

“No wonder Americans are pessimistic and unhappy,”said Mr. Sinai.“The only way we are going to get in gear is to face up to the reality that we are entering a period of austerity.”

This dreary accounting should not suggest a nation without strengths. Unemployment rates have come down from their peaks in swaths of the United States, from Vermont to Minnesota to Wisconsin. Port traffic has increased, and employers have created an average of 68,111 jobs a month this year.

After plummeting in 2009, the stock market has spiraled up, buoying retirement accounts and perhaps the spirits of middle-class Americans. As a measure of economic health, though, that gain is overstated. Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, notes that the most profitable companies in the domestic stock indexes generate about 40 percent of their revenue from abroad.

Few doubt the American economy remains capable of electrifying growth, but few expect that any time soon.“We still have a lot of strengths, from a culture of entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, to flexible labor markets and attracting immigrants,”said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.“But we’re going to be living with the overhang of our financial and debt problems for a long, long time to come.”

New shocks could push the nation into another recession or deflation.“We are in a situation where our vulnerability to any new problem is great,”said Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.

So troubles ripple outward, as lost jobs, unsold houses and empty offices weigh down the economy and upend lives. Struggles in Arizona, New Jersey and Georgia echo broadly.

Florence, Ariz.

In 2005, Arizona ranked, as usual, second nationally in job growth behind Nevada, its economy predicated on growth. The snowbirds came and construction boomed and land stretched endless and cheap. Then it stopped.

This year, Arizona ranks 42nd in job growth. It has lost 287,000 jobs since the recession began, and the fall has been calamitous.

Renee Wheaton, 38, sits in an old golf cart on the corner of Tangerine and Barley Roads in her subdivision in the desert, an hour south of Phoenix. Her next-door neighbor, an engineer, just lost his job. The man across the street is unemployed.

Her family is not doing so well either. Her husband’s hours have been cut by 15 percent, leaving her family of five behind on water and credit card bills—more or less on everything except the house and car payment. She teaches art, but that’s not much in demand.

“I say to myself‘This can’t be happening to us: We saved, we worked hard and we’re under tremendous stress,’”Ms. Wheaton says.“My husband is a very hard-working man but for the first time, he’s having real trouble.”

Arizona’s poverty rate has jumped to 19.6 percent, the second-highest in the nation after Mississippi. The Association of Arizona Food Banks says demand has nearly doubled in the last 18 months.

Elliott D. Pollack, one of Arizona’s foremost economic forecasters, said:“You had an implosion of every sector needed to survive. That’s not going to get better fast.”

To wander exurban Pinal County, which is where Florence is located, is to find that the unemployment rate tells just half the story. Everywhere, subdivisions sit in the desert, some half-built and some dreamy wisps, like the emerald green putting green sitting amid acres of scrub and cacti. Signs offer discounts, distress sales and rent with the first and second month free.

Discounts do not help if your income is cut in half. Construction workers speak of stringing together 20-hour weeks with odd jobs, and a 45-year-old woman who was a real estate agent talks of her job making minimum wage bathing elderly patients. Many live close to the poverty line, without the conveniences they once took for granted. Pinal’s unemployment rate, like that of Arizona, stands at 9.7 percent, but state officials say that the real rate rises closer to 20 percent when part-timers and those who have stopped looking for work are added in.

At an elementary school near Ms. Wheaton’s home, an expansion of the school’s water supply was under way until thieves sneaked in at night and tore the copper pipes out of the ground to sell for scrap.

Five miles southwest, in Coolidge, a desert town within view of the distant Superstition Mountains, demand has tripled at Tom Hunt’s food pantry. Some days he runs out.

Henry Alejandrez, 60, is a roofer who migrated from Texas looking for work.“It’s gotten real bad,”he says.“I’m a citizen, and you’re lucky if you get minimum wage.”

Mary Sepeda, his sister, nods. She used to drive two hours to clean newly constructed homes before they were sold. That job evaporated with the housing market. (Arizona issued 62,500 housing permits several years ago; it gave out 8,400 last year.)

“It’s getting crazy,”she says, holding up a white plastic bag of pantry food.“How does this end?”

You put that question to Mr. Pollack, the forecaster.“We won’t recover until we absorb 80,000 empty houses and office buildings and people can borrow again,”he says.

When will that be?

“I’m forecasting recovery by 2013 to 2015,”he says.

Cherry Hill, N.J.

The housing market in this bedroom community just across the border from Philadelphia never leapt to the frenzied heights of Miami Beach or Las Vegas. But even if foreclosure notices are not tacked to every other door, a malaise has settled over the market. Home prices have fallen by 16 percent since 2006, and houses now take twice as long to sell as they did five years ago.

That’s enough to inflict pain on homeowners who need to sell because of a job loss or drop in income. Some are being forced to get rid of their houses in short sales, asking less than they owe on a mortgage. As of last week, 10 percent of all listings in this well-tended suburb were being offered as short sales.

Chrysanthemums bloomed in boxes on the porch of one of those homes as a real estate broker unlocked the front door. In the kitchen, children’s chores were listed neatly on an erasable white board. Dinner simmered in a Crock-Pot on the counter.

There were few signs of the financial distress that prompted the owners to put their four-bedroom colonial on the market for less than they paid five years ago.

The colonial’s owners, James and Patricia Furrow, bought near the top of the market in 2005 for $289,900. Mr. Furrow, 48, retired in July after 26 years as a corrections officer and supplements his pension with work as a handyman. But his income is spotty, and his wife, who works in a school cafeteria, does not earn enough to cover the mortgage on the house where they live with their three children.

They have already missed a payment; they want to sell the house in hopes their lender will forgive the shortfall between their loan balance and the lower sale price. They are asking $279,900.

“When we did buy, the market was still moving pretty good,”said Mr. Furrow.“Then it got to the point where people said it is not going to last. And of course it didn’t last.”

Some of the homes being offered at distressed prices are dragging down prices for less troubled homeowners who hope to sell. And with foreclosures now in disarray, the market could be further weakened.“Even someone who is trying to sell a normal, well-maintained house is at the mercy of these low prices,”said Walter Bud Crane, an agent with Re/Max of Cherry Hill.

So the houses sit, awaiting offers that rarely materialize. According to Mr. Crane, the average number of days that homes sit on the market has nearly doubled, to 62 this year from 32 in 2005. Buyers are chary, not sure if their jobs are secure. Open houses draw sparse crowds.

In Camden County, where Cherry Hill sits, unemployment is near 10 percent. Several large employers have closed or conducted huge layoffs, and others have pruned hours. With Gov. Chris Christie reining in spending, government workers are jittery.

Real estate agents say it has rarely been a better time to buy: interest rates are at record lows, house prices have fallen and the selection is large.

Tara Stewart-Becker, a 28-year-old financial services manager, said she and her husband would love to buy a sprawling fixer-upper just three blocks from the narrow colonial they purchased four years ago in Riverton, which backs onto the Delaware River.

But a bad kitchen flood and a loan to pay for repairs has left Ms. Becker and her husband, Eric, owing more on their mortgage than the house is currently worth. Even though the couple make far more money than they did when they bought their house and could afford a larger loan and renovations, they cannot sell.

“I would gladly take a new mortgage and stimulate the economy for the rest of my life,”Ms. Becker said.

“Unfortunately, there isn’t anything that a government or a bank can do,”she added.“You just have to settle for less and wait.”

Atlanta

Long fast-growing, no-holds-barred Atlanta has burned to the ground before, figuratively and in reality, and each time it was a phoenix rising. But this recession has cut deeper than any since the Great Depression and left Atlanta’s commercial and high-end condo real estate in an economic coma.

Over all, assuming a robust growth rate, industry leaders say it could take 12 years for Atlanta to absorb excess commercial space.

“That one—see it?”Alan Wexler points to a gleaming blue tower as he drives.“A Chicago bank took it over six months ago. Sold at a 40 percent discount.”

“And over there”—he juts his chin at a boarded-up hotel topped by a Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant crown.“That was going to be a condo. They just shut it down and walked away.”

Mr. Wexler, a wiry and peripatetic real estate data analyst, describes it all on a drive down Peachtree Road, Atlanta’s posh commercial spine.

He starts in the Buckhead neighborhood, which has more than two million square feet of vacant commercial space. A billboard outside one discounted condo tower promises“New Pricing from the $290s!”There are towers half-empty and towers in receivership. Office buildings that once sold for $85 million now retail for $35 million.

Approaching downtown, Mr. Wexler hits the brakes and points to an older, white marble building.“See that one? It’s the Fed Reserve. That’s where they sit, look, sweat and wonder: How did we get into this mess?”

That’s a question much on the minds and lips of residents.

The commercial vacancy rate in Buckhead is near 20 percent, and the Atlanta region has added jobs only at the low end.

Mike Alexander, research division chief for the Atlanta Regional Commission, posed the question:“When do we start to add premium jobs again?”

Lawrence L. Gellerstedt III, chief executive of Cousins Properties, sits in an office high atop an elegant Philip Johnson tower, with a grand view of the Atlanta commercial corridor running north. He does not see improvement on the horizon.

“We’re all wondering what gets the economy producing jobs and growth again,”he says.“Atlanta always was the fair-haired child of real estate growth and now, it’s‘O.K., poster boy, you’re getting yours.’”

Small banks are a particular disaster, 43 having gone under in Georgia since 2008. (Federal regulators closed 129 nationally this year, up from 25 last year.) Real estate was the beginning, the middle and the end of the troubles. In one deal, dozens of Atlanta banks invested in Merrill Ranch, a 4,508-acre tract of desert south of Phoenix.

The deal imploded and took a lot of banks with it.

“No one was demanding documents or reading the fine print, and mortgage banks were fat and happy,”recalls John Little, a developer.“Well, that train couldn’t keep running.”

He has a ringside seat on this debacle, as he sits in the office of a handsome condo complex he built in west Atlanta. He faced price discounts so deep that he decided to rent it instead.

Nationwide banks have no interest in lending to local developers, and the regional banks are desperate for cash and calling in their loans.

Mr. Little got lucky; he bought out his loan and kept his property.“Most of my generation of builders has gone under,”he said.“It’s still spiraling out of control.” Posted by Bill Buczak at 7:34 AM Email This BlogThis!

Oh No, Mr. Bill!
 Bill Buczak I am a 34 year retailing veteran with buying, planning, and storeline experience at Gimbels and Macy&apos;s. I&apos;ve been through multiple downsizings, six mergers, one nameplate change after another, and I STILL love the department store retail business, don&apos;t ask me why! I hope you enjoy my news blog. View my complete profile
