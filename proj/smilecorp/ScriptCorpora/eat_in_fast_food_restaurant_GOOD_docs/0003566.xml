What are my tenant rights? water bill, security deposit, garbage?
 Im about to move into a reallly nice duplex in ohio this weekend. The guy wants a month and a halfs worth of rent as the deposit Plus first months rent due at signing. (at first he wanted this much only for a 6 month lease to see if we get along well with him and the guy living in suite below us, and i told him theres no way i pay that much and only get the security of having a lease for 6 months) so he changed it to a year. rent by the way is 785, so my total this weekend comes to near 2000 just to move in!

My questions are: i saw on ohio tenant law websites, that any security deposit over one month of rent, will require the landlord to pay the tenant 5% interest at the end of the year. Is this true? How can i use this to encourage him to only charge only one months rent for the deposit?
Second, in regards to us paying water. I thought most landlords paid this, but he did show me a seperate water meter that is in the basement so i guess that is legit. Right?

Third, and i know i can ask him but i forgot, how does the garbage work. Is the landlord supposed to at least cover trash pick up?

thanks for any help!

Additional Details
 5321.16 Security deposit procedures.

(A) Any security deposit in excess of fifty dollars or one month&apos;s periodic rent, whichever is greater, shall bear interest on the excess at the rate of five per cent per annum if the tenant remains in possession of the premises for six months or more, and shall be computed and paid annually by the landlord to the tenant.

(B) Upon termination of the rental agreement any property or money held by the landlord as a security deposit may be applied to the payment of past due rent and to the payment of the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant&apos;s noncompliance with section 5321.05 of the Revised Code or the rental agreement. Any deduction from the security deposit shall be itemized and identified by the landlord in a written notice delivered to the tenant together with the amount due, within thirty days after termination of the rental agreement and delivery of possession...

 ...The tenant shall provide the landlord in writing with a forwarding address or new address to which the written notice and amount due from the landlord may be sent. If the tenant fails to provide the landlord with the forwarding or new address as required, the tenant shall not be entitled to damages or attorneys fees under division (C) of this section.

(C) If the landlord fails to comply with division (B) of this section, the tenant may recover the property and money due him, together with damages in an amount equal to the amount wrongfully withheld, and reasonable attorneys fees.

So landlords must pay tenants 5% interest on rent that exceeds one months rent? I want to use this to get my deposit lowered.

 so is the ohio landlord website i went to wrong (ive seen the 5 % thing a few different places...)

The garbage is just, walk to the end of the driveway on fridays type thing. So i will get a bill for that then, not the landlord?

 Your lease should specify which utilities you pay
Tenants for homes, duplexes and twoflats often pay all the utilities if they are separated
My tenants pay water (sewer&amp;garbage), gas, electric, cable, phone, etc. Nothing says a LL has to pay ANY utilities--I don&apos;t. When choosing a place to live and budgeting you need to consider the utility costs you pay as well as rent

Don&apos;t know about Ohio, but if it were me, I&apos;d rather get 1 month than have to keep your deposit separate and pay the interest, so ask the LL.

 Paying the water is negotiated between you and the landlord. If the landlord says you must pay, you don&apos;t sign the lease if you don&apos;t agree.
He must pay you 5% interest but only on $400. SO you will get $20 when you move out. Garbage is included in most water bills. At an apartment complex, the landlord pays it in one lump sum; it would be negotiated.

 I&apos;m sure your landlord knows he as to hold your security deposit in an interest bearing savings account, but the interst won&apos;t be anywhere near 5%. It&apos;s more like 1.25% If there are seperate water meters, you&apos;ll be paying your own water. (Learn to conserve) As for the trash, it depends. Is the trash put in one dumpster that all tenants use? If so, the landlord would have to pay that. If you put out your own cans, you&apos;ll be resposnsible.

 I have no idea on the 5% for 1.5 months security deposit but I suspect if it was on a Ohio tenant website its legit. I would definitely show him this and he may very well lower the deposit to one month based on this since he can save paying the 5% interest if he does. Just show him the law and ask him to lower it since it saves him money to do so.

As to the water meter the tenant usually does pay this. The exception is where one meter covers multiple places but since this isn&apos;t the case here then yes you should pay it. For the garbage, most places this is picked up by the city/ county (included and paid for by real estate taxes which the landlord always pays), but some places do have a separate service and charge for this. So, I&apos;ll bet this is included in your rent but you&apos;d better ask him to make sure.

 The landlord is requesting 1 1/2 months security deposit, that is what he wants in order to move in. He does not have to negotiate.

5% interest for the year on $392.50 is under $20.00. The landlord would likely prefer to have the $392.50 in his possession (it is security after all) and pay you the $20.00 annually.

The landlord may very well know the law.

As far as the water, as long as there is a separate meter he can legally have you pay for the water/sewer. You will be paying for what you use only.

You will have to ask about the garbage.
