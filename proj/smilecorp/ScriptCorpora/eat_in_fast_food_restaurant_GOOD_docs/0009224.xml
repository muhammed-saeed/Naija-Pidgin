 Need for Social Media in the Food and Beverage industry 

The Food and Beverage industry is similar to any other industry for the simple fact that it is constantly growing and needs new ways to expand, and in recent years the way for this to happen is to expand into the social media world. This has been accomplished through web 2.0 applications such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc. People sign into Facebook 14 minutes a day, and think about food 44 minutes a day. If the food industry could combine the two successfully, then it would greatly increase the revenue potential.


The food industry is already becoming more popular in the social media world because on May 1st 2010 the top post of Twitter was &quot;world poutine eating championship coming to Toronto&quot;. In addition, a lot of these companies are becoming very popular on Facebook. In Canada the top companies are Pepsi, Canada dry, McDonalds,Doritos, Red bull, Amp energy. The reason that they are the top companies is because they offer easy access to Facebook users to follow their companies on Facebook, and they also properly advertise their merchandise on Facebook.


Such powerhouse companies like Starbucks, Doroitos, Whole Foods Market, and Pepsi have begun to integrate New Media into their websites. They have done this by using the RSS feeds, Facebook, and tweets aspect. This allows customers to follow their events,new products, and even coupons right on their computers.

Beverage Company like Coca Cola is willing to spend millions of dollars to advertise their beverage on Super Bowl commercial through new media.

 



 
 How Social Media contribute to the Food and Beverage Industry 

Improving technology has made everything easier especially when it comes to communicating. Business are finding different ways to communicate with their customers and advertise their products. Many food and beverage industry has been using social media such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs to connect with their customers ever since social media has been on a rise. [ Baker Tweet ] is an example, &quot;BakerTweet allows businesses to use Twitter to communicate in real-time about offers, pricing and stock from a device that can withstand kitchen peril and is much simpler to operate than a laptop or a mobile.&quot; [1] There has also been an increasing number of food trucks, and they don&apos;t always stay in one location, they would use blogs and twitters to let customers know where they will be located at and keep the customers posted.
 
 New Media in the Hospitality Industry 

The hospitality industry consists of broad category of fields within the service industry and includes lodging, restaurants, event planning, theme parks, transportation, cruise line, and other fields within the tourism industry. Moreover, it covers a wide range of organizations offering food service and accommodation. The industry is divided into several sectors according to the skill-sets required for the work involved. These sectors include accommodation, food and beverage, meeting and events, gaming, entertainment and recreation, tourism services, and visitor information. [2] 


Today the hospitality industry has significantly engaged in social media and networking websites. With the evolution of social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google+ and Blogger, the industry is able to provide its guests higher quality, faster service, and lower cost locally and globally. In hospitality and tourism, customers use social media before making any travel arrangements and consuming tourist products and services. On the other hand, in order to know the precise level and situation of quality of products and services, producers and service providers use social media tools to advance their position and gain competitive advantage. Social media can help hospitality professionals maximize their customers’ travel experiences and recognize their needs. After all, travel is personal, and social media essentially creates opportunities for personal interaction. [3] 


The progressive use of social media has diverse impact on an individual’s life. Experts advise people to see this new way of communication as an innovative and productive tool, instead of being apprehensive of its potential harms to the society. As far as the hospitality industry is concerned, every organization that opens its door to social media, impacts its entire environment – from the way information is delivered through communication all the way to hiring decisions. However, Identity and reliability are two of the major issues that both consumers and producers have to take into account before starting to share their insights through social media. If organizations are exposed without security boundaries to the internet world, they are putting their cultural and web identity at risk. The staff at these organizations that is responsible for taking care of the interactive web pages has to assess and critically decide which reviews are really trustworthy, reliable and helpful for the organization. Lastly, like any other tool or invention, social media is not by definition good or bad, harmful or harmless, informative or manipulative; it all depends on the way, the purpose, and the circumstances we use it in order to get benefit from it. [4]

 POS Systems 
 POS System Illustration 
A POS (point of sale) system is a combination of a computer, cash register, and credit card machine. This technology is used by most bars and restaurants in major cities throughout the United States and worldwide. A POS system should most definitely be considered new media because it is a mash-up of the original cash register with a touch-screen computer that has internet connection. This mechanism allows retailers to operate every facet of their business with a single, integrated point of sale system. Basically, it has helped evolve and progress the cash register to enable smoother, more efficient, and more organized transactions. Dinerware&apos;s systems is one example of a POS system that is frequently used in restaurants. This POS system can be customized to fit the needs and offerings of each restaurant.

 Screenshot of Dinnerware&apos;s POS 
Lets walk through the process and some of the amazing features of the POS system at a super market. Using the POS system is like using a touch screen computer that operates through the internet. The POS system is a software that consists of the menu, the scanning feature, connection with the cash register and the printer. Every POS system at the grocery store has a menu page that consists the list of their products at their store, which makes it easy for the cashier to look up the name of the product in a certain category. For example, if you are looking for apples in the system then you would look up the fruits folder and then locate apple. Now the names of the products can be added/deleted by the user. The user has full authority to edit the product&apos;s name/price saved in the system. Moreover, it also has a scanning system that makes the life of the cashier way easier. Every name of the product is entered in the system with the help of the bar code, so when a customer want to buy a certain product, the cashier simply scans the bar code and the system shows the name of the product, it&apos;s price and then you can chose the method of payment-either cash or credit. After hitting cash or credit button, the cash drawer open from where you can give the customer their change. Now all these transactions that take place are recorded and this is how they can find out the sales for the whole day. It is also in the user&apos;s hand of how they what to show the report. They can either get the report daily or by shift depending on the management.

POS system is advanced, much faster and attractive than the old registers that is used in the super markets. This system saves a lot of time. In other words, it means that being able to take the customers fast and generate more revenue for the company.
 
 Promotional Efforts and Increasing Traffic with New Media

 GoMobo enables individuals to store their payment information securely so that they may either place orders online or text in their orders to participating restaurants. In addition, it allows individuals to store their favorites / preferences. GoMobo 

 A website that offers consumers printable gift certificates to restaurants at a discount from face value to help restaurants gain exposure. Each restaurant offers a limited amount of certificates each month and there are certain restrictions that may apply. For example, for a $25 certificate, the restriction may that that it is valid only on a purchase of $35 or more. However, when one can get a $25 gift certificate for a restaurant at their regular price of $10 or oftentimes much less due to their coupon codes / sales, it helps create a significant incentive for individuals to try a new restaurant. Restaurant.com 

 This site features a different deal a day for businesses in the food, beverage,and service industries in your area via a gift certificate or card discounted from face value. Typically, they offer their deals via printable certificates that one may print directly from their account at their convenience. They also recently created an iPhone app and utilize social network sites such as Twitter and Facebook to promote their website and deals. Groupon.com 

 This site operates very similar to Groupon in that it offers a deal a day in your area for businesses in the food, beverage,and service industries in your area. However, what sets it apart is that it relies largely on its iPhone application. LivingSocial 

 Another deal a day site that offers a gift certificate / card at a discount from face value. However, the way KGB differs is that its deals often require the individual to wait for a physical certificate / card to be mailed rather than being able to print their certificate immediately or shortly after purchase. KGB Deals 

 This website offers daily deals on food&amp;drink at restaurants and cooking classes in addition to other businesses. Gilt users may purchase these deals for themselves or as a gift for others. Gilt City 

 Google is going big. Google Offers is yet another website that was launched in 2011. This website offers great deals on a daily basis for areas in food, salon, fitness and much more. Google Offers 

 Opentable provides free real-time online reservations, it has more than 25,000 participating restaurants. Users can also write reviews of their experience and read review other customers experience.

 Benefits of having Promotions through New Media 

New Media is spreading like a virus. It has not only made an influential impact in the entertainment world, but also in the food industry. Who hasn&apos;t heard about Yelp, Groupon and living social these days? There used to be a time when we never really looked to our newsletter in our inbox, but today we always look forward to getting the daily deals in order to save some extra bucks.

Who doesn&apos;t like to get an extra $10 when you spent $10 to shop at your favorite food store? Sure, everyone does. Hence, these promotional sites have been expanding rapidly over these years. It not only helps save some extra buck for the consumers but also helps promote the business immensely. For instance, a restaurant decides to give some promotion through these sites. As a result, hundreds of people buy the deal. Just imagine how many people are you reaching out to with that one offer. As a matter of fact, you are not only limited in reaching out to that hundred people; keep in mind that these people are spreading the word with their friends also. In addition to that, there is facebook, twitter and all the other social networking sites where you can share the links from these sites. These sites can be used as one of the the marketing strategies by businesses.

New media has literally made our lives much easier. With the help of new media, ordering pizza is just one click away. As a matter of fact, it&apos;s amazing how you can even track online from the point you ordered the pizza to the point when its being delivered.

Moreover, new media has helped people go green. In other words, you do not really need to buy the book to find the best restaurant in your community. There is yelp to help! You find the best restaurants in the town with all the good/bad reviews and price range. When everything is going virtual, you can help the environment go green as well, and thats what new media is doing.

 Downsides of having Promotions through New Media 

A coin always has it&apos;s two sides. Likewise, having promotions through new media also has it&apos;s sweet and bitter sides.

The consumers are always better off getting the best deals in their community, but can you imaging how much pressure the company has to live up to? A company has to make a bulk of food in a limited time, pay the employees for the extra time they are devoting, and it is not always profitable for them to give these promotions. Recently there was an article in Business Insider , where a bakery called Need Cake in UK, decided to give out promotions through Groupon. But then they were so pressurized to bake huge amount of cupcakes in a limited time. This did not even help them make profit. So these promotional sites can not make everyone happy all the time.

In addition, when everything is going virtual there is a threat of people being isolated. With the help of new media people are interacting through internet to buy stuff, so they are losing personal contact with each other. Also, when we are talking about yelp, people are posing reviews and commenting about the employees there. When people are writing reviews, they can be really rude at times. They are not aware that they are not just throwing out their emotions to the computer. Writing a comment does hurt the other person and not the computer. People normally do not tend say those same words if they were to comment about the employees face to face. Hence, new media has bought a shield between two people interacting each other.
 
 Fast Food Goes New Media 

CKE Restaurants, Inc. is a corporation in the U.S. which consists of three fast food restaurant chains: Carl&apos;s Jr., Hardee&apos;s, and Green Burrito. [5] For those who live in New York City may be unfamiliar these names, but there are over 2,000 locations throughout America (including Hawaii and Alaska). This corporation, like all others, must file annual reports to show it&apos;s revenue, profits, and other operating and financing activities. SEC filings do not typically include advertisement through blogs, social networking websites, and any other new media.

In 2009, CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc., Andrew Puzder, added something out of the ordinary to the &quot;Executive Commentary&quot; portion of the corporation&apos;s 8-K (specifically regarding Carl&apos;s Jr.):



 &quot;We just launched a very innovative partnership with YouTube whereby we are utilizing 
 some of their most popular video stars to produce short videos promoting our burgers. With a 
 combined following of 3.2 million subscribers, these video bloggers (&quot;vloggers&quot;) are 
 helping us target our customer demographic where they already are. In addition, the media 
 cost is much lower that with traditional advertising. According to www.mashable.com, the 
 world&apos;s largest blog focused exclusively on Web 2.0 and Social Media news, our sponsored 
 video content appears to have &apos;turned out to be a big hit.&apos; In fact, just one of the Carl&apos;s 
 Jr. vloggers created a video that&apos;s already received over 2.4 million views across the web. 
 All of the Carl&apos;s Jr. vloggers&apos; videos, combined, have been viewed more than 5.7 million 
 times.&quot; [6] 

Apparently YouTube was responsible for the recent profit increases. Perhaps Puzder felt it necessary to mention to dispel any suspicious dealings. After all, this type of advertising is cheaper, so the report must have showed a decrease in expenses and an increase in profit.

Another food corporation, Bob Evans Farms, Inc., is also guilty of mentioning their use of social networking sites (i.e. Facebook and Twitter), a type of new media, in their annual report (2009).

According to these SEC filings, new media has become something worth reporting.

McDonald of one the biggest chain fast food restaurant is advertising on the U.S television about the new launch of their Happy Meal and other healthy meals.
 &quot;In the new ads, a kid named Ferris lives on a farm with his goat,
 who learns how to eat healthier foods as the story unfolds. 
 Some commercials will advertise Happy Meal toys, which were
 banned by the city of San Francisco last year. McDonald’s, 
 which has more than 33,500 locations worldwide, spent $74.4 million
 last year primarily for TV and radio ads in the U.S.,
 according to a company filing.&quot; [7] 
 Fast Food Education 

There are many tools we can use in new media technology to educate ourselves about healthy food.

 SustainableTable 

 


 Weight Watchers has signed a deal with fast food chain McDonald&apos;s to promote a new range of healthy meals.The dieting company have agreed to put their logo on three McDonald&apos;s Classics - Chicken McNuggets, the Filet-O-Fish and the Sweet Chilli Seared Chicken wrap.

 

 

 Many of these calorie counters or trackers can be easily found on apple store which can be very helpful for individuals to track their daily calorie consumption.
 
 Is It Ethical? 

Major transnational food and softdrink corporations such as McDonald&apos;s and Pepsi have been using new media to target children. These corporations set up websites that attract children around the age of four to register and play multiple games in which further exposes these children to more marketing strategies. In return for using the websites, children are given screen savers, avatars, and even coupons. New Media tactics are being used by these companies to promote unhealthy lifestyles when it comes to food choices by targeting a higher susceptible market group of consumers, children. Justin Macmullan, Head of Campaigns at Consumers International, stated that:



 In many countries kids already spend more time on the internet than watching TV. That’s why
 it’s vital we have mandatory regulations that restrict junk food companies from using new 
 media to perform the same old marketing tricks on our children. [8] 

New media makes marketing and advertising easy and effective, even in the food industry.

Numbers of downside news regarding the fast food restaurant in the United State on new media’s, however, people still willing to purchase the “unhealthy” fast food. It goes beyond the ethical perspective in some cases.

The chefs also use these social networking sites as to market themselves. They know that every daughter mom and dad in the family uses facebook or twitter. So they use these medias to reach to all the people. The way they use these sites is that they create the fan page and let all the lessons go public and in some cases you need to like the page first to view any content.

These people are not posting these lessons for any marketing or anything but they are just posting it because it&apos;s their hobby and they want to share it to others. Its not that they want to make profit out of it, but by posting these videos makes them happy.

Basically the company should be utilizing all of the web 2.0 applications that so many of today&apos;s people use every day.

Social Media has added a little to the way marketing happens, it can now be seen that Something you buy leads to, something you trust leads to, something you want leads to, something you prefer leads to,something you love leads to, something you participate in. IT is this last aspect which really portrays the new media aspect because it is things like blogs, tweets, and social networks that let the user participate in the food industry. And it is up to the firm to let the customer do all of these things.

 Coupons.Com 

Is an online site which offers virtually all kinds of coupons from local restaurants to everyday grocery items like cereal and milk. It is extremely important that the food industry provide a good amount of coupons for their customers because it gives them a reason to go to the store and purchase items. Once in the store or restaurant they will be more inclined to spend more money. IT is also important that it is easily available on websites such as coupons.com. They could also advertise on popular sites such as facebook and tweeter. Yet another way people could follow the deals would be to let customers follow the products on facebook and twitter, this way they are always updated with the best deals at the time.

 


 Urbanspoon 

Is an online site which lets you search for local restaurants and nightlife. IT is broken down by city for easy search and further broken down to type of eatery/cuisine you would like. Once you get to that point you can establish what price you would like to pay and after that it is just based on your opinions of the reviews. There are constant blogger on this site who update their pages with different places they go to and those posts have their own updates from other people, and even add pictures. Thus it seems to be like an online community in which people contribute their opinions. It is up to the restaurant/ bar to keep up with what people are saying and to make sure the reviews are good and if something isn&apos;t up to par they should change it. This way both the customer and the restaurant can utilize the best of the social networking aspect.

 salad. It&apos;s technologically literate, too, with i-Phone compatible recipes, and there is a 
 convenient index of recipes by ingredient, and by category (ie gluten-free, cookies, drinks 
 etc).&quot; 
 

One of the most incentive Twitters regarding cooking is BakerTweet

 whatever.&quot;

For example, Playfish&apos;s Restaurant City game is interactive in the sense that players can create their own virtual restaurant and use ingredients to level-up their recipes. They can use &quot;money&quot; to purchase ingredients and decor for their restaurants. Players can visit their friends&apos; virtual restaurants and request trades of ingredients. These virtual games are available either via Facebook, online gaming websites, video gaming systems, or SmartPhone applications. Examples of virtual food and restaurant games include:

 Virtual Games - In the Restroom

While this product is in a trail stage its bringing the opportunity for users to get the best out of the time spent and the urinals as well as the the chance for potential advertisers to reach more consumers.


 
 
 Recipe Websites 

There are many websites in which people can share and exchange recipes online. A few popular websites are: [19] 

 Epicurious Allrecipes Food Network Chow Food My Recipes Recipe SimplyRecipes Yummly 
 
 Food Advertising and new media 

Today U.S. food and beverage companies are using new media to promote their products and extend their television advertising. These companies are focusing in gaining children&apos;s attention. These websites and other types of new media promote food items high in sugar and fat and many other unhealthy food. The proliferation of media in Children lives has created a new marketing ecosystem that includes cell phones, music devices, instant messaging, videogames and virtual worlds. [20] 


 
 
 Advergames 

The food companies are using advergames to gain children’s attention. An Advergame is defined as advertising in a free, electronic video game. The game usually is on one or more websites. The game promotes a product, service or brand to the specific audiences of those websites. For example, a cartoon video game directed at children that promotes snacks, candy, or cereals. Branded entertainment is a fast-growing and potentially highly effective way to reach consumers in unique and compelling ways.

Imagine, for example, that “Nestle Push-up Frozen Treats are popping up all over the place, and it’s your job to bop ‘em back down.” For every pop that you bop, you earn points, and as you become more skilled at the game, you can progress from the “easy” to a “medium” or “hard” level of play. The brand package is the visual centerpiece of the game (it pops up repeatedly), making the brand easier to recall later. This is “Bop-a-Pop” one of the games on the kids.icecream.com website. [21] 




 
 
 Goverment Regulations 

The government is pressuring food companies to cut back on marketing unhealthy foods to children, releasing guidelines that could phase out advertisements on television, in stores and on the Internet if companies agree to go along with them.

Under the voluntary guidelines, companies would be urged to only market foods to children ages 2 through 17 if they are low in fats, sugars and sodium and contain specified healthy ingredients. The proposal sets parameters that are stricter than many companies have set for themselves.

It is unclear whether government pressure will be effective enough to get many companies to sign on. Some of the country&apos;s largest food companies, including McDonalds, General Mills Inc., Kellogg Co., Kraft Foods Global and PepsiCo Inc., already have joined an initiative sponsored by the Better Business Bureau to limit their marketing to children. [22] 

Through similar initiatives and as a result of public pressure, the industry has been successful in reducing the number of television ads aimed at children in recent years, though much of that advertising has moved to the Internet, social media and other digital platforms such as smart phones. Public health advocates argued that the industry&apos;s self-regulation is not enough and has pushed the government to set guidelines to pressure them.

In 2009, Congress directed the Federal Trade Commission, Agriculture Department, Food and Drug Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to form a working group and develop the recommendations. The guidelines they wrote are broad, applying to digital media and almost any promotion a child might see for a food, including text messages, product placement in video games. [23]
