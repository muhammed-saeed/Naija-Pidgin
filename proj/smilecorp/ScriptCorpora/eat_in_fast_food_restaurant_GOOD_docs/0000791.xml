We love this place. It can get really busy and you sometimes have to wait a while to get a table, but the food and the service are great.

This Nando&apos;s is far superior to the one on Lothian Road. Nando&apos;s is generally quite pricey, but you know what you&apos;re getting. It&apos;s probably the best place to kill time at Fountain Park if you&apos;re a bit peckish.

Totally over rated and not worth the money you are spending. I would not be so fussed about going back. The food was OK but nothing special.

Yum! Nando&apos;s is brilliant, and if you haven&apos;t tried it stop reading this and go eat some chicken! A half chicken with medium sauce is a good place to start, and the froyo and drinks are bottomless so you&apos;ll not get thirsty.
You&apos;re encouraged to eat with your hands (it tastes better), so do it.
Oh, and before you leave don&apos;t forget to stamp your parking ticket at the till so you get free parking.

Nice food, nice atmosphere. Handy for a pre-cinema dinner.

Have been on several occasions and never really had any problems. Did once have burnt chicken wings but was given a voucher for 10 free chicken wings on my next visit so can&apos;t really complain!

Loyalty is rewarded too.

I like Nandos as its reasonable and very quick, if you are trying to catch a film. The staff are a mixed bunch, but on the whole nice. I think that they are just young and not so used to dealing with customers.
Not great for vegetarians, but if you like chicken you&apos;re sorted.

It is a fast food restaurant offering a wide selection of chicken dishes, something the South African chain is expert in. The meals come with a good variety of sauces and the refillable drinks is another asset to the place. Portions are really generous, the service is quick. Not very busy during the week but the weekends could be a small hell.

Nandos is good food if you believe everyone living in the X factor house from last year, I tedn to agree a little bit. I mean its really just posh kfc isnt it and its way more expensive.

They have the salads and all that but you&apos;re not really going in there for that are you its all about the begerks really. Its brilliant that this has opened at fountain park because there were no real fast foody type places out there if you just wanted to grab something quick before the movies, so its brilliant for that.

The food is quite good I like the whole piri pirir thing and theres not really a fault with it, its clean, its always pretty busy but sometimes the food does take awhile to come out - that depends on when your there though I guess and cant be helped.

Nice seating and really convenient. All up, not bad for a posh kfc.

Having been to Nando&apos;s in the past, albeit quite a few years ago, I pretty much knew what to expect here and certainly as far as the quality of the food and the general service were concerned I&apos;ve no complaints.

I do not however think that the restaurant is particularly good value for money - £12 for an ordinary sized wrap with two modest servings of rice/veg is steep. The pricing structure across the board is also rather bizarre. Where else charges £3.01 for a beer (never mind that one of them is Super Bock, which Oddbins practically give away, not that it&apos;s a bad beer in any way)? Possibly this is due to the recent vat change but it strikes me they could either have absorbed that or re-priced in a more sensible manner rather than littering the menu with pence amounts of 13, 26, 64 etc. On this visit they also ran out of knives (and those on the go looked rather less than totally clean although that could have just been dishwasher smears) and they could do with a larger soft drink dispenser as on busy nights it appears to run out of content on a regular basis due to the free refills available.

For 2nd tier fast food I would choose the La Tasca or TGI Fridays chains above Nando&apos;s.

Well, it&apos;s probably unfair to label it as a fast food restaurant in a restaurant setting, but that is essentially what it is.

However, that&apos;s where the similarities end.

The food is excellent, served really quickly and good value for money with generous portions.

I had the chicken breast wrap with chilli jam and it was insanely tasty. If you are getting chips, definitely pay the extra for the piri-piri salt!!

When I was in, the staff were friendly and approachable without being overbearing.

 GOOD FOOD . GOOD AMBIANCE . GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY .

 TERRIBLE SERVICE . STAFF NOT TRAINED . RUDE STAFF .

I had a complaint cause of my food not being served on time and on the CORRECT table.

Politely asked the staff, manager was angry and being arrogant.

I just asked my money back. The staff suggesting it’s my fault.

Spoiled the night. Customer not coming back. EVER .

But of course I ate there before this happens, food is good quality and very nice ambiance. Only service is poor, but it still counts, though.

Sorry but I will never suggest Nandos in Edinburgh ever again to my friends and to our 5-STAR HOTEL GUESTS . Sorry!

I was really looking forward to a Nando’s opening up in Edinburgh and I was not disappointed. If you’re a fan of chicken then this is a great place to eat. There’s a good selection on the menu, the service is quick and friendly and the decor is spacious and comfy. We were sat in one of the booths which was great for not being distracted by other diners. The refillable drinks is another great feature. The restaurant is in a fairly central location and great for a pre or post movie bite to eat. I’ll definitely be back!

Ok, not cool to frequent or voluntarily review a chain restaurant, but I love chicken&amp;I love Nandos so am over the moon to finally have one in Edinburgh!

Long may it reign!

I’d heard nothing but good things about Nando’s in the past but never actually visited one. I have to admit it was a pretty enjoyable experience.

The Fountain park branch is only a few minutes walk from my flat so made it an easy choice for Sunday dinner when feeling too lazy to cook. The place was big enough that we didn’t have to queue to get a table but not so cavernous that it ruins any atmosphere.

Being a bit of a chicken wing fan I went straight for the portion of 10 with a side of chips. I am Scottish after all. My partner has a quarter chicken with sides of rice and coleslaw. The staff member at the counter asked if we’d visited Nando’s before and told us we were“very brave”opting for the“hot”sauce as first time visitors. We’re fans of spicy food though and would probably have rated this more medium than hot. Just a pleasant amount of heat with plenty of flavour.

If there’s not enough heat in the marinade for you they prvide bottles of sauce of each heat level to take to your table so you can spice it up&apos;til your hearts content.

The wings were perfectly cooked with the meat just falling off the bone. Chips are chips and I can’t think of anything exciting to say about them.

With top-ups of your soft drink also included and a takeaway service available I’ll be more than happy to become a regular at Nando’s

This is the first time I’ve been to Nando’s and I was really impressed with the food.

It’s more a fast food style of service, so you get a table and then order your food and drink at the bar. The food is then brought to your table.

I had a half chicken with sweet potato mash and it was really good. I had the hot spice and it certainly lived up to the name!! It wasn’t a huge chicken and I could quite easily have eaten more. My husband had a plain chicken burger which he said was ok. The olives were good and one of my friends had the cous cous salad which looked pretty good too.

It was pretty busy and noisy (it was a Friday night so to be expected!) but teh service was still quick, although queueing to order took ages.

As it’s in fountain park theres plenty of parking, and if you get your ticket validated by the restaurant the parking is free.

There is also a take away service
