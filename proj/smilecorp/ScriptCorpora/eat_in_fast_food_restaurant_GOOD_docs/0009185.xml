Ξ April 29th, 2008 |→|∇ Uncategorized | 


 Due to extremely high volume, we have had to expand the petition to a second page. Sign below and join the over 2300 other supporters! 

Led by District 1 County Supervisor Gloria Molina, the L.A. Board of Supervisors has passed new restrictions that will effectively eliminate taco trucks from our streets. Under Supervisor Molina’s new rules, taco trucks will have to change location every hour, or face a misdemeanor charge carrying a $1000 fine and/or jail. Yes, jail.

Taco Trucks are a special facet of Los Angeles, and something we don’t want to lose. Though this ordinance currently affects just unincorporated parts of L.A., that’s 65% of the County. And of course it opens up the doors for legislation closer to home too.

Let’s send Gloria Molina and the L.A. Board of Supervisors a message that we cherish our local vendors and don’t want to see them move away. This new law needs to be repealed!

this law must be repealed!…these are practically the best places to get good mexican food (especially late at night) how will we find the trucks if they have to keep moving every hour???!!! part of the charm is knowing where the good ones are parked. there are other solutions…such as requiring letter grades and inspections…please focus on bigger issues instead of picking on hard working people….

Making legislation to keep the trucks sanitary is one thing but to penalize them for trying to make a living is horrible and stupid! There are countless restaurants that got their start in those trucks and have become a thriving part of this city. If the cops have the time to give out tickets to hard working people instead of fighting real crime, we have a problem in this city!!!! Molina find something important to get behind. I am sure your constituents did not support you in the hopes of riding the city of“The Great Burrito Truck Infestation!”

GLORIA MOLINA DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORKING CLASS, IF SHE DID, THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.

I have been frequenting the same taco truck with my best friends for over a decade now. Our local taco truck (Fred’s truck on Colorado and Eagle Rock Blvd.) has become a part of our life and we have developed a wonderful friendship with it’s owner.

I believe that this ordinance would not only be detrimental to the hard working people who provide our city a great service, but would also be detrimental to our culture in Los Angeles.

Hundreds of people make a living out of taco trucks if this is done it will be devastating for them and their families. Knowing that this work is not a delinquency it is unfair that this new law will make the people break the law just for working.If selling tacos is unlawful. Then Is it wrong to work? If there are fines then the law will be getting money out of delinquency because the taco trucks will not be moving every hour. All of this is very unfair! Gloria Molina should be more considerate of the situation.

Ms. Molina as someone whom you represent i would appreciate that you listen to my opinion. The taco trucks are more than just vendors but they have become part of our wonderful Mexican culture. Please do not make the mistake of having the taco trucks move every hour because vendors struggle to make these taco trucks succesful. If you do plan to implement such law it is like taking away their rightful oppotunity to make a living. Please as a citizen of the county you represent I am asking that you represent your people will.

Please allow the TACO TRUCKS to stay in the various neighborhoods they frequent.

My family and i have been going to the same spot since i was 6 and I am now 22. They are authentic mexican tacos, the meet is fresh, the salsa is the bomb! Any how, I just want to say that removing the taco trucks in east L.A is the worst thing the city can do. Taco trucks is what makes EAST L.A.

To put it simply, good food and successful business equals happy public. By the way…did you know umm…there’s a bit of a war going on at the moment…also…umm…we’re plummetting into a recession. But of course, I’m sure that was all taken into consideration while the decision to put a smack down on tacos was put into effect…right?

Throughout the years, my obssession with tacos has grown to a level, where I cannot go a day without biting into a delicious combination of flour and corn. The fact that I am a robot, in this human world, I try to assimilate to the society by eating these tacos. Furthermore, my android sister likes tacos as well. These trucks are a vital part of the robot society and androids worldwide will step up for this cause. Here is a poem I have composed for this purpose:

The Taco

I love tacos
They are good
They fill me up
Even when I’m sad
Which is most of the time
Because I’m an android
Vapid
Androgenous
Laconic
And Metallic.

Banning Taco Trucks as a way to“clean up the city”is disgusting and racist. Taco Trucks are part of the Mexican Culture in LA. The restaurant owners are missing the point. We have the option to eat at the truck or in the restaurant. Removing people’s options so that they are forced to eat somewhere doesn’t seem like the democratic solution at all. It sounds like fear based tactics to keep the lower economic population poor and dependent on others. Don’t let this happen.

Eliminate the taco trucks. Add one more to the casualty list. Chavez Ravine, the red car, taco truks (i know there is much I am leaving out of the list). Help make Los angeles as homogenous as possible. Please make cheap street tacos unaccessible so they can only be served in miss informed and out of context restaurants.
This whole move curb taco trucks stinks of money. Los Angeles is finally being recognized as a valid culture spot and now its own leaders want to castrate the history a little more.

You have got to be kidding! The only reason I can see that this is being done is because these businesses might not be paying as much in taxes as restaurant facilities. But many of these people cannot afford the overhead of a restaurant building and they provide an economical alternative for many people who cannot“brown bag”it or afford eating out at a restaurant every day.

What is the purpose of this law? It seems only to harass poor and hard-working people and those who need to eat cheaply and nutritiously. I remember a point when I was struggling financially and be able to eat dinner for $1 helped enormously in getting by paycheck to paycheck. The vendors at my local taco truck were very nice and evenings eating outside iwith others in my neighbourhood are some of the most positive memories I have to date of living in this city. Please dont drive the taco trucks away if you care about the city of Los Angeles.

There are far greater aspects of this wonderful city to be concerned with. Leave these people be as they are providing a much needed service to the communities of LA. They provide culture that is painfully lacking from so much of this city.

This seems tragically targeted towards one section of the community as well. Very tragic to see so much effort being forced here when we should apply this methodology to let’s say the educational system, or perhaps even the rising crime rates?

For the love of all things, let the trucks stay in operation. If this is really just a stance to find ways to generate revenue for the county, then we need to impeach everyone in office for their incompetence.

Not allowing trucks to stay at their location long-term eliminates trucks to build sales, customer loyalty, or a profit. The TACO TRUCK is part of our community. If you have eaten off the TRUCK or not support la communidad latina and the thousands of Taco Truck families who try to make a living and provide for their children.

I think they’re not just a part of our culture but have also integrated into society as widely-recognized businesses. So they think that by banning them it will help the economy? Well I guess the government is going to get more wealthy from all of the fines they want to give since there are so many taco trucks out there. This is crazy.

All four gringos in my household (L.A. County residents, two of voting age) support the taco trucks. Free market competition between the brick&amp;mortar establishments and the truck vendors ultimately benefit taco consumers by providing superior tacos for better prices. If the taco trucks are not obstructing traffic or presenting safety hazards, they should be allowed to park without the exorbitant fines.
The county supervisors would have done better to pass a law to sock fines to door-to-door solicitors instead, and maybe those nuisances would stop.

In a city that has never met a condo conversion or strip mall it didn’t love, it should come as no surprise that a classic, iconic“mom and pop”operation like the Los Angeles taco trucks is something the City Council has decided to try and strangle. Perhaps the overpriced restaurants that launched the drive to curb the trucks should try to compete in the open market rather than being cowards and having the City Council do their dirty work.

I was born and raised in L.A. and have been eating from my favorite spot in Boyle Heights since‘84.

There is in no way, shape, or form that there can be any justification for even fining Taco trucks the $60 dollars that they are already getting fined for selling their food.

You say that establishments are complaining that the trucks are cutting into their business? I say, that those guys are upset that these guys are making better food cheaper!! Get over it already!! It’s called competition and trust me, you should take the time to quit entertaining ideas to try and kill its spirit and go have a couple of tacos!

We are in sad times when people in office want to take away some of our finest food at a very affordable price. Not only that, this sort of sounds like government trying to stomp on the little guy who is trying to make a buck. These people are not drug dealing, unless you are addicted to tacos! So please for God’s sake, leave our taco trucks alone, and quit punishing them for making an honest living!

Taco trucks are, and should remain a fixture in the L.A. landscape. They are a convenient and basic way for workers and people like me (who just enjoy the flavor of the culture) to grab something quick to eat without having to go to fast junk food restaurants or sit down establishments. I do not see the lunch trucks park overly long anywhere. They are there during the times workers are available to purchase food and are gone early enough to be out of the traffic pattern.
Please leave the trucks alone!

I am a 52 year-old lawyer and I have been eating at these trucks for 30 years. I usually refer to them, like everyone else, as“roach coaches,”but health department inspections have consistently shown them to be cleaner than the vast majority of restaurants and the quality of food is very good. And when I don’t have time for even fast food, grabbing a couple of tacos or a burrito at a truck is a much-appreciated alternative to starvation.

I oppose the ban, particularly because these trucks are a large part of the cultural background of LA. If the restaurants can’t compete, too bad.

I do not go to the Taco truck near my job that often, but I would hate to see it go! The food is good, quick and inexpensive. I like having options for lunch. How can they expect the taco truck to pack up and move every hour! How can it be safe to drive with hot grease or a hot stove top? Isn’t their a law about that?!? If the law passes and they have to move every hour I think that they should be allowed to stay longer in area’s where there are no near by restaurants! Has anyone considered the construction&amp;out door workers whose clothes are dirty and do not want to go inside a restaurant at lunch time????

Dear Supervisor Gloria Molina,

You should not be be spending my tax money trying to pass laws to benefit a few restaurants. I believe that the US is supposedly a free market economy. If these restaurants want more business, make better food or lower their prices. Using the City Council to force taco trucks out of business is wrong. Plus, shouldn’t you be supporting laws that promote SAVING GAS, not wasting it forcing both the taco trucks and their customers to driving thousands of extra miles trying to find each other?

You are PUBLIC SERVANTS and must not cater solely to the special business interests with permanent addresses you mostly associate with. Serve the public by letting food trucks serve us, anywhere, anytime, for as long as there is demand. Your duty is to expedite the public interests. Not only repeal absurdly punitive laws for merely parking over 30 minutes, rather issue parking time limit exemptions to food trucks consistent with public convenience and safety.

Part of the luxury of living in Southern California is that we have a plethora of places that offer good, quality Mexican food. One of these places is the mobile taco truck. The owners are just trying to make a living. Even though I love King Taco, the taco truck (whichever one it may be) offers food that is just as good if not cheaper in price. I wish the Burrito&amp;Taco Nazis would get off their high horse and pass some worthwhile legislation that benefits the entire County. What do we want- TACO TRUCKS. When do we want‘em- NOW!

Guys who sell burritos aren’t criminals…it’s more the guys who sell Taco Bell……now that’s a gross crime if you ask me.
How did this even become an issue with the city? Is City Hall that bored?
This is yet another example of how the gentrification of our fair city is destroying the real LA…with more Downtown Condos/Lofts, getting rid of the Homeless, Taco Trucks….or anything that resembles a‘real city’.
This city of LA is supposed to be the land of opportunity….for any tax bracket….not just the“Bankers from Arizona”, or the“Loan Officer from Philly”, that immigrated here to try and fulfill that lifelong dream to be or look cool or hipster-like.
No offense to the LA newbie….but this isn’t your fake playground. This is my real city.
What’s next?
I will finally say that Taco Trucks are as American and as Angelino as the Ice Cream Man…….why don’t we throw the Ice Cream Man and his truck of iced sweets in jail too? What a bloody criminal….giving us all Diabetes and reminding us that yes we were all once little snotty nosed kids too.

Family member own a taco restaurant yet every night they bring out their“carrito”&amp;guess what we have all noticed? Yup…the“carrito”tacos are better than the restaurant tacos. Come on Ms. Molina or are you siding with the King becuase Hillary visited it? Do I see a conflict of interests here? Ok, I’m pissed…leave the taco trucks be!!!

Hey look I don’t have a problem with the trucks,
what I do have a problem with is the GANGS. I grew up in this old town 68 years ago,I lived with Mexican American people, and GOD in heaven knows the Brother loves all type Mexican food. Mrs. Molina no disrespect to you and your other members on the boards but, good quality food will sell itself. Now when you wanna take a vote on the GANGS count me in. In the meantime pass the Brother the hot sauce and salsa.

City of Los Angeles, you have been harassing street vending for decades. I’m sure there are other issues our tax dollars would be better spent debating. Affordable healthcare for all. Better education. Homelessness and poverty. The list is so long, it’s embarrassing. Taco trucks, like all street vendors, enrich our cities and should be encouraged, not hindered by petty regulations. Moving every hour would disrupt the trucks’customer basis, and would mean more time would be spent driving around than actually selling food. Less business = more hungry families at home = less time to spend with that family = further dissolving of the qualities of life we deem so important (that lead to all the“crime”this city is always“fighting”).

If you’re worried about health concerns, improve the standards for getting a taco truck license (is there such a thing) but PLEASE don’t abolish them! Especially with the economy how it is, are we going to destroy all chance of good, fast, cheap food in this town? PLEASE put your money into something else.

Making criminals out of ordinary people trying to make a living is the appropriate way to deal with this issue. Taco trucks provide affordable food to families and workers who cannot afford to dine at restaurants.

Gloria Molina’s response:

The changes to the ordinance allow vendors to remain in one location
in
a commercial zone for one hour, which is one-half hour longer than
permitted under the existing ordinance. Los Angeles County is not the
only jurisdiction that places time restrictions on vending; cities that
border the unincorporated areas have similar restrictions.

Although not everyone is pleased with this ordinance, please be aware
that sidewalk vending has never been permitted in Los Angeles County.
Our ordinance is a compromise that will allow vending in a manner that
protects the health and welfare of our residents, and respects the
needs
of our business community.

I appreciate your taking the time to express your views. If you
require
additional assistance with a County-related matter, please do not
hesitate to contact my office at (323) 881-4601. Thank you.

I cannot believe that the supervisors have given in to the restaurant owners who are so afraid of the taco trucks. The best meals I have ever had have been from a taco truck in East L.A. It is part of the culture and it is abhorrent that the supervisors would try to eliminate such a time worn tradition.

I was born and raised in Los Angeles. Taco Trucks are a part of of this upbringing. I thought Los Angeles was becoming a city of cultural note, one to rival New York. Taking away taco trucks is just one step to making Los Angeles“un-Los Angeles.”Do these bricks and mortar restaurants really think it’s the taco trucks that are biting into their businesses? Did anyone stop to think that maybe it’s our struggling greater economy? I would hate to see what happened to NY happen to LA. We should preserve and promote the identity of LA rather than trying to clean it up and make it some urban Disneyland.

My Hubby took me to the one thats near the Food for Less in Highland park/Eagle Rock after the Dodger/Red Sox game that was at the Coliseum and it was very tasty. Just leave them alone, they are not hurting anyone. Thats all i am going to say.

I’m no libertarian, but this strikes me as a pretty clearly-defined blow to one’s Constitutional freedom of industry. Molina had better have a mountain of evidence that the taco trucks actually hurt local businesses, and that complaints from residents aren’t more than the usual yammering from elderly curmudgeons who are just looking for a reason to complain, because if she doesn’t, then there’s really no legal basis for her argument.

Also, taco trucks are made of delicious and awesome. WTF’s her problem?!

I understand that capitalism requires limits and adjustments to function, but this is just an example of a powerful group (brick and mortar restaurants) abusing their influence to tip the scales in their favor. If taco trucks are outcompeting“normal”restaurants in some areas, it is because they are providing services that cannot be found at their non-mobile competitors. Taco trucks are still governed by the laws in California pertaining to food service. If they have found a way to obey those laws while cutting costs, more power to them. This new legislation represents an artificial and anti-competitive adjustment to the food industry in Los Angeles county. It serves to benefit only the stationary restaurant owners, removing free choice from the residents of Los Angeles, while simultaneously damaging an important element of Southern California culture. This unfair law must be repealed.

Certain Taco Trucks had developed reputations at specific locations, so it would be a disservice to the truck owners and the patrons to keep them on the move. If the trucks are licensed and registered they should be allowed to stay in any spot for as long the parking restrictions will allow. Los Angeles needs to support these mobile entrepreneurs, not further restrict them.

Sunday night stopped by the truck at Venice&amp;Sepulveda. Three generations were working inside: Grandma, husband&amp;wife and granddaughter, maybe twelve or thirteen - who manned the window, her English being the best. The customers were a mix of Latinos. blacks, whites, Asians, Iranians, etc. the whole mix that makes L.A. great, all brought together by great tacos at buck a piece. Now political hacks at city hall want to outlaw this entry-level entrepreneurial spirit? Can’t let it happen. We’ll get Gloria Molina and her ilk who’re beholden to developers out of office office before we let that happen.

When you think of Los Angeles, you think character and diversity of cultures. Removing taco trucks off the streets will not“clean up the streets”but rob it of the aspects that set L.A. apart from the rest. L.A. is so distinguished thanks in part to the little businesses that color our streets. If you want to clean up the streets of Los Angeles, how about providing more shelters to the homeless and greater punishments for those that permeate our walls with gang signs. Leave the poor taco trucks alone, they contribute to your salaries after all.
 Gerard Pacificar signed,

Restaurant owners should factor their operating costs in relation to competition from the trucks. The competition is not necessarily unfair in that restaurant owners could have chosen alternative locations for their businesses. Whatever the case, some compromise should be worked out between the trucks, the restaurant owners, and the city.

As for the $1000 fine and misdemeanor with threat of jail time, come on! That’s punitive and demonstrates bad blood on the part of the supervisor and restaurant owners.

Don’t be too hard on Gloria Molina. If she’s doing a good job for her district, then that’s good. Help her forge a compromise.

The Taco Trucks is a prime example of the American entrepreneurial spirit. Laborers, blue-collars workers, the homeless, and people in a hurry don’t necessarily want to go to a sit-down restaurant. The taco truck ideally serves their needs. Therefore, they provide an important service.

If they are taking business away from restaurants, taco trucks should not be allowed withing one block of such restaurants. But they shouldn’t be prohibited from staying parked any more than an autombile. When it’s uneconomical to stay parked because a lack of business, the taco truck will move on.

BTW, I grew up in the days of the Good Humor truck, the Helms Bakery truck, the fish monger’s truck and the ice truck. I miss really miss those days.

Taco trucks are a good thing. I mean it doesnt get much better than a burito from a truck right? I eat from a red burito truck every day and will be very disappointed if I have to chase it down every 30 min to get my food. Exercise and carne asasa don’t really mix so lets hope this thing doesn’t get passed.

This requirement would affect the livelihood of many hard working people as well affect the economy. This means that taco truck owners, employees would make less money, which means that truck owners and employees would have less money to spend affecting their buying power, and thus affecting the local economy. Is the requirement something you really want to pass when it has so many negative externalities? Supervisor Molina, you should definitely rethink this mandate.

Taco trucks has a unique role aside from the brick&amp;mortar stands. They often cater to people of limited funds, or people of limited time who can’t venture too far away from their worksite to look for food. Not only that, taco trucks embody the small entrepreneurial spirit that keeps our local economy growing, just like the brick&amp;mortar places. The fill a practical need and are part of our cultural landscape.

Los Angeles County should not penalize taco trucks because they are part of the regions changing economy, demographic, and transportation choices. Many low-income residents live on tight budget and can’t afford sit down restaurants so they spend their money on inexpensive, accessible food. Buying food from street vendors is a common practice in many urban centers across the globe.
This behavior pattern has been transported to LA where many Latino immigrants live, yet we have failed to modify street vending policies to support the needs of this rapidly growing population. In addition, many of these taco trucks owners locate their truck where there is pedestrian movement, and transit because many low-income residents do not drive, and have parked their cars because now a gallon of milk is just as expensive as a gallon of gasoline. Local elected should work on policies that promote economic opportunities for all people.

I went to work at age 17. Our factories were served by the taco and burrito trucks. Without them many of us would have gone hungry. The blasting of their horns told us it was break and lunch time not the bosses. Molina is just another politician on the take. Molina and cohorts have the time and money to go to fancy restaurants and over indulge very often at the taxpayers expense.

Taco truck is not a hispster trend. It’s an important part of the culture for many people in LA. I’ve been visiting the same taco truck for years–it’s my favorite place to eat, I cant get that same kind of food anywhere else. And furthermore, even if taco trucks were taken off the streets, my money would not go to any“brick and mortar”restaurants. We would truly be suffering a great loss if taco trucks no longer populated our late-night streets.

I support all street vendors (especially Taco Truck vendors) that try to earn a living and supply a good meal for less than you can get at an established restaurant. It is not right to target one group while allowing their opposition to charge outrageous prices for food that for the most part is not any better than you could get off a taco truck. I now live in Northen California and purchase tacos the same way I did when I lived in East Los Angeles. In fact, on my way to work this morning a taco truck was pulled over on the freeway shoulder to replace a flat tire. Three motorists including myself pulled over to assist. We talked as we all helped in replacing the tire. I explained what was going on in Los Angeles with the new taco truck regulations and all were appauled. I was in Los Angeles last weekend and found out about the law. It made me feel as if I, personally, am being targeted for what I believe is somewhat of a daily cultural event that strengthens communities. Something most restaurants cannot accomplish. Power to the People.

As a Chicano from East Los Angeles / Boyle Heights, I find it incomprehensible that this law would have ever been considered, let alone passed. With all the social, political and economic issues confronting us these days; joblessness, homelessness, growing gang and drug related violence, police brutality and racial profiling and growing anti-Chicano/Mexican sentiment etc. THIS is the cause Gloria Molina chooses to take up? If it’s about cleaning up our streets, how about tackling the gang situation, graffiti or fixing all the pot holes in the lower income areas of Los Angeles? Shame on you Gloria Molina.

Don’t the county supervisors have more pressing issues to address than how long a taco truck is located in one spot. Most of these trucks with a few exceptions are not directly competing against established brick and mortar restaurants. The restaurants who do complain may need to reexamine their menus. If the food is good I would eat at a restaurant over a truck all day long. La Estrella is one of the best tacos and burritos in Highland Park. Memo to supervisors lets focus on some real and legitimate issues this city faces. La Estrella and the other small business owners are just another easy target.

The supervisors wrote the wrong law. If they wanted to help brick-and-mortar restaurants out, why not word the law, so that taco trucks can’t park within 300 feet of a restaurant, the length of a football field? And they should send a message to restaurant owners,“Compete! If a taco truck can take away all your customers, then your restaurant wasn’t so good. Or, try competing on price. Create a takeout version of carne asada tacos and price it lower than the taco trucks. *And* put a“Cold Beer”sign in the window.

If you did that, then the taco truck owners could be next to complain to the Board of Supervisors, asking the Board to ban restaurants from putting any signs in their windows that might draw customers away from their taco truck!

My own take on this would favor competition, put some distance between the taco truck and the restaurant, so that the taco truck isn’t unfairly getting to a restaurant customer before the restaurant can, and allow the restaurant to put signs up discribing competing products and the advantages that the restaurant has over the taco truck, like a liquor license (margarita anyone?).

when an elected official engages in activities that are contrary to the wishes of the people she represents, it appears that change is necessary.

As a voter and as an east los angeleno, i feel that gloria molina has become out of touch with the eastside citizenry (due, perhaps, to too many years in office).

what is culture? what is east l.a. culture?

…a complete answer to either of these questions must include some reference to the food that We (the community) eat.

Shame on Gloria Molina, and shame on anyone who supports this ignoble endeavor.

If the issue is safety or health, then our officials should create legislation to that effect;

But the powers that be should not CRIMINALIZE east los angeles’exercise of FREE ENTERPRISE–Nothing would be more un-American.

Let us bow our heads in memory of the Puritan work ethic–upon which this country was built–for clearly (if this regulation takes effect) there is no longer any room for hard work and success…at least not for Us on the eastside of town.

light a candle at your local church, for a holocaust is upon us…NO, this is not an obvious massacre, but it is a ravaging of a culture.

Little by little,‘big brother’(gloria molina, et al.) is stripping away the cherished elements of our culture…only instead of calling the process by its true name“POGROM”, the powers that be have chosen to call it“GENTRIFICATION”.

this is a dark time, indeed.

holdfast, ye children of the sun, for‘tomorrow’there shall be a reckoning…where will you be counted:

will you be the uncle tom who sits silently by his computer, writing comments to his friends on myspace,

or will you join me in my efforts to dismantle this juggernaut of oppression, a.k.a. Gloria Molina,‘the Leviathan.’

I think the taco trucks are such a part of LA culture that to think of the streets and neighborhoods without them is to make them empty of a vital part of our lives. I always feel if there’s a taco truck open and people around the area is a little safer. I don’t know that I would patronize a restaurant if I were hungry, where a quick stop for a burrito or such would…and might make me come back to that area again to visit or shop.
To stay in business, a taco truck has to develop relationships, know the customers so they keep coming back. How many restaurants invest the personal touch and meet people face to face everyday?
I can understand better controls on those who litter the area or other misdemeanors, but the new law and fine are really unjust and unnecessary. Yes some restaurants (brick&amp;mortar) may benefit, but what about the people who WANT to eat at the taco trucks?
Good luck SAVE OUR TACO TRUCKS!

Your own health department says that per capita, the taco trucks are healthier and cleaner than taquerias. Your own police department says there is no demonstrable link between public safety and the trucks. Poor night-shift workers need to eat too, and we don’t all want hamburgers; do you only represent the middle class and rich Los Angelenos? What about the rest of us?

Since there is no evidence behind what you’ve done, it is therefore irrational. And an irrational person, making dogmatic decisions that only benefit brick&amp;mortar restaurant owners.

We know who butters YOUR bread, Gloria Molina, and it sure ain’t a tortilla. You’re as white as they come, and that goes for your lily-livered support of“your community,”which it turns out you don’t give a rat’s ass for.

To whom it may concern,
A $1000.00 fine is outrageous. This is a disservice to many communities. Taco trucks are usually the only available food source at odd times of the day or night. As a sober driver I have taken intoxicated friends to various taco trucks late at night so they may eat and therefore have food in their system to help absorb alcohol. This is not a joke, because of this new law I may not be able to find a taco trucks from one hour to the next. We need our taco trucks and we do not want innocent business people thrown in jail because of multiple fines. This needs to change! I am a Los Angeles native and I believe this is an absurd law.

This new law shows plainly how out of touch our local politicians are. It’s safe to say that they could care less about the prices the average person pays for food and gas in this town. Regardless, we’re here because we love being here and the minimal food culture that we have in this town is directly related to cheap ethnic food. It’s a symbol of our beloved town, just like Dodger Dogs, In N Out Burger and Phillipe’s. The pupusa and the guarache and the big corn cob on a stick embodies everything about us true Angelenos, as well as the spirit of countless people who have come here to live in the past decade…Our will to mingle with other races(something that L.A. has not always been known for), and also our innate wonderlust which drives us towards new experiences in food we wouldn’t otherwise have. Gloriawould rather have us super size it.

I understand that restaurants resent the rent-free status of taco trucks…but keep in mind that taco trucks sell only very cheap food items, and cannot make nearly the profit that high-end restaurants can, especially considering prices from alcohol&amp;bar drinks, which taco trucks cannot serve!

These food trucks have a been a part of my life as long as I have been able to forge memories. They have been with this city even longer. The people who run these trucks are hard working people, laboring in cramped spaces feeding the working hungry of Los Angeles. Who would benefit from this bill. Deffidently not the thousands of patrons who choose to frequent these mobile eateries. It seems the only people who would benefit from this would be corporate reseraunts and those who can’t stand hard working competition. The bully in the yard will always beat away at the defenseless.

They want to strip us of an ability to get an inexpensive, great tasting, and fulfilling meal and keep people that need jobs in business during a slowing economy. Taco trucks are a part of LA culture and to rip that apart from the very people that have contributed to building this culture for so long is stripping a part of their identity and making it an LA past-time.

As a taco eating white guy, I’ve seen firsthand the goodwill that comes when I walk up and order my tacos at 3 am. Whether there are gang members or graveyard shift workers, everyone is equal at a taco cart. Order prevails, and although they are often in“unsafe”neighborhoods, I happily and uneventfully eat at my favorite taco trucks.

I wonder why Gloria Molina is against taco trucks? Is she“too good”to eat at a taco truck? Or does she only approve of Jack in the Box at 3 am? I’ve never gotten sick from a taco truck, but I sure have from a couple of restaurants. Gloria, if you come with me, I’ll drive and buy you one of every taco. Call me!

Not only are Taco Trucks of immense cultural significance in the areas they serve, they provide essential services not otherwise offered. The claim about them taking away business simply holds no water: it’s called the free market! Competition among businesses is one of the most treasured features of our economy. Jail sentences for not moving every hour are ridiculous and unfair. A small fine, understandable, but considering such an act a misdemeanor is excessive punishment. But whatever arguments are made, for or against the cause, can you really justify legislating away one of the most beloved features of the greater L.A. area?

This a very unfair law that singles out Latinos in general. I am further appalled that Gloria Molina, a US born latina, is promoting this issue. What really needs to be done is to overhaul the immigration system, so that immigrants already in the US can get their papers in order and simply settle down to a normal life like everyone else. Besides, no one has said a word as to whether some of the taco trucks are managed by US born latinos. It makes a difficult, complex situation all the more difficult and complex.

When we were students at USC Medical School campus, the Taco Truck was our only alternative for food other than bringing our own in or eating at the cafeteria. There were no brick and mortar stores that could provide the convenience of being within a short walk away from the campus. At times, we only had 15 minutes for lunch; a drive to the Jack in the Box down the street was out of the question.

Taco Trucks provide a valid service to the community. Let free market forces dictate how businesses survive and thrive. Otherwise, innovation in providing goods and services will languish if protection is always given to the lobby with the most money and political clout.

Taking out the lunch trucks of sidewalks of Los Angeles streets, is not only unfair but extortion to small family own business that pay taxes just like any other restaurants in the Los Angeles area, with this in mind I believe its not fair plus lunch trucks help the economy in general. Gloria Molina should focus in other problems in L.A County not lunch trucks where middle class people try to make a living in an honest and decent way. We have to keep in mind that this new law will affect people, in the community and the lunch truck business in general. This law does have to be repealed for justice for all members of the community.

And now what they just feel like terminating all taco truck workers,“why”for there own sole purpose, cause they have nothing better to do, then to knock down hard working mexicans, maybe they can’t afford to buy a restaurant so they utilize their resources, whats wrong with this nation it has never been a problem before for people to make an honest living, weather you buy food from a restaurant or a taco truck it’s food and nobody’s complaining. I could see if they weren’t making any money and just taking up space than ok, but they are making money ther like any other business so why should there business be any less? Let them provide for their family let them do their jobs.???

Taco trucks have some of the best, and most authentic mexican food in the United States. They are a part of LA culture! Why target taco trucks? Are the local restaurants clamoring to get rid of competition? Is there a sudden rise in food safety concerns? (No one I know of died from taco truck food) Or does someone think this is actually a substantial way of keeping down the number of illegals?

Las loncheras dan trabajo a familias, es mejor que se combata a los delincuentes que si nos molestan en las calles, que a estos negociantes que se gana la vida honradamente,ellos los loncheros nos brindan un manjar que son los tacos y las tortas, a precios accesibles, ahora con la crisis economica ya no podemos ir a restaurantes, la lonchera que se pone en mi calle Par K View hace los mejores tacos de Los Angeles, ademas es muy limpio el señor y no ensucia la calle, ahi a demas no molesta a nadie y tampoco afecta a otros negocios, debes considerar cambios a tu legislacion porque no es justo que les digas que se pongan una hora en cada lugar, nostros los que no tenemos coche no podemos anadarlos buscando, es mejor que combatas a los negocios de drogas que hay en los aprques y hasta en las calles eso si y no dañes a los loncheros.

Los vendedores están haciendo un servicio a la comunidad. Qué pena que usted no aprecia el esfuerzo que hacen. Pero si lo único que le incomoda es la“imagen”eso significa que usted se encuentra economicamente estable. Qué bueno que usted no tiene que luchar por el pan de cada día. Y como al parecer su solicitud ha ocacionado reacciones ojalá pudiera hacer lo mismo en asuntos de drogadicción, o en terminar con la guerra, por ejemplo, que sí afectan realmente a la sociedad y en lo que el gobierno debe concentrarse por el bien de su país.

Dear, Gloria Molina,

There are times that we make decisions that we do not realize the consequence of them, an unfortunately this is one of them. Have you ask your self what is going too happened with having the loncheras be moving every hours, what is going to happened with the restroom issue, how are you going to monitor where each Lonchera is located since they have to be moving you and Department of Health will loose the control. Well I think that is time that you for once you take a day and spend it with a Lonchera to realize the hard work they put into those tacos and that they are only trying to work hear. I believe that if people do not go and eat at restaurant is not due to the Loncheras is due to the economy that we are leaving in. If the restaurant would lower their prices on meals maybe people will alter and visit restaurants also.

Tacos, Burritos, Mariscos, Tortas. I have my share of catering truck spot i visit…Broadway&amp;Figueroa, Vermont and 8th, Alvarado before Glendale Blvd. , Main and Gage, Vermont and Beverly…and so on. These people provide a good experience at a great price and not once have I seen some of the allegations against them(the trucks) carried out. Gloria Molina , a great politician with merit in her work dropped the ball this time, I mean 1k as a fine with Jail time? Whats next , jail time for teachers?…”So when she became an elected official, Molina understood that the public treasury originates from
working people’s hard-earned paychecks”…This is what is stated in her Bio available to all- http://molina.lacounty.gov/PDFs/About%20GM-BIO.pdf

Dear government officials:
You need to start worrying about more important things like crime rate, drop out rates, etc. You are way to preoccupied with“TACO TRUCKS”. Now that’s just ridiculous. So what’s going to be next, a fine for all fast food restaurants? If you give me the argument that it’s because of health reasons, you know fast food restaurants sell food that are way less healthier than tacos. This is just ridiculous.

Save Taco Trucks. I do not see a point in putting restrictions on industrious people who work hard and honestly for a living. Put your energy and thoughts on finding better solutions to our deficit and budget cuts. Putting restrictions on trucks will produce less revenue for the state of California, thus making the deficit deeper. This is not the solution to your problems, this is adding to the problems California is already facing.

NOT THAT IT ONLY DOESN’T TASTE GOOD BUT FROM THE WAY THE FOOD IS HANDLED, PREPARED, AND FINALLY SERVED….DID ANYONE GUESS??? WELL I HOPE NOBODY IS SURPRISED BUT MY WORK EXPERIENCE COMES FROM“FINE”DINING RESTAURANTS THAT ARE LOCATED IN“FINE”CITIES LIKE BEVERLY HILLS…..HMMM….NEED I MENTION MORE?? I THINK NOT!!! DO I HAVE WORK EXPERIENCE FROM LUNCH TRUCKS? I SURE DO!!!! AND THE FOOD SERVED AT THESE TACO TRUCKS IS ONE OF THE FRESHEST, WELL HANDLED AND VERY AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I KNOW THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT PROPER FOOD HANDLING NOR ABOUT IT BEING A HEALTH HAZARD OR DID YOU (GLORIA MOLINA) REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE (THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TACO TRUCK FOOD) ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOUR BEST INTEREST IS OUR HEALTH?
