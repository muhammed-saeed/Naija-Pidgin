An 



An ACCOUNT 

Of the Hospital of 

St. MARY MAGDALEN 

Near SCROBY 

IN 

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, 

By JOHN SLACKS, 

Master of that Hospital. 

From a MS. in the Hands of THOMAS FREWIN, 
of LiNCOLH&apos;s-Inn, Esq; 



Dr. THOROTON&apos;s Antiquities of NOT- 
TINGHAMSHIRE, Land. 1677. fol. pag. 
478. 

rTFIE Moretons did found an Hospital in the uttermost edge 
-* of the Parish [of CSjaitoorfy in jf9otting|&gt;amQ)irc] near 
autreg Town in Jpotfefljite, to which there is also a Chapel 
yet standing, wherein they of the Family have used to be buried, 
and amongst the rest there lies Katherin (daughter of John 
Boun, Esquire, by his first wife, and so) half sister of Gilbert 
Boun, Sergeant at Law, who was widow of George Moreton, 
elder brother of the before named Robert [^Morcton^ who 
sold $atetoorrl&gt;[to Mr. William Saunderson,&apos;] which George 
died long before the said Anthony \_Morcton~^ his father, 
[who paid in Queen Elizabeth&apos;s time 3 s. 4 d. for half a 
Knight&apos;s Fee in tyartoortl), (sometime Henry lir&apos;set&apos;s) and 
wasted the Estate.] These Moretons bore Quarterly 
Gules and Ermine, the frrst and last charged zsilh each a 
Goate&apos;s Head Erased Arg. 



( 391 ) 




To the most Reverend Father in God, 
Richard, by the &apos; Devine Provi- 
dence of God now Lord Archbp. 
of Yorke, his Grace, Primate of 
England and Metropolitane, 
John Slacke, Master of that poore 
Hospitall of Saint Mary Magda- 
len juxta Barvtrie, wisheth all 
happiness and eternall blessed- 
nes. 

T was your Grace&apos;s speciall charge 
att B aw trie, that I should make 
a Booke, and therin sett downe 
the true state of that Hospitall, viz. 

1 . I Vho was the Founder ? 

2. For whome it was founded ? 

3. What Maintenance doth bclonge thereunto ? 




Sic. Sic. 



4. Who 



392 Account of flit Hospital of 

4. W7w is Patron thereof? 

5. How, and by whome, it was passed as a Con- 
cealment, and given to Hugh Millar, Foo&apos;-manto 
the late Queene Elizabeth of famous memory, and so 
passed under the Great Seale t 

6. How, and by whome, it was reversed, uppon 
a solemne hearinge in thexchecquer, uppon 1 aincient 
Evidences and good Testemony, before the Lord Bur* 
ley &apos;then Lord Treasurer , and the Barrons there f 
by the meanes of a John, late ArchbyshopofYorke, 
and John Cooper, then Master, and Predecessor, be- 
fore me, of that Hospital? 

It was decreed, that the Graunt from the late 
2uee?ie Elizabeth to her servant, Hugh Myller, 
should be reversed, and allso it was decreed, that 
that Hospitall should continue as in former tynie, 
as more at large may, and doth, appeare by the 
said Decree, examined by Thomas Fanshaw, her 
Majestie&apos;s Remembrancer in thexchecquer. 

Yet after the death of Mr. Cooper, my Prede- 
cessor, it pksed the Lord Archbyshop J Tobie, to col- 
late that Hospitall on me John Slacke, but was re- 
sisted, in the Possession by Thomas Robinson, Tho- 
mas Shorte, John Noble, John Bradley, with others, 
who had formerly combynedwith James Brewster, 
late Master there, but was deprived from that Ho- 
spitall, in regard of Combination and Concealement. 
I repayred to Mr. Houlder, Prebend of Suthwell 



1 Sic. * John Piers. &apos; Tobie Matthew. 

and 



St. Mary J\Iagd. near Banlrc. 393 

and Executor to Mr. Cooper, with whome I found 
out these Pleadings and the Decree ; and some from 
Anthony JWorton, Esq;. Thereuppon I exhibited a 
Bill against those, ivho opposed mf in the x Pocession, 
and., uppon a Motion, repeatmgc the Decree, for- 
merly made at the hearinge in thexchecquer, there 
ivas granted a Subpcena, to cause them to shew good 
cause, why the Possessions and Decree, formerly made 
and established, should not continue. And, upon 
theire Answer, in Hillarie terme, octavo Jacobi, 
in thexchequer Chamber, by Sir Laurence Tanfteld 
Lord chief e Barron, and the rest of the Barrons, it 
was there decreed againe, that the former Decree 
should stand, and is ordered, that both my selfe f 
and my Successors there after me, should quietly en. 
joy the samej and for thai purpose the Courtegraunted 
an Injunction against any that should molest me. 
Lastly, the Courte did enjoyne the Auditor and Re- 
c tmr for Yorkcshicre, to pay unto -me such Pen- 
tions, as were arreared and stayed in his hands, as 
by the said Decree, entred into this Booke, it doth 
appcare. So that this Booke may give both Dire- 
ctions and Instructions, * of any Ques. ion should here- 
after arise cunccrniuge the Premisses. And thus I 
take my have from Cantlcy the II th of August 1(535. 
At your Grace&apos;s Command

Concerninge the Founder. 

( T doth appeare to be Robert Morton of 
Bawtrie, Esqr. who founded the Chap- 
pell, the Mansion-Howse for the Mais- 
ter of that Hospitall, with other HowseS 
as a Barne of tower Bayes, a Stable, a 
Dove-coate, and a Gate-howse, but most of them ruin* 
ated, defaced, and pulled dovvne, arid carried away, by 
Thomas Robinson, Thomas Short, and the rest, who 
combyned in the Concealement. 

That there belongeth to the said Hospital!, wherein 
it standeth, a Close, allso a Close-More in Scatworth 
carr, called Preist-Close, one other Close, called Lane- 
e nd-Close, with 15 Roods of Meddow in Scroobie Med- 
dowes, all which were the Gift of the Founder. 

It doth, moreover, appeare, that this Roberte Mor- 
ton gave unto the Prior and &apos; Coment of St. Oswauld 
250 1. who, to gratifie that Gift, gave unto the Master 
of St. Marie Magdalen, then founded by Roberte Mor- 
ton, eight Markcs, as appereth by the Indenture of the

Now followes the Confession of Thomas Robinson 
before the high Commissioners at Yorke : 

About May last I agreed with one Will. Ballard, of 
&apos; Lincoln&apos;s-Inne, Gent, beinge deputie to Sir Edward 
&quot; Stanley, havinge a Graunt for Concealeraents, for the 
&quot; Summe of xii li. to have the Hospital! convey&apos;d to me 
e &apos; by Fee-Farme, but before Sir Edward Stanley&apos;s Booke 
&quot; passed, one William Typper passed a Booke, wherein&lt;c William Ballard got him to passe his Hospital!, and 
&quot; tooke his hand to passe it to him by Fee-Farme. 

&quot; I brought for Ralfe Dames, James Brewster and Ed- 
&quot; ward Watteson a Subpoena, to shew how they held rt, 
&quot; and they yeildinge, I entred to the Howse and Grounds,&lt;e and sold mine Intrest for about an hundred Markes, if 
&quot; that I could obtaine the Pension, being 5 li. yerely to 
&quot; the Maistcr of the Hospital!, whereof I have received 
&quot; xv li. and I have a Bill of his hand for 49. li. bond in 

&quot;an 



404; Account of the Hospital of 

&quot; an hundred for the payment therof. The Howse and the 
&quot; Particulars be past, but, I thinke, not the Pension, for 
&quot; which I must make Allowance, and it hath cost me in 
&quot; goinge to London for my Assurance above 20 li. be- 
&quot; sides my Charges and Short&apos;s att Yorke, and as yet I 
f( have no Assurance from Typper, but from Ballard, be- 
&quot; cause of Welbecke and Brewster, because they would 
&quot; buy it, and are some what a kynne to Mr Typper; but&lt;{ Mr Typper was commaunded to lett me have my As- 
11 surance at the next Tearme, or to shew some good 
** cause, why I should not have it. 

&quot; I am bound in an 100 li. to Thomas Short, to war- 
tl rant him this zlssurance, and for a Pawne allso I have 
&quot; delivered to Thomas Short my Uncle Robinson&apos;s Will, 
&quot; wherin I made him a Letter of Atturney, to sue for 
&quot; the same, with a Bond of 200 li. for Performance of 
the Will. If I may be freed from Thomas Short for 
* e my Pawnes and Bonds, I would be contented with 
u my Money, if he will be contented. 

&quot; By me Thomas Robinson. 

The Confession of Thomas Short btfore the high 
Commissioners att Yorke. 

1 &quot; Thomas Robinson was att bord at the Hospitall 
&quot; nere Bawtrie with Mr. Brewster, for one Quarter, about 
&quot; Easter last, duringe which tyme Mr. Brewster moved 
&quot; the said Robinson, to procure the Queene&apos;s Right of 
&quot; the Hospitall of Bawtrie to the said Brewster &apos;s use, and 
&quot; told him be should have 30 li. for his paynes. 

2 &quot; About May day last Mr. Brewster and Tho. Ro- 
** bin son did disagree, &apos; and went from Mr. Brewster&apos;s 

&apos;Sic.&lt;f bowse, 



St. Mary Magd. near Bautre. 405 

&quot; howse, and went to gett the Hospitall for himselfe at 
&quot; London, and being there did procure a Bill of &apos; vocante 
&quot; from one Ballard, deputie to Mr. Stanhopp, as he said,&lt;f and came and entred into the Hospitall the last Sum- 
&quot; mer. 

3 &quot; The last * Sumer Mr. Welbecke, Father-in-law to 
t( Mr. Brewster, offred Thomas Robinson, as he said, a 
&quot; 100. Markes for his Intrest, which Summe he refused. 

4 &quot; About Michaelmas last the said Robinson did lelt 
tl to me Thomas Short, the said Hospitall, with thap- 
&quot; purtnances, for a yere for 4 ft&apos;, being worth vi. li. in&lt;e the yeare, and promised me, when he gott his Assu- 
te ranee, I should have the Purchase therof for 60 li. up- 
&quot; pon conditions, that I should lend him as much Mo- 
&quot; ney, as then I could, whereuppon I lent him 15 li. and 
&quot; tooke his Bond for the payment of the said Summe of 
&quot; 15 li. I borrowed it of John Noble, not tellinge him 
&quot; for what cause I borrowed the same. 

&quot; By me Thomas Short.

&apos; which, since the same was past, I have understood, that 
&quot; the Patronage therof belongeth unto your Lordshipp, 
&quot; which since I knew I have made stay therof in mj 
*&apos; owne hands, by order from Mr. &apos; Freeascue, for that one 
c&lt;Robinson hath sought to have had the same from me, 
&quot; to whome I minde not to passe it, nor to any other 
** without your Lordship&apos;s consent ; and what your Lord- 
&quot; ship&apos;s Determination is herein, if it might please you, I 
*&apos; would gladly understand, whose honourable direction I 
&quot; mind to follow. Here was one Ballard, who very earnest- 
&quot; ly solicited the matter to my Lord Treasurer and Mr. 
&quot;*Fortscue, by whose meanes the stay came, and after 
&quot; the stay made by them, Robinson found meanes to 
Ct procure my Lord Chancellor&apos;s Letters to me for the 
&quot; assuringe the same to him, which in like manner I have 
&quot; refused to do ; Therfore I shall entreat your good 
&quot; Lordship to direct me some Course herein, and I will 
&quot; not faile, but performe it. Thus restinge at your 
u Lordship&apos;s Commands, most humbly I take my leave, 
&quot; from my howse in Aldersgate Street, the 3 of April

4. This was a Roman Conquest over Cangi^ and it 
could be no other. For the Saxons com pleated their 
conquest at &apos; SDeljacam in Glocester-shire, the Deanes 
theirs at 25atl)e, and the Normans theirs at Battle SLbty 
in Sussex. The Cangi did * agmen carpere, (i. e.) se- 
lect and collect a great multitude of the ablest of their 
militia against the Romanes (according to my conje- 
cture) into the toppe of jjiortort ^tU, within a Mile of 
Conqtieft, fortified it with a very strong Dike and Ram- 
pire, made a Sallieport, and a broad deep Avenue on 
the North side of the Hill, extending directly towards 
ConqttCft, by which they might inviseblely and sudden- 
ly issue out, and fall on the Romans there at their plea- 
sure. But it seems, all this availed them nothing. For 
a tradition of the Nortonians intimates, that they were 
miserably routed, (viz.) that a very great Heap of dead 
Mens Bodies lay uuburied at the Foot of the said Hill, of 
whose Corruption a Serpent was generated 8 , which de- 
voured living Men, and it seems that their Ancestors be- 
lieved this as their Creed, in the Place whereof, in the 
Roode Lofte in their Church, the Effigies of this Ser- 
pent is curiously carved, and painted, as having 4 the 
nether Parts of a Man to the Navell, the Man lifting up 
his Hands and Eyes to Heaven, and with open Mouth

But yet this story may intimate thus much in general], 
that there was a great Battel and Slaughter, that some 
monstrous creature (though not so great) was generated 
of the Corruption of the slaine, (Historic &apos; and Expe-

this Climate not so great as reported, yet great enough

phies, Lawrell and navall Crownes, and other triumphall 
ornaments, ascending the Capitoll Staires on his Knees, 
his Son in Law Pompcius and Syllanus supporting him 
on either Side.

whole Valley, extending from ^auiUOIt to HpfctJiarU, 
fetOgumber, faliatCfjett, #c. in which is very probable 
the Romane Armie, having conquered the Cangi as afore- 
said, some Partie of them quartered to guard and defend, 
what they had wonne, against the Rebellion of the Na- 
tives, and Invasion of Forriners, especially against the 
Silures of Southwales, which were yet unconquered. 
For although Tacitus saith, ortce apud Brigantes f discor- 
di(E retraxere ducem, certaine tumoults, sprang up among 
the Jirigantes of Yorkshire, drew back the Generall, yet 
he saith not, and his whole Armie, he was so sensible 
(no doubt) of the late Rebellion of the /cent, and now 
again of the Brigantes, that he would leave a sufficient 
guard behind him, and, therefore, this Vale is by Synecdo- 
che (the greater part of the whole) called HpuiatD *i

bility from one of the said SUltDtg of these Coynes. 

The most antient of these Coynes were sorts of Clau- 
dius Caesar&apos;s, and as they demonstrate him to be the Con- 
querour of the Cangi at COtiqueft, so the rest, Domi- 
tius Nero, Domitianus, Trajanus, Antoninus, Victorinus, 
Septimius Severus, Tacitus, Galienus, Aurelius, Aurelia- 
nus, Tetricus, Quintillus, Posthumus Sfc. yea almost all 
the Successors of Claudius about 600. Years, &apos;till the Ro- 
manes left this Hand, declare, that in these Maritime 
Parts, lying low, open and easie for Invasion, the Ro- 
mans kept guard, to prevent Rebellions and Invasions, 
and paid them with such Coynes as this, which was hid 
by them in such Vessels when they were all to returne 
home to defend their own native Country, but never re- 
turned to take them up. It is true, that in ancient Ages 
of the World, before the Invention of Money, Men were

But we must returne to the Roman Money, and speke a 
little of the Valuation thereof, and so leave it. The an- 
cient Roman Coyne z was called As, (not quasi, but) 
quia aes. At first an As consisted of a full Pound Weight. 
Afterward, in the Punick Warr, by reason of the scar- 
city of Money, they made of every Pound of Brass 6 of 
the larger Coynes, each valuing as that one at first. In 
the second Punick Warr 12 made of every Pound, and 
afterwards 24 of a Pound, of which six are our largest 3 Me- 
dalls, and made for honour and to continue the memorie 
of Princes, yet they were currant as the smaller, though 
all the same value, (viz.) an halfc penny farthing a peece, 
ye ten of them were the price of a sheepe, and * an 
100 the price of an ox. The next probable argument, 
to prove, that the 5 maritime Parts were gaurded by the 
Romans, as aforesaid, is, that they were as carefull to 
keep and preserve what they had conquered, as indu- 
strious to conquer, according to their maxirne : 

Non minor est virtus, qudm qucerere, part* tueri. 
Catch is a good dog, but hold fast is a better. 

And, therefore, when they had conquered all Britaine, 
Antoninus, who 6 began to rule as Emperor 7 about 40 
years after Claudius, divided, or caused to be divided, 
all Britaine into 16. Iters or Itineraries, each consisting 
of (12 and between that and 20) Mansions or Stations,

(i.e.) encamping Places, fortified with Dyke and Rara- 
pire, on the toppe of high and steepe Hills, the Re- 
maynes whereof are extant in many Places to this day. 
And the three Legions, (i. e.) about 1800 Romans Soul- 
diers, were distributed amongst these Itineraries and Man- 
sions, according to their discretion, to prevent Insur- 
rections and Invasions. 6 of &apos; these Mansions (with their 
subservient militarie Fortifications) were designed to 
guard the South Sea Coasts of this West Part of Bri- 
taine, (vis.) Isca * Danmoriorum, now Exeter, 3 Mori- 
dam now Seat on, Durno-varia now Dorchester , Vindo- 
gladia now H r inburne t Regnum now ftingwood, and 
Clausentum now Southampton. So likewise there were 
7 more of those Mansions to secure the South part of 
&quot;Wales against the Severne, as Abone now Avington, Ven- 
to, Silurum now Caertaent, * Esca Legionum now Car- 
Icon, Bomum now Bo-oerton, Nedus now Neath, Leu- 
carum now Loghor, and * Maridumum now Caermar- 
then, and can any man be so void of reason, as to think, 
that both those Sea Coasts ought so much (o be guarded 
and regaurded, and that this Sea Coast being either land, 
and of greater consequence to the Hand, should be alto- 
gether slighted ? No. For although Antoninus his Iti- 
neraries 6 mentions no mansions of his, or North Sea 
Coast, yet 7 there were many such fortified Places herea- 
bout, may be conjectured by the great multitude of An-

tude of Souldiers belonging to them, which were to re- 
ceive them as their pay in these parts. 

1. To these &apos; these may be added these 3 more Arguments 
briefly. First, that, during the whole time long of the 

jout Romans dominion here, there was never any Invasion of 

these maritime Parts, because, it seems, it was known 

2. how well they were fortyfied at that time. But shortly 
after the Romanes had relinquished Britaine, (riz.) in 
the time of the Anglo-Saxons, these maritime Parts were 
invaded 8 times. But the Natives, in all the invasions, 
stoutly defended themselves, and destroyed them which 
invaded them, and this they did by the help of the 
King&apos;s Armie, or Parties of the same, which was divided, 
in Australi * parte of the Seaverne, opportuna per loca, 
and the opportuna per /oca, I conceive, were those, and 
the like Gards, Heads, Torrs, Burrowes and Castles afore- 
said. And this will more clearly appear by the circum- 
slances of the said 8 Invasions and Repulses, as they are 
described by authentick Historians, some of them living 
and writing in, and some shortly after, the time these 
things were done. Seaven of the 8 Invasions on these 
maritime Parts were made some in the Reigne of King 
3 Alfred, and the rest betwene that time and the Nor- 
man Conquest, which was Anno Domini 1066. And, 
therefore, it will be requisite to declare the condition of 
King Alfred and this Kingdome, as it was in the begin- 
ning of his Reigne, for the better understanding of these 
Invasions and Repulses afterward. 

The Danes having subdued the greater part of this 
Kingdome, before the begining of King Alfred&apos;s reighn,

Hie first nine years thereof he strove, with that little 
power left him, to recover from them all that was left, 
but all in vaine. For they gained still more and more 
from him, till they had &apos; left him no more but the three 
Counties, Sommersett, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and 
those too fide * vigentes ; and now they brought an in- 
numerable multitude of their keathonish nation, under 3 
more of their Kings, to subdue and possess this small 
remnant, and quartered and rendevouzed at, and about, 
djlpnattt neare 35atlje, and when none could resist them, 
they took all for their owne, whitest some of the Natives 
fled out of the Kingdome, some into deserts and moun- 
tains, rocks and denns, Kc. yea the King himself was 
necessitated to fly for refuge, with a few of his nobles, 
into the Isle of 3&lt;3tf)elneg, near ButCQtD bri&amp;gC Som-

whilest he quartered witli a swineheard in that inaccessi- 
ble moorish place, waiting for better times, where, for 
his recreation, having obtained dexteritie in the art of 
jugling, he under the disguise of a jugler, adventured 
to the Camp of the Deanes, and insinuated first with the 
Souldiers, and then into their King&apos;s presence, where 
having observed their security, and learned such of their 
counsel, he secretly retourned to his homely quarters, 
wherein having suddenly and covertly raised a consider- 
able power in the County of Somraersett, he marched 
then to + *o&gt;ettOOtJ in the East of that County, and from 
thence, as out of an Ambush, suddenly fell on the Deanes,

dayes, dismissed him with many rich presents. King Al-

tbeir Generalls, and having sailed round Cornwall, came 
into Seaverne, plundered and burnt upon the Sea Coast 
wheresoever they had opportunity, but the King had dis- 
posed his Armie into convenient places of defence from 
the River Avon, which runs through Bristoll, along the 
Sea Coasts to Cornwall, notwithstanding the Danes brake 
into (L&amp;tatCtjett by stealth in the night, plundered and

them, and slew a great number on the place, pursued the

to their Shipps. But the Anglo-Saxons Duke, or Gene- 
rail, Godman (sometimes abbreviated into Goda) and 
their valiant Champion Streame Guld, and divers other 
of the King&apos;s Armie were slain also, upon which Victo- 
rie the Anglo-Saxons made two solemn triumphs, the 
first in locofuneris, the second in loco Jiumints t accord- 
ing to the words of my Authors. And now let us rc-

into meadowes and pasture) betwixt d(llatcl)0tt and 
dfliilUtOttj where the Danes were encountred, as they 
were coming to (UUillitOtl as aforesaid. 

The locus funeris, or buring place, of the slaine, I g^

For by the often diging, and carrying away of much 
earth from them, to dress the ground adjoyning, some 
times in one, and some times in another, have been 
found fragments of mens bones, and sometimes sepul*

stones, two of them lying along on their edges, about 
two foot distance, and a third lying flatt on the topp, 
the both ends walled up closely, and the concavity con- 
taining peices of mens bones, and these latter I take to 
Ije monuments of such Anglo-Saxons, as were slain and

sleep quietly together. 

But as these 3 dftabburrocg are to be looked on as se- 
pulchres of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, so also as Tro- 
phies of the Anglo-Saxons. It was the common practice 
of the ancients, to triumph in, or neare, the field, where 
the victorie was obtained, and to erect * Trophies, (i. e.) 
huge Burro wes, Filler*, Arches, Sfc. in the places, where 
victories were obtained, to perpetuate the memory, both 
of the victorie and the triumphe. So that, as here was 
a f units as before, so a dominantur in lopo funeris, a do- 
mineering or triumphing in the place of the funerall, and, 
consequently, these 3 (ErabburrOtoejS were 3 Trophies 
also of the victorie here obtained, and the triumph here 
celebrated. 

But there was another domineering or triumphing, be- 
gides this, and consequently other Trophies also. JtnglH 
loco dominantur Jluminis, the Anglo-Saxons triumph or 
domineere in the place of the River, not in the River, 
but in the place of the River, (i. e.) OQlUlftOn, which ad r 
joynes close to the River, and indeed here was the great- 
est cause of joy, triumphing and domineering, when the 
village was so seasonably preserved, when the Enemies,

8 foot high above ground, but, before a part of it was

to the dialect of Sommersett, which varies t)CC into Ijurt,

lieve any one to be so simple, as to think this to be an 
ancient monument of some whore ; for then it would 
have been called &apos; tyyw CtOtU. But, doubtless, the an-

of the King&apos;s forces approaching, upon this encourage-

the Country for booties, and that all the inhabitants fled

they quickly perished. Tfee Danes having gotten intel- 
ligence of the loss of some of their ships, speedily re- 
treated, to save themselves and the rest, but the people 
of the Country, having intelligence, that all their ships 
were cast away, took courage, pursued them to JMf&amp;On, 
there fought, and destroyed them with such a bloody 
slaughter, as that frome thence the place took, and ever

most as permanent as little stones. And a Gentleman 
there, within 7 yeares last past, having bought a peice 
of Moorish ground, lying at the foot of the said BUtJOtt,

1 Ernlph, with the forces of Somraersett, and Duke Osred, 
with his Dorseltanians, gave them battel there, and slew a 
great number of them, and obtained a glorious Victorie. 
Wheras this Victorie is said to be obtained at the mouth 
of the River l^attCtt, I suppose the particular place 
meant (though not mentioned) was 23ttnt;1inoU, with- 
in a Mile or two therof. For the tradition, amongst the 
natives there, is, that the Deanes invaded that place*, 
plundered and burnt the 3 parishes of (Jaft and&gt;OUtl) 

iBrentvand Bten&amp;am, now iSurmljam, all which, I 

suppose, took their Names from their humeing, now 
burning, as BrentfOCtl, now 3ScajM0fort&gt;, because it 
was burnt by the Deanes also. And this may yet be far- 
ther confirmed by 2&amp;C0nt&apos;-lUloU it self, which *is a very 
steep and round Burrow or Mole, the topp fortified with 
Dyke and Rampire, where the Deans, according to- pro- 
bability, seated themselves. And by a Ground (almost 
plaine) of two acres in the South Side of that burrow, 
called 25aml--t)Une, where, I suppose, the battel was 
foughten, and the Victorie obtained. 

A 7 th . invasion, intended &apos;against the * maritime Coasts*, 
but by the hand of God confounded, before they could 
come quite thither (like that of the Spaniards in 88) 
thus. The Deanes having a great fleet and armie at 
ftflUtrijam in Dorsett shire, designed their armie in these 
parts by land, and a fleet of 120 saile here to meet them. 
So the fleet sailing round about Cornweili came to an- 
chor apud fetoamtDicfc, which I take to be now ^tane= 
fep, on the North Coasts, over against the West of Som-

mersett. But then it pleased the Lord to send such a 
violent and sudden tempest upon them, as destroyed 
them all : so that, as * Ovid saith of the Sea where Ica- 
rus was drowned, 

Icarus Icariis nonrina dedit aquis ; 

So may I say * of King Swanus his fleet, drowned at 
alias Swanesey, (i. e.) Swanus-Sea, 

Swanus Sanewicis nomina dedit aquis. 
Swanus to Sane-Sea waters gave their name. 



The 8 th . and last invasion in these parts, was at 3

certaine privilidges and prerogatives claymed by the 
King, and denied by the Barons, at last their differences 
were composed in a Parliament at Oxford, where the

into a Filler of Salt, for looking back -ward towards Ido

to say, the multitude of his Graecian Architectonicall 
termes of the parts of it, as hypazthros, monopteros, * di-

one whole one is to much ; because the extcrnall circle 
of high Stones will overshadow allmost all within them, 
as a company of tall men, standing round about a com-&apos;

to each remarkable part and place of the fabrick, corre- 
lateing to what I shall say concerning such particulera.

that the old Britons, which lived in those places, took it 
for a great honour, that thence pittifull habitations 
should be called after the name of this antient renowned 
mount, or some part or propertie thereof, and this is 
most observable in those 3 eminent Rivers, CcUmlwm, 

and 9^aDtlcr, runing from their severall quarters

almost to fetOltap, and meeting a little below it, and 
in many of the hamletts, situate on, or near, those Ri- 
vers, up to their Fountaines, both the said Rivers, and 
many Villages on them, taking their antient British 
names, some from fetonaffC, some from some, some 
from other, parts and properties thereof, shortly after it 
was founded, and seeing, that conveniunt rebus nomina, 
and that any one of those antient names, taken from fetOH* 
affC, is a Description of the same, then, surely, out of many 
of those names, methodically composed, may a defini- 
tion of it be formed, at least some such conjecture of 
mine aforesaid. And because this nominall picklock is 
of my invention, as he that forgeth a pick-locke will 
try him upon some doore of his own, before he will ad- 
venture with it to the publick treasurie, so I entreat leave 
to try, how I can illustrate that famous monument the 
hot Bathe water of 2Satl)t by this engine, before I make 
use of it on fetOIUtlffC. Suppose then, that when the 
heathonish Saxons had subdued all this Hand, saving 
and parts adjoyning, and at last came so near 
as 2Del)Oram, now SDlCCam, and having there 
slain the 3 Kings of iBatfje, (BlOCtftCJ and CfrenceftetT, 
routed their armies, and destroyed those Cities, suppose, 
I say, upon the invasion of those infidells, and destru- 
ction of those Christians, the Lord had, in his wrathful) 
indignation, dryed up the waters of life and health, as 
he did * other salutiferous waters, upon like provocation, 
or that Merlin&apos;s provecie, frigebant Badonis balnea, Sf

barbarous Saxons had, in their furie, burnt the Citieto 
ashes, and nothing of it remaining, but the old British 
names thereof in antient histories, and in the names of 
Hills, Rivers, Hatnletts, SfC. near it, yet much of the 
CitL\ and nature and propertie of the Bath-water, might 
be collected and inferred out of those names now a thou- 
sand yars afterward; as, first, the tradition of the man- 
ner of finding out the vertue of the Bath-water being 
this. Bladtul, alias Bhula, the son and heir of Rudhudi- 
bres, beeing smitten with a leprosie, was, Nebuchad- 
nezar like, driven out from amongst men, and became 
a swineherd near 23atfyc, which was then a bogg or quag- 
mire of hot water, in which his swine often wallowed, 
and one of them, being a Scabbilonian, was thereby 
cured, whereupon Bladon making triall of it was also 
cured, whereupon he built a Temple, and consecrated it 
to the sun, as the God of the heat of the Bath-water, 
and Health, which he recovered by the same, and his 
father dying, Bladon reigned there in his place. Now 
although this is taken generally for a fabulous tradition, 
yet much of it may be proved by such old British names, 
as aforesaid ; as, first, that 25atl)e was such a bogg, or 1. 
quagmire, may be inferred from the most antient name 
thereof &apos; Cat 25ftt&gt;0n, the bogg of Bathe, 9eretUtU, (i. e.) 
Mireton. 

2. That there was such a King Rudhudibres, may be 
inferred from part of his name, still continuing in 

lie, and a relique of his Kinglie dignitie in 
IMngftOtone adjoyning. 

3. That there was a man of great honour and fame, 
living in, or near, Bathe, of the name Bladon. For the

4. That this Bladud was a King, but reduced into 
some miserable condition on the North side of 2Batl)&gt;as may be collected by his picture over the North gate 

of Batfje.

there was such a heathonisb temple on it, and what more

7. That* in regard of the supposed influence of the

times Sommersetlensis*. 

9. That the vertue of the 2$atJ) water being discovered,

14. That this City Batljam, lying in a low valley, 
had a 25atf)amptOn (i. e.) a Bathefort^ on the toppe of

the topp whereof being surrounded with a strong Dike 
and Rampire, a sallie port to issue out upon occasion on 
(OattCttOtltf downe, and military worke about 100 yeards 
off, to secure their issues and retreats, and avenue ex- 
tending from the fort down the hill directly towards 
IBatlje, whereby the Bathonians might pass and repass 
securely and invisiblely between 25atl)am and Batty* 

ampton. 

15. That, in proccsse of time, there was so much re- 
sort to this hill, that they dwelt here and there over all 
the downes, which, before inclosures, was comprized 
all under the name of BaUon, and, upon that account, 

35atl)e was also called Baton, Bationfa, 23atljon, 26a-- 
tijonia, Sfc. 

16. That, for their better security, they afterward 
fortified the said Downe in more places, as near ^unftc 
Lane end, OHlOnOu&apos;d), or &apos;Eljogr-toOUenCMc&amp;e, Sfc. and 
thereupon it was called CaitxBatlOn, the fortified Bath e- 
downe. So that, I say again, if BattjC had been anni- 
hilated 1000 years since, yet these and the like names 
of it, and other neighbouring places, preserved, a pliilan- 
tiquarie might easily out of them extract both these, and 
many more, things, which otherwise would continue bu- 
ried in oblivion, arid much of the fabrick, and many of 
the names, of fetOUag0, and parts and properties there- 
of, being hitherto preserved, I hope, I shall do the like 
thereupon, beginning with the first particuler of my con- 
jecture, viz. 1. j^tonage

1. fetOtiaue is an old British monument; where, first, 
I shall briefly shew, who, and what, the old Britons 
were, and afterward, that this was an old British monu- 
ment. 

The old Britons were the first of six Nations, which 
had the possession of this Land successively, viz. old Bri- 
tons, Belgce, Romanes, Saxons, Danes and Normans. 
The old Britons came origenally from the Tower of &apos; Ba- 
bell thus. Shortly after the deluge, the Lord having 
blessed Noah and his posterity, saying, be fruitfully mul- 
tiplie aud replenish the earth, * they notwithstanding had 
been fruitfull, and had, in a short time, multiplied in- 
credibly, yet they obstinately refused to replenish the 
earth, but said, go too, let us build us a Cilie and a Tower 
in it, whose topp may reach unto heaven, least we be 
scattered over the face of the whole earth ; so they in- 
tended to dwell in their Citie together, and to secure 
themselves from any future flood in the Tower, but the 
Lord confounded their one (rfc. the Hebrew) in 52 
Languages, so that they, not understanding each other, 
3 Babling about carrying on the Worke, were necessitated 
to give it over unfinished, and then each principall ma i 
amongst them having sought out, and brought together, 
such as could understand his language, conducted them 
into the several! parts of the earth, where many of them 
are called after their conductors names to this day, as 
the Medes from Madai, the Moscoviles from Mesech 
alias Mosoch, the Canonites from Canan, and Gomer, 
the eldest son of Japhet, calling together all such as 
could understand 4 (Bottterarjr., as the speech of Gomer,

conducted them to, and seated them in, France, where 
they were called Gomeri after old Gamer, and some of 
them into Britaine. But because &apos; he doth not parti- 
cularize the place, where they were first seated, give me 
leave to conjecture, that it was in Sl^OUnt (Eometf in 
Wales (for that is also called CcefolDgUitt, the famous old 
Towne, a proper name for such old Towns-men.) From 
UlftoUlVt CftCHnejt they might dilate their plantation over 
all S^Ottnt (EomerifitN&apos;re, still called Gomori, as long as 
they had such garments * as their fore-fathers had ; but 
those being worne out, and they being destitute (in this 
wilderness) of meanes to recruite apparrell, yet found 
expedients to paint their naked bodies with severall 
Coullers of Cloatbes, and then they were no longer called 
Gomeri, but Britons, (i. e.) Painters, and their land 
Britaine^ (i. e.) the painted nation*. Some families 
painted gtom white, some&amp;U black, some (Blag blew, some 
(pronounced&lt;E0ff) red, some Hloi&apos;D (pronounced 
reen, and this is the originall of those common 
names (EtDfn, SDtl, (la0, (ftoff and jflOItl r amongst their 
posteritie in Wales to this day. He that desires any fur- 
ther intelligence concerning the old Britons, let him 
reade Caesar&apos;s Commentaries, Strabo, Oiodorus Siculus, 
Pomponius Mela, Solinus, Oio Cassius, Ziphiline, Plinius 
Secundus, Cambden, Speede,&amp;?c. 

Having seen who the old Britons were, we may, in 
the next place, well look upon this&amp;tOnagC as an old 
British monument. If it had but one old British name, it 
were a probable argument, that it was an old British 
thing. For conr.eniunt rebus nomina, ut supra. For 
who, but old British Founders, would have given it an

old British name? But it&apos; I can produce, at leasf, old 
British names thereof, and parts and properties thereof, 
and not one Belgick, Romane, Saxon, Deanish or Nor- 
man name thereof (but the nick-name &apos; ^tonc^enge) 
then, surely, it was an old British monument. I forbear 
mentioning those names now, because I would not tau- 
tologize, when I shall have occasion both to mention 
and interpret sometimes one, sometimes another, of 
them. But the Architector (and I wish I could say the 
Antiquarie) Jones is point blanck against a British, and 
also for a Romane, Monument, and 1 will complie with 
him, as farr as I may, by saying, it might be a Romane 
Avork, but not a Romane Monument. For it is true, 
which he maintains at large, that this monument was 
framed according to the most exquesite rules of Archi- 
tecture, in which the pittifull naked Britons had no 
knowledge at all, and the Romans were the most expert 
men in the world in that art, and might be hired by the 
Britons to do that work for them. For * there was a 
commerce between the Britons and forreigue nations, 
before Julius Caesar&apos;s dayes, insomuch that the Graecians 
frequented this Hand upon this account ; and if so, then 
much more the nearer and more Architectonicall Ro- 
manes, who as they 3 taught and helped the Britons to 
build tempells after they had conquered them (being 
well hired,) so might some of them build, or help them 
to build, this one before they conquered them, and, in 
this respect, it might be called a Roman work, but no 
more a Romane Monument, or Temple, then the tem- 
ple of the Jews might be called the temple of the Gen-

tiles, because the Gentiles had the chiefest hand in build- 
ing it for the Jews. The Romans endeavoured (no way 
more, then) by magnificent Structures to perpetuate their 
fame, as well in this Hand, as in other places, and, to 
this end, they imposed their Romane names on them, as 
Templum Claudii ; ac Camalodunum, consecreated Vi- 
ctoria; murus Seven, extending from Sea to Sea in 
the North of this Land ; the fosse way from the Roman 
fossa, a ditch on each side of it, out of which the earth 
was cast up ; &apos; Antonini Jtinerarium, by which he de- 
rided Britaine into 16 Itinera, and every Iter into 12, 
13 or 14 Mansions, some Remainders of some of them 
to be seen to this day. Not so much as that pallrie tot- 
tering bridge, built by, or for, the Romanes, near (0laC= 
fonbtljte, but must be called by the Romane name Pom 
periculosus, and is called ^ompetlg at this day. and if 
so, then, surely, this most glorious monument (if it had 
been Roman) should have been called after the name of 
one of the Roman Emperors, as * founders of it, at least 
by some other Roman name or word ; but no Roman 
name, word or syllable, on or near it, but all British, is 
argumentum Herculissimunt, that it was no Roman, but 
a British, monument. 

2. My second particuler ig, that a bloody battle was 
foughten at fetonflffe. For the very name fetQIUage, 
signifies Stone^b attic, the last syllable flgfc comeing from 
3 the Greek ayo&apos;v, a furious battle, and a village near

Situation (in a valley;) but because it is near the Jight- 
tuition, or place l hired in, where the Jjght was, (i.e.)&gt;t0nag;e, which stand in the midst of a multitude of 
burrowes, (i. e.J burying hillocks, which are the tumuli 
or tombesj in which the slaine of the battle were buried. 
He that can not, or will not, believe it, let him scearch 
one of them, and there see the fragments of mens bones, 
and peices of their old fashoned armour, spoken of by 
Cambden, Speede, SfC. and conclude, as I do, this par- 
ticuler, that all, that have built their opinion of this mo- 
nument, on any other foundation, then a bloody battle, 
have built ^tona&amp;Cg in the aire. 

8. This bloudie battle produced a glorious Victorie. 
It was not folium anceps^ or a drawn battle. He that 
runeth may reacle almost clear Victorie of the one over 
the other armie, in the numerous traines of burrowes, 
with mens bones in them, extending from s^tonaije to 
jameglHtrie, and from thence to the topp of ^aca&amp;On Ijlll, 
about 5 miles in all the burrowes, being very great, and 
standing thicke at, and near, s5&gt;tOnajT,C, and still smaller 
and thinner till near the topp of l^aradOfl IjlU, plainly 
declaring the great execution done ncare ~3&gt;tOnajJC, and 
that the conquered Armie fled toward l^ara&amp;Ott f)ill, the 
conquering armie pursued them thither, and slew many 
thousands of them, and buried them in heaps together, 
in, and near, London way to the said hill. 

4. That this Victorie was won by the Cangi of (Elate

seems, they delighted so much, that, as the old Bri- 
tons did, so their posteritie of Wales do, call Sommer- 
sett&lt;f5lads0r*f)af, the merry Summer-fold, to this day. 
The Cangi then were the Westermost inhabitants of this 
Hand. For Devon and Cornwall were not then inhabited, 
and their province extended East-ward either to, or near 
unto, S^tonage* For Mr. Cacnbden &apos; intimateth, that 
Cannfngg ^UntyeU, reaching within few miles of&gt;tOm 
01T.0, was so called, a&amp;being part of the Cangies territo- 
ries, * whence I infeir, that if the traine of burying hil- 
locks aforesaid, had extended from fetonaffC westward, 
then the Cangi had been routed and slaine in their flight 
home-ward. But the traine extending East-ward de- 
claret h, that the Cangi) coming out of their westerne 
parts, routed their enemies assoone as they began to en- 
ter upon their frontiers, and pursued them East-ward to- 
wards their homes, or quarters, as more in due place. 
5. That these Cangi were Giants will appear, 

1. by their names. For Cambden&apos;, Speed, fyc. affirrae, 
that this monument was antiently called the Giants 
dance, and Canning or the*CangM0#, near fetonap, 

signifie Cangicfe d5iant0. 

2. By their chaines, intimated by all the names of Ri- 
vers and Villages on them near ^tOItajr.?, which have 
the syllable in or prig; in them . For they come from 
Heb. *&amp;nafe, which signifies a Giant hanging a Chain 
about his neck, as those Anakims in the scripture, and 
such Anakims were the Gigantick old Britons, wearing 
Chaines about their necks and wasts. T vestis usum non.

4. by their armour, or peices of it, (which, when 
new, was large enough for Giants) found there also. But 
5. here I must distinguish Giants into two sorts, Giants of 
antiquitie, and Giants of abilitie, and so declare what 
sort of these 2 the Cangi were. Giants of antiquity were 
so called in respect of their senioritie, as if they had not 
been borne into the world by the way of all flesh. For 
they being heathens, and not beleiving any Creation, 
supposed the first inhabitants of each nation, were brought 
forth by the earth, as froggs, mice, serpents, and here- 
upon the earth was worshiped by the name of J)ea ma- 
ter &apos;, and the first inhabitants termned Terror jilli, and 
terra editi\ and Gigantes, (a y/vo/xai sr yala, Dorice ya) 
that is, men brought forth by the ear///, according to that 
of the Poet 1 : 

Terra fcrospartus, immania monstra Gigantes, 
Edidit. 

And such were the Giants of antiquity. Giants of abili- 
ty were men of a very great stature and strength. And 
these Cangick Conquerors were Giants both of great An- 
tiquitie and Abilitie. Their great Antiquitie may ap- 
pear in Jailjmgton, orthog.&amp;lDfntim, (i. e.) antient Giants 
ion. Their abilitie in jablmgtOlt, (i. e.) able or strong 
Giants-ton* For neither of these two names were proper 
to either of those villages, but borrowed from Sortonagt 
as aforesaid, and now restored to ^&gt;tonap, to declare 
the antiquity and ability of the Cangick Giants, which

and strength of a Cangick Giant, by the topp of his skull 
an inch thick, and a tooth of his, which I have, 3 inches 
long * now since the root is broken away, and three 
inches and a quarter round, and three ounces and half 
in weight, being full four ounces till the roots were 
broken off; so that, according to this instance, the Can 
gick Giants were very much greater and stronger then 
Goliah, or any other of the Giants described in the Scri- 
pture. Mr. Cambden writes of two teeth of a Giant, out 
of which 200 ordinary teeth might be cut, and this one 
Cheektooth weigheth just 100 Cheek teeth. 

6. That the commander in chase of these Cangi was 
the famous old * Stanenges of (E&gt;lathac--l)af aforesaid, 
which give&apos;s demonstration ap, as ^tonaffe was one, so 
fetatunffegf another, Britannick-Graecian name of this 
Monument, compounded of xJtanC and syyvf, (i. e.) Stones 
pitched up near together; and as IjtaneniJCtf was the 
name of this antient Monument, so also of a most antient 
family flourishing in&lt;J&gt;laD:aC--|)af to this day, which name 
could not arise from any ot her place, or thing, then this 
monument. For there was never any other place, or 
thing, of this name but this. , 

Therefore, the prime Ancestour, of the family Sta- 
nenges, took his name from this monument J^t0n0nff0&amp;which being easily granted, it will be enquired, upon 
what account he took his name from this monument ? 
and answered, it must be either from his 3 habitation 
there, or from some action performed there by him.

Not 



502 A FOOL&apos;S Bolt soon shott at STONAGE. 

Not from any inhabitation there. For it \vas an heathen- 
ish Temple, as shall be shewed, and the inhabiting in, or 
at, it had been esteemed a&apos;greater prophanation., then 
the dwelling in a Church or Chappell. Besides, there 
was no water, nor any other accommodation for a dwell- 
ing, within 2 or 3 miles of it. So the name of&amp;5)taruns 
00 was not taken from any habitation there, but from 
some action performed there; and what action could 
that be, but from conquering, and erecting this Trophic 
there? Nimrod the conquerour, and his adherents, 
would needs build him a &apos; Bable to get him a name, and 
from what else could Trophimus, and others of that 
name before and since him, take their Tropicall names, 
but from their Trophies ? And why should not old Sta- 
nenges take his name from&gt;tanenffC0 also ; as he did 
his Arms, 3 Batts volitant in a field argent, from the 
innumerable multitude of Batts (the peculiar animals of 
that place) ambuscadeing there by day, and rendevouz- 
&apos; ing by night, never so much as any sheep coming to 
rubbe or shelter there. Or in what respect could their 
most antierit %OntU&apos;-CUtt, alias |^Onniatl--CUtt, (i. e.) il- 
lustrious court, be so called, but from that most antient 
illustrious Stantnges of ^ontllCUtt, who wonne the field, 
and erected the Trophic aforesaid ? 

7. The people conquered by the Cangi were King Di- 
nitiacus and his Belgce of Low Germanic. For 

1. The king Divitiacus and his Beiges were the on- 
ly people recorded, that invaded the old Britons, and 
therefore if the old Britons conquered such -as invaded 
them, they were the King Divitiacus and his Belg&lt;e.

f . Julius Caesar saith, that &apos; Dixitiacus magnum partem 
Britannia obtinebat nostrd etiam memorid; which great 
part of Britaine Mr. Cambden supposelh was Hampshire, 
Wiltshire, and Sommersett, called antiently the Belgce 9 
after the name of those which conquered them ; but Ju- 
lius Caesar doth not say, they conquered them without 
any repulse. Julius Caesar himself was routed 2 or 3 
times by the Britons, before he could subdue that little 
part of Britaine which he did, and therefore King Di- 
vitiacus and his Belgce might be routed, at least, once 
by them, and at figtonap, before they could vincere that 
great part of Britaine called Belgce. 

3. The armie, which was conquered, fled Northeast 
directly towards Belgium^ as the traine of Burrowes 
aforesaid declares. 

4. ^araUun till, orthog. ^etto&amp;un, to which the 

routed armie fled for refuge, is a Belgick word, or name, 
signifying the hill of refuge, and who was so likely as 
the BefgcB, to give it a Belgick name of refuge, when 
being routed at 2&amp;tOnage&gt;they fled back thither for re- 
fuge? all which being put together, will amount to some 
such historic, insteade of a Chronicle, as this: 

Divitiarus, King of the Belgce, invading Britaina 
with his Salii of Belgium, came into Wiltshire, and quar- 
tered and plundered all over the Salisburie e ate round a 
Plaine, particularly at fealetflOrpe, %UCffiCale, about 3^&quot; an ^

Divitiacus and his armie from the topp of 
DOtt f)fll 5 miles Northeast thereof, where, after they 
had faced each other a while, they mett and fought a 
bloudie battle in the midd-way, where the Belgce being 
routed, fled homeward toward their said hill of refuge, 
but so many of their Salii were slain and buried in the 
burrowes aforesaid, that the field was ever since called 

fealfetourfe Paine. 

8. The Cangick Giants having conquered, triumphed 
over their enemies at&gt;tOnaff0, which, upon that occa- 
sion, was called the Giants dance, and this triumphant 
singing and dancing together, at the time and place of 
Victorie, was the common practice of the antients. So 
when f Jephtha had conquered the Ammonites, the Israe- 
lites triumphed with timbrell and dances. So assoone as 
2 David had slain Goliah, and the Philistines were rout- 
ed, the Isralites triumphed, singing and dancing with 
Tabretts and joy, and with instruments of Musick, and 
the women answered one to another as they played, Saul 
hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 
So assoon as the Lord had given victorie to the Isralites 
over the Egyptians, and that they saw the Egyptians 
dead upon the Sea shore, 3 Then sang Moses and the 
Children of Israeli this song unto the Lord&amp;c. and then 
verss the 20 th . Miriam the Prophetess, the sister of Aa- 
ron, took a timbrell in her handy and all the women went 
out after her with Tabretts and with dances, and Mi- 
riam answered them, sing ye to the Lord, for he hath 
triumphed gloriously . And yet not long 4 after they sang 
and danced a palinodia, like an herd df skipping and

bleating Calves, to the similitude of a &apos; Calf that * eatheth 
hay, sitting down to eat and drink, and riseing up to 
play, dancing and singing, (much out of Tune) these be 
thy Gods, O Israeli, which have brought s the up out of the 
land of Egypt, and this Idolatrous singing and dancing 
being too easily learned of the Gentiles from the Jewes, 
was put in practice at ^itOIUIiJC, by the Cangick Giants 
of (BlaU=^l)af, which was thereupon called the Giants 
dance. 

9. But all this singing and dancing did but beatc the 
aire, uncapable of any legible impression, in which poste- 
ritie might read this glorious victorie; therefore they 
thought it expedient to erect this Monument, as their 
4 Trophie, and as such a Gazett, as all the world might 
gaze at, and in it admire their Heroicall valour through 
all generations : and herein also they imitated, or rather 
emulated, the Isralites, who being delivered from the 
Egyptians, and having trampled the Red Sea and Jor- 
dan (opposing them) under their feet, did, by God&apos;s com- 
mand, erect a -Jtonage of twelve Stones in the midst of 
Jordan, whence it was driven back, and they are * there, 
saith Josuah 6 , un(o this day, standing, perhaps, as a cir- 
culer guard ofSouldiers, up to their middle in water, as 
keeping in possession what had been conquered as afore- 
said; and another such a fetonage of 12 Stones they 
carried to their first quarters, and erected them as a me- 
moriall to the Children of Israeli for ever. vers. 7.

This Trophie of these Giants was called 
orthogr. * S^atltWff, (i. e.) Giants great Stone, observa- 
ble in the 3 9anpt1ff fOttJ&amp;so called, because at each 
of those villages there are fords to pass over that River, 
which runeth downe near to ^anjUffj or Giants great 
Stones. So that although that River is commonly called&amp;t)0ft (i. e.) the River, yet the proper name is 9$anpn, 
the Giants great Stones, from runing down near them, 
as ^ormantOn, orth. |i0^tl)mantOn, (i. e.) the Towne 
, standing nearest to them ; and all this may be exempli- 
fied by other old British Trophies, all resembling&amp;tOtl* 
agC in theire circuler formes, British names, and some 
other respects, although not in magnificence, as 

1. The first was also called 9antOtt near Marlbur- 
rowe, from a pettie fetonage there, of eight huge Stones, 
now called the broad Stones, antiently standing, but 
now lying circularly in London way, testified to be a 
British Trophie, by the fragments of mens bones found 
in the Burrowes in the fields adjoyning. 

2. On feeijenfotjrotoeg |)ill, 4 Miles West of Marie- 
burrow near London way, are 40 great Stones, sometimes 
standing, but now lying in a large Circle, inclosing an inner 
circle of 16 great Stones, now lying also, testified to be 
an old British Trophie by the Anglo-British name there- 
of, (viz.) Beaten Burrowes, and by those 7 huge Bur- 
rowes very near it with fragments of mens bone*. 

3. At g&amp;tanton 2D?U, six miles on the South of Bri- 
stoll, are 8 Stones bigger then the greatest of those at

not above 12 foot high standing circulerlie, and round 
about, within 200 yeard of those 8, are, at least, 60 
more smaller stones, 6, 7 or 8 foot high, standing up- 
right. 

This was an old British Trophic, as may appear by 
the name thereof, retained still in the name of the parrish, 
in which it stands, viz. ^taittOru^U, the Stone Town 
of Victorie. 2 by the smaller stones, monuments of the 
Conquerours friends &apos; their slain, one of which being 
lately fallen, in the Pitt, in which it stood, were found 
the crumbes of a man&apos;s bones, and a round bell, like a 
large horse-bell, with a skrew as the stemme of it ; 
whence I conjecture, that as the circle of large Stones 
was the Trophic of victorie, so those smaller were mo- 
numents of friends slain in wining the Victorie, (for 
Victors would not honour their enemies with such mo- 
numents :) and the bell was part of an old Briton&apos;s Wea- 
pon, there buried with it&apos;s owner, and, I supppse, the 
like bones and bells may be found under the other small 
stones, confirming the praemises. For Mr. Speed, in his 
Chronicle, pictureth an old Briton naked, Lions, Beares, 
Serpents painted on him to terrific enemies, * with a J^ance 
in his hand, on the butt end whereof is such a bell 
screwed fast, which served in stcade of a Trumpett to 
alarmc, and a clubb to dash out the enemies braines, and 
this bell was, I suppose, the permanent part of that old 
Briton&apos;s weapon there buried with his owner, according 
to the old custome, continued to this day, in burying 
Souldiers weapons with them, at least in carrying them 
on their Coffins to their graves.

4. In Denbigh shire &apos; is a famous monument of a cir- 
cle of great Stones, called Ccteff 2Dttrftlfon, (i. e.) the 
Stones of Victorie^ alias the stones of the Druides, (i. e.) 
Priests sacryficeing at Victories. 

5. In Mount Gomerie Shire * there is an high Moun- 
tain, called dorn&amp;On, on which there is a famous monu- 
ment of great stones, standing circulerly, a Trophic of 
Victory. 

6. At 2Bifeato&amp;Uattm in Cornwall 3 are 21 great 
Stones in a Circle, the greatest standing in the Center, 
a Trophic of Victorie. 

7. At ^OCfjCnortOn in Oxford Shire * 36 very great 
stones in a circle, called lfto!l:rict&gt;ttcmctf, and this, as all 
the former, deemed Trophies of Victorie, by that Ora- 
cle of antiquities Mr/Cambden, who, for the excellen- 
cie of his knowledge in afiaires of this Nature, was 
created King at armes, and if all these pot tie, or climi- 
nitive, s3tonaC0 were Trophies of Victorie, then, sure- 
ly, their great grandfather fetOtiagt was a Trophic of 
that Victorie aforesaid. 

Q. But what kind of Stones are they? how brought 
hither ? and sett up in this place*? 

A. 2uot homints tot sentential, the first is, that mon- 
strous legend of Monmouth, and his Giants bringing 
them per mare, per terras, out of the utmost parts of 
Africa, to HilOate, Kc. of which a little, but too much, 
already.

plaines, dreamed &apos;, that nature had aggregated all the la- 
pidificke Vertue of that country into ^tonaje* 

3. The third is, that of Inigo% who might truly have 
said out I goe, when, after he had affirmed, fol. * 10. 
they were hewen out of a quarrie at Slftmcfe, he said, 
they are so churlish and extream hard, that they disdaine 
the touch of tooles, and if they were hewne out from 
thence, tell me, how they were brought 15 miles over 
hills and dales from thence to ^tOna^C, # eris mihi 
tnagntis Apollo. 

4. The fourth is, that of learned Cambden, who sup- 
poseth 4 them to be saxa factilia ex arena pura $ s un* 
ctuoso aliquo coagmcntata. 

5. And I am confident they are saxa factitia, great 
artificial stones, made of many small naturall Stones, 
* made of many small naturall Stones&quot;. That a Lime- 
kilne was there erected, which being filled with lime- 
stones, extraordinarily coaled, were melted with fer- 
vent heat into a birdlime-like substance, which was let 
runne out into such variety of Cisterns, one after ano- 
ther, as formed them for their severall places, into which 
they were drawne up by some Crane, or other Engine. 

1. My reasons are; first, ilt was impossible to work 
&apos;.hem into their severall formes. Free stones may be 
\vrought to any, but these churlish stones to no, forme, 
in regard of hardness and brittleness. 

2. Iron 7 ginnes, chimney back-stones, stone-inges, 
the pillers of the late royall exchange, the 8 great pillers 
of&amp;tantOn=3Dttl Trophic, were all cast stones, formed

some of oise, some of another, sort of melted stones, 
and why might not ^tonage-stones be so also ? Surely 
lieere was such an aggregation for a saxificition, but 
not made by Miner va, as Child rie doteth, but Mars, or 
indeed by the Martiall old Britons, who having been 
active in gaining the victorie, were officious in gathering 
together the small stones of the plaines to be melted into 
great ones, and so multorum manibus grande levatur 
onus, an old British limeburner and his stonegetherers 
performed this opus herculissimum. 

10. This trophic was a Temple, or rather a Tropieall 
1. Temple. For first, it was the common practice of the 
heathens, to promise and vow Temples as Trophies to 
their supposed Gods, or Goddessess, of Victorie, in case 
they would give them some great Victorie, which when 
they had obtained, they surely built it accordingly in the 
place aforesaid of an ordinarie Trophie, so it was called 
a Tropieall Temple, and, upon this account, the Ro- 
mans nsuallie vowed and built Temples as Trophies to 
Mars, Victoria, Sfc. and upon this account Canutus 
built &apos; a Temple at&amp;fl) DO\!U, and all other places 
where he wone Victories; yea some Christians have imi- 
tated heathens in this partictilcr, as King William the 
Conquerour, once, though he built not a Temple to 
Mars, yet he did an Abbey to St. Martin, as a Trophie, 
in the place where he conquered King Herald, the mines 
whereof in Sussex are called Battle al)bf g to this day. 

2. fetonap was a Temple in respect of the magnifi- 
cence thereof. Any such circle of rough stones, as afore- 
said, served well enough for a Trophie, but this was a 
magnificent Tropieall Temple, or Templarie Trophie.

3. S^tOttaije was of a Circnler forme, according (o the 
forme of all other heathonisli Temples. 

4. In that it stood sub dfa, open to the heavens and 
ayre. For the Heathens &apos; accounted it a great sin to im- 
prison their Gods within roofs and walls, who would 
have liberty (as they thought) to be abroad doing good. 

5. It was the opinion of our great Architect&gt;r * (or- 
thodox in this point) saying, [ am clearely of opinion, 
that 5&gt;tOna$C was originally a Temple.&lt;&gt;. ([{Hilton, within 2 miles of ^tOliaffe, was antient- 
ly called %lan&amp;tme (pronounced&lt;UanlHine) (i.) Tern- 
pfe-dovcne, not in regard of any such thing in it self, but 
in regard it was so near the said heathenish Temple, and 
the Earles of Wiltshire were antiently stiled Earles of 
CUan&amp;ime, and if (UUUtOn, the old Metropolis of Wilt- 
shire, took it&apos;s anticrit name from this Temple, then 
consequently AViltshire, and all the rest of the (IxlllMsS

and (HUilgfrlCD, QHUICOtt, and OHfllCOt situate some on

their Templarie names from, and must then restore them

danceing, then, surely, no such sepulchre of sorrow, or 
monument of mourning, weeping, wailing and gnashing 
of teeth, erected by the old Britons for Aurelius Am- 
brosius, according to Poh/dorus VirgiHus, or for the old 
Britons by Aurelius Ambrosius, according to Galfridus 
MonumethensiSy or for Queen Baodicea by the Jceni, 
according to Anonimus. For never any sepulchre bare 
any aspect like this monument, but far different in forme, 
manner and composure. The severall pillers of Rachell 
and Absolon, the &apos; columnes of Vespatian and Trajane, 
the one having his shield, the other a Colossus on the 
topp of it, had no resemblance with this. Neither had 
the Obelisks of Mitres or Kamesis, or the Piramides 
of Memphis, or Arsinoe, or the Mausoleum of Arthe- 
misia, any resemblance with 5&gt;t0ttcig0. And how much 
did the sepulchre of King Arthur, * buried at (35la(Tcnlnu 
tfc in an hallowed Oake, with a little Pyramis at the 
head, and another at the feet, differ from this ? Is there 
any probability, that King Arthur and Ambrosius, fel- 
low Christians, Coatanians, living and dying so near 
together in time and place, that the one should be bu- 
ried and monumented according to (he custome of the 
old British Kings and Princes, and the other as never 
man before, or since? Amongst all nations sepulchres 
were alwaies such sollid piles, as might be truly termed 
monuments, (i. e.) remaines, not ayerious, with fre- 
quent openings and void spaces within, and subject to 
ruine, but this was such, therefore no sepulchre, but a 
Temple. 

11. And this Temple was consecrated to Andraste, 
alias Anraithy alias Andates, their Goddess of Victorie.

of that his native Country in these words:

3. That they sacrificed their captives and spoiles there

The Britons iiMially sacrificed their Captives and Spoiles 
of war, according to the testimony of Julius CaBsar 1 , when 
he invaded this Island, 2ui in hello versantur, out pro 
cictimis homines *immolant, aut se inmolaturos vovent, 
(i. e.) They which addict themselves to warr either sa~ 
crijice, or vow they will sacrifice men, (i. e.) their Ca- 
ptives, as Viclimes for Victory (saith he). The Ma- 
jesty of the immortal 3 Go dess would not be pleased, un- 
less they offer up the life of a Captive) or the life of a 
man, and they have sacrificed or publickly instituted* 
and some of them (saith he) make hallow images of vast 
magnitude, with twiggs wreathed about together, whose 
members they Jill up with living men, (i. e.) Captives, 
and so burn the Images, men and all together: and these 
4 instanses are sufficient to prove, that the old Britons 
did usually sacrifice their Captives.

2. They usually sacrificed tbeir Captives and spoiles 
to Andates in her Temple; and this I prove out of Cor- 
nelius Tacitus. The Romans having conquered Britain e, 
tyrannized so intollerably over them, that Prasutagus, King 
of the Iceni, that he might free his Subjects from their 
calamities, made the Romane Emperor Nero his Heir, 
hoping that he, and his, should thereby have the more 
favour, during his life at least ; but the Romanes taking all 
for their owne, presently tyrannized infinitely the more, 
whipped his Queen Baodicea, ravished his daughters, and 
plundered his Subjects of all their estates, whereupon his 
wife Baodicea (whom Gildas termcs the subtill Lioness) 
stirring up first the Trinobantes (i. e.) the Londoners, 
and afterwards the Britons in generall, raised a most 
blody warr against the Romans, cut oiF their two Colo- 
nies Verolamium, and Camalodunum, destroyed &quot;three 
in the Legion, put Catus Decianus to flight, destroyed 
80000 of them, some by the sword, and some by srcri- 
ficing them with the greatest crueltie to Andates in her 
Temple. 

And that those old Britons sacrificed their Captives al- 
so to Andates in this her Temple, may appear by this, 
that it had all accomodations for such hcathonish sacri- 
fices, as an internall, or spatious, Court, lying round 
about, marked with the Letter A in the fronlispice, 
wherein the Victimcs for oblation were slain, into which 
it- was unlawfull for any prophane person to enter. It 
was seperated from the circumjacent plain with a large 
trench, (marked with ) instead of a wall, as a bounda- 
rie about the Temple, most conformable to the maine

this day, when we confine it to 
a measure of Land containing&apos; Q 
Perches in Length, and 4 in 
Breadth. And indeed as Akre 
denotes Field (and not that small 
Quantity of Ground, which we 
now adays understand by it) it 
agrees exactly with the original 
Suxin word Acejie, from whence 
it comes. For, saith Somner in 
ftis Saxon Dictionary, &quot; Acejie. 
&quot; Ager, campus, a field. Vo- 
&quot; cabulum omnibus Europtfis 
&quot; fere commune, ut tiro doctis- 
&quot; simo jam observatum, Icon&apos;s 
&quot; in ll&apos;illeramum,p. 14-3&quot;. And 
truly &apos;tis worth while taking 
notice, that the Acre of land 
(notwithstanding the former 
quantity prescribed) is not in 
every place in this land of like 
quantity; for the Cornish acre 
is said to contain a Carew of 
land. 0. E. 3. 283. and in the 
Commentary of Mr. Ploden the 
Cornish Acre is said to con- 
tain an hundred other Acres. 
Com. Throg.&amp;Tracy 154 &apos;. 
And sometimes it hath been noted 
to be (he same with a yard land, 
sell. 31- or 30 Acres*, tho&quot; 1 even 
the jard land also differs much 
in different places. From this 
extensive signification of the ivord 
in old time I cannot but observe, 



. that whereas in some places, 
wher: there have been undoubt- 
edly Roman Works, the common 
people, as well as ot/ters, make 
use of Castle Acre, to distin- 
guish such a piece of Ground 
where they have been, I th&apos;tnk 
vie ought not to restrain that 
term to our modern narrow Ac- 
ceptation of the word, but look 
upon it to be meant in the old 
sense, so as to denote an intire 
Field. So whereas by Castle 
Acre in Weycock field, in the 
Parish of Laurence- Waltham 
near Maidenhead in Berks, the 
Country people commonly under- 
stand, no more ground than what 
is now generally known by the 
term Acre, / rather think, that 
&apos;tis to be understood of the whole 
Field, at least of a great many 
of our common Acres, and that 
the Building there was very large, 
a thing which the great number of 
Antiquities found in the Field 
proves rery plainly, in reference to 
which I shall here transcribe, what 
I put down in one of my MSS.i a 
few years since, ishen, in my walk, 
I lay at Hare-Hatch, and the 
next day went through this Field, 
as I have upon occasion done 
several times. &quot; Wednesd* A-

&quot; day, March 31.] at Hare. 
4t Hatch, but said he lived at 
&quot; Cookham, where he had re- 
&quot; sided 21 Years. He told me, 
&quot; that there was a Tradition 
&apos;* at Cookham, that the Em- 
&quot; press Maud was some time 
&quot; at Cookham, and that she 
&quot; built Cookham Bridges and 
&quot; some Houses there : but, says 
&quot; the Gentleman, I believe no- 
&quot; thing of it. For my own 
&quot; part, I am apt to think there 
&quot; is some Ground for the Tra* 
&quot; dition. I talk&apos;d with him 
&quot; about the Road&apos;s going over 
&quot; the River in old time nearer 
&quot; Cookham than it does now. 
&quot; He said, he had heard Stories 
&quot; about such a Road, but he 
&quot; did not think, that there teas 
&quot; any credit to be given to 
&quot; thent. Leland tells us, that 
&quot; the old Name of Maiden. 
&quot; head was South - Aillington. 
* But I think South . Aiding. 
&quot; ton was distinct from it, more 
&quot; near Cookham, and &apos;twas at 
&quot; this Place that the Roadpass&apos;d 
&quot; before Maidenhead Bridge was 
&quot; built. 

&quot; This old Man (whom I 
*&apos; have mention&apos;^, and is a 
&quot; Person of good Sense, and 
&apos;* seetn&apos;d very honestj had 
&quot; not heard of Leland the An~ 
&apos;&lt;liquor^ &apos;till I mentioned him. 



&quot; From Harc.Hatch 1 walk&apos;d 
&quot; to Shottesbrooke, and pass&apos;d 
&quot; through a great Field (in the 
&quot; Parish of Laurence&apos;Waltham) 
&quot; call&apos;d Weycock. 

One part of this Field is 
&quot; call&apos;d Castle-Acre. There is 
&quot; a Tradition, that there was 
&quot; a, large Castle there. 

&quot; Indeed there is no manner 
&quot; of doubt, but in this Field 
&quot; there was once a very consi- 
&apos; &apos; dera ble Fort, a nd sever a I Build- 
&quot; ings besides. The Ground call&apos;d 
&quot; Castle Acre is higher than the 
*&apos; rest. Abundance of Roman 
&quot; Money hath been found in this 
&quot; Field of Weycock. I dis. 
&quot; cover&apos;d in many Places of it 
&quot; Fragments of Roman Bricks. 

et I met with two or three 
&quot; Workmen, with whom t 
&quot; talk&apos;d about this Field, par- 
&quot; ticularly about the Coyns 
&quot;found in it. There was a 
&quot; Youth with them, who told 
&quot; me, that a great many little 
&quot; Pieces of Money had been 
&quot; plough&apos;d up in this Field, 
&quot; and a many pretty Things 
&quot; (says he) besides. I ask&apos;d 
&quot; him, where any of them might 
11 be seen. He taid, at Mr. 
&quot; Nevill&apos;s of Billingbeare. I 
&quot; am apt to think, that some 
&quot; of the pretty Things he men.

&quot; Roman Pavement.

became conferred, zcas the

ted, withall, that * the word 
used to donate the Degree of 
Knighthood, in the several Dia- 
lects of other Nations, hath 
the same derivation, to wit, 
from a Horse; for in the 
French, a Knight is called Che- 



valier; (which was a Word 
also much used by our English 
Ancestors, and it very fre- 
quently occurrs in our MSS. 
as it does also in Mr. Dods. 
worth&apos;s MSS. Collections :) 
in the German, Ridderj in

strained to a Title of Honor

Mr. Ashmole notes 4, that 
these four Knights in the 
same MS. are termed luther 
Knights, a very proper Ap- 
pellation for those, that, by 
their vileness and wickedness, 
forfeit their Vertue and the 
Honour of Knighthood, as 
certainly all do that are con- 
cerned in treacherous and 
disloyal Acts. And therefore, 
even in the primitive Moudij 
Persecutions, such Knights 
(Equitcs) us appeared most zea- 
lous against the Christians, 
lost also their Honour, how- 
ever instigated and counte- 
nanced by the Emperours, as 
acting against common hu- 
manity, the light of the Go- 
spel that they hail heard, and 
abetting the Designs of the 
grand Rebell the Devil him- 
self. There were many wic- 
ked men of this nature in Bri-

tian, and we have Accounts 
of their Cruelties represented 



not only in old Writings, 
particularly Martyrologiet 
(one MS. of which I pur-

manner. I cannot be posi-

think it teas about the time 
of Richard I. The Ruffians

An Act for the abolishing

Where the kings most ex-

fourth and established by au. 
tfcoritie of parlement, an vni-

The booke of common prater, 
and administration of the sa- 
craments, and other rites and 
ceremonies, ajter the church 
of England, to be vsed and 
obserued in the said church 
of England, agreeable to the 
order of the primitive church, 
muqh more comfortable vnto 
Jiis louing subiects, than other 
diuersitie of seruice as heere- 
tofore of long time hath

booke ordeined nothing to 
be read, but the verie pure 



word of God, or which is 
euidentlie grounded vpon the 
same, and in the other things 
corrupt, vntrue, value, and 
superstitious, and as it were 
a preparation to superstition, 
which for that they be not 
called in, but permitted to

continue in their old accus- 
tomed superstitious seruice, 
but also minister great occa- 
sion to diuersitie of opinions,

Be it therefore enacted by the 
king our souereigne lord, the

vagant Acts (as some call them) 
made in those times. &apos;Tis in- 
credible to think, what a vast 
number of curious Books and 
Monuments perished by otV- 
tue of it. The Reader will 
take the more notice of it, 
because I have transcribed it 
from an Edition of our Acts, 
in which are many Particu. 
lars that have been left out in 
later Editions. The Sandford 
Image (made of Barrington 
Stone by Burford, and paint. 
ed) is certainly comprehend- 
ed in this Act. I look upon 
it to be as old as the Reign 
of K. Edw. Hid, and as the 
Artists us&apos;d to have some fine 
Lady of their oven, time in 
view, when they wrought J- 
mages of the Virgin Mary, so 
I am of opinion, that the 
Face (which is a little da- 
mag&apos;d, as the Arms arc also 
broke off) of this Image was 
intended by the Artist for 
that of Q. Philippa, a thing 
which I noted also (soon af- 
ter it was discovered) in one 



of my Volumes l of MSS. 
Collections, where the fol- 
lowing Particulars occur, :

the King, their Master, and 
also to bring forth a nu- 
merous and hopefull Proge-

a Bishop, zchose Order mas 
not then allowed to marry, 
gave occasion of much Di- 
version and Mirth to the 



Company. But, however, 
the Judgment prevailed, anil 
Madam Philippa (who was 
the very youngest * of the 
Ladies) was pitch&apos; d upon 
to be their Queen. 
&quot; She was received in Eng-

&quot; their View, when they made

But now, if any one should 
think, as I once did % that 
this Image did not originally 
belong to Sandford Church, 
it may be he will not judge it 
absurd to believe, that it be- 
long&apos;d either to the Chappcl 
by the great Ivy House at 
Sandford, or else to the Min- 
chery at Littlemore, and that 
in Hen. VHl tbi &apos; lime, when

destroyed or pulled down. 



I have often been willing 
to think, that K. Edw. VI. 
had he lived to a mature age, 
would have repented of the 
Act above published, and of 
many other Things, that he 
was drawn to consent to by 
bad Counsellors, such as his 
own Godfather Cranmer, who 
(as well as Cardinal Wolsey) 
had likewise suggested many 
unworthy Things to this

have looked upon to be the 
beheading of Bishop Fisher,

most like those holy Fathers and

and first ground of our beliefe, up- 
on the which we have since rested 
and stayed our&apos; selfes, whome to 
describe whollie and fullie unto 
you, according to his worthinesse, 
I will not take upon me to do it, 
neither am I able. No, were I 
as eloquent as Cicero, or as wit- 
tie and subtill as Aristotle, as co- 
pious as Demosthenes, or as pro- 
found inphilosophieasP/fl#o,such, 
and so innumerable, were his * 
singulervertues. Butherinlwill 
content my selfe with the generall 
commendacion, which all the fa- 
mous universities of 4 devinitie in 
Europe do give this learned Fa- 
ther, by calling him blessed Mar- 
tir, and alleaging his workes for 
great authoritie. Thus much 1 
may also say, that unto Justus 
his predecessor, the first Bishope 
of Rochester, he was a just and 
true successour. The place of 
his birth he doth greatlie beau- 
tifie with the glorious Bishoppe 
St. John of Beverley. To the 
Countrey of Kent, where he 
was bishope, he is an ornament 



with St. Thomas of Canterbu* 
rie ; in gravetie of his writing he 
is to be reverenced with St. Bede; 
for stout defending the right and 
libertie of the holie Church, 
against the power of princes, he 
is not inferiour to the blessed 
bishope St. Ambrose, and St. 
Crysostome ; in praying for his 
enemies and persecutors, he re- 
sembleth holie St. Stephen / in 
constancie and stoutnesse of his 
martirdom, he was a second Ci. 
prian. But, above all other, he 
is most to be likened and com- 
pared to the holie Prophett and 
Martir of God St. John Bap. 
tist ; and first, to sett aside all 
congruence in their names of 
John, it is to be noted, that as 
John lived in 5 wildernes a hard 
and solitarie life, in penance and 
punishment of himselfe, so this 
John lived a solitarie and austere 
life, in his private house and 
cell, saving when he was called 
abroade to other businesse, pu- 
nishing himselfe with studie,hard 
lodging upon the mattes, fasting, 
praying, wearing of heareshirtes, 
and whipping himself. Likewise, 
as that John preached diligent- 
lie the coming of Christ at hand, 
giving knowledge of salvation 
to all them that would be. 
leeve and be baptised, so this 
John, with like diligence and 
care, warned the people by his 
continuall preaching and writ,

hand, in case they stopped not 
their eares against those horrible 
heresies, dailie preached and sett 
forthe unto them ; And, as that 
John, died for a case of matri- 
mony, contrarie in appearance, 
but agreable in substance and 
truth, saying unto kinge Hen. 
rye, it is not lazcfull for &apos; the 
*&apos; to put away thy wife, and&lt;; take an other, though she 
&quot; were once thy brother&apos;s tcife, 
&quot;/or thy brother is dead icith- 
&quot; out issue, and then now 
&quot; lazi-fiillie maried unto her by 
&quot; dispensation and authoritye 
&quot; of the Church.&quot; For Ilerode, 
whom St. John Baptist repre. 
hended, took to him his bro- 
ther&apos;s wife, his brother living, 
which &apos; is manifestlie repugnant 
to God&apos;s Lawe, could not be 
done : But king Henrie tooke 
his brother&apos;s wife, when his bro- 
ther was dead without issue of 
her, which by Moyses Lawe is 
not in that case forbidden, and by 
the authoritye of the Church may 
be permitted as this was, and ther- 
fore was the manage good and 
lawfull, and consequentlie the se- 
cond detestable and unlawful!. 
Furthermore, as that John&apos;s head 
was begged of king Ilerode at a 
banquett by a Psaltresse or wo- 
man dancer, so this John&apos;s head 
was by a like person of king 
Henrie, as he sat banqueting and 
chearing at his house at Ham*, 
zcorth. As this John was be- 



headed on the birth day of kinge 
Herode, so this John was be- 
headed on the birth day of king 
Henrie, the king having accom- 
plished that day the just age of 
fortie five yeares. And as the 
holie fingar of that John Mith 
pointing to the Lambe, when he 
said, Ecce agnus dei, was mi- 
raculouslie preserved from Cor- 
ruption long after his death and 
martirdome, so the holie head of 
this John, wherwith he stoutlie 
defended the head of our holie 
mother the Church, was by mira- 
cle preserved long after his mar- 
tirdome with a fresh and livelie 
colour, till, by commaundement 
of the king, it was taken away, 
and conveied out of sight. Fi- 
nallie, as in the person of that 
John 4 their died thre severall 
functions or offices at once, that 
is to saye, of a Preist, a Prophett, 
and a Patriarke, so in the person, 
of this John there died three 
like worthie vocations, that is 
to say, a Priest, a Bishope and 
a Cardinall. And thus we 
see, how the death of our 
holie John may be compared 
to St. John Bapttste&apos;s death, 
and yet in verie deed for some 
respectes it surpasseth the death 
of St. John. And the wick- 
ed doings of kinge Henrie 
surpasseth likewise the wick, 
ed doings of king Herode.

learninge, sanctytie of life, dig- 
nitie, nor other quality in his 
worthie personage. The fact of 
king Herod, for which St. John 
died, did most concerne the in- 
jurie, which Herode did to his 
brother, whose wife he took. But 
the fact of king Henrie, where- 
fore our blessed John died, &apos; not 
onelie touch the injurie committed 
against the vertuous ladie his 
lawfull wife, but it contained the 
expresse contempt of our holie 
father the Pope, and of the au- 
thoritie of the Catholike Church, 
besides the occasion of sinne and 
scandall, which it gave to the 
partie, that did pretend title to 
her, whomethe king would nedes 
marry. But what should I speake 



of Herode, whose crueltie was 
nothing to be compared to this 
king? For in malice, which he 
showed to a great number of ho. 
lie and learned men, principallie 
to this our holie father, he had 
never yet his like bearing the 
name of Christ, and professing his 
faith. In unthankfulnesse he was 
much worse then Alexander. For 
he did not onelie nothing consi- 
der the great affiance, which his 
noble father king Henrie the 
Vjjth. had in this holie man, mak- 
ing him, at his death, one of his 
executors(as we have before men- 
tioned) nothing waying the singu- 
lar affection and creditt, that his 
Grandmother, that worthy Ladie, 
Margarett Countesse of Rich- 
mond and Darbic, had in him 
above all the Prelates and Bishops 
of this Land ; but setting at naught 
the great Vertue, Learning and 
llolinesse, which he knew to be 
in this so rare a Bishope, and ut- 
terlie forgetting the honor and 
fame, which by him both he, and 
all his realme had gotten, like a 
most unthankfull Prince, and 
most contemptuous of his sove- 
raigne and holie father the head

ritie nor Jurisdiction, wherby he 
might lawfullie thus proceed a- 
gainst an anointed Bishope and 
Cardinal of the Church of Rome, 
but that by intending the least of 
the waies, that he used against 
him, must, of necessitie, incurre 
the sore and grevous Excommuni- 
cation, accompanied with mame 
other dangers and inconveniences 
then can well be rehearsed : He, 
I say, contemning all these, did 
most wickedlye take upon him 
and usurpe the authoritie, which, 
before his daies, never Christian 
and Catholik Prince did, (and 
which John Calvin, an heretike, 
did utterlie detest and condemne 
in him ;) and against all lawe and 
reason most cruellie put to death 
this man of God, over whome 
neither by Lawe, nor Custome, 
he could have anie Criminall Ju- 
risdiction, but ought, if he had 
made anie offence, to have refer, 
red the hearing and discussing of 
his crime to his Metropolitan, or 
rather to the cheefe .Head of all 
Bishopps, to whome onelie the 
Judgement and hearing of a Bi- 
shope&apos;s crime in a spirituallcause, 
as this was, doth and all waies 
hath of right appertained. And 
as the enormities of King Henrie 
iu this case were so exorbitant, 
and surpassing all Lawe, Reason 
and Conscience) so is the wonder- 
full working of Allmightie God, 



whose Judgements are&apos; secrett and 
strange in our sight, much to be 
marked and noted in him, and his 
adherentes. For as God of his 
owne nature is patient and long 
suffering, &apos; by cause he expecteth 
the amendment of our sinfuli 
lives; so is he allso just in his do- 
ings, and punisheth greivoslie 
when no amendment is indevour- 
ed, as now may well be perceived 
by those persons, that were per. 
secutors of this blessed man. For 
they escaped not the danger of his 
heavie hand, as shal bedeclared 
unto you. 

And first to begin with the La- 
die Anne Sullen, as the chefe 
and principall cause, for whome 
all this wofull tragedie began, 
who was also the chefe persecutor 
of this holie man, markehow she 
was, in short space, cast downe 
from the topp of her high honor 
and dignitie, wherin she was ex- 
alted, arid for a most vile and ab- 
hominable incest, committed with 
her owne brother, besides sun- 
drie adulteries with other per- 
sons, was throwne into cruell and 
straite prison, where she remain, 
ed not longe before she was con. 
demned to death by sundrie no- 
ble men of this realme, that late, 
lie before were pliable and readie 
to please her in allhercommaun- 
dementSjWhereof some were neare

ing to which condemnation she 
was put to open and shamefull 
execution of death, leaving behind 
her nothing but an infamous name 
to remaine for ever, for whose 
lossethe king himselfe tooke so 
little sorow, that the verie next 
day after she was dead, he was 
maried to an other wife. 

Next that the Lord Crumwell 
is to be remembred, who with a 
great diligence solicited the matter 
to the king, and earnestlie pro- 
voked him In this and manie other 
ill purposes. He being advaunced 
to such honor and authoritye,. as 
no man in this realme, at that 
time, bare the like about the king, 
grew at last into such hatred a- 
mongst the noble men and com- 
mons &apos; througout the realme, for 
his untollerable and tirannicall 
crueltie,exersiced over them, that, 
finallie, he was by sundrie pra- 
ctises brought also into the king&apos;s 
displeasure, and so cast into miser- 
able prison condemned to death by 
act of parliament for heresie and 
treason, and after executed ac. 
cording to his judgment, no man 
pittying his case. 

Then cometh to mind Mr..TAo- 
mas Cranmer, archbishope of 
Caunterlurie, who of his owne 
power, without just warrant, pro- 
nounced the sentence of divorce 
betwene the king and the Queene, 
and after calling this holy man 
before him and others, cast him 



into prison, with as much extre~ 
mitie as could be shewed, for re- 
fusing the two othes, the one of the 
king&apos;s new mariage, the other of 
the supremacie, from whence he 
was never delivered, till death rid 
him of all worldlie cares. ThusMr. 
Cranmer allthough he continued 
his place and dignity, during the 
unnaturall and cruell times of king 
Henrie, and the infant his sonne 
king Edward; yet, at last, in 
the raigne of that most blessed la- 
die Queene Marie, when the true 
light of Justice of Christe&apos;s aun- 
cientandCatholike religion began 
againe to shine, he was called to a 
reckoning for manie of his former 
iH doings, and, lastlie, standing 
stifle in divers horible and foule 
heresies, was worthelie burnt with 
tier, and consumed to ashes. 

Likewise Mr. Rich, the king&apos;s 
Soliciter, that gave false testimonie 
against him, and was forsworne 
at his * araigment, in so falselie 
betraying him, although for ma- 
nie yeares after he continued cor- 
rupt! ie gathering together of 
wealthe, till the daies of king 
Henrie were ended, yet have I bin 
crediblye informed, that, if the 
king had lived but a fewe dayes 
longer then he did, he was 
growne into such displeasure 
against him for sundrie false- 
hoodes and deceiptes, in frau- 
dulent purchasing and exchanging 
of land betwene the king and him, 
wherin the king was deceived of

no small value, and likewise for 
diverse bribes extorted upon 
many of his subjectes, that he was 
fullie determined to have attainted 
him of felonie, extortion and per- 
jurio, and so in one houre to have 
spoiled him of all the great heape, 
which he so falselie had raked to- 
gether in manie yeares before. 
But being after, in the wicked 
time of the Infant&apos;s raigne, ad- 
vanced to high honor and place, 
far above his desert, yet lived he 
to be deposed againe of that place, 
&apos;evin by the same persons that 
preferred him. But since, in the 
time of that noble and blessed 
QueeneAfary of worthiememorie, 
he became penitent, as I have 
heard, for many of his offences, 
for the which God permitted him 
(as it may be thought) to die in 
better order then the rest before 
did. But true it is, that after his 
death his bodie escaped a narrow 
daunger of burning. For at such 
time as he was dead, and his bo- 
die laid in a coffin ceared and 
balmed, and certaine candles set 
upon the hearse, as the maner 
was, one of the candles, either by 
the will of God, or els by negli- 
gence of some * of some&quot; of the 
watchers that were absent, fell 
downe, and tooke hold, first of 
the clothes, and after of the cof- 
fin, that, in the end, before anie 
bodie was ware, the fier was 
fastned upon the seare-clothes, 
where his miserable carcasse lav, 
and had, without all doubt, con- 



sumed the same into ashes, had it 
not bin spedelie espied by certaine 
of the sen-antes by chaunce, who 
saved all for that time, though 
not with out great danger to the 
bodie and the rest of his howse 
also ; All which so narow escapes 
I can impute to nothing, but one- 
lie to the goodnesse of God,for that 
he conceived (as before is said) 
some repentance, though I ne- 
ver heard of anie penance by him 
donne at all. 

Last of all, it is worthie to be 
remembred, how justlie the king 
him selfe was plagued, first by 
the inordinate number of wives, 
being in all six, and not one law- 
full more then the first, as may 
be thought. Of these six, two 
were repudiate, two beheaded for 
incontinence, one killed witting, 
lie in childbedd for saving of her 
child, and the sixt survived him, 
wherin her fortune was better 
then the rest of her fellowes. For 
(as I have heard reported by such 
as had no cause to lye) he was 
wearie of her longbeforehe died, 
and therfore, if he had lived but 
one yeare longer, meant to have 
framed such matter against her, 
for heresie, as should have cost 
her her life, as it did some others 
of her predecessors before. And 
as for heire male of his bodie, 
which he so much desired, and 
made so much adoe for, as though 
the realme had bin utterlie 
undonne, if he had died without

labored to teare her in peces, and 
despising her authoritie, being

monstrouslie took upon him to

And for noble personages of this

spared neither kindred nor other; 
yea manie times, for a word speak- 
ing, he would revenge by death, 
were it spoken upon never so rea- 
sonable aground or cause, by rea- 
son wherof more of the nobilitie 
were consumed in his daies, then 
in anie 3. of his predecessours,

with sores and diseases, that grew 
upon him by meanes of drunken 
surfeits, idlenesse, sloth and vicious 
trade of life, sparing neither kin-

drcsse him, it hath bin reported by 
some of his privie Chamber, that 
they have smelt the ill savour of 
his sores the space of two cham-

Lastlie, and most of all, weighe 
the danger of his miserable soule, 
dying in the perilous state of ex- 
communication, without anie re- 
conciliation or repentance knowne 
or hard of in the world : yea it

ed carcasse. For in such time as 
it was in preparing, to be ceared

chamber at Westminster, where 
he died, to be after removed 
downe to the chappell, and so 
from thence to Windsore, where it 
was buried, it chauncedthe said 
carcasse, by mishap, and over 
boisterous lifting, to fall to the 
ground, out of which issued such 
a quantitie of horrible aud stink- 
ing blood and matter, that it was 
no small treble to a number about 
it, to dense the place againe, and 
make it cleane against the next 
day for the remove. But be. 
fore all could be done, there 
came into the place, as I have

black dogg, no man could tell 
from whence, which dogg, whiles 
everie one was occupied, filled 
himselfe so full as his sides could 
hould with licking up filthy blood 
that was spilt, and in the end 
escaped without hurt from the 
guard and diverse others, that 
stroke at him with their holberdes 
and other weapons, meaning ve- 
relie to have killed him, if they 
could. 

Others I coulde have named 
unto you that were doers in this 
matter, and that of 1 righ great 
calling, whome God worthelie af- 
ter punished, some by a foule and 
shamefull end, some by leaving 
them without either issue or kin- 
dred, wherby their lands and 
goodes, after their death, came 
to the handes of straungers, that 
fell in strife among * themselfes. 
Others were attainted, and ther- 
by not onelie their owne bodies 
executed to shamefull death, but 
also their lands and goodes being 
forfeited, their children went a 
begging, some came to one mis- 
happe, and some to an other,

requier a long processe.

the Dean and Chapter, having 
then an annual Market, or

so that Christ-Church having 
thus got the whole Meadow 
to themselves, they damni&apos;d 
up the old Channell, that ran 
into Charwell, and brought 
both the Meads into one; 
yet to keep up certain tokens, 
how the Course ran, certain 
meer stones were set in the 
Meadow, and it still bore the 
name of Shire-lake. And in- 
deed even to this day, there

Rushes and different Grass,

there was formerly a much 
greater Number than there 
is at present, the Water of 
Charwell being then more ob- 
structed than now, which con- 
duc&apos;d, in no small degree, to 
Sicknesses. And those that are 
acquainted with the History of 
Oxford are not ignoiant, that 
the Pestilence was often in 
old time in that place, which 
occasioned the Scholars to re- 
tire, a thing which is to be 
attributed, in great measure, 
to the Flams, a* well as to the 
neglect of cleansing the Streets, 
and keeping out Creatures 
that raised Filth and corrupt- 
ed the Air. Of such kind 
of Flams there were abund- 
ance on the South side of the 
City, even beyond Fryer Ba- 
con&apos;s Study, the Causey being 
not raised so high as at present, 
nor that way so much fre- 
quented (the Flams hinder- 
ing) as nowadays ; which was 
the reason therefore that the 
place, now called Fryer Ba- 
con&apos;s Study, was very private 
{in respect of what it is now) 
and afforded that great Man 
a very convenient Retreat 
from the Grey Fryery, in or-

night time, and make proper 
Observations in Astronomy, 
and other parts of Mathema-

Multitude of Flams, the ill 
Effects of which, however, 
himself, by the Directions he 
gave, very, much prevented, 
for which he deserved, and, 
without doubt, received thanks 
from the University, as well 
as the Town, it being the In- 
terest of this Seat of Learn- 
ing, which is so admirably

ed, to listen to persons of 
Skill when they prescribe what 
may prevent Infection, and 
therefore more Attention should 
have been given to such know- 



ing Men above fourscore years 
since, when many suffered by 
a new Disease, which tho 1 it 
was felt at other places, yet 
rag&apos;d most at Oxford, as may 
appear* from a scarce little 
Book, lent me by my worthy 
Friend Thomas Rawlinson, 
Esq;. intituled, Morbus Epide- 
mius Anno 1643. England&apos;s new 
Disease most contagious at pre- 
sent in Oxford. With theSignes, 
Causes, Remedies. Published by 
his Majesties Command. Oxford, 
Printed by Leonard Lichfeild, 
Printer to the University. 4 in 
3 Sheets. Though it was as an- 
cient as Hippocrates*, yet it 
was termed The new Disease. 
&apos;Twas generally defined to be a 
malignant and contagious Fea- 
ver, being comprised under the 
Genus of a putrid continued Fea- 
ver, which proceedeth from pu- 
trefaction of blond, or humours 
continued in the greater vessels. 
So that the Disease may be 
truly called, Febris putrida, 
continua, maligna,&amp;contagio- 
sa; that is, a putrid, continued 
Feaver, both malignant and con. 
tagious. TAo&apos; it zcas not the 
Plague, yet it was (as we be- 
fore defined it) what some ne- 
vertheless denyed, malignant 
and contagious, as the Au- 
thor of that Tract hath 
well proved. One cause of

ff icus found to be those putrid 
Exhalation*^ drawn up by the 
Sun, from stinking Matter, 
Dung, Carcasses of dcadllorses, 
and other Carrion, in and about 
the City, the removing of ishich 
noysome Inconveniences, and 
keeping the Streets sweet, and 
clean, was soon found to 
tend much to the abatement of 
the Disease. A second cause 
was found to be Diet. For 
although there was no such 
scarcity of Provisions, as fore- 
edany of the Inhabitants (Scho- 
lars or others) to feed upon bad 
Meats, yet the Drink could not 
be excused, being, for the most 
part, (by reasonofthe multitude, 
and concourse of people) over- 
new, and not ripe or fit for 
drinking. Which Inconvenience 
is what we still complain of. 
And therefore &apos;tis wished the 
Brewers zcould somewhat re- 
gard our health, as well as 
their oisn profit, in drying their 
Mault sufficiently, throughly 
boyling their Beer, and making- 
clean their Vessels ; whereas a 
common Complaint against them 
is, that they make use of slack- 
dried Mault, do not half boyl 
their Beer, that they add few or 
no Hopps, and tun it up in un. 
-cashed Vessels, which causeth 
the Drink to be crude, raw, and 
apt to corrupt within -us. To 



which Observation we may add, 
that the Brew-houses all stand 
upon the Banks of the River 
Isis, which of it self is a cold 
hungry Water, the source and 
springs of it arising from Cots- 
wold in Gloucestershire : where 
at the spring head, the extre- 
mity of Coldness in the Water 
is such, that, as it is observed, 
Beasts refuse to drink of it ; 
how great care then ought the 
Brewers to take i&apos;th&apos; boyling, 
whereby to alter, and amend this 
qualify of the water ? This Di- 
sease as it proved mortal to 
some, so it hung long upon 
others; but then many pre- 
vented the ill Effects by using 
this method. Presently upon 
complaint of Chilness, of aking 
and dizziness in the Head, they 
took a Cordial, went straitway 
into bed, and swet, and rose 
next day, without any distemper: 
which might very well be, by 
discussing, and expelling the 
^xa-fAM, and inquinamentum pu. 
tredinale, before it had fer- 
mented, and assimilated the 
whole Masse. And by this 
means alone was cured that 
most fatal Disease fyonms, or 
Sudor Anglicus, which raged 
with such destructive violence 
(&apos;till constant sweating for 
24 houres, the only certain 
Remedy was found out) that

reason to think so, since there 
are so many Deans in Eng- 
land, that from their very na- 
ture all shew what the mean- 
ing of that Term is ; which 
puts me tit mind of a very 
pleasant valley called Cookham 
Dean, (in the Parish of Cook- 
ham) in Berks, which as &apos;tis 
near Maidenhead in that Coun- 
ty, so, withall, &apos;tis but at a 
tittle distance from Great- 
Marlow in Buckinghamshire, 
which is a very pleasant, tho* 
very poor Market-Town ; uhere 
however there is plenty of Fish, 
.Corn and Wood, whence the 
People of Great- Marlow com-

catching, Cora for snatching, 
and Wood for fetching. And 
now upon writing these parti- 
culars, I cannot but observe, 
that Kimpton, near Andover in 
/Jampshire, seems to .me to be 
the same with Kempton. It 
teas usual to change e into i. 
The Syllable ton for toun is 
very common. Nor will what 
I note seem at all improbable 
to those, that shall consider, 
that the Parish of Kimpton, 
as lam informed (for I never 
saw it my self) by the pre- 
sent learned Rector thereof, the 
Reverend Mr* George Gresn- 
way, is encompassed with Ro- 
man camps, ways,&amp;c. on every 



side, and that Roman Urns and 
Coins, and other Curiosities 
have been frequently discovered 
thereabouts. Two Urns have 
been found in the Parish since 
Mr. Greenway came to it, one 
a Sepulchral Urn with bones 
in it, and several teeth as firm 
as ever he saw, that he gave

the other were many Coins 
found, seven of which, viz. 
one of Silver, the others of

the same Book tells &apos; us be- 
long&apos;d, in Bernesh Hundred

that it was also part of Abbot&apos;s

eighty acres. And moreover, 
whereas the same Register in.

ways did belong, to the Abbey 
of Abbington, contain&apos; din Edw. 
the Confessor&apos;s time 50 2 hides, 
and but 30 in K. William the 
Conqueror&apos;s, the meaning is, 
that in the former King&apos;s time 
it consisted of eight thousand 
acres, in the latter&apos; s of only 
four thousand eight hundred. 
Yet it must be granted, that as 
there were great Alterations be. 
tween K. Edward the Confess-

rather use haw, hay, or hack)

and not, as others do, house, 
so as there were in Walling, 
ford 276 hedges in the time 
of E. Conf. 8 of which were de. 
stroy&apos;d for the Castle, that was 
built by K. William Conq. in 
lieu of an older Castle, that had, 
I suppose, been originally built 
by the Romans, tho&apos; utterly 
destroy&apos;d by the Danes. Which 
hedges were made of (vimina) 
twigs, wattles, $c. and from 
thence our fences of closes, 
grounds, and fields are now sti- 
led by the same name ; but then 
being covered at the top fit 
for lodging, (just as the an- 
cient cassati, which had land 
annex&apos;d, were) they are com- 
monly translated houses, as if 
domus and haga were really the 
same kind oflnclosure or Fence, 
whereas haga or hedge was of 
a more ordinary kind of work, 
tho&apos; generally large, as may 
appear not only from their be. 
ing call&apos;d curies in Hearing&apos;s 
Chartulary of the Church of 
Worcester &apos;, but from the pre- 
sent site of Wallingford Castle, 
which is about five Acres, and 
shews that formerly an haga or 
hedge (since eight hagce only 
were pull&apos;d down and destroy&apos;d 
for building it) was of a consi- 
derable extent and compass. But 
now whereas the word domus 



instead of haga occurrs in Do- 
mesday Book, where it speaks 
of Oxford, as I take it we are 
thereby to understand, that tha 
Buildings of Oxford were far 
better than those at Walling, 
ford. For that I think the true 
signification of domus will war- 
rant, the word really denoting 
Buildings or Inclosures of a much 
better kind than those call&apos;d 
httgcu. A thing which may also 
appear from Publius Victor&apos;s 
Description of Rome, in which 
tho&apos; the several Wards are re- 
prest-nftd as large, yet the Do- 
mus, a word always there used, 
as &apos;tis also in the old anony- 
mous Description of the same 
City published by Labbe, are 
but few in comparison of the 
Extent of those Wards; much 
fewer indeed than the Wards of 
the City of Constantinople, de. 
scribed also by another anony- 
mous Author published by the 
same Labbe, and yet the Wards 
of Constantinople were less than 
those of Rome. I should there- 
fore readily conclude, that the 
Domus in Constantinople (for 
that is the Word there used 
also, that of haga being not 
as yet come into fashion) 
were nothing near so big 
nor so fine as those at 
Rome, and yet in both places

they were of stone, to which 
the word haga cannot proper- 
ly agree, which I look upon 
therefore as one reason, why 
&apos;tis not used with respect to 
Oxford, where they had be- 
gun to have some Stone build- 
ings some time before the Con- 
quest, as may appear from St. 
Grymbald&apos;s building St. Peter&apos;s 
Church in the East of Stone out 
of Hengesteseiht (commonly call&apos;d 
Hinxey) Quarry, Masons be- 
ing brought for that end out 
of Normandy, at which time 
also instead of hagce other do- 
mus were erected of Stone, and 
the method of building there- 
with being now learned, it soon 
began to be established and prac- 
tised elsewhere, tho&apos; not with- 
out much interruption 1 . Yet 
tho&apos; I should reckon St. Peter&apos;s 
Church among the old Domus 
of Oxford, it ought neverthe- 
less by no means to be reck- 
oned in the Taxation of Wil- 
liam the Conq. in which not- 
withstanding I fear the three fa- 
mous Halls were reckoned that 
were built by King Alfred, be- 
cause I find&apos;, that K. William 
withdrew the Exhibitions that K. 
Alfred had settled upon his 



Schools, tho&apos; others say 3 that 
K. Harold depriv&apos;d these Schools 
of their Revenue, and totally 
destroy&apos;d the two lesser of K. 
Alfred&apos;s Halls. But be this as 
it will, those Halls ought pro- 
perly to be stiled domus, yet 
perhaps being so much superi- 
or to the generality of build- 
ings then in Oxford, had the 
anonymous author of the De- 
scription of Constantinople seen 
them and described Oxford, 
he would, it may be, have called 
them domus nobilissimce^ an 
expression he uses with respect 
to houses of a better kind than 
ordinary. However notwith- 
standing this difference between 
domus and haga, AVC cannot de- 
termine for certain how big ge- 
nerally those domus were in 
Oxford. There is no doubt but 
they were large, since Domes, 
day Book 4 tells us, that in Wil- 
liam the Conqueror&apos;s time there 
were only 243 domus both with- 
in and without the Walls of Ox- 
ford, besides 20 mural mansions, 
call&apos;d so because, upon occasion, 
they were obliged to repair 
the Walls (in order to which 
there were there, as well as

the year 1263. (47 //. 3.) at 
the time Prince Ed-card passed 
by Oxford, in his Journey to-

The zchole Passage in Robert

deservedly taken (tho\ as it 
seems, from second hand &apos;) 
into Mr. Wood&apos;s History and

Mistakes, which render it un-

undertook to metaphrase Robert 
of Gloucester, but in doing it he 
hath committed many Mistakes^ 
and oftentimes miserably cur-,

where he did not understand his 
Author, as may, in some mea- 
sure, be learned from this very 
Passage about the said Conflict, 
where he hath quite pass&apos;d over 
those remarkable Words hare 
well, purely, as I conceive, be- 
cause he did not understand the 
Signification of the Expression, 
which is no more than old well, 
and is to be understood of Wai-

in my Preface to Rob. of Glou-

Daughters, (not fifty one, as 
in Hector Boethius) who hav-

which was named Albion by

The Story occurs in Caxton and

Latin at the beginning of an 
old vellum MS 1 , of Gejfry

my learned Friend, Thomas 
Rawlinson, Esq;. where never, 
theless are only XXX Daugh.

Tho&quot; 1 there is not one material 
point of History in Mr. Ward&apos;s 
MS. but what is already well 
known, and far better and 
more fully delivered in the ori- 
ginal ef Robert of Gloucester, 
that I printed, yet &apos;tis a great 
Curiosity, and worth preserv- 
ing, being really different (as 
far as t can remember) from 



all the MSS. of the History 
or Chronicle, commonly call&apos;d 
Brute of England, that I have 
seen hitherto*. There is a 
Picture at the beginning of Dio- 
clecian and his Daughters. The- 
King is represented standing, 
with a sword in his right hand, 
and an hat, or sort of bonnet, 
upon his head. The Daugh- 
ters are represented going to a 
Ship. Jt ends at the Battle of 
Lewes, in which it says, that 
the King of Almaine was taken 
in a Windmill, and that Prince 
Edicurd fled into the Minor (or 
Grey) Friers. And when the 
two ostes (these are the Words) 
Diet, there was many a modre 
sonne broght to grounde, and 
the kynge of Almayne was taken 
in a wyndemylle, J?at som tyme 
was duke of Cornewalle, and 
Sir Edward ron to the Froiera 
Menores ....

it seems to signify here from 
the toord medis immediately 
following. The IVordsmoor and 
meer in the South parts of Eng- 
land are confounded, zzhence 
&apos;tis, that the great meer near 
Bicester is called Otmoor, when 
it should be Otmeer or Otmere. 
The Word mora also is taken in 
both senses in the middle-aged 
Latin Writers, //to&apos; it more fre- 
quently signifies in-, them a fenny 
or moist place, oS so &apos;tis cer- 
tainly to be understood in John 
of Glastonbury, when he is 
speaking of the XII. Hides of 
Glastonbury. Between Rother- 
field Grays and Neltlebed in 
Oxfordshire is an Hamlet called 
Highmor, which I once thought 1 
should be High meer, meer sig- 



nifying often a boundary; but 
I am since sufficiently satisfy&apos;d, 
that it is rightly called High, 
mor or Highmore, being an high, 
barren, dry Ground, where is 
a prodigious Quantity of black 
Cherries, which grow in the very 
Hedges. And just above Sand, 
ford, as zee go from Oxford to 
Dorchester, is a dry barren 
Soil, which they call Basse-More 
(not from one Bassus *, a Ro*. 
man General, that got a great 
Victory here, as some haie right 
foolishly suggested,but)from if 9 
being a low Moor, or low dry 
barren ground, in opposition to 
the high dry barren ground, 
that is farther off than this, 
being upon the Hill just be- 
yond the way that turns off 
to Newnham Courtney, and 
may therefore be properly sti. 
led, as the Moor by Nettle- 
bed is, Highmor or Highmore. 
And this / mention of mores 
brings fo my mind a remark- 
able Passage (concerning a 
dry ground, &apos;call&apos;d Hob More^). 
that occurrs in a Letter that 
u-as writ to me from Mickle-

turday July 28&apos;*. 1723. by 
my very worthy Friend, Ri- 
chard Graves, Esq;. It is this.

&quot; there interred. Before she 
&quot; departed att Kimbolton, shee 
&quot; had lyen two yeares at Bug- 
&quot; den, passing her solitarie life 
&quot; in much prayer, great almes 
&quot; and abstinence, and when 
&quot; shee was not this way occu- 
&quot; pied, then was shee and her 
&quot; gentlewomen workeing with 
&quot; their owne hands, something 
&quot; wrought in needleworke cost- 
&quot; lie and artificially, which 
&quot; shee intended to the honour 
&quot; of God to bestow upon some 
*&apos; Churches. There was in 
&quot; the said house of Bugdeu a 
&quot; chamber, with a window, 
&quot; that had a prospect into 
** the chappell, out of the 
&quot; which shee might heare di- 
&quot; vine service. In this cham- 
&quot; ber shee inclosed her selfe, 
&quot; sequestred from all other 
&quot; company, a greate part of 
&quot; the day and night, and upon 
&quot; her Knees used to pray att 
&quot; the said windowe, leaning 
&quot; upon the stones of the same. 
&quot; There 1 was some of her gen- 
&quot; tlewomen, which did curi- 
&quot; ously marke and observe all 
&quot; her doeings, who reported, 
&quot; that often times they found 
&quot; the said stones so wett after 
&quot; her departure, as though it 
&quot; had rained upon them. It 



&quot; was credibly thought, that in 
&quot; the time of her prayer shee 
&quot; removed the cushions, that 
&quot; ordinarily lay in the same 
&quot; Window, and that the said 
&quot; stones were imbrued with the 
&quot; tears of her devoute Eyes. I 
&quot; have credibly also heard, that 
&quot; att a time, when one of her 
&quot; Gentlewomen began to curse 
*&apos; the Ladie Anne Bull :&quot; [with 
whom Sir Thomas Wyatt the 
elder had had carnal pleasure, 
before the King married her, as 
Sir Thomas himself told th 
King when he endeavoured to 
disswade his Majesty from the 
Match, because her conversation 
had been very loose and base, 
if you will believe what this 
Author observes in another 
place] &quot; she answered, hold 
&quot; your peace, curse her not, but 
l&lt;pray for her, for the time will 
&quot; come shortly, when you shall 
&quot; have much neede to pittie and 
&quot; lament her case, and so it 
&quot;&apos; chanced indeed.&apos;&apos; In short, 
this Lady was one of the greatest 
patterns of true Humility, Chas- 
tity, and all Virtues, of that age, 
and &apos;twould have been very hap- 
py (according to this writer) 
for the King to have acted con.

&apos; Vertue, Prayer and Religion, 
&quot; but allso of the publicke com-

&quot; importable. I say, they were 
&quot; the very Nurseryes, not only 
f&lt;of pietie and devotion, but 
&quot; allso of the happy flourishing 
&quot; of the common wealth. Where 
&quot; were the blind and lame, or

&quot; bee said of other places. 
&quot; Where were Noblemens, Gen-

termed them, or as we may say, round battailes, in 
forme of a circle, in the whiche stoode theyr people, 
that caried long staues or speares which they crossed 
ioyntly togither one wythin an other, betwixt which 
schiltrons or round battails were certain spaces left, the 
which wer filled wyth theyr archers and bowmen, and 
behinde all these were theyr horsmen placed. They 
had chosen a strong grounde, somewhat sideling on the 
side of a hill. The Erles Marshall, Herford, and Lin-

at the first made directly towardes the Scottes, but 
they were stayed by reason they founde a marys, or an 
euill favoured mosse betwixt theyr enemyes and them, 
so that they were constreyned to fetche a compasse to- 
wardes the weste side of the fielde. 

The Byshop of Durham ruling in the seconde bat-

or maris, made toward the Easte side, hasting forth to

Knyght the Lorde Raufe Basset of Drayton sayde to

noted in the Statutes of the

the Prima Hora, or Prime, the

Nights ; which is also divided 
into four Vigils, the Contici-

and Antelucinium. Now since 
their Mattins rrere performed 
about break of day, and their 
Prime, by consequence, at 6 
Clock in the morning, I can see 
no reason to doubt, but the 
hour of Tierce was 9 a Clock 
in the Morning, and so the rest 
at 3 hours distance one after the 
other. And this Determina-

One would think from the 
first of these Notes, that the 
MS. is, at least, as old as the 
Reign of K. Richard the first. 
And yet, as soon as I saw it, 
I guess&apos;d it to be much more 
modern. And I soon found my 
conjecture confirm&apos;d from the 
mention (in the body of the 
book, in the very- same hand 



with the rest) of Pope Sixtus 
the fourth thus : Dominus pa- 
pa Sixtus quartus composuit 
quartam Sf quintam praidicto- 
rum sujfragiorum oraciunQulas* 
Et cum hoc omnes indulgencias 
hcec legentibus per ante con. 
cessas duplicavit. Now Sixtus 
the fourth being made Pope in 
1471. and dying in 1484. the 
Book cannot be older than the 
Reign of Edw. IV. I suppose, 
therefore, that the Note relates 
really to some other older 
Breviary or Book of Offices, 
of which this (which is finely 
written, in good large cha- 
racters, such as were proper 
for elderly people, and those 
that had bad Eyes) may have 
been a Copy. The like Note 
occurrs both in Hackluyt and 
\Veever ; but there being some 
differences, I question whether 
it were immediately from the 
same MS. That the Reader may 
the better perceive the Varia- 
tions, I shall transcribe the Copy 
as &apos;tis in Weever&apos;s Ancient Fu~ 
nerall Monuments, pag. 818.

*&apos; College of Arms in London, 
&quot; Saturday 16 of May 1124. 

Sir, 

&quot; In your Glossary to Ro. 
bert of Glouc. page 640. 
you mention the famous 
champion of Mershland in 
Norfolk, whose story hath 
been long since printed in 
a black letter, but the signi. 
fication of the fable I am not 
yet satisfied fully about. Tho 
I intend, this vacation, to 
travel over Mershland in 
Norfolk, to find out more 
certainty; in the mean time, 
I would beg to know, what 
is in your MSS. vol. 61. p. 
117. and vol. 82. p. 67. said 
of him. The most probable 
opinion is Sir Henry Spel- 
man&apos;s, and that of Mr. Weav- 
er in his funerall Monuments, 
pag. 818. (from Hackluit) in 
his Discourse of Terrington 
in that country, who tells you, 
that Sir Frederick de Tylney, 
a valiant Knight, was at the 
seige of Aeon with King Ric. 
I.&amp;lyes buried in Tirington 
church. yard, and, I sup. 
pose, haveing a cross on the 
upper end of a long staff, 



cult on his tomb, (which 
suppose something like the 
cross in the hand of the cutt 
of the Knight templer in Dug- 
dale Mon. Angl. [and] might 
give rise to the story of the 
wheele&amp;axle tree,) as dyeing 
in the holy laud, might be 
the person, who either gave 
the .large common to the 
inhabitants of the towns round 
(called Tilney Smeth) or ra- 
ther recovered it for them 
by his power or lawe from 
some person, who had inclosed 
it. (Quaere if Hycophrix is 
not a corruption of Frede. 
rick?) The story about the 16 
Knights of the name succeed- 
ing him is false. For they 
were not all Knights, neither 
were sixteen descents from 
him to Sir Philip Tilney, Knt. 
whose daughter was second 
wife of Tho. Duke of Norfolk,&amp;which Duke married to his 
first Wife Eliz. daughter&amp;sole heir of Frederick Tylney, 
Esq: not Knight, of Boston

Legate was forced, for secu- 
rity, to get into the Steeple of 
Osney Abbey Church, the Scho- 
lars of Oxford being enraged 
to such a degree, from the 
Affront put upon them by one 
of his servants, that, in all 
probability, he might, other- 
wise, have lost his Life. The 
matter was afterwards accom- 
modated, but with Loss to the 
Scholars, as may be learned 
from Mr. Wood&apos;s account there- 
of, in his History and Anti- 
quities of the University of 
Oxford, under the years ciocc. 
xxxu x, cioccxxxix. But then 
Mr. Wood does not take no- 
tice of what Robert of Glou- 
cester says thereof, having not, 
I suppose, met with it in the 
Papers {for I do not think, 
that he had seen Robert of 
Gloucester himself l ) which he 
perused; and yet Robert&apos;s ac- 
count ought not to have been 
passed over, as having something 
in it very particular about an 



allowance, that the Scholars 
made to the Legate, even at 
much as he spent in commons 
(or in his Family or Houshold) 
in the Week, which was a great 
Burthen, considering that it 
lusted many Weeks together, and 
that the Legate, and his Reti- 
nue, which was very large, lived 
very magnificently, and spent 
much, notwithstanding the f re, 
quent Treats they met with. 
But the MS. prose Chronicle, in 
Mr. Ward of Longbridge&apos;t 
hands, represents this com- 
promise, as if the Scholars 
granted the Legate as much as 
every Scholar&apos;s Commons came 
to by the Week, whereas the 
original Words have another 
Sense, viz. uhat I have men- 
tioned^ that they allowed him 
as much as he spent in the 
Week in Commons, which might 
be therefore sometimes more, 
sometimes less (but always, to 
be sure, very great) as occasions 
offered.

&quot; tion, but the Judgement of 
&quot; after ages. And Theft (with. 
it out a paradox) in writers of 
&quot; Historyes is plain dealing 
li Sf an argument of Truth. 
&quot; Onely it is Ingenuity in the 
&quot; Historian, and satisfaction to 
&quot; the Reader, to confess from 
&quot; whom he tuok his Storie upon 
&quot; Trust. In my Journey there- 
&quot; fore through this Historic, 
&quot; I first light into the Com. 
&quot;pany of St. Beda, who told 
&quot; me he was eleven years old 
&quot; at St. Cuthbert 1 s death, and 
&quot; upon good information had 
&quot; writ his life. A little further 
&quot; I met with Turgotus Prior 
&quot; of Durham, one that was an 
&quot; eye witnesse of St. Cuthberfs 
incorruption, Sf had made 
tl diligent searches into the An- 
li tiquities of Lindisfarn, 4&apos; 
&quot; Chester, who brought me for. 
61 ward a great part of my way : 
*&apos; till I overtook one Laurentius 
61 a Monk of Durham, who 
&quot; continued to me the Dis- 
&quot; course of St. Cuthbert, 
&quot; where Turgotus had left off: 
t( Sf travailing on I fortuned&lt;{ to happ upon my Ccuntrie-&lt;c man Simeon of Durham, but 



11 Roger Hovenden told me 
&quot; the same tale. Afterwards 
tl I had the company of Mal- 
u mesburiensis, Nubrigensis, 
c &apos; Parisiensis, IVestmonasteri- 
11 ensis, Hygden, icho all had 
*&apos; travailed the way I was to 
&quot; go, and could tell me Stories 
&quot; of St. Cuthbert. But Cup- 
&quot; grave a Monk of Bury pass- 
&quot; ed all for telling wonders, 
11 Sf one Nicolas of Finchalc 
il coseri&apos;d some few miles wiflt 
&quot; a merry relation of St. God- 
&quot; ric. Harpsfield also stood 
&quot; me in stead by his direc. 
&quot; tion, when I had almost lost 
11 my way, icith many others, I 
&quot; mett besides, of whom I 
11 asked the way to my Jour-

&quot; N. B. In pag. 248. of this Work is a short account 
of the taking of Aeon or Acres from the Christians by 
the Saracens in the year 1292, upon occasion of which 
I shall here beg leave to publish a Letter of Soldon Em- 
perour of the Turks directed to a Christian King, as it 
~cas transcribed and sent to me from the Register of 
John de Pontissera Bishop of Winchester by my learned 
friend the Reverend Mr. Richard Furney, Archdeacon 
of Surrey. *7Vs a Curiosity, and as it pleased me t so 
I believe it may not be displeasing to curious Headers.

emplum, et uniat te cum obedientibus private et mani- 
feste, qui rccepit in propria persona cum patientia tri- 
bulationem emcrgentem supra suam nationem, ex quo 
viam invenire non potuit resistendi, facimus vobis 
notum, quod Civitatcm Aconen : quae erat sedts fidei 
crucis, couquisivimus, cam in tam puucis diebus obse- 
dimus, quod milites cum omni sua potentia earn de- 
fendere non valebant, nee resistcre multitudini exercitus 
obsidentis, et cum sustinere nequiverunt propter mul- 
titudinem occisorum, quant umcunque nominati essent 
et laudati milites, una brevi bora diei omnes a nobis 
ferrati fuerunt et compediti. Omnrs Milites Hospital: 
noster consumpsit vibrans ensis. Templarii Civitatem 
Aconen : prodiderunt et fratres terrain perdere dubi- 
tantes, set nee sic ruinas eventum evaserimf . Consump- 
to tofaliter Hospitali Alamanorum, Ecclesias omnes ter- 
ras coacquavimus, super altaribus trucidatis qui popu- 
lum ad obedientiam ipsorum inducebant : Patriarcha 
finali supplicio liberato, copiam aurorum credere non 
possetis qui ad manus hominum devenerunt. Tanta 
fuit Dorninarum multitudo, quod una pro drag- 
ma vendebatur. Civitate conversa in agricultural!! et 
desertum, Illius civitatis notorius est conqutstus, et ex 
praesentium literarum nostrarum exhibitione scire pote- 
ritis, quomodo mortuorum corpora balistariis coajquan- 
(ur, ignem supponentes mortuorum corponbus-in pul- 
verem sunt redacta. Ex armamentis fieri fecimus com- 
pedes pro pedibus. Qui vivi nobiscum remansc&apos;runt 
Comites et Barones, qui signa super eorum capita por- 
tare consueverant, ligatis pedibus et manibus nostris 
carceribus mancipantur. Et tu Rex si teipsum castiga- 
vcris per liujus rei eventum, qui super civitatem Acou

noii feci&apos;ris. super te dicetur quod dicitur, super eis 
pcribis tu et terra tua, sicut ipsi per ensem nostrum 
perierunt. Et si cognoveris event um eorum qua? acci- 
derunt, erit tibi ad profectuni, et venias personaliter 
cum donis tuis et tribulo duorum annorum ad altitudi- 
neni porlarum iiostrarum, sicut homo qui vult salutem
