Tasting Notes

This is our classic, lively and vibrant New England breakfast cup. It offers a snappy, crisp and citrusy Central American coffee matched with the sweetness, body and depth of an Indonesian bean to create a wakeful blend that won’t try to compete with your orange juice in terms of its brightness.
 

&quot;Great balance of vibrance and sweetness. The right body brings harmony to sparkling acidity and toasted nut tones.&quot;
– Lindsey Bolger , Director of Coffee Sourcing and Relationships 
 Rating: 91 Points (out of 100)
 
The aroma is rich with floral notes and a pungent black-currant-like fruit. Delicately and sweetly tart acidity; smooth, silky mouthfeel. The black currant note carries into the cup with an enveloping hint of dark chocolate. Slight hint of drying astringency in the finish.
–Kenneth Davids, CoffeeReview.com , February, 2011
 
About Green Mountain Coffee®
 
 

 

A great tasting cup of coffee can give you a whole new perspective. It&apos;s a moment to pause, reflect, and reprioritize. That moment is what inspires us to make coffee that benefits everyone it touches. From carefully sourcing and roasting the highest quality beans, to supporting small farms and protecting the environment, we focus on what&apos;s important.

That&apos;s why we at Green Mountain Coffee® believe a good cup of coffee can change your day... but a great cup of coffee can help change the world.
 
Notes From Origin

One of the components of Breakfast Blend is the Costa Rican coffee that we buy from the Vargas family in the Central Valley of Costa Rica in Alajuela. On the horizon rises the majestic form of Poas, the world&apos;s largest volcanic crater. Against this impressive backdrop is set Doka, the garden-like estate that has been lovingly farmed by the same family for four generations.

The Vargas family has struck the perfect balance between tradition and technological progress. On any given day, Don Rodrigo Vargas is just as likely to be found examining the results of his most recent agricultural experiment as he is overseeing the century-old ritual of drying coffee on Doka&apos;s sun-bathed patios. The Vargas family is involved in sugar, dairy, and coffee. There are 6 families on 32 farms totaling over 1000 acres, 22% of which is conserved, 60% is shade-grown coffee; there are three mills, 278 full-time employees and 3,100 coffee pickers.

In March 2008, our own Lindsey Bolger, Director of Coffee Sourcing and Relationships, was invited to Doka to cup (a rigorous and objective form of sensory evaluation) some of their fine coffee. As we&apos;ve been buying from the Vargas family for years, a number of our employees have visited, including Deb Crowther, one of our cuppers and green bean buyer. While Don Rodrigo hasn&apos;t visited yet, his daughter Natalie was here in Waterbury, VT, in the fall of 2007 for a visit.

Comments about Green Mountain Coffee 12oz. GRND Breakfast Blend :

I used to drink coffee all the time, but fell out of the habit after I became a cashier at a [@]. There people would throw their coffee into the garbages under the registers w/out finishing them and then it stayed there all morning(The morning ppl never changed the trash) so finally I decided to get back into drinking coffee after my boyfriend had me try the breakfast blend. VERY delicious! As an experiment we added a couple of tablespoons of cinnamon, one tablespoon of nutmeg and one of ginger into the coffee grounds. Made a HUGE difference in taste. I also decided to do a spoonful of instant cocoa powder also with good results. Add milk and little sugar and you got a great cup that makes you feel it should be illegal to have! Highly recommend trying this!
 
 Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend
