 ABOUT AEP BIO-ACTIVE GREASE INTERCEPTOR   As the world population grows each year, the amount of Fat, Oils and Grease (FOG) accumulation also increases resulting in more wastewater generated and being discharged to the riverside. FOG are mainly produce from animals and vegetables fats in the foodstuff that we consumed on a daily basis. FOG will eventually lead to pipeline blockage if it is not handle properly. If the pipeline is not maintained properly overtime, usually the FOG will solidify inside the piping system which resulting the need to replace a new pipeline system which would be a costly repair for the owner.   Typical Pipe Failure Cycle (Without AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor)             New 4”pipe     Grease clogged down to 2”, pipe flow reduce to 50%     Grease clogged down to 1”or less, pipe flow reduce to 80%. Outer layer becomes solidified.       Result 
All water flowrate is accessible.     Result 
Half water flowrate is accessible and causing overflow in pipeline system and maintenance is require.     Result 
Less than half or no water flowrate is accessible causing whole pipeline system failure and replacement is required.       Advantages of Installing AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor    a. To overcome building pipeline system from becoming clogged overtime.    b. To reduce the chances of sewer pipelines to become clogged.    c. To reduce the operation needs for sewer treatment plant to process the wastewater.    d. To prevent and reduced environmental water pollution caused by FOG to landfills and riverside.    e. To recycle grease waste for other commercial application. (E.g. fertilizer,  organic composite, animal feed and etc.)   Therefore, AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor is an effective, reliable and hygiene system is required to overcome the FOG issues to protect and maintain a clean and healthy living environment. AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor is the solutions to solve all your FOG problems with offering wide ranges of interceptor sizing and accessories to meet your requirement and applications.     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; READ MORE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   
 
 AEP BIO-ACTIVE GREASE INTERCEPTOR SYSTEM   (A) Overview of AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor System AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor unit comes in two chambers and two access covers. The first compartment comes
with a stainless steel perforated bucket to filter out the incoming solid waste and starch from the kitchen sinks. Both
chambers are fitted with separator baffle units to direct fats, oils, grease and waste water effluent effectively.
Wastewater in the form of emulsion discharges from kitchen sinks and dishwasher which contain air, fats, oils, grease
and food particles will be flushed to the inlet of the interceptor unit. When wastewater enters the first chamber, food
particles will be trapped and filtered out through the stainless steel perforated basket allowing only the emulsion effluent
to flow through the second chamber. The entrained air rapidly causes the separation of effluent. Effluent is directed
through the separation chamber of the interceptor by means of baffles. Baffle serves to prolong the effluent flow path to
increase the separation time while providing a non-turbulent environment for effective separation.   (B) The Advantages of AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor System   The air release provides small amount of buoyancy pressure to the FOG contents in the separation chamber by
regulating the internal running water level of the grease interceptor. The water generates rush air which accelerates the
separation process of FOG, resulting it to rise rapidly to the surface of the water in the separation chamber. The rising
air bubbles literally pull the FOG globules to the top of the water quickly and leaving clean water below.   
   Key Factors for Sizing an AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor Unit a. Amount of Meals Served During Peak Hours:–
Amount of fats, oils and grease accumulation. b. Flowrate: –
The greater the flow rate, the lower the retention time. c. Retention Time: –
Amount of time taken for the FOG to travel through the system before discharging. d. Storage Factors: –
Number of hours the unit is operating continuously. e. Pump Out Frequency: –
Discharge frequencies to ensure optimize cleaning. f. Chemistry: –
Temperature and waste emulsion that affected fats, oils and grease separation process. 
   Sizing Method of AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor Unit   
 1. Based on the drainage fixtures unit. 2. Based on the wastewater flowrate of pipeline connection with pump discharge. 3. Based on the point of used fixtures size and diversity factor of the capacity load. 4. Based on the storage size capacity. 
 
 Method 1:  Based On Drainage Fixtures Unit   
 Commercial Sink Dimensions (mm) Outlet Size (Inch) Unit Value (Fixture) GPM Equivalent Flow Rate Size (GPM) 305mm x 305mm x 152mm 1 ¼ 2 5.80 7 305mm x 457mm x 203mm 1 ¼ 1 7.80 10 305mm x 406mm x 305mm 1 ¼ 4 8.70 10 457mm x 508mm x 203mm 1 ½ 1 12.40 15 508mm x 610mm x 305mm 2 2 21.80 25 
 Since the possibilities of all the fixtures are used simultaneously, taking an average total values and considering sufficient loading factor for individual fixtures is important.   Method 2: Based On Flowrate of Pipeline Connection With Pump Discharge 
 Where Q : is the flowrate to a grease interceptor in L/s. Where V : is the volume of the fixture in L. Where DDT : is the drain down time, 60 or 120 seconds (1 or 2 minutes). Where PD : is any pump discharge in L/s. Where N : is the number of fixtures to go through the interceptor. 
   Example of Calculations:-   To determine the size of a Grease Interceptor serving a double-bowl commercial kitchen sink. Each bowl measures 900mm x 450mm x 300mm.   a. Calculate the capacity of each bowl in liters:-   
 900mm x 450mm x 300mm = 121,500,000 mm3 per bowl 121,500,000 mm3 / 1,000,000 mm3 = 121.5 L per bowl 121.5 L x 2 bowls = 243 L total capacity of the sink 
   Convert the total capacity of the sink into liters per second flow :-         0.75 (factor) x 243/60s = 3.0375 L/s or x 60s = 182.25 L/min total flowrate #   If there is a pump discharging through the grease interceptor, add pump discharge rate according to the formula which the value should be known.   Method 3:  Based On Point of Use Fixture Sizing   Sizing Calculations:- 
 a. Determine the volume of fixture by multiplying length, width and depth. b. Determine the capacity in gallons (conversion needed). c. Determine the actual flow rate capacity. Fixture normally filled to 75% capacity of water and contents flush were usually at 25%. d. Identify the drainage load period. (generally taken standard flow rate per minute). e. Select the model of the interceptor with flow rating equal to peak flow or the next higher rate. 
   Example of Calculations:-   
 Commercial Sink Dimension(mm) Unit Value (Fixtures) Unit
Flow Rate (GPM) Total
Flow Rate (GPM) Diversity Factor (%) Flow
Rate Size (GPM) Floor Drains
(80mm x 80mm) 2 8 16     Hand Washing Sink
(305mm x 406mm x 305mm) 3 10 30 Single Bowl Dishwasher Sink
(457mm x 508mm x 203mm) 1 15 15 Double Bowl Dishwasher Sink
(508mm x 610mm x 305mm) 2 25 50 Total  111 75% 83 GPM 
 For this particular scenario, the recommended model would be:-
AE8100 (100 GPM) (Rounded up to next highest value)   Method 4: Based On Storage Size Capacity

   Example of Calculations:-   A restaurant operates on a daily basis serving western cuisine on 2 operating meals session per day from 7.00am to 3.00pm. The maximum seating the restaurant can cater at one time is 760 seats. The restaurant is operating using a single service kitchen concept.   
 1.  Sizing of AEP G.I.= No. Meals Per Peak Hour x Peak Factor x Waste Flow Rate x Retention Time x Storage Factor Max Seating Capacity Per Peak Hour = 760 Seats Operating Meal Hours = 2 (breakfast and lunch)
@ 8 hours (assume 7.00am – 3.00pm) 
 Workings:- 
 AEP Sizing (Volume) = (760 seats x 1.00 peak factor) x 5 gallon x 2 1/2 hrs x 1.0 (8 hours)   ≈  9500 gallons x 10% (to cater for over volume)   ≈  10,450 gallons / 60mins (1hr = 60 mins)   =  175 GPM (select highest value grease sizing)   =  200 GPM# 
   Explanation:- 
 a. Number of Meals At Peak Hour.   Maximum seating capacity a restaurant can cater meals at peak hours. b. Peak Factor   Peak factor of grease interceptor depends on the design load size and the flow rate of the system. c. Waste Flow rate   It measures flow volume of sediment into the grease interceptor unit.  Approximately 5 gallons of effluent flows. d. Retention Time in hours   This measure the efficiency of the grease interceptor to retain the effluent inside the system. Sufficient retention time is important for efficient performance of the system. e. Storage Factor   Depending on the number of work hours, storage factor measures the time period needed for the grease interceptor to remain operational&amp;reflect on the unit’s capability to retain the O&amp;G within the operating hours. 
   Maintenance Guide for AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor Unit   
 a. By Manual Scoop.   The grease layer on the top of the water layer should be scooped  up regularly to avoid clogging of  the interceptor unit. Please ensure that the grease layer is scooped up entirely.
 Recommended cleaning frequency:-
Once or more in a week depending on the volume of the incoming FOG.     b. By Using AEP Bio-Active Liquid Enzyme.   The enzyme digests and turns the grease into water&amp;carbon dioxide by bio-degradation of the grease layer. When thickening is sighted with significant layers of FOG buildup around the water surface with heavy pungent odour emitted, it is advisable to increase the enzyme dosage rate to compensate. The degradation process is working if contents appear in semi-liquid state with no odour emitted. Dosing procedure must be repeated according to initial dosing rate when the tank is cleaned to avoid wastage of overdosing of the enzyme.
Recommended cleaning frequency:-
Every 6 months or earlier depends on the incoming contents. Periodic cleaning is highly advisable. 
   Basic Working Principle of AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor System   AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor is specially designed to intercept grease at the optimum rate. There are three essential areas in the AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor system which is capable of filtering out the grease effectively and efficiently. AEP Bio-Active Grease Interceptor Wastewater Flow Chart       
 A. Incoming Chamber (1st Chamber)   i. Sediment Bucket – to trap and prevent solid sediment buildups inside the grease interceptor so that the system will not clog.   ii. Grease Separator Unit – the 2nd filter is to further block-out the micro solid sediment that managed to pass through the sediment bucket. The separator unit also acts as a grease dispersion system to prevent the grease from solidifying and enters into the 2nd chamber which could affect the efficiency of the unit.       B. Interceptor Chamber (2nd Chamber)   i. Baffle Pack – the 3rd filter is to direct the grease emulsion beneath that will produce better  state in separating the grease and water that flows at high velocity.   ii. Baffle Plates – the plates are used to reduce the unstable high velocity water flow condition, known as“turbulence flow”.   iii. Deep Seal Integral Trap – its function is to ensure  clean water flowing out for discharge instead of greasy water. The upper plate is fitted with air relief valve to ensure water level is always flowing consistently.
