 Dumpster diving (aka Skip diving) 
 
 Whilst living in Ireland I knew a retired couple who visited the supermarket once a week. I never once saw them inside the supermarket, they were always at the back, rummaging around the bins. Food they found that was past it&apos;s best before date was given to their animals. Anything that was only past the sell by date, they would consume themselves.

Dumpster diving is all about looking for free things amongst other people&apos;s rubbish. Divers are not just looking for a free meal. They are looking for old furniture that just needs a little repair. Electrical items such as DVD players and computer parts can also be found.

There are many places to do a spot of dumpster diving. Try the back of shops, offices, residential alley ways and building sites. My own preference is for residential alleyways. People like to dump things in alleys they can&apos;t get rid of in their rubbish or recycling bins. Wood off-cuts, flower pots, pipes, electrical wiring, you name it, I find it in alleys.

Make sure you are not breaking the law. A building site has lots of goodies on it but what you are taking may actually be used on the construction. Wooden pallets are often free to take. However, things like copper pipe or wire off-cuts may be given to a specialist recycler for a fee so do ask if you think the item is of value.

When I was a seller on eBay I went behind some shops and found all the cardboard I needed to package the items I was selling. That saved a lot of money that would have been used to buy Jiffy bags

Another place I like to visit is the local car breaking yard. Often there are bits of a car that a breaker can&apos;t be bothered to price and will let you have for nothing. Also, people use their old cars as rubbish bins. They load up the car with bits of junk and then send it to the breaker to get rid of both the car and the junk. I once found a USB/parallel printer cable on a car seat in a breaker&apos;s yard. The breaker had no idea what it was and let me have it for nothing!

 Remember 

 Local laws - be familiar with them Don&apos;t climb fences - If the gate is locked then so too is the dumpster, open or not Food - discard if best-before date has passed - food after sell-by date is okay but be cautious Dress for the occasion - you are going to get dirty Be careful - people dump all kinds of things and some things might be dangerous Make a note of which days fresh rubbish is thrown into a bin so you can get first option

Oh my. First thing I think about when I think of dumpster diving is rats, disease, raccoons that often nest there. I would not recommend that anyone do it to see what they might find. Around here the only people who dumpster dive are the homeless.

With our laws, re-cycling etc one would not find computer parts. They&apos;re not to be thrown out in the regular trash. There are specific locations where one re-cycles electronics. .

I might suggest you make sure your shots are up to date if you continue to do this.

I guess where you are is pretty hot and/or dirty. In the UK, you are not going to find a raccoon.

Of course, people should take care. Certainly not stand in a bin, maybe wear gloves.

I tend to just skim the tops of bins and never rummage. I tend only to go for bins that I know will contain dry stuff and never bother with food as I grow much of what I eat.

You&apos;ll be surprised as to what you can find in bins. There are many recycling places and yet the majority of people do not recycle. Books, electronics, even antiques.

for&quot;fresh&quot;food, you can also go to&quot;fast food restaurant&quot;bin... every 10 minutes, they have to throw away food that as not been sold because of&quot;bacteria pollution&quot;(sorry i&apos;m french... what i mean is that in 10 minutes, little organism have populated the food) and is&quot;possibily dangerous&quot;, but every item, not eaten, in a box, is good to eat ;)
