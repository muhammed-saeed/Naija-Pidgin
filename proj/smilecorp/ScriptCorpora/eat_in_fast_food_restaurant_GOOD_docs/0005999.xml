In the 1970s the Department of­Energy floated the idea of mining out a nuclear repository in the salt under centrally located Lyons, Kans. The people didn’t want it; Three Mile Island didn’t help. Carlsbad made more sense; its 3,000-foot salt layer is the thickest in the country. And the state has a nuclear history as home to the Manhattan Project. The Los Alamos and Sandia national labs continue to do a lot of nuclear work. What’s more, the people of Carlsbad know salt; they’ve been mining it since 1930 to go after seams of potash—a mineral in high demand as fertilizer.

Carlsbad’s current mayor, Dale­Janway, worked for 30 years as a safety director at the Intrepid mine, which he describes as an underground city with a claustrophobic warren of tunnels and rooms. All told, Carlsbad’s potash mines hold more than 1,000 miles of tunnels covering 100 square miles. Compared with going after potash, says Janway, digging a spacious mine to hold drums of waste is easy. The miners were all for it.

Forrest and other Carlsbad leaders saw what billions in federal investment could do for their town—and their businesses. Forrest moved to Carlsbad in the 1940s; his father started a chain of tire shops, Forrest Tires. Today, in addition to the Fairfield Inn, his family owns the aging Best Western hotel nearby and controls Carlsbad National Bank, of which he’s chairman of the board. Having grown up selling tires, says Forrest, “I’ve been a salesman all my life, and WIPP is something I’ve sold.” He rejects the idea that he’s the face of WIPP. “We don’t really have a face; our whole group supports it so heavily.” Dinner with Mayor Janway and dozens of other pro-WIPP Carlsbadians on steak night at the Elks Lodge backs him up.

Still, it wasn’t easy to sell WIPP to the rest of the state. Folks in Albuquerque and Santa Fe didn’t see why they should allow trucks to traverse their roads with other states’ waste. When Forrest in 1990 took busloads of Carlsbadians to Albuquerque for hearings on the plan, protesters threw rocks at the bus. A common sign at the time in the windows of Santa Fe and Taos art galleries: “Another business against WIPP.”

To win them over, the Energy Department brought its custom-built waste-hauling canisters to Albuquerque for punishing tests. Dropped from 30 feet onto concrete slabs, smashed into steel spikes, broiled for 30 minutes in a jet-fuel inferno—nothing fazed them. New Mexico’s then Representative Bill Richardson (later governor) dragged his feet on WIPP; Senator Domenici pushed for it in Washington. At last Energy agreed, and Congress decreed that no high-level waste would be brought to WIPP. No big deal: Congress had already ordered that stuff sent to Yucca.

Forrest says Carlsbad and DOE have contended continuously with 15 different oversight groups throughout the construction and operation of WIPP. “We were in a fishbowl. They were consulted on anything that­happened at WIPP,” says Forrest. “I don’t have a problem with it, but you couldn’t run a business like that.”

On Mar. 26, 1999 the townsfolk of Carlsbad gathered to cheer the first truck to deliver waste to WIPP. Then, as now, it passed through barbed-wire gates and armed guards to deposit its load in one of a series of giant hangar buildings, the most secure of which has concrete-reinforced walls 4.5 feet thick. Inside, past the airlocks, I was half-expecting workers in moon suits, but it’s just jeans and steel toes. The drums they handle—filled with scraps of machinery, rags, sludge and clothing contaminated with plutonium— have been packed at the Energy Department’s labs in Idaho and South Carolina. You can stand next to most drums without concern. Others are so hot they can only be handled by heavily shielded machines.

The drums’ final resting place is down an elevator 2,150 feet into the salt. It’s dark, dusty, dry. Unlike Carlsbad Caverns, there are no stalactites or stalagmites and no dripping water. WIPP’s tunnels and rooms have 15-foot ceilings, enough to stack drums three high. So far it’s swallowed 10,200 shipments totaling 200,000 tons impregnated with 5 tons of plutonium. To get that stuff to WIPP drivers have logged 12 million miles with loaded trucks and 10 million miles empty. Drivers work in pairs when hauling full loads and can’t get hired if they’ve ever had a traffic­violation. There have been three­accidents in 13 years. In the worst, a driver jackknifed with an empty load. The waste container performed as designed, detached from the truck and rolled to a stop. No damage.

Likewise, only a few mishaps down in the salt. In 1995 a worker broke his leg in an electric cart accident. In 2008 a forklift operator gouged an inch-long gash in a drum. No radiation escaped the thick plastic bag inside. None has escaped WIPP, either. All the air that circulates out of the WIPP buildings passes through HEPA filters. Carlsbad’s monitoring center picked up heightened levels of radioactive iodine in the air weeks after Japan’s Fukushima disaster but hasn’t yet sniffed any leakage from WIPP.

 WIPP’s salt tomb is a simple, passive solution to a tough problem. Contrast that with Yucca, which requires active engineering to work. Though the mountain’s volcanic tuff is three times stronger than concrete, it features lots of cracks and faults that could allow water to slowly trickle through. Over thousands of years those trickles could pick up radiation and carry it into groundwater. To cope, Energy Department engineers designed a drip shield that would deflect the water. To resist thousands of years of corrosion, however, the shield would have to be made from titanium—so much titanium that it could be irresistible to future scavengers. One person who has worked on both Yucca and WIPP says the titanium solution would negate a primary objective of a repository: ensuring that people leave it alone. “If it’s 1,000 years from now and the U.S. doesn’t exist, and I don’t know what that titanium is protecting, I’m gonna go get it.” In contrast, even if future generations wanted to dig down a half-mile, there’s nothing at WIPP worth poking around for.

“canisters of high-level waste, 600 degrees hot”

Where on Earth did you get that number from? After five years in a water-filled pool, used LWR fuel can be put into a shielded canister cooled only by ambient air circulation.

“a reprocessing plant, which would take the 95% of energy still left in old rods and turn it into new ones.”

Not quite, unless Integral Fast Reactors (a project killed by Bill Clinton and John Kerry in 1994) are involved.

“tiny volumes of ultrabad waste that could be devastating in the wrong hands”

You mean for so-called “dirty bombs”? The explosives would harm people more than the radioactive contaminants. Anyway, the bad guys would get this from medical, sterilization, or radiography sources, not reprocessing plants.

“Science must be the decision maker.”

Yeah, but the media need to educate themselves enough to know how to report it properly.

As for the ultimate economic incentive, the people of Carlsbad should simply be allowed them to take title to the used LWR fuel.

In ten years, after the ideologically-driven push for unreliable and inefficient renewables has passed, and society realizes that the only way to curb emissions and supply a growing worldwide population is through the use of Generation IV nuclear reactors, this material will be seen not as waste, but as a ready-made stockpile of fuel capable of generating decades worth of electricity.

But first we have to educate the public, change the paradigm, and start calling things what they really are – a nearly inexhaustible fuel supply, rather than “nuclear waste”.

I think Carlsbad is an excellent choice for this stuff.

I used to work for an oil exploration company in the Permian basin that specialized in seismic surveys. Been all over this area.

It’s remote. It’s got a stable geology. And anybody who lives out in the middle of nowhere tend to be pretty tough people to begin with.
If this does have some long term effect we’ve overlooked, I believe the technology of the future will have some way to deal with it.

I’m not a big fan of nuclear energy for the fact the waste is so toxic. But at the same time, I don’t want to train guinea pigs to row a tiny little boat either.

It is much easier if you teach the little hamster coxswain to call “stroke” instead of “row”.

It is much easier to pronounce stroke with cheeks full of seeds than it is to say row.

Here’s what the United States Department of Energy is spending 40 percent of its $29 billion annual budget on:

http://viableopposition.blogspot.com/2011/04/united-states-department-of-energy.html

Rather than helping consumers improve energy efficiency and save money in this time of high energy costs, billions are being wasted baby-sitting America’s nuclear arsenal.

It’s not widely known that since 1995 highly enriched uranium from over 18,000 surplus Soviet warheads has been downblended into fuel for American power reactors, providing 10% of this country’s electricity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatons_to_Megawatts_Program

A MOX (Mixed Oxide) plant being constructed in South Carolina will do the same thing to 3.5 tons of plutonium warheads annually: http://www.moxproject.com

This is the best way to efficiently utilize, and destroy once and for all, aging Cold War bombs – a modern technological version of the biblical imperative to beat swords into plowshares.

Not exactly.

Enriching and reusing spent uranium fuel creates even more radioactive waste.

The more you feed the beast—-the more poop there is to clean up.

And the yard is getting pretty well piled up already.

WIPP – It Good!
 Permalink Flag Reply fredlinn 5 months ago 
This all sounds very good.

But there are some factors that are not being considered.

It is hard to speak about safety when there is no track record to base any kind of statistical predictions on. The safety aspect is still pretty much conjecture. The concern about trucking high level radioactive waste on public roads seems fully justified to me. Trucks can be pretty safe for moving things—trains even safer. However, we KNOW from experience, get enough trucks and trains on the move with hazardous loads, and sooner or later you WILL have accidents.

They transport nuclear waste in indestructible containers.
 Permalink Flag Reply fredlinn 5 months ago 
Here is another consideration that occurs to me.

A salt dome is considered a safe bet from a seismic and geologic point of view—and that is probably true.

However, what happens when you bury high level radioactive waste in a salt dome?

I don’t know, it has never been done before. And neither does anyone else. I do know that where there are large areas of land that were there have been nuclear accidents in the past where no one is allowed to live displacing large populations for as much as 30 years(so far) in both Ukraine and Japan. It is just too radioactive to be safe.

Are we setting things up to have just such a large exclusion zone in Carlsbad NM?(or somewhere else, due to a transport accident?)

I don’t know. Possibly.

Is it worth the risk just to make electricity to run hair dryers, X boxes, and leave refrigerator doors open? I don’t think so. I think we have better and much safer ways of doing the same thing.

In a nuclear accident radioactive particles contaminate the area, and they emit dangerous ionizing radiation for years or decades. In case of storage, only the radiation can escape from the containers, not the radioactive material itself, and radiation can be shielded easily.

aaaand it won’t last forever. the radioactive material decays with time

Since we are making “facts” out of the speculations based on assumptions that we have no experience or historical justification to establish as facts. I’d like to make a speculation as well.

This is pure speculation on my part. I have absolutely no history, experimental data, or previously done projects to base this speculation on—but considering that the pro-nuclear people are basing their safety claims on conjecture, I’d like to do just a little conjecture too.

So, what do I know about radioactive decay?

Radioactive decay produces heat. A LOT of heat. Enough heat that the solid iron core of the earth’s interior has been melted by the retained heat of the radioactive decay of the isotopes that were present when the earth was formed over 4 billion years ago. This heat and pressure, and liquid molten iron and rock still drives the earth’s tectonic plate movement today.

All of the power ever generated by all of the earthquakes, volcanoes, and continental drift of the entire lifetime of the earth has been generated by radioactive decay in the earths interior(and to a minor degree by magnetic induction—but mostly, radioactive decay).

It sends entire continents sliding around and colliding like billiard balls on a pool table.

Even the lowest level radioactive waste being proposed to be buried in New Mexico is thousands of times higher than the amount of radioactive decay taking place naturally inside the earth that creates these amounts of power.

Spent fuel rods such as in Japan had to have constant streams of water on them to remove heat otherwise they would melt the stainless steel casings(which melt at about 2500* F). Even 50-60 years after they have been placed in storage, When that does not happen—-you can have massive explosions.

You’ve seen the result of that many times on the photos and videos of Chernobyl and Fukushima.

And now—we are going to bring ALL of the results of ALL of our nuclear power generation and bomb making for the last 70 years together and dump them down one big hole?

It only seems reasonable to me to expect that there might be a HUGE problem with this.

Problems that the service station owners and fast food restaurant owners who are promoting the idea have very little or no comprehension of. They want to sell trucks diesel fuel and hamburgers.

The thermal conductivity of rock is very poor, and there is thousands of miles of it between the core and the surface, so the decay heat can’t escape.
The nuclear waste is close to the surface, and can be cooled by air too. Plus, most of the waste is only slightly radioactive. The spent fuel, which is the hottest stuff, is stored on site for a few years, until it’s cool down enough to be safe to store without active cooling.
