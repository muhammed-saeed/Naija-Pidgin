Damn straight Nermal Nov 7, 2003, 12:07 AM I&apos;ve never even heard of most of those :rolleyes:

Anyway, I chose Subway. It&apos;s good to get something fresh, and it&apos;s a lot better for you than McD/BK/KFC. Plus they&apos;re a lot more filling than a burger. fredwick Nov 7, 2003, 12:12 AM In-N-Out!!! i wouldn&apos;t mind a 5x5 right now:D GrannySmith_G5 Nov 7, 2003, 12:14 AM If you are going to go for the fast food, nothing beats a half dozen White Castle slyders. mmmmmm. White Castle. gelbin Nov 7, 2003, 12:24 AM for us vegetarians trying to get some food on the run and eat something decently healthy.......

black beans, rice and some grilled veggies wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. mmm.... msassman Nov 7, 2003, 12:27 AM It&apos;s all about white castle.

If you do your homework, you will find out that they are still 100% family owned and they don&apos;t franchise because they want to keep quality under control.

In-N-Out is a family chain (last I checked) that has great quality food (nothing premade, frozen, etc.) and fast service.

It&apos;s a throwback to burger stands in the 50s. jelloshotsrule Nov 7, 2003, 01:26 AM Originally posted by york2600

the two aren&apos;t mutually exclusive

taco bell is the most vegetarian friendly. somewhat more vegan friendly now with their&quot;fresco style&quot;thing... uhlawboi80 Nov 7, 2003, 01:33 AM hmm, gelbin...you must be in houston. I think freebirds are only here, one in austin and now 4 in good ole college station.

id have to say for fast food, which i rarely rarely eat...Jack in the Box. Wendys is a close second. though not sure why Jack in the box wasnt listed.. you Nov 7, 2003, 01:49 AM Taco Del Mar, mmmmmmm burritos. (drool.......)

I am willing to make a change to Mc Donalds though if they start giving away songs.

In and Out started as a Southern California thing but is now in places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Las Vegas.

White Castle is a southern thing along the lines of Krystal Burgers.

For the best hamburger, go to a Fatburger or Tommy&apos;s.

Best healthy fast food, go to World Wraps.

And don&apos;t even get me started on Taco Bell, that was an awesome mexican fast food place when it was only a California thing and before Pepsi bought it. Now Del Taco is where it&apos;s at for mexican fast food with Taco Time a distant second.

I hope nobody makes the mistake of calling Bob&apos;s Big Boy fast food here. It&apos;s a coffee shop, and I&apos;ll kick the butt of anyone who disses it in any way! G4scott Nov 7, 2003, 03:02 AM I love Arby&apos;s.

I stopped eating at Taco Bell a long time ago, since they actually have real Mexican food restaurants where I&apos;m from... For those of you who think Taco Bell is real mexican food, you need to visit deep south Texas (and I don&apos;t mean San Antonio, I mean like 10 miles from the border...) Sun Baked Nov 7, 2003, 03:09 AM Why stop at the Taco Bell across the street, when there&apos;s a Del Taco further up the road -- if you decide to skip the REAL Mexican taco joints (taco specialy shops in the Mexican neighborhood) that you&apos;d have to pass driving to Del Taco.

Why have fresh made tortillas and condiments, when Taco Bell and Del Taco are in the area -- price (it&apos;s cheap and tastes like it). littlejim Nov 7, 2003, 03:10 AM There used to be a Taco Bell in Leicester Square in London - used to love it after a hard night&apos;s drinking in &apos;The Glassblowers&apos;!

Alas ... it&apos;s no more. G4scott Nov 7, 2003, 03:13 AM Originally posted by Sun Baked

Taco Bell Tortillas can not compare to real Mexican Food restaurant tortillas. There&apos;s this little place back home called El Pato, and they are absolutely the best fast food mexican restaurant... For a full, real Mexican meal, you go to a real restaurant, not Taco Bell... nickmcghie Nov 7, 2003, 03:19 AM Originally posted by Rower_CPU

Vegan. pimentoLoaf Nov 7, 2003, 03:45 AM There shoulda been checkboxes &apos;stead of radio buttons....

Said Taco Bell (love them Baja-sauced Chalupas -- though I add a couple of mild-sauce packets to each of &apos;em), but there are two others:

Cousins Subs -- unlike Subway, there&apos;s real honest-to-goodness mayo and other cholesterol-laden things in each sandwich.

Culvers -- started in middle-Wisconsin and now in many midwest states (&amp;Texas), there&apos;s plenty of traditional burger fun and really great custard.

Hmmm...

Despite the early morning hour, I suddenly have a taste for filet mignon. LoopHoles Nov 7, 2003, 04:18 AM Originally posted by Rower_CPU

I dont even like Pepsi but ill be drinking some Sierra mist in February. Centris 650 Nov 7, 2003, 06:29 AM Rush&apos;s first and then Zaxby&apos;s. These are my faves but I eat a good bit of Subway.

In-N-Out Burger :)

You took the words right outta my mouth! iAlan Nov 7, 2003, 07:18 AM We don&apos;t have most of the fast food chains in the choices here in Japan.

i have got to say that in Japan the best fast food restaurant is &apos;MOS Burger&apos;. Here is a link to the menu.

MOS Burger Menu (http://www.mos.co.jp/menu/index.html)

The name is a little off-puting, but the burgers are great. Everything is made fresh (have to wait for your order to be delivered to your table). Very nice rice burgers. Instead of bread buns they have a couple of burgers with &apos;buns&apos; made out of steamed rice. Yummy Jerry Spoon Nov 7, 2003, 07:33 AM White Castle gets a nod. I&apos;m impressed. You have to be from certain parts of the US to know about Whitel Castle.

Edit: Someone above mentioned that White Castles is in the south, but it&apos;s also in the Midwest. SiliconAddict Nov 7, 2003, 07:48 AM Subway by a long shot. Prior to the diet it was Toxic Bell but since I&apos;ve been working on decreasing the mass I&apos;ve found subway veggie subs with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese and a strip of mustard does a good job of filling the void. Fitzcaraldo Nov 7, 2003, 08:04 AM Slices of Buffalo mozzarella and sun/vine ripened tomatoes with fresh Basil and a drizzle of Olive oil on whole-grain German style rye bread...

Takes about 30 Seconds to make :) and there is a Tesco Express right next to the Local McD&apos;s

iTunes vouchers with loafs of bread... Mr. Anderson Nov 7, 2003, 08:16 AM Chipotle - best burritos and actually not all that fattening if you pick the right ingredients....and its a chain.

As for non-chain fast food - it would have to be Kabob Palace. Eye, moxie and evo have eaten there and they can confirm its yummy goodness :D

D iLilana Nov 7, 2003, 08:28 AM There is one in Calgary Alberta Canada. Its a Drive-in fast food place. I could compare it to in and out but it supasses it by miles.

Peter&apos;s Drive-in. The hamburgers are very large. portions are huge...I order for one and feed three.

The absolute best. People drive hundreds of miles for this fast food. Ambrose Chapel Nov 7, 2003, 08:50 AM i swore off fast food unless i&apos;m on the road and there&apos;s no other option. in that case...um...wendys! killmoms Nov 7, 2003, 09:09 AM Oh Chik-Fil-A, I love you too much for my own good! (And my gut&apos;s good). ;_;

--Cless Datazoid Nov 7, 2003, 09:19 AM First, having visited Calgary before, I must say that Pete&apos;s is awesome. And yes, people do drive great distances to go there...

Area: Sacramento, CA

&quot;Fast&quot;Hamburger: Carls Jr./In-N-Out (Tie, far too different to be compared)

&quot;Not-so-fast, but Huge&quot;Hamburger: Redrum (Murder) Burger (With Nations Giant Hamburgers a close second)

Sandwiches: Gotta go for Togos

Mexican (Chain): JimBoys Tacos

Mexican (Taqueria):&quot;Mexico&quot;Mexican Tortilla Factory (Newark, CA: not in Sac area, but too good not to list).

Pretty much all of the places listed in the poll have dry, bland, boring food (in my opinion....no flames pls ;) )...I rarely go to any of them (KFC sometimes just because its a cheap meal for the whole family, and Arby&apos;s to mix things up every now and then). I think more regional choices (at least, as far as the west is concerned, other areas seem to have at least some representation of their local favorites: White Castle, Hardee&apos;s, Chick-Fil-A (???)) should have been on there, as each of our cities has just as many&quot;Jack In The Box&quot;,&quot;Carl&apos;s Jr&quot;, as BK&apos;s and Wendy&apos;s, and nearly as many Togo&apos;s and Blimpies (Quizno&apos;s I find slightly less often) as Subway....

But thats just my opinon.... groovebuster Nov 7, 2003, 09:25 AM My favourites are Dner Kebap, Shawarma or Gyros.

Burgers are OK once in a while if can&apos;t get anything else around where you are...

Don&apos;t confuse&quot;Fresh&quot;with&quot;Recently Assembled&quot;. Sure, they may make it there, but I don&apos;t see the lettuce and meat truck parked out front every morning. It&apos;s nothing more than good advertising.

Come to think of it, I can&apos;t think of a single instance of&quot;Tomato&quot;that wasn&apos;t preceeded with&quot;Fresh&quot;. Somewhere, there must be a huge landfill of 3 day old tomatoes. bousozoku Nov 7, 2003, 09:39 AM Give me Popeye&apos;s Chicken and Biscuits or Checkers any day. TEG Nov 7, 2003, 09:41 AM May I ask why a list of resturaunts was picked that is so geographicaly incorrect. Half of the Resturaunts don&apos;t exist west of the Miss, or at least in the northwestern US.

Also... Hardees should read&quot;Hardees / Carl&apos;s Jr.&quot;Carl&apos;s Jr. Bought them a couple years ago, that is why all the Hardees have stars on them, its CJ&apos;s Logo.

Being that I travel, I&apos;d like to suggest a more generic poll... With the following National/International Brands;

McDonalds
Burger King
Wendy&apos;s
Arby&apos;s
Subway
KFC
Taco Bell
Hardee&apos;s/Carl&apos;s Jr.
A&amp;W
Quiznos
Blimpie
Other

Also, how about a&quot;Your Favorite Franchise Sit-Down Resturaunt&quot;?

International? You are kidding, right? ;)Those brands are american as american can be! :D

I would have found it way more interesting what KIND of fast-food people like and not if they prefer to be served by Ronald McDonald.

The quality between restaurants can be so different from place to place that a general statement doesn&apos;t really make sense...

The clear winner is: OTHERS!!!:D gojira Nov 7, 2003, 09:56 AM Why isn&apos;t there a&quot;I don&apos;t eat fast food&quot;answer?

Realize that not everyone who chooses to eat&quot;clean&quot;food is vegetarian. There are environmental reasons as well as health issues involved.

As an omnivore, I try to eat as little processed food as possible and buy as much locally and seasonally produced whole grain, organic food and produce as possible. Mr. Anderson Nov 7, 2003, 10:03 AM Yeah, the winner is others. I don&apos;t go to fast food restaurants unless I have no other choice (like on a long trip).

The last burger place I went was In and Out burger in San Diego - because I&apos;d never been - that was January ;)

D Rocket Rion Nov 7, 2003, 10:22 AM McDonald&apos;s is just nasty. No accounting for taste. bikertwin Nov 7, 2003, 10:23 AM Originally posted by gojira

That&apos;s right, gojira, tell it like it is.

C&apos;mon folks, you&apos;re Mac-heads. Think different. Support your local mom&amp;pop cafe that&apos;s probably using recipes that grandma used, instead of a recipe that&apos;s been optimized in a factory test kitchen for speed and cheapest possible price.

When picking up your next fast food meal, compare the meal in your hands with the pretty pictures on the wall. Does it look like the same thing? :eek: Nah! :)

Yeah, walk into your favorite fast food restaurant to pick up a nice steaming burger made of meat-that&apos;s-ground-up-from-unrecognizable-or-unmentionable-parts-that-can&apos;t-be-otherwise-sold and that&apos;s been irradiated to protect you from the cow dung that&apos;s inevitably included in it because of the unsanitary do-it-as-fast-and-cheap-as-possible methods they use to kill the cows.

Mmmmmm. Are you hungry yet? :)

What are you eating now? Where did it come from? Do you recognize it as something that came from the earth (a fruit, vegetable, dairy, or meat item)? Or is it some hyper-processed made-in-a-factory-and-coated-with-fake-cheese-flavoring Dorito? ;)

There is a&quot;quick food&quot;place in town called Rumby&apos;s Island Grill that is relatively fast and has great teriyaki chicken bowls.. dunno if it is&quot;fast (fat) food&quot;though.

I&apos;d say Cafe Rio, but it&apos;s only fast after the 30 min wait in line. MacSlut Nov 8, 2003, 01:28 AM I&apos;ve been all over the United States, and I gotta say Southern California is where its at...Green Burrito, Del Taco, In and Out, World Wraps, Tommy&apos;s, Fatburger, El Pollo Loco, All American Burger, plus almost all the worthwhile others except...Krystal, White Caster, and Ivars.

Plus many fast food and coffee shops started in Southern California. Taco Bell, McDonalds, Bob&apos;s Big Boy, Carl&apos;s Jr, Der Weinerschnitzel, A&amp;W (Lodi), Baskin Robbins, Johnny Rockets, Mel&apos;s (San Francisco), others? TEG Nov 8, 2003, 01:43 AM Originally posted by you
I think that Ivars is awsome, although it only exists in the seattle area I think. They have the best clam chowder

Ivars Rocks, and they are also a sit down resturaunt in some places... Like at the Mukilteo Ferry Dock.

Taco Del Mar... (Taco of the Sea) it&apos;s a nice pun, but never eaten there.

Skippers, another NW classic, great seafood (When you can&apos;t find an Ivars)

In Portland, Or area they have Burgerville, use real NW foods like Walla Walla Sweet Onions, and beef from OR/WA/ID.

In the Midwest, there is always Rally&apos;s, drive through only though. :(

Also, Re. my last post, many of the franchises i mentioned do exist outside of the US, infact All Exist (Except for Carl&apos;s Jr./Hardees) in Canada. I&apos;m not sure about everywhere else, but of course there&apos;s McD everywhere in the world, Even Bagdad Int&apos;l Airport, and Kabul.

ya got good taste in fast food; I think I ate 5x at in-n-out burger when I was in LA and Orange County for a week visiting family :)

My favorite fast food that i can actually get in WA would probably be Wendys, I like there chili -- it&apos;s good stuff ;)

Fatburger

That place is also good, very greasy food unfortunately, and they are pretty expensive for fast food [5 dollars for a burger on an ala carte menu] scem0 Nov 8, 2003, 03:10 AM Wendy&apos;s pwns!

The 99 cent menu is pure goodness. Every thursday I have 2 jnr bacon cheeseburgers, a med fries, and a med drink. :)

Sonis is pretty good too. McD&apos;s sucks.

Sun Baked Nov 8, 2003, 05:38 AM As somebody said, sort of sucks that the new chains like Pei Wei aren&apos;t represented.

Another winner from Paul Fleming, fast/casual food style this time. And he&apos;s mad at work on a new restaurant concept now.

Nice break from the Fish Taco joints, and the rice bowl places. yamabushi Nov 8, 2003, 06:37 AM MosBurger is by far my favorite. I voted for Arby&apos;s since they are my favorite within easy driving distance. I also often eat take out chinese food.

Good Choice. I thought MOS Burger was only available in Japan. I am guessing you had it here? The Spicy Mos Burger is by far hte best, although the new Hayashi Rice Burger is quite good too!!

Yes, I lived there for three years. I have only seen MosBurger in Japan. I like the Teriyaki Burger the best. The fries are great too. Here is a menu in English for those who are curious.http://www.japaninyourpalm.com/Restaurants/mosburger.htm physicsnerd Nov 8, 2003, 11:03 AM I voted for wendy&apos;s but I&apos;d rather go to a Carl&apos;s Jr. I know that there was the Hardees option but the two places are so different. Carls Jr. by far has the best chicken sandwhiches of any fast food place I&apos;ve ever been to. I don&apos;t know why Hardees doesn&apos;t have the same selection of chicken. Plus, i&apos;ve always had much better service at Carl&apos;s Jr. Of course In-N-Out rocks too, I just don&apos;t eat much beef anymore. I&apos;m now living in Indiana anyone got any suggestion for good chicken fast food out here?

For those of you who voted for Subway, if you&apos;re ever in the San Diego areo check out Submarina. Their subs blow Subway&apos;s out of the water. djjon Nov 8, 2003, 12:26 PM Mr. Sub, Timmy&apos;s, Harvey&apos;s then Wendy&apos;s. bousozoku Nov 8, 2003, 12:27 PM Originally posted by MattG

Have you tried the Skyline Chili on U.S. 41 there? I used to go crazy over that stuff when I lived in Ohio and I&apos;ve eaten at the one in Naples, as well as another in Clearwater.

Naples seems more KFC or Chick-Fil-A than Popeye&apos;s or Church&apos;s. ;)

For those of you talking about Subway, have you ever tried a Hoagie in Philly? After that, you&apos;d never consider going to Subway again. MattG Nov 8, 2003, 12:33 PM Originally posted by bousozoku

No I haven&apos;t tried Skyline Chili, although I&apos;ve heard people say it&apos;s pretty good. I&apos;m not a big chili guy, though.

Naples has both KFC and Chick-Fil-A, but alas, no Popeye&apos;s. I think there&apos;s one in Fort Myers because they&apos;ve been advertising Popeye&apos;s on the radio a lot lately, but I&apos;m rarely in Fort Myers so it does me no good. It&apos;s really annoying! mms Nov 8, 2003, 03:16 PM Definitely In-N-Out. Nothing else even comes close. ColoJohnBoy Nov 8, 2003, 03:44 PM Chipotle is definitely tops (A Carnitas burrito with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, black beans, rice, and salsa verde), with Rubio&apos;s in close second - they make the best fish tacos you&apos;ll ever have.

iJon Sayhey Nov 8, 2003, 09:29 PM San Francisco has all kinds of Taquerias that serve great burritos. Nothing like the **** that Taco Bell serves. If you ever get to the City try El Toro at 17th&amp;Valencia for a great burrito.

I also like a place called&quot;Philly Cheesesteak&quot;shop on Divisadero in the City and University Ave. in Berkeley. Of course, its disgustingly unhealthy for you - but it tastes great! Rower_CPU Nov 8, 2003, 09:44 PM Originally posted by Datazoid

The Teriyaki Burger at MOS Burger is good, but the best Teriyaki Burger available is actually from &apos;Freshness Burger&apos;, which is a MOS Burger like fast-food restaurant that prepares everything from scratch and has a similar menu to MOS Burger. Next time you are here give it a try.

Subway is picking up in terms of popularity and number of outlets in Japan. McDo is on the decline, with several outlets closing and a record loss reported for the year to September.

Wendy&apos;s has a limited number of outlets, but is always crowded when I go there. I like the 99 yen chilli.

Burger King has gone out of business here, lasting about 3 years. Not sure why they didn&apos;t survive.

KFC still around, doing better with their chicken burgers and wrap sandwich lines rather than their fried chicken.

Here are a couple of other fast-food chains I think are unique to Japan - Lotteria, 1st Kitchen, Morinaga Love (don&apos;t really like any of these though). Sayhey Nov 9, 2003, 12:01 AM Originally posted by Rower_CPU

Given the highbrow clientele in Crescent City, I would be shocked...nay, outraged, if there was a Hooters there. :p

Yreka is a Native American word meaning&quot;north mountain&quot;, according to the Yreka Chamber of Commerce (http://www.yrekachamber.com/history.html) anyway. I was born there, so suffice to say, it&apos;s a pretty kickass place. ;) Sayhey Nov 9, 2003, 12:30 AM Originally posted by Rower_CPU

Rower,

I lived a few years as a kid on the Eel river outside of Eureka, so I can truthfully agree that the Northern part of the state (Redding excluded) is indeed&quot;kickass.&quot;Shasta, Lassen, and the Trinity Alps are amazing places. If I can ever get the time off from studying I going to do some backpacking again in the Alps. Of course, this says nothing about the food which if memory serves is the pits.

P.S. - Always wondered what&quot;Yreka&quot;meant, thanks. pbooktebo Nov 9, 2003, 12:53 AM Great Poll. I haven&apos;t had this much fun reading replies in a long time.

Certainly In-N-Out, but when I want plain old good&quot;bad&quot;corporate death meal, nothing does it like an Arby-Q meal with fries and lemonate.

I have to say when traveling, I really love to try local chains: Dick&apos;s burgers in Seattle, Krystal or buffalo wing places down South, Jack in the Box when I first visited Texas, Rally&apos;s down in Tallahassee, etc. They&apos;re mostly the same, but the decor and packaging differences are a blast. I love the way they all have different ways to name a hamburger. MacSlut Nov 9, 2003, 02:50 AM Originally posted by Datazoid

DQ: Nice alternative place to go sometimes. Yu can get a chicken strip dinner for less than you&apos;d play at Sonic.

Sonic: Goooood. The onion rings suck now, though. They changed the batter and now they taste like pancakes. But the burgers are good. I love the Toaster Sandwiches, except the one I like best (Chicken Ceasar) isn&apos;t a normal menu item.

I never heard of In-and-Out Burger.

Chipotle: Yum. Huge amounts of food for the money. Too bad they&apos;re owned by McDonalds Corp.

Subway: I never go to Subway. We have a small chain (two of the three locations) called Yello Sub here. The sandwiches are better and its not corporate at all. It&apos;s pretty popular because of the food and it&apos;s locally owned. Hemingray Nov 9, 2003, 05:27 PM Uh... what the heck... no Carl&apos;s Jr.!?!? :eek: Infidels!!!! MacAztec Nov 9, 2003, 05:52 PM Carls is really good. My sister knew one of the sons of the owner (or grandsons), and he used to hook us up all the time with food.

I think that sometimes you don&apos;t enjoy things that are free. It is more satisfying when you earn the money and pay for it yourself. Also too much of a good thing can be bad. leet1 Nov 9, 2003, 08:02 PM Originally posted by SeaFox

Carl&apos;s Jr. screwed up Hardee&apos;s. We had two (Hardee&apos;s) and they&apos;re both closed now. Nobody wanted to eat there. The first one that closed became a central office for the McDonald&apos;s in town (since one of the four McD&apos;s we have right was across the street from the Hardee&apos;s).

The second is a Culver&apos;s now. Or is it a Seriden&apos;s?
Yeah. It&apos;s a Sheriden&apos;s frozen yogurt.

There are a couple things I have to go to Taco Bell for, even if it&apos;s Taco John&apos;s I go to most. I like the Chalupas and the Seven-Layer Burrito. SeaFox Nov 9, 2003, 08:42 PM Originally posted by leet1

I don&apos;t blame you for not wanting to interrupt the enjoyment of some home made chicken soup. There is nothing better than home made soup in the Fall and Winter. It is well known for it&apos;s healing quality.

You are making my mouth water, always a craving banana. A banana shake would sound good, but my preference is for ice cream.

First, they only use fresh ingredients from the NW and only when they are in season, their burgers are made to order from fresh ground chuck (ask for that in any other fast food joint!). That&apos;s why they sell Walla Walla Onion Rings only when they are in season, if you haven&apos;t tried these onion rings...man, you don&apos;t really know what a true onion ring is, I pity you! And their shakes...WOW! They only use REAL ICE CREAM...with fruits that are IN SEASON, like their Blackberry shake sold only during summer. Each time I get to enjoy one of them shakes, I feel I&apos;m in heaven! Dude, I really feel sorry for those of you who haven&apos;t a Burgerville around, it&apos;s one of our best kept secrets from the NW! mykemp Jan 5, 2004, 12:56 PM Moe&apos;s Southwest Grill... they are a little burrito shack chain here in the southeast.
