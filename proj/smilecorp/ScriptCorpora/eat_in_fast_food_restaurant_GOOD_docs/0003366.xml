How Coupons Works:

Crown Burgers is a small hamburger fast food restaurant chain based in Salt Lake City, Utah started in 1978 by brothers Nick and Manuel Katsanevas. The chain&apos;s signature burger is the&quot;Crown Burger,&quot;a cheeseburger which, in addition to the char-broiled patty, is piled high with hot pastrami. Crown Burgers&apos; pastrami burger has been widely imitated and has become a staple of restaurant cuisine in Salt Lake City. In 2004, Carl&apos;s Jr. released a very similar burger called the&quot;Pastrami Burger.&quot;Crown Burgers offers other fast food fare as well, such as beef burritos, hot pastrami sandwiches, steak sandwiches, gyros, fishburgers, fries, onion rings, and other burgers. Crown Burgers also carries its own version of the regional condiment fry sauce, a combination of ketchup, mayonnaise and spices.
