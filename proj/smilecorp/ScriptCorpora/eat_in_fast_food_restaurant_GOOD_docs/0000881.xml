View Full Version : Fast Food restaurant loyalty programs 
 mschroed Nov 15, 09, 7:14 am Apologies if this belongs in another thread, but is there a relatively comprehensive listing of fast food restaurant frequent eating programs? Subway, etc.?

Thanks 
 bitburgr Nov 15, 09, 8:06 am I posted a similar question in Dining Buzz about a month ago (Dining Rewards?) (http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/diningbuzz/1004550-dining-rewards.html) and got no responses. I hope this gets some traction. Jeeves Nov 15, 09, 9:24 am Subway did away with the Club Card earlier this year. They said it was replaced by the $5.00 foot long value meal selections.

I&apos;m unaware of any fast food loyalty programs. Most chains have you provide them with your e-mail and they will then send you coupons and promotions.

Ok, thanks for that. I didn&apos;t know about Subway doing away with their program. That settles it, I might just start tracking what I can find.

What he said. I&apos;m on the list of a few.

Cheers. CMK10 Nov 15, 09, 5:05 pm If you are near a Paradise Bakery they have one. It&apos;s called the Taste of Paradise card and every time you buy ten sandwiches/salads you get the next one (along with a soda or coffee) free. They&apos;re in ten states.

http://www.paradisebakery.com/ gleff Nov 15, 09, 5:57 pm What I&apos;m more interested in is elite levels of loyalty programs. Not a fast food chain, but Mortons has one, and CO Presidential Plus Mastercard holders are comped in.

I wonder what elite status would look like at Quiznos? RobertTheTraveler Nov 15, 09, 10:41 pm Burger King has had a survey on the back of its receipts for several years. Make any purchase, call the toll-free number on the receipt, answer the questions, and receive a code.

The code entitles you to either a free whopper or a free original chicken sandwich when you purchase ANY SIZE fries and ANY SIZE beverage, including the $1 Value Menu.

The survey indicates one redemption per month.

I am CA-based, but have seen the offer printed on receipts in the midwest and FL.

Not exactly a&quot;frequent dining&quot;deal, however, depending on your own personal ethics, and the number of BK outlets in your area, you could dine daily for $2+tax. RobertTheTraveler Nov 15, 09, 10:47 pm I do not believe this offer is nationwide, but the receipts given throughout Southern CA have surveys printed on the back. You can either call a toll-free number or use www.talktowendys.com to submit the survey and receive a code valid for a free Single Burger. This is not the 99-cent Jr Burger, but rather the standard regular, one-patty burger.

There is no additional purchase requirement.

You can only complete one survey per month and software prevents calls from the same telephone number or repeat e-mail addresses until after 30-days. Fly2LAX Nov 15, 09, 11:48 pm Just what people need... a way to encourage them eating more unhealthy and fattening food ! :td: 767-322ETOPS Nov 16, 09, 10:34 am Cosi Card (http://getcosi.com/cosicard_learnmore.html) - combo stored value and reward card. 10:1 purchase to freebie ratio. bitburgr Nov 16, 09, 10:57 am There&apos;s the Qdoba Rewards Card (http://www.qdoba.com/ILoveQdoba/Rewards.aspx) program. PG Nov 16, 09, 2:17 pm Some Grocery Stores (Giant, Safeway) will give you a free sub after you purchase a certain number of subs.

Some stores will have cards which will you get stamped/puched each time you eat and you get a free meal or discount after all boxes have been stamped. I know in my area some Subways that will give you a free 6 inch sub when you redeem - you have to purchase a drink to get the sub though.

Manchu Wok near my work has a card which gets you the 12th meal free. Nexus Nov 16, 09, 9:45 pm Apologies if this belongs in another thread, but is there a relatively comprehensive listing of fast food restaurant frequent eating programs? Subway, etc.?

I have no idea about a list but I know about a related program. Is called The biggest loser and it airs on NBC on Tuesdays.

On the subject now : I know about a loyalty program on Penn station sandwiches but I don&apos;t know if they still have it. 8 sandwiches brought you a free one. sobore Nov 17, 09, 5:16 am I just want a bigger booth with more legroom at Subway, how do I get upgraded! Kalboz Nov 17, 09, 11:37 pm Register with Jack in the Box and you get periodic coupons: http://www.southwestchickenbowls.com/coupon/

This one is&quot;Buy a Southwest Chicken Bowl Get a 3 piece order of Stuffed Jalapeos FREE&quot;- valid through 12/28/2009

Enjoy! goalie Nov 18, 09, 7:47 am Subway did away with the Club Card earlier this year. They said it was replaced by the $5.00 foot long value meal selections.

Most chains have you provide them with your e-mail and they will then send you coupons and promotions.just went to subway yesterday here in sf and i was asked at checkout if i had a subway card. i said no and was promptly given one and had my purchase points (or whatever they&apos;re called) added to my card cordelli Nov 18, 09, 8:09 am I wonder what elite status would look like at Quiznos?

A seating area with bigger seats. A red carpet and a dedicated register with velvet ropes blocking it off. The ability to order in advance. A priority soda fountain. The ability to change your order with no fee, and once you have enough points, a free upgrade to a foot long pending availability. Reserved seating near the exit door. mccheese Nov 20, 09, 1:57 pm Select Subways are doing a new thing with points for every dollar you spend http://www.mysubwaycard.com. OzzyOzzie Apr 19, 10, 11:52 am http://www.heartlandfoodcorp.com/default.aspx

Just registered and coupon was good until May 2nd, but it may vary by registration date. Picture ID required when using coupon but as far as I can tell just one per visit so if you visit multiple times a week the coupon is still valid?

Printed a few off - it arrived VIA and e-mail and as a PDF attachment. AZ_MISMAN Apr 19, 10, 1:04 pm Note that this is for a specific set of BK franchises, and is not valid nationwide. Check the restaurant locator before signing up...

(Nothing in NM or AZ!) jredknapp11 Apr 20, 10, 1:51 am Only located in the SE but Larry&apos;s Giant Subs do a clubcard deal like Subway used to. Buy 8 and get the 9th free.

Back in the day when I lived in HHH I ate at Larry&apos;s everyday for two years straight... healthy and filling... I sware there is some sort of crack like substance in their food as I still crave their subs to this day, they are fantastic.

No stores within 2000 miles of ANC :eek:

This thread reminds me of Elaine&apos;s Sub Card on Seinfeld :p N965VJ Apr 20, 10, 9:45 am Select Subways are doing a new thing with points for every dollar you spend http://www.mysubwaycard.com.

Ive yet to find a location that honors the point card. :( abomb576 Apr 20, 10, 10:49 am Ive yet to find a location that honors the point card. :(

All the ones in NY that I have been too honor it GOOFYam Apr 20, 10, 4:59 pm http://papaginodangelorewards.com/ CEUflyer Apr 20, 10, 9:14 pm Salsarita&apos;s Fresh Cantina recently rolled out a loyalty card program. You get 10 points per dollar spent, and everytime you reach 1000 pts it loads $10 credit on your card. Plus you get 500 pts for registering the free card, and 1000 pts ($10) on your birthday if you list it in your account details.

http://www.salsaritas.com jredknapp11 Apr 24, 10, 6:35 pm Duffy&apos;s Sports Bar&amp;Grill in Florida/Georgia also have their own rewards card. The loyalty program they run is excellent.


Also, it&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve been to Dave and Busters but don&apos;t they also do a loyalty program ? sammy0623 Jul 31, 10, 1:07 pm www.mypanera.com

Register your mypanera card after its been swiped at the register, and you get a free bakery item. As far as other details about the program, I&apos;ve been unable to find them... amberdel Aug 3, 10, 2:58 pm http://bodybuilderspro.info/pictures/35/1274732818/random.gifA seating area with bigger seats.

A bottle of Crystal....VIP all the way. Gamecock Aug 9, 10, 12:56 pm Just what people need... a way to encourage them eating more unhealthy and fattening food ! :td:

Just what I need, someone else telling me what I should and shouldn&apos;t eat. :rolleyes:
