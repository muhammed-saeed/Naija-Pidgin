 ? Some restaurants take the EBT card. McDonald&apos;s Doesn&apos;t here in Los Angeles, CA, but Jack in the Box, El Pollo Loco and Subways does. It&apos;s the restaurant meals program and is only for homeless, elderly, and disabled food benefit recipients.

 Desireé had Riley 12/27/09 u can use the ebt CASH at mcdonalds not ebt food food stamps, there are cash food stamps that can be put on the ebt card too. at least thats how it is in ny.

 becky When applying for SNAP (foodstamps), as a homeless person, then it is possible to purchase prepared foods from certain places as they have no means to prepare hot meals. I do know Meals on Wheels in Maine takes SNAP for hot meals, but not sure of the other restaurant.

 becky The little blue EBT card is also a debit card. If a person qualifies for cash assistance it is placed on the card as cash and can be withdrawn and used to pay bills or whatever they wish, just like a bank card. It is accepted anywhere you see the QUEST emblem, kind of like a VISA.

 If they are using it at MC Donald&apos;s they should not be allowed to have it. That should be used at a store for good healthy food like fruits, veggies, milk, meat, etc. That is what is wrong with this system today. There are to many people on it that is abusing it and when someone really needs to be on it they cant because of all the dead beats that are bleeding the system dry.

 No. You cannot purchase hot food on an EBT card. You can only purchase stuff like cereal, bread, weiners...you know some stuff you find in the grocer store..

 No you can&apos;t EBT cards can only be used for non cooked food items, You can&apos;t even use them for the deli&apos;s in the grocery stores. I worked at a grocery store for like 4 years I thought that was crazy they couldnt get fried chicken for dinner unless it was COLD from yesterday on EBT

 no u can&apos;t, i wish u could but u can&apos;t, it would make no sense for them to that anyway cause u can&apos;t buy hot food on ebt anyway so all u would be able to get there was sodas,salads, or icecreams anyway


and for some of the ignorant ppl who replied above u can still have a job and receive food stamps so ain&apos;t no lazy about it

 I am pretty sure that they can&apos;t be used on pre-prepared food. I would hate to think that all of that tax money is going to somebodys fast food crap instead of putting good food on their kids plates.
