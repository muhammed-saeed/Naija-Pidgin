TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

 

Why is it that interviewers/companies still need this crutch question 
 to begin their interviews•Some use it from habit, some because 
 they didn&apos;t have time to prepare, and some because they don&apos;t know 
 any better. But despite trying to prep our clients away from the dreaded 
 opening interview question“Tell me about yourself,”we 
 have never been successful in getting them to stop using this question. 
 They use it, and we have resigned ourselves to this recruiting truth: 
 Most interviewers/companies will start with some version of this opening 
 question.

 

Fine, if they won&apos;t stop using this silly opening question, then 
 let&apos;s make sure you are ready with a loaded gun for this question. 
 If we, at EHS, prep candidates properly, we can make our candidates 
 look prepared, confident, and focused right from the start of their 
 interview. Furthermore, you will make a great verbal first impression.

 

Don&apos;t think this is a big deal•Let us share just one story 
 about this opening interview question that cost our candidate a chance 
 for a great opportunity. It is a perfect illustration to make you 
 understand why you must add this information to your interview process. 
 The scenario was this: We recently received a Job Order for a General 
 Manager of a high volume, full service restaurant. We located an ideal 
 candidate, and our initial impression was that the job was perfect 
 for her. Our client joked that when she came to the interview the 
 recruiter should send her with an invoice for the fee because they, 
 too, thought she was the perfect fit.

 

You can more or less guess how the story ended. To start the interview 
 the candidate was asked the dreaded“Tell me about yourself”question. Thinking that it was an inconsequential icebreaker question, 
 she retorted, simply intending to cause an opening chuckle,“Well 
 as you can obviously see, I am 15 20 pounds overweight.”

 

The candidate was only joking! Yet, due to the impact her answer 
 had on our client, for all practical purposes the interview was over. 
 That“amusing”answer to what the candidate viewed as 
 a seemingly harmless question convinced the client that this $60k 
 GM had an image or low self¬-esteem problem. Despite our insistence 
 that it was just a joke, our client declined to make the candidate 
 an offer. Her retort was just a joke! But not really. It was to the 
 candidate who didn&apos;t get her dream job. This candidate attempted to 
 humorously break the ice, but the interviewer misinterpreted her intentions 
 and became convinced she was not their next GM.

 

The whole fiasco could have been avoided if the candidate had just 
 remembered the simple formula for answering this question. Sure, we 
 know this question is a stupid and unnecessary question with which 
 to begin an interview. But because interviewers open interviews with 
 this question, you need to know how to respond to it intelligently. 
 The formula we teach has worked wonders for hundreds of our candidates 
 over the last few years.

 

We at EHS know that most of our clients will open with some form 
 of the“Tell me about yourself”question. The answer we&apos;d 
 ideally like our candidates to give would be a prepared and well thought 
 out initial marketing statement of themselves and their skills, which 
 are applicable for the open position. However, it doesn&apos;t matter if 
 the candidate makes $25k or $200k per year, the very best candidates 
 will typically respond to this question by answering with“What 
 would you like to know•”Let&apos;s get one thing straight: 
 It is extremely poor form to answer the opening interview question 
 with another question. But that is how most candidates will likely 
 answer this question due to its ambiguous nature. We can prepare you 
 to do better.

 

We need to teach you to answer this question with a Three 
 Part preplanned marketing statement that can more or less 
 be reused from interview to interview.

 

 Part One of that three part marketing statement 
 is always a one sentence summary of your career history.


For example, let us share with you a recent candidate&apos;s opening sentence:


 &quot;I am a professional, hands on restaurant manager 
 with 7 years experience in the full service and fine dining industry.” 

 

You get the picture; your whole career needs to be condensed into 
 one brief sentence that summarizes the most important aspects of your 
 career, which you want to use as leverage in order to make your next 
 career step.


 Part Two of the pre planned marketing statement will 
 be a one, maybe two sentence summary of a single accomplishment that 
 you are proud of that will also capture the interviewer’s attention. 
 It immediately follows your initial career summary sentence from above. 
 This accomplishment should be one that the interviewer will be interested 
 in hearing, one that is easily explained or illustrated, and one that 
 clearly highlights your bottom line impact. When done correctly this 
 will build interviewer intrigue about your accomplishment so that 
 they inquire further, giving you an opportunity to further discuss 
 your career success.

 

The above candidate&apos;s accomplishment sentences were:


 &quot;Recently, as a General Manager I was transferred 
 to trouble shoot problems at one of our locations. After serious analysis, 
 I was able to increase sales 7% through marketing, reduce my food 
 cost by 8% through portioning and waste control and build morale amongst 
 the staff.” 

 

 The Final Piece on TELL ME ! The marketing statement 
 is probably the most fluid piece. It needs to be a one sentence summary 
 of specifically what you want to do next in your career . 
 The reason this third part is difficult is that it needs to specifically 
 address what you want to do next, AND it needs to change from interview 
 to interview to make sure it matches exactly what our client will 
 be interviewing the candidate for.

 

Continuing with the above example of one of our recent candidates, 
 two of his final sentences, which were used for two different clients, 
 follow:


 “For the next step in my career, 1 would like to 
 move away from privately owned concepts and focus my talents on corporately 
 owned, high volume restaurants.” 

 

But for a second client this ending was significantly altered because 
 of the candidate&apos;s multiple interests in differing opportunities:


 “For the next step in my career, I would like to 
 find myself as a General Manager with a growing company that will 
 allow me to be promoted to any other position based upon my performance.” 

 

These were two very different endings that perfectly matched two 
 very different client needs. Clearly you can see why the first ending 
 wouldn&apos;t t have worked for the second client or vice versa. With some 
 simple revising, we made sure that each client heard from our candidate 
 that he was interested in doing exactly what they were interested 
 in hiring him for.

 

It will be apparent that you are a prepared and serious player right 
 at the beginning of the interview when you answer the“Tell 
 me about yourself”question with this memorized brief marketing 
 statement which combines your career summary , an exceptional accomplishment , and company specific 
 career goals as in this example:

 

 “I am a professional, hands on restaurant manager 
 with 7 years experience in the full service and fine dining industry. 
 Recently, as a General Manager I was transferred to trouble shoot 
 problems at one of our locations. After serious analysis, I was able 
 to increase sales 7% through marketing, reduce my food cost by 8% 
 through portioning and waste control and built morale substantially 
 among the staff. For the next step in my career, 1 would like to move 
 away from privately owned concepts and focus my talents on corporately 
 owned, high volume restaurants.” 

 

Clearly you can understand how a candidate who opens with this type 
 of prepared response to the“Tell me about yourself”question 
 will make a significantly better first impression than a candidate 
 who responds to this question by answering“What would you like 
 to know•”or worse yet,“Well as you can obviously 
 see, I am 15 20 pounds overweight.”A candidate who is prepared 
 in this manner is confident at the interview&apos;s start, makes a substantial 
 and positive first verbal impression, gives a clear indication of 
 their interest in making a career move, and forces the interviewer 
 to get past the icebreaker questions to the parts of the interview 
 that will help both parties begin the process of seriously determining 
 if this is a solid match.

 

 Nonverbal Communications 
Escape the Pitfalls
by Carole Martin


It begins even before you say your first word in an interview. By 
 the time the interviewer walks toward you, an opinion is already being 
 formed. There you sit waiting to spew out your answers to questions 
 you&apos;ve prepared for, while you are already being judged by your appearance, 
 posture, smile or nervous look. A study done at UCLA a few years ago 
 revealed that the impact of a performance was based on 7 percent of 
 the words used, 38 percent on voice quality and 55 percent on nonverbal 
 communication.


Look back at speakers or teachers you&apos;ve listened to. Which ones stand 
 out as memorable? The ones who were more animated and entertaining 
 or the ones who just gave out information? This is not to say you 
 have to entertain the interviewer (no jokes, please), but it does 
 mean the conversation should be more interactive. If you say you are 
 excited about the prospect of working for this company but don&apos;t show 
 any enthusiasm, your message will probably fall flat. So smile, gesture 
 once in a while, show some energy and make the experience more pleasurable 
 for both sides.


 Nonverbal Pitfalls to Watch For: 


• The handshake: It&apos;s your first encounter 
 with the interviewer. He holds out his or her hand and receives a 
 limp, damp hand in return -- not a very good beginning. Your handshake 
 should be firm -- not bone-crushing -- and your hand should be dry 
 and warm. Try running cold water on your hands when you first arrive 
 at the interview site. Run warm water if your hands tend to be cold. 
 The insides of your wrists are especially sensitive to temperature 
 control.


• Your posture: Stand and sit erect. We&apos;re 
 not talking&quot;ramrod&quot;posture, but show some energy and enthusiasm. 
 A slouching posture looks tired and uncaring. Check yourself out in 
 a mirror or on videotape.


• Eye contact: Look the interviewer in the 
 eye. You don&apos;t want to stare, as this shows aggression. Occasionally, 
 and nonchalantly, glance at the interviewer&apos;s hand as he is speaking. 
 By constantly looking around the room while you are talking, you convey 
 a lack of confidence or discomfort with what is being discussed.


• Your hands: Gesturing or talking with your 
 hands is very natural. Getting carried away with hand gestures can 
 be distracting. Also, avoid touching your mouth while talking. Watch 
 yourself in a mirror while talking on the phone. Chances are you are 
 probably using some of the same gestures in an interview.


• Don&apos;t fidget: There is nothing worse than 
 someone playing with his or her hair, clicking a pen top, tapping 
 a foot or unconsciously touching parts of the body.


Preparing what you have to say is important, but practicing how you 
 will say it is imperative. The nonverbal message can speak louder 
 than the verbal message you are sending.

 

 Finally, Spice Up Your Answers 

 

Take a look at these typical answers and how you can make them more 
 unique.


 Typical: &quot;I am a high-energy person.&quot;This 
 answer needs more detail.
 Unique: &quot;I am a highly energized person.&quot;


 Typical: &quot;I&apos;m a hard worker.&quot;This is the 
 most common phrase used. It shows no imagination.
 Unique: &quot;I do whatever it takes to get the job 
 done, sometimes working 10-hour days.&quot;


 Typical: &quot;I am a quick learner.&quot;This is 
 an overused phrase that has lost its effectiveness.
 Unique: &quot;I can hit the ground running and come 
 up to speed faster than anyone I know.&quot;


 Typical: &quot;I&apos;m analytical.&quot;This is a lackluster 
 answer that doesn&apos;t reveal much.
 Unique: &quot;I&apos;m a wiz at analyzing data and transforming 
 it into useful information.&quot;


 Typical: &quot;I&apos;m very organized.&quot;This answer 
 is understated.
 Unique: &quot;I am a person who can bring order to 
 chaos.&quot;


 Typical: &quot;I&apos;m reliable.&quot;This answer needs 
 more information to get the point across.
 Unique: &quot;I pride myself on my record of never 
 missing deadlines.&quot;


 Typical: &quot;I&apos;m good with customers.&quot;The 
 answer needs clarification.
 Unique: &quot;I build great relationships with customers; 
 they always ask for me.&quot;

 

 Scripting Exercise 


Describing your personality is like writing ads for a product. What 
 makes you unique? Are you the type of person who would fit into this 
 organization? Your job is to convince your interviewer that you have 
 the perfect personality for the position.


Make a list of personality traits that describe you. Determine the 
 qualities you would like the interviewer to remember after the interview. 
 Incorporate some of the same words used in the job posting.


For example, if the job listing reads:&quot;Must have five or more 
 years&apos; experience managing a diverse population of employees,&quot;you might say to the interviewer:


 &quot;I am a person who values other people&apos;s qualities and 
 contributions. My employees would tell you that I am a fair manager 
 who listens when they have something to say.&quot; 


The more specific you are with your answer, the better your chances 
 of leaving a lasting impression. Interviewers talk to several candidates 
 in a single day. What will make you memorable?
