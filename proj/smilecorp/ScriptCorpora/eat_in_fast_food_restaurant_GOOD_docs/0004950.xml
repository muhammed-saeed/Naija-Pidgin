 Putting Ending My Lack of Motivation on My‘To Do List’ 
 By familylivingideas on Thursday, July 5th, 2012 | Shared Thoughts 
During the past several weeks, I have had a really hard time getting motivated to do some of the things I normally have no problem starting, much less actually finishing. I don’t know if it’s just the time of year and the ridiculously hot weather, or if there’s just some inner rebellion going on, but I’ve just about had enough of avoiding starting even the most basic of tasks.

Is it a real problem for a lot of people, especially women with families? Yeah, I’m pretty sure it is a national epidemic. I just did a bit of investigating and have found some tips that might help. I figure, at this point anything helps, and maybe something will really work.

The folks at Zen Family Habits.net have some great suggestions for getting the motivation bug scurring about in your brain. The first step they have is to make lists and lots of them. They compare approaching your day‘listless’as going about with no direction and then wondering how you got where you are, which is in my case, no where. It doesn’t matter how you make your lists, electronic, paper or audio, just write down what you need/want to accomplish and it could help you at least have a starting point.

 Fun Things to Do at the Beach With Your Family and Friends 
 By familylivingideas on Tuesday, July 3rd, 2012 | Shared Thoughts 
We all want to get our kids to become more active, and the best place for that is outdoors of course. The health benefits alone are enough to motivate those kiddos outside to play and enjoy nature. Another great place for families to have fun together is at the beach .

Very often, however, once everything and everybody is all packed up and then unpacked once you get to the beach, a lot of parents feel like,‘what now?’Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing bad about just letting the family run amuck (within reason of course,) and just play in the sand and water, but with just a teeny little bit of planning, there can actually be a few planned activities to engage the kids with . 

Here’s a few to get your creative juices stewing about:

 Play Games –When all else fails, play games on the beach. If you don’t want to deal with packing nets and equipment, then take a frisbee and just go!

 Learn a New Water Sport –Yes, swimming or floating in a tube rock, but you can learn a new water sport that the whole family can enjoy together like snorkeling, boating and even surfing. If your kids can’t swim, then get them some lessons so everyone can have fun.

 Get all crafty –If you’ve been to the beach, then you know that there is absolutely a world of craft materials just tossed about every single day waiting for you to gather them up. You can use shells, driftwood, feathers and even sand to make some awesome craft projects. These crafts can be done right there on the beach too so you don’t need to pack much more than glue and some paper and scissors etc. Look online for‘beach craft ideas’or something like that for inspiration and suggestions.

 What You Need to Know About Making Money With Storage Unit Auctions 
 By familylivingideas on Wednesday, April 4th, 2012 | Shared Thoughts 
 How would you like to make money with storage unit auctions ? You can start your own business or just make extra cash. This free report shows you how to get started. No strings, just free info you need to be successful. Go here now to get your copy. 

Are you interested in joining a storage unit auction? If you are, you’ve come to the right place. The number of storage unit auctions being held around the country has increased tenfold over the last few years, and there is no better time than now to strike it rich using this adventurous business model.

If you have watched Storage Wars before, or even American Pickers , you know that there is a wide market out there for almost anything that you can find during an auction.

Whether you’ve stumbled upon baseball cards or antique furniture, someone, somewhere nearby is waiting for an offer to buy them. While the business process itself is not as easy as the reality TV shows depict, there is still real money to be made from storage unit auctions.

 How it works 

When a storage unit renter fails to pay his monthly fees, his unit is foreclosed on by the company and auctioned off to willing buyers. During a live auction, the manager opens the storage unit and shows the contents to all of the bidders.

This allows the bidders to calculate whether or not a storage unit is profitable. After showing the unit to the bidders, the auctioneer then opens the auction with a baseline bid (usually $10 or more), and the formal bidding commences.

People just say how much they are bidding. Usually, it only takes a few minutes for a storage unit auction to end. Unless there are more than a handful of bidders involved, units get sold fast. If you’re competing against seasoned auction hunters, be prepared for bids as high as $4,000 for really profitable storage units.

 Organizing a Spring Garage Sale and Declutter Your Home 
 By familylivingideas on Wednesday, March 28th, 2012 | Shared Thoughts 
 
 How To Have A Successful Garage Sale: Learn How To Make More Money With Less Work Overall Rating:   Retail Price: $9.97 Amazon Price: $9.97 
 Spring is here. It’s the perfect time to begin organizing a spring garage sale and declutter your home at the same time. Think about what you want to accomplish and then use these tips to meet your goals.

Take a couple of weeks to go through your home to find everything you can for your garage sale. Chances are there’s more than you think, so give yourself some time to find it all. If possible, price things as you go to save time later on.

Start in the bedrooms, dressers and closets. Go through your closets first to find items that haven’t been worn in a year, aren’t absolutely loved or don’t fit anymore. If they’re in good shape they can be added to your garage sale stash. Don’t forget to look under the bed for shoes or purses. Check out the jewelry, too.

Head to the children’s rooms next. What have they outgrown that can’t be passed down to a sibling? Then start going through their toys. Find items which they haven’t played with in a long time. This might be an activity to do with your children but be prepared for the fact they may not be willing to part with much.

Step into the kitchen and see what you can part with there. Do you have more dishes than you need for the size of your family? What about the pots and pans? Have you recently gotten some new ones but the old ones are in good shape? Add them to your garage sale pile. You’ll also want to go through dish towels, silverware and glassware.

 You Really Can Throw a Preschooler’s Birthday Party…and Not Lose Your Mind in the Process 
 By familylivingideas on Tuesday, March 6th, 2012 | Shared Thoughts 
 
 Overall Rating:   Retail Price: Varies based on product options Amazon Price: View Sale Price 
 The best way to start to plan your preschooler’s party is to ask them what kind of party they want to have. This is important because they may want, or not want, a party similar to one which they have attended. By asking them what they want, you are on your way to being able to start your planning. You do not need to be fearful that if you ask what your child wants that they will tell you they want expensive options; most children have pretty simple wants such as a specific theme or color scheme they desire.

The next decision you need to make is the location for the birthday party . For young children, who are prone to being messy, you might want to have the party at a local fast-food restaurant or similar venue. This can have the effect of the kids having some fun, and you not having a large mess to clean up after the party has finished. Another good option is a local park if the weather in your area permits it. Just keep in mind the ages of all of the kids who will be attending.

If you dread the idea of spending hours with a pack of preschoolers on your weekend, you might choose to have the party in the evening or for just an hour or two on a Saturday afternoon. Preschoolers can only have a limited amount of fun before they become stressed out and start whining and crying. You can use this to your advantage by planning a relatively short but fun party.

If you will have more than a couple other children at the party you will need other adults to help you. Because preschoolers need lots of help and attention, you should have an adult for every three or four children in attendance. This will be a great help when children need help using the bathroom and other things as the party goes along.
