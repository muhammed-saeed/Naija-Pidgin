If you&apos;re a Fairfield native AND you&apos;re Filipino, you&apos;ll probably relate to my review.

I give credit to the ghetto Solano mall trying to make changes to the place. Interesting to see the area that used to be Tilt, Armed Forces Recruiting, Subway, and the salon as the food court area.  Kudos for having Filipino cuisine as one of the choices.

BUT- it is waaaaay over priced.  It is nice that they have this Filipino option at the mall, but DAYAM.  You are better off going over to Manila Seafood off north Texas (behind the jack in the crack) and eating there if you&apos;re craving Filipino food.

My husband does love their sisig though.  it&apos;s on the short order menu, so it&apos;s about $11 for sisig, rice, and egg.

This was my first time eating with this establishment.  Kinda disappointed with the pricing, overpriced!

Here&apos;s my order: 2 plate entree, med soda and BBQ pork.  Comes out to $13.19.  The young lady there served my plate with all the other entree&apos;s soup mixed together.  Just plain sloppy.

Sorry folks, the food is ok.  It just seems like they don&apos;t know how to cook in mass quantities.

The young lady who served me rushed to put my food on a plate.  Maybe I was interrupting her texting time.

They&apos;re alright. I got longanisa and it was good. I haven&apos;t tried the rest of their menu but pretty sure it&apos;s good.
I appreciate that it&apos;s always clean. I guess that&apos;s all. I have yet to eat there more often to provide a more thorough and detailed review.

I have to get my pancit palabok fix just about every month lol... Couple of things... Expect to pay... This place ain&apos;t cheap. Only get your food early morning or afternoon when it is fresh. Stay away from the louganisa or tocino... It just taste bland and when you purchase your drink buy it from the McDonald&apos;s across the way... Free refills and cheaper... So far I have tried half the menu and other then the palabok and BBQ pork I wouldn&apos;t eat anything else...

This place use to be good but now everything is tasteless. The garlic rice is missing the garlic taste n the pancit taste bland. The bbq pork has a funny tasting red sauce tht taste bland also. The people are rude n I felt like I was being rushed. Tht wouldve been fine but no one was behind me. this place is a big fail!!

4.5 stars.  Yummy food for a courtyard in the mall fast food restaurant.  It&apos;s a perfect alternative to the standard Panda Express in malls if you want a rice dish.  The food is fresh and there&apos;s a variety to choose from.  Try the vegetable dishes and longanisa.

First off...not bad for a Filipino restaurant in a mall food court. The food offerings at Inay are your typical Filipino fare you would experience at any Pinoy party or restaurant. Seeing as this restaurant was located in a mall setting outside your typical Filipino hubs, such as Daly City or Union City, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the menu was not Americanized for a more broad audience.

To the menu, traditional dishes such as Chicken Adobo, Beef Caldereta, Pancit, Shanghai Lumpia, barbecue on a stick and even Tinola. My favorite dish was the Beef Caldereta. Tender beef in the stew with carrots and potatoes. The Shanghai Lumpia was not bad too. I was actually disappointed with the Chicken Adobo. I prefer mine with more garlic and vinegar. Then again, that is a personal preference as there is no official recipe for the Philippines&apos; national dish. During my last visit to the Philippines on a culinary eating tour, I was told that there are hundreds of published varying recipes throughout the country. Inay also serves popular Philippine beverages like Sarsi, Milo and Calimancy juice.

I was just at the Great Mall in Milpitas today and found out that this is actually a chain restaurant. Excited to see if this brand can expand. The employees were also actually friendly too, which is always appreciated.

Overall, a great convenient spot if you are craving Filipino food in Fairfield.

Sadly, like all the other previous reviews I did not have a pleasant experience. Granted all the workers there were very nice and patient and the establishment just opened, but if you decide to order food from Inay rather than the nearby McDonalds, Taco Bell or Panda Express you definitely need patience. From the time I had placed our order to the time they called our name, a total of 20 minutes passed by. I honestly believe that if the Westfield Mall truly wanted a Filipino restaurant in their dining court, I truly think that a Jolibee&apos;s would have been more sufficient in regards to their kind and quick service.

As for the food, my husband tried the &quot;Breakfast Combo&quot; with tocino and I with longanisa. Unfortunately, neither one of us was in &quot;love&quot; with our choices, simply because it&apos;s not like home cooked tocino and longanisa. Inay gills their breakfast meat, which then makes the meat dry and bland. I prefer my longanisa and tocino moist and fried. Also, the portions of their garlic rice is HUGE! I honestly could not finish more than a 1/4 of the amount of rice they serve in individual plates. The one meal I did enjoy was their sisig as it was moist and held a lot of flavor.

Unfortunately, this Yelp reviewer may pass up Inay when choosing to eat at the Solano Westfield Mall and stick to either Panda Express or another fast-food joint.

This place is whack!!! If you want a entree plate (1,2,3) you are limited on two or three dishes for the price. Anything outside of those dishes is a dollar more a piece!! Why have a &apos;choice&apos; menu?? Plus no lichon???? WTF?!!  White folks will pay but this flip isn&apos;t!!

What a treat!

My husband and I were in Napa doing some wine tasting.  Our hotel was in Fairfield, so we opted to try the food court at the mall. We&apos;re really glad we did.

We ordered the bistek, menudo, palabok, garlic fried rice and pork bbq.  Everything was really tasty and seemed &quot;healthier&quot; - less greasy than your typical mom and pop filipino restaurants. We had to wait a little bit for the palabok, but not too long. My husband loved the food too, and we had enough food for leftovers the next day!

Sure, you can always have better filipino food at home.  That&apos;s a basic fact. But I was really proud to see a nice Filipino restaurant at the mall. Being from San Diego, there still aren&apos;t any family Filipino restaurants at the mainstream malls, except for Jollibee, Chow King and Goldilocks. So this is a major accomplishment in my book.

If I&apos;m ever in Fairfield again and have a craving for Filipino food, I will be back.

New restaurant at the Westfield Shopping Mall in Fairfield.

Finally the Fairfield mall has a food court.  This is one of them... a Filipino &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant.  If you haven&apos;t figured it out, I am Filipino, but that doesn&apos;t mean I eat the food everyday.  As a matter of fact, I probably eat it once a month.  Back to this place.  When I first got there, I said to myself...yup it&apos;s your typical Filipino restaurant.  Where you pick the food from the heating trays.  I&apos;m not much of a fan of eating food that&apos;s been in a tray for God knows how long.  I didn&apos;t try the food, but I did order the Halo Halo, which was the shaved ice with mixed gels, beans&amp;fruit with milk&amp;an ice cream on top.  It cost around $4.  I didn&apos;t care for it.  I&apos;ve had better.  I was surprise they didn&apos;t carry other Filipino drinks and treats.  They had smoothies but where&apos;s the Taho&amp;Buko Pandan.

This place sucks. Service is terrible; they hired a bunch of kids who have no idea what they&apos;re doing, even with an insane amount of them behind the counter doing nothing but talk to each other. The turon was unusually oily and there was a piece of melted plastic on one. I watched three concerned workers quickly and quietly discuss the piece of plastic before ultimately deciding to serve it to me anyway, with the plastic. I stole their chain-linked pen and watched them all go crazy when the next customer paid with a credit card and they had no idea how to find another pen..

First off, you can&apos;t compare store bought Filipino food to good ol&apos; homemade cooking. Of course homemade Filipino food will always be better. There aren&apos;t too many Filipino places for food out in this area, and this place is okay for what it offers.

My husband has ordered the bbq sticks - chicken or pork - whatever they&apos;ve got, and the sinigang. All I&apos;ve ordered is the longanisa, the siopao (not even filipino, it&apos;s chinese), the pancit, garlic rice and halo-halo.

BBQ sticks - they are good.
Sinigang - if you like sour sinigang, don&apos;t go looking for that here. All in all, it&apos;s okay.
Longanisa - I had some juicy morsels, pretty tasty. But no garlic kick, and I didn&apos;t get those 12-hour-late-burps tasting/smelling like longanisa. Filipinos - you know what I&apos;m talking about here...
Pancit - I didn&apos;t enjoy this one bit.
Siopao - usually can&apos;t go wrong this Chinese delicacy.
Garlic rice - tasty. good. garlic and rice - how you can you mess that one up.
Halo Halo - I was quite disappointed in this. They don&apos;t give you much of the &quot;stuff&quot; it&apos;s filled with evaporated milk and shaved ice. I swear I only ate two slices of jack fruit and 3 gel squares of nata de coco.

Basically, if you need a Filipino food fix, and don&apos;t have any Filipinos to cook for you at the moment, this is the place to go. Or, if you&apos;re lazy to cook and don&apos;t care about &quot;hitting the spot,&quot; this place is okay to go. They&apos;ve got breakfast all day so not too shabby!

As far as service, if you talk to the guy in glasses, make sure you are clear with him when he takes your order, he got our order wrong pretty bad.

In my humble opinion, Inay is the best &quot;Fast Food&quot; Filipino restaurant I&apos;ve had the pleasure to eat. (Can&apos;t beat mom&apos;s cooking tho&apos;!) It&apos;s not as greasy as Sisig in Suisun or Goldilocks. A very big plus is the Adobo Chicken and BBQ sticks (pork or chicken) had no fat what so ever... a rarity I&apos;ve seen in Pinoy eat outs. I&apos;m quite impressed by the portions and shortage of grease I find after my meal.

My biggest complaint is the service. They&apos;re kind and courteous but extremely slow. They have a system in place where they take your name and order down and write it on the to go box. From there the same guy gets the food by himself 1 by one... There is 1 person on the register, 1 bagging your food and 1 getting drinks. 4 cooks are rotating BBQ sticks and JUST 1 person is taking orders and serving. I arrived there at 11:30 today and sadly it took 25 minutes to get my food. The person getting drinks and bagging needs to help out. (I&apos;ve seen this twice already)

I&apos;m not a fan of service like this. I used to LOVE Max&apos;s Fried chicken in Vallejo but there service is god awful and slow. (polite people though) It was so bad I haven&apos;t eaten there in over 6 years. I HOPE Inay changes there customer service because I like there food. It&apos;s too early to write them off, I&apos;m hoping to see improvements.

Went here for breakfast one day and the lady was helpful and fiendly since I was unfamiliar with a lot of the menu items.

However that all came to a stop when I didn&apos;t tip on my debit receipt but really who tips at a food court?

She got a bad attitude when she saw that and didn&apos;t want to help me after that which is sad because she seemed to be some type of manager.

Good was just ok but after that little episode I won&apos;t be going back.

I went there with my mom and I was not impressed. First of all they&apos;re way too expensive. I don&apos;t like pork or chicken too much so I had to pay an extra $1 for beef. I got the kare-kare and it was horrible. All I tasted was pepper. I didn&apos;t even finish my food.. That was my second time coming. The first time wasn&apos;t great either but we thought it was just because they were closing. Now I know not to eat there again. One star just for them being conveniently located in a mall.

Needed to make a quick trip to the Solano Mall and what a better way to check out the new food court for the second time since opening last month. I had a mad craving for filipino food and since I&apos;ve been here once before, I thought I&apos;d check it out again.

I ordered their 2 item combo plate which included garlic fried rice, pancit and 2 items I chose. I decided to go for the pork adobo and their pork mechado. Everything was wonderful and filled with great flavor. Not oily and the meat was extremely tender and moist.  They gave plenty of food for my toddler and I to share. Was just enough to fill both our bellies.

I also ordered their pork sisig to go which comes with the pork sisig, garlic fried rice, and a fried egg on top. This is also has great flavor with me wanting more! I don&apos;t know what times people have gone to have them wait so long but its a monday around 1pm that I went and had no problems whatsoever in waiting..esp when I had to wait for my sisig to be made. Stood there with a fresh batch of sisig within 5 minutes. So far so good with my visits @ Inay and wouldn&apos;t mind coming back to try other things whenever I come to the mall.

The staff is extremely friendly and a pleasure to talk with. yes. I will be back!

I read reviews among my friends on Facebook. After trying this it wasn&apos;t exactly on point.

I tried the beef steak, fried rice,BBQ chicken, Kare-Kare, and pancit.

Since I was raised with a ton of traditional Filipino dishes it&apos;s hard for me to like the food. The beef steak was delicious and so was the rice. But the pancit and Kare Kare werent as tasty as I thought. And why $1 extra for the beef? Even Sisig in suisun doesn&apos;t charge extra for theirs. They&apos;re more home made than Inay.

If you haven&apos;t had Filipino food you can go here. They do have pretty good food but doesn&apos;t have the homely taste for me. They will charge extra depending on some of the entrees.

I&apos;ll have it once every blue moon, but won&apos;t e too regular since I have Sisig near my residence.

I think it&apos;s neat there&apos;s a filipino Resturaunt in the mall and I hope young Filipinos share with their friends about their culture and be proud of their heritage.  My favorite spot for a Filipino fix when Mom isn&apos;t around is in Suisun called Sisig but this is just around the corner from work.  I had the Garlic Fried Rice, pancit, BBQ Chicken adobo and vegetables in coconut milk (aka Ginataang Gulay). It&apos;s pretty tasty, if you like garlic and peppery flavors which I do, and I enjoyed it. The service was ok but remember you&apos;re in the mall so be realistic. I ate here a little before lunch and  I think the best part was sitting next to a lot of Lolos and Lolas eating apter der walk around de mall.  Joking lang, i miss my Lola.   Anyhow, I&apos;ll visit again there&apos;s more on the menu I would like to try out.  Good luck Inay!

Tried this place for the first time while shopping.  I&apos;d say their food, especially Kare Kare, pork spicy binagoongan, pakbet,&amp;pancit are super good!  Their Kare Kare tastes just like my husband&apos;s cooking, tender, tasty, with just the right amount of peanut butter.  Yummy!  A big plate overflowing with 4 items consisting of rice, noodles&amp;meat/fish dish&amp;/or vegetable dish cost me $8.00 with plenty of leftover for dinner!

Finally a filipino restaurant nearby. I was pretty excited hearing about this since I work at the mall and could go here a lot on my breaks.Service wasn&apos;t the fastest but I think over time it will speed up a bit. I tried the adobo with steamed rice. A huge plus for me was the amount of rice they give you. It&apos;s more than perfect, and the fact that they put some sauce all over your rice if you want it. I subtract a star just because of the greasiness, but can&apos;t really complain much. It&apos;s filipino...and fast food.haha

Tapa was grilled right when you order it. It was yummylicious!  Menudo was good and  I liked the garlic fried rice and Pancit.   Lechon Kawali is what they&apos;re known for and it does NOT disappoint!  Pork BBQ is also a MUST! Halo Halo is also the bomb! One complaint I have is the portions are a bit small.

I love trying new foods, but this was a mistake. I travel love discovering new places to eat and have a great pallet for ethnic foods. I&apos; tasted great filipino foods in my life but this place takes the worse. The meat was bland. the food looked as if it was sitting for over an hour. Service was really slow. i&apos;ve gone to a supper busy restaurant and service much better. The server was more on his cell than servicing customers. i usually give place a second try but it&apos;s not worth it for me.

For my first visit to the new food court at Solano Mall, I decided to give Inay Filipino Kitchen a whirl since it was one of the only two restaurants there I hadn&apos;t had before (the other is this teriyaki joint I forgot the name of).  The consensus from my coworkers was that this place was pretty good, and now I know why!

After glancing at the menu, I immediately ordered the Caldareta because 1) I hadn&apos;t had it in a while,&amp;2) it&apos;s one of my favorite dishes that my mom makes soooooo deliciously + despicably well!  They served me a huge, heaping portion of garlic fried rice (when it comes to plain, white rice, I usually prefer the perfect rice-to-protein ratio, but hey, if it&apos;s garlic rice, it doesn&apos;t hurt to have more than enough!) and placed the Caldareta neatly to the side, and even though it was at this food court on an empty mid-afternoon, the look&amp;feel of this clean, newly-renovated space made it nice to eat at! As far as how well the Caldareta was, mmmm it was delicious! Although a little tangier than my mom&apos;s recipe, the beef was juicy and very tender, and it&apos;s very difficult to get garlic rice wrong, I could probably eat that with almost any protein! I also tried their adobo and it was o.k. at best.  I usually don&apos;t eat when I make a visit to the mall, but I&apos;d come back to try the other dishes in the future if my mom is out of town :)

I know Filipino food.  I am always willing to try new food and today I went to Inay.  My initial observations were how pricy the combos were.  3 entrees plus rice or noodles will run you $10 (which does NOT include a drink).  I had a sampling of staple Filipino dishes: garlic rice, pancit, pork adobo, menudo and caldereta plus a side order of lumpia shanghai.  Nevermind the inordinate amount of food I ordered.  The garlic rice was perhaps the best I&apos;ve ever had. It was fresh, garlicky enough and not oily. The pancit on the other hand was rather generic tasting.  It was slightly under seasoned and the tasted a bit of packet blend.  The pork adobo was the freshest and tastiest entree, having arrived to the serving line immediately prior to me ordering.  Then again, adobe is the quintessential Filipino dish, so it would be embarrassing if it was anything other than perfect.  The meat was tender, had a nice balance of salty and sour, and exhibited excellent umami.  Both the menudo and caldereta had a good ratio of meat to vegetable;  the meat was tender and vegetables were cooked perfectly.   The menudo was entirely too sweet and made it difficult to eat more than two bites.  The sugary taste lingered on the palate.  The menudo had excellent taste, but was entirely too salty.  It tasted as if the chef used the olive brine to add flavor to the dish, but inadvertently made the dish salty.  The lumpia was nothing special. It tasted of--at best--average frozen commercial brand lumpia.  For the price and quality of the food, I would recommend eating here if it&apos;s convenient or if you&apos;re looking for good garlic rice and pork adobo.  I&apos;d come back because unless I had a horrible first experience, I&apos;ll give anywhere a second try. The next time I plan to order their barbecued meats, pancit palabok, bistek and chicken adobo.

The convenience of having a this Filipino kitchen in Solano Mall was a good idea.  I know that there&apos;s only a hand full of malls in our area that has Inay, but having it here in Fairfield opens up culture in this mall.  Their selection that I saw yesterday was pretty good.  They had Bangus (which wasn&apos;t my favorite), a chicken soup, kare-kare, and a half and half plate of pancite and garlic rice.  My boyfriend and I shared this plate because he wasn&apos;t too familiar with filipino food.  The only thing that really sucks is how they seriously hike up the prices, the kare-kare was an additional $2 to the three item plate, the bangus was a bit more as well.  The bangus has be cooked on their grill which might take a little while before you pay and leave.  I did like their garlic rice and kare-kare but the pancit was dry.  I did noticed that the soup wasn&apos;t as oily as other restaurant would cook it as, which made me appreciate this place a bit more. Thumbs up!

Grand opening of the Solano Malls&apos; food court was yesterday and so was a new place called Inay Filipino Kitchen. Also in the food court was McD&apos;s, Taco Bell, Subway and Panda Express. The line for Inays at dinner time was at least 30 people, not surprisingly, made up of mostly Filipinos.  Their menu is made up of about a dozen or so of the more popular dishes: Sinigang, Adobo, bbq chicken-on-a-stick, bangus, lechon, pansit, lumpia, etc. It took about 30 mins to get through the line and by the time I got to the counter they&apos;d run out of steamed rice, garlic fried rice, chicken, and bangus. Fortunately, I was eyeballing the Pork Sinigang. Unfortunately without rice I had to have it with pansit. Also, each entrée is supposed to come with two side dishes. I asked what sides were left and the young lady behind the counter pointed at the pinakbet (which is also an entrée). I nodded thinking it was going in as my other side order since there didn&apos;t appear to be any others but it got rung up as an extra entrée. They also weren&apos;t taking credit or debit cards which I didn&apos;t find out until I was in line for 20 mins. Fortunately I had cash. Some folks behind me left. When the guy in front of me got rung up he said he was &quot;friends and family&quot; and so got a discount. Overall the experience was just ok. I attribute a lot of their issues to opening day. But really, a Filipino place running out of rice is like Starbucks running out of coffee. It shouldn&apos;t happen. The sinigang was pretty good but without rice, it&apos;s just not complete. Same with the pinakbet. The pancit was a little peppery from what I&apos;m used to but it was still ok. I&apos;ll probably go back because it&apos;s convenient, I want to try more of the menu,  and the only other good Filipino food close by is Sisig in Suisun. There aren&apos;t very many options in Fairfield for us Kababayan, but I think if they can keep up with the volume of customers they&apos;re likely to get, they&apos;ll fill the void nicely and do very well for some time to come.
