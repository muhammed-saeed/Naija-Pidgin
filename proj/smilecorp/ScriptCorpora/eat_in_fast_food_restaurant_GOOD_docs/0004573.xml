Retail Store Managers - 45 mandatory hours
 Tags: allowable , due , employee , employment , exempt , florida , labor , law , legally , managers , mandate , mandatory , money , retail , schedule , store , themselves , time Florida

Since an exempt employee is not legally due money for time worked past 40 hours, is it allowable to mandate them to schedule themselves to work at least 45 hours a week? Can that be put in the employee handbook and enforced?

Thanks 3 Comments under it.

 Post a Comment Now. Comments Fri, 05 Sep 2008 08:15:00 GMT (1) Yes to both questions. Fri, 05 Sep 2008 08:17:00 GMT (2) I think you are misunderstanding how&quot;exempt&quot;status worked. It is NOT that they are being paid for 40 hours and any hours over that are unpaid. It is that their salary covers all the time they are working whether that is 10 hours or 90 hours.

Any employee, exempt or non-exempt, can be required to work as many hours as the employer needs them to work. Nothing in the law says an exempt employee cannot be required to work over 40 hours a week. For exempt employees, the number of hours is immaterial. But most exempt employees in my experience work over 40 hours a week on a regular basis. Fri, 05 Sep 2008 23:35:00 GMT (3) This is one where there are a lot of wrongly classified employees. The title of manager or being paid on a salary basis is not enough to merit being exempt from overtime. Several retail establishments learned the hard way by calling their store managers&quot;exempt&quot;. Note the use of&quot;primary duty&quot;. If you spend more than 50% of your work time doing non managerial duties you would not qualify as exempt.
From the FLSA:

An employee who meets the salary level tests and also the salary basis tests is exempt only if s/he also performs exempt job duties. These FLSA exemptions are limited to employees who perform relatively high-level work. Whether the duties of a particular job qualify as exempt depends on what they are. Job titles or position descriptions are of limited usefulness in this determination. (A secretary is still a secretary even if s/he is called an&quot;administrative assistant,&quot;and the chief executive officer is still the CEO even if s/he is called a janitor.) It is the actual job tasks that must be evaluated, along with how the particular job tasks&quot;fit&quot;into the employer&apos;s overall operations.

There are three typical categories of exempt job duties, called&quot;executive,&quot;&quot;professional,&quot;and&quot;administrative.&quot;

Exempt executive job duties.

Job duties are exempt executive job duties if the employee

1. regularly supervises two or more other employees, and also
2. has management as the primary duty of the position, and also,
3. has some genuine input into the job status of other employees (such as hiring, firing, promotions, or assignments).

Supervision means what it implies. The supervision must be a regular part of the employee&apos;s job, and must be of other employees. Supervision of non-employees does not meet the standard. The&quot;two employees&quot;requirement may be met by supervising two full-time employees or the equivalent number of part-time employees. (Two half-time employees equal one full-time employee.)

&quot;Mere supervision&quot;is not sufficient. In addition, the supervisory employee must have&quot;management&quot;as the&quot;primary duty&quot;of the job. The FLSA Regulations contain a list of typical management duties. These include (in addition to supervision):

* interviewing, selecting, and training employees;
* setting rates of pay and hours of work;
* maintaining production or sales records (beyond the merely clerical);
* appraising productivity; handling employee grievances or complaints, or disciplining employees;
* determining work techniques;
* planning the work;
* apportioning work among employees;
* determining the types of equipment to be used in performing work, or materials needed;
* planning budgets for work;
* monitoring work for legal or regulatory compliance;
* providing for safety and security of the workplace.

Determining whether an employee has management as the primary duty of the position requires case-by-case evaluation. A&quot;rule of thumb&quot;is to determine if the employee is&quot;in charge&quot;of a department or subdivision of the enterprise (such as a shift). One handy clue might be to ask who a telephone inquiry would be directed to if the called asked for&quot;the boss.&quot;Typically, only one employee is&quot;in charge&quot;at any particular time. Thus, for example, if a&quot;sergeant&quot;and a&quot;lieutenant&quot;are each at work at the same time (in the same unit or subunit of the organization), only the lieutenant is&quot;in charge&quot;during that time.

An employee may qualify as performing executive job duties even if s/he performs a variety of&quot;regular&quot;job duties as well. For example, the night manager at a fast food restaurant may in reality spend most of the shift preparing food and serving customers. S/he is, however, still&quot;the boss&quot;even when not actually engaged in&quot;active&quot;bossing duties. In the event that some&quot;executive&quot;decisions are required, s/he is there to make them, and this is sufficient.

The final requirement for the executive exemption is that the employee have genuine input into personnel matters. This does not require that the employee be the final decision maker on such matters, but rather that the employee&apos;s input is given&quot;particular weight.&quot;Usually, it will mean that making personnel recommendations is part of the employee&apos;s normal job duties, that the employee makes these kinds of recommendations frequently enough to be a&quot;real&quot;part of the job, and that higher management takes the employee&apos;s personnel suggestions or recommendations
