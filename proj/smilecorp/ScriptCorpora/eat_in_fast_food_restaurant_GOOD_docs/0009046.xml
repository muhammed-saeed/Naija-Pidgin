The Olympus Stylus 730 is an all-around solid ultracompact, with a weatherproof metal body that&apos;s appealing to the eye. Also appealing is the large, 3.0-inch LCD, which dominates the otherwise slim camera&apos;s back side. The 730 is a superlative low-light camera, with a high-sensitivity mode (ISO 1600), geared to capture good looking images when less is available. The camera&apos;s buttons self-illuminate when it gets dark, and the LCD is super-bright.

Olympus Stylus 730 Comments&amp;Questions ( write your own! )
 Write a comment or ask a question about the Olympus Stylus 730: 
 Kaitlyn (09/27/2010) My Olympus Stylus 730 keeps saying&quot;zoom error&quot;whenever i attempt to turn it on, and the lens stays open. Whenever i presses the&quot;Menu&quot;button, it will chime several beeps after and turn itself off again. I can&apos;t send it in to get fixed and my warranty is over. Any suggestions ? reply to this comment (by James DeRuvo—09/29/2010) I&apos;m betting it&apos;s a battery issue. THis camera is near 5 years old and those LiOns lose capacity over time. Try a fresh battery and clean your contacts. if that doens&apos;t work, it&apos;s time for a new camera. reply to this comment (emmaaaaa—08/29/2010) Hi there,

I was taking a photo and zoomed in quite a bit and then my camera wouldn&apos;t zoom out again. I took this as the camera being frozen and just turned it off hoping the zoom would reset. When I went to turn the camera back on, I noticed that the lens had not closed when I had turned it off. Now when I turn it on, I can hear the shutter trying to open (even though it&apos;s already open) and then the camera beeps a few times and then the start up music plays and then the whole thing shuts off. The screen is blank and so I don&apos;t know if this is the &apos;zoom error&apos; all you guys were talking about but it&apos;s really starting to get on my nerves! The only explanation I have is the fact that I traveled from Hong Kong (where I live and it is very hot at the moment) to Australia (where we are now in the middle of winter) and the camera received a shock from the sudden temperature change.



I&apos;ve tried hitting the camera against my wrist, my hand and the table and the lens has still not budged. I charged it overnight and tried the reset button and still nothing. I&apos;m now sitting on my camera hoping that the warmth will release the shutter but other than that I don&apos;t know what else to do :( As I&apos;m on holiday at the moment I would really like to get my camera fixed ASAP! If anyone knows anything that may help (besides me spending thousands of dollars getting it serviced) please let me know! reply to this comment (Chris Weigl—08/30/2010) Can you hear the motor trying to work and failing? You either have sand/dust stuck in the lens barrel or the motor failed. Either way, you&apos;ll need to get it serviced. You can try blowing around the lens with compressed air but it&apos;s a longshot. reply to this comment (emmaaaaa—09/01/2010) Thanks for your reply!

I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s the motor - it sounds like the lens is trying to open even though it&apos;s already open if you know what I mean.

I was able to get the photos off my camera onto my computer, and plugging it into my laptop actually made the screen work and I can now see the &apos;zoom error&apos; message.

I think I&apos;m just going to go buy a new camera - I asked a few camera repair shops what they thought and they said it would be about $200 AUD to get it repaired, I can buy a brand new better camera for less. I&apos;m going to steer clear of Olympus though that&apos;s for sure! reply to this comment HB (02/11/2010) While everyone had the ZOOM ERROR my 730 had a an open lens issue.

Bought a new battery at TARGET meant for a FUJI (it said that it would fit the Stylus 730 too) for $19.95 by Targus.)

When the battery was installed the camera would startup and after about 5-10 seconds would turn off with gentle music.

Well...I slapped the camera on my wrist a few times and all of a sudden a picture appeared again. What a relief...

I firmly believe that there is a mechanical linkage issue on the little door which protects the lens. A gentle jar has released the jamming.

I was already to return the battery and walk away from this camera. I want to buy a new camera on my terms not as quick replacement for a bad one.

Thank you for the tip folks. reply to this comment (by James DeRuvo—02/13/2010) Cycling the camera on/off several times is often a more gentle course of action. Forcing things can cause more problems than it solves. reply to this comment HB (02/14/2010) After cycling the camera several times I gave up..!

I wrapped it on my left wrist while holding it with my right hand.

If I would have knocked the camera on a table, I would certainly agree with your thoughts. reply to this comment hajgomz (03/28/2007) i have a problem with my Olympus stylus 730... i cant start it.... when i press the power on button, the screen appears ZOOM ERROR!!! what will i do? PLS HELP!!!! pls help me to solve my problem.thank you reply to this comment (Andrew Skinner—03/28/2007) Haji,



This sounds like a lens error. I would try coldstarting the camera first. Take the battery out and leave it out for about 5 minutes. Re-insert the battery and try to turn the camera on. If this does not work, try the reset button on the top of the camera. If this does not work either, I would get in touch with Olympus repair support ( olympusamerica.com/cpg_sect...  ). Good luck.



Andrew reply to this comment (hajgomz—03/29/2007) hi andrew,

i have already did what you have told me on your reply, but it still does not working?

can you please help me where to find a solution in my problem..please i really badly needed your help. thank u again. reply to this comment (Jeff—05/06/2007) Hello,



My camera did the same thing today. So I searched the internet, found this thread. I guess it is a common problem for this camera, and the only thing I could do is to send it for repair.



I t must be related to lense - whenever you turned on the camera, the lense is adjusted fir focus, and something went wrong.



Ant tips? Someone has had the same problem and got fixed?

Thanks reply to this comment (Sara—06/18/2007) Hello,



I just discovered today that my camera too would not open, and it had the words&quot;ZOOM ERROR&quot;...even though this camera takes great pictures...it seems as though its not reliable...



This camera will probably be my first and my last Olympus purchase. reply to this comment (Jeff—06/18/2007) Hi Sara:



I sent this camera for repair and it returned, everything works again. Took 1.5 week. Send it to Olympus Canada, or two other US locations found from Olympus web.



Most likely yours is also under warrenty since this model is relatively new. So don&apos;t give up.



Jeff reply to this comment (Sara—06/19/2007) Thanks Jeff, for the encouragement. I think I will be sending my camera for repair...since I am going on a trip in two weeks. But my friend had the same camera as I, and they wouldn&apos;t repair the camera for him because they said the camera was damaged through users abuse. So yeah, if I don&apos;t get my camera fixed...its gonna be a total downer :(! reply to this comment (Sara—06/28/2007) well i just got a call..and they said they won&apos;t fix it due to user abuse..claiming i dropped it when i didn&apos;t!!! and i spend so much time arguing with them too!!! gah!!!!!!!!!!!!!! reply to this comment (ali—07/03/2007) i have the same problem it says zoom error!! please help me b/c i paid alott for this camera:&apos;( reply to this comment (by James DeRuvo—08/24/2007) I find zoom errors occur when the battery power is near depleted. I have also found that if you hold down the on button for a second or two longer it doesn&apos;t occur as often. But the key is to keep your batteries fresh. reply to this comment (ali—08/24/2007) thank you james i sent it off to get it repaired but if i have this prob again ill take ur advice:) reply to this comment (fD—08/28/2007) I had the same problem with my stylus 730. Even when the battery&apos;s fully charged, it still wouldn&apos;t open. I found that if you lightly hit it on your wrist a few times, the lens cover will retract as normal when powering it up (what an advanced technique, i know). reply to this comment (LN—07/01/2010) Thank you so much! I am in Ireland and completely demented trying to find someone to repair my Olympus u730, googled it and found this thread - the wrist thing didn&apos;t work but then I lightly tapped it on the table and ....a little miracle after months of recharging battery and turning it on and off....it&apos;s working!!



Whatever life I get out of it now is a bonus - definitely won&apos;t buy another Olympus - shame because I love it.



Thanks again! reply to this comment (Nar—09/03/2007) fD, you&apos;re brilliant. I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t think of that myself. I thought I&apos;d have to either bust out the screwdriver or spend $150+ to either get it repaired or buy a new one. But i hit it on my wrist a couple times, and it&apos;s back to normal! Thanks a lot! (Stylus 730) reply to this comment (ali—09/08/2007) well mine is back to normal b/c i gt it sent off to be repaired but i will take ur advice next time if it does that again thanks sooo much fd Love ~ali!~ reply to this comment (BP—09/17/2007) Yes, this seems to be a common problem. I have sent my Stylus 730 in for repairs 3 (yes, 3!) times in the past 6 weeks (all under warranty). The last time the repair took longer because they&quot;were waiting on a part&quot;which sounds as if they actually replaced a defective part (the lens cover looks different now) rather than just gently whacking it on someone&apos;s wrist. We will see how long this works; but you know that if I get ZOOM ERROR again, I will be hitting it lightly (or not so lightly) against my wrist to see if I can fix it myself! Thanks for the tip. reply to this comment (Jane—09/23/2007) I also had the zoom error for my brand new camera. Nothing worked until I found this post and followed the advice of taking out the battery for a few minutes and lightly hitting it against my wrist. Crazy!



Thanks for the tip....

So I thought I was going to have to get a new camera - almost cried when I saw the horrid&quot;zoom error&quot;.



Thank you SOOOO much fD... the tip WORKED! reply to this comment (Vicky—11/04/2007) OMG...I cannot beleive that hitting it against my hand actually worked. What? That is crazy! Thanks for the tips! I was really close to going to the store to buy a new camera. reply to this comment (LB—11/21/2007) I called and argued about the zoom error and was told because it has a dent on the bottom left, that it&apos;s not covered under warranty and will cost more to fix than it cost to buy. PIECE OF CRAP! reply to this comment (Sara—11/21/2007) same here LB...so instead I got fed up with them and just opened it up and fixed it myself... reply to this comment (SUBZRO—01/15/2008) I KNOW HOW TO FIX THE ZOOM ERROR PROBLEM, JUST AS U TURN IT ON HIT THE PART WHERE THE RESET BUTTON IS OR AROUND THERE A COUPLE OF TIME AS IT IS TURNING ON AND IT WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL, WORKED FOR ME! KEEP DOIN IT IT TOOK ME ABOUT 3MINS! DONT GIVE UP AND WASTE YOUR MONEY! reply to this comment (dowain—03/16/2008) hey thanks man, i hit mine just once and it started working fine. THANK YOU. reply to this comment (Andrew Skinner—03/16/2008) All,



Remember that when you&quot;hit&quot;your camera, you can cause more issues than fix the one you&apos;re looking at. Also, admitting this can void your warranty. Just be careful with your equipment.



Andrew reply to this comment (sweetheart—06/17/2008) SUBZRO thank u very much, it really worked and I was very close to spend my money on fixing it.... reply to this comment (aimee—06/19/2008) ahh its so annoying!

ive been hitting it for about 30mins and nothins happened, the lens is open, but wont close, :@ reply to this comment (Easylistener—07/04/2008) I&apos;ve had a look, and before trying the tapping thing, and possibly damaging things, my friends camera Mu 730 had the same zoom error, so I took out the battery and warmed it slightly till it was at room temperature or just above, it started immediately showing a full battery level. I think its a design issue with this camera as the casing is all metal and the battery compartment is like a refrigerator, and as a result it suffers from moisture on the contacts. I suggested to my friend that she keep the camera in a warm dry area, and also that she puts a dessicant sachet such as silica gel with the camera, problem solved. reply to this comment (Michelle—07/06/2008) So I tried the advanced&quot;hitting technique&quot;.. it took a minute.. but after a nice swift hit... it worked!!

Thank you to the brain of this operation who decided to tell all of us the common sense route!!! reply to this comment (Genia—08/27/2008) My camera is doing the same thing but the lens is open. What do I do? reply to this comment (RP—11/08/2008) Wow, this is amazing I had to wack it a little harder than just my wrist but THANKS!!! It really does work.

Thanks for the hitting technique tip! reply to this comment (CD—12/13/2008) Just take you finger and slide the camera lens cover down and up a few times and it will start back to working. It appears that the lens cover gets stuck causing the&quot;zoom error&quot; reply to this comment (Jared—12/19/2008) how come the hitting it works for everyone but me! damn it... im on vacation and it jus came up. no reason to cause it... reply to this comment (Pat Walters—12/27/2008) I can&apos;t believe it! If I had looked on here and read about taking the battery out and/or wacking it, I would have saved myself a lot of grief. I went out and bought another camera (a piece of crap) for the cost of the&quot;zoom error&quot;repair. I compared cameras and wished the Olympus worked. I had taken the battery out; when I put it back my camera was working! It is if I got a free camera now. Thanks for your tips, guys. reply to this comment (tess—12/29/2008) holy shit i just wanted to add, the hitting thing worked for me too! i left this thing for dead two months ago and now, a simple slap on the wrist, battery out for 5 secs, reset button and IT WORKS! don&apos;t let it discourage you if it doesnt work right away. i had to definitely slap it around like crazy and even tried pulling the lens down to make it work, but it finally did! reply to this comment (16 Lizards—01/23/2009) I&apos;ve had this camera for over 2 years, so it is out of warranty. It&apos;s been a great camera, I&apos;m even on the second battery. But now I&apos;m getting this zoom error you&apos;re all talking about, so I decided to google it and found this great thread. before this, I tried tapping, hitting, slapping, whacking and slamming the friggin&apos; thing (after all, I already gave it up for dead since it it too old to repair and there are better ones on the market today for the same or less price.) I even tried prying the lens closed with a fine tool. NOTHING! The lens tries to close upon startup and zoom error appears. I could break out the jeweler&apos;s toolset and open it up. Any other ideas?



 reply to this comment (jake—05/03/2009) I&apos;m a believer now too. I was using my Olympus Stylus 730 and zoomed in to snap a picture. Suddenly the camera froze. The lens cover would not close and the camera would not turn on. When pressing the menu button the screen would come on blue. After reading this post I removed the battery, cleaned the contacts and put it back in. When I turned the camera on I hit the reset button then gave it a sharp wack across the top with my hand and now it works like new. I tried less forceful slaps and that did not work. I had to strike it pretty hard with my hand. Like the others have said, don&apos;t give up. The lens cover must get stuck and needs a good jar to get it going. reply to this comment (Stephan—07/23/2009) OH man! There are a lot of complaints on the same problem with this camera.&quot;ZOOM ERROR&quot;I bought this camera when I was in New York city. I now live in Australia. So I have no hope at all in getting it fixed. I tried a light bang on the wrist. NO LUCK. Now I have to go out and buy the smallest philips head screw driver in the world. I will just open it up and fix it my self. If I can not, then I will try the banging it one more time. But it will not be on my wrist. I will use the brick wall on my house!!!&quot;THAT SHOULD FIX IT&quot; reply to this comment (Kitty—09/14/2009) Just wanted to say a quick thanks to fD -- a couple of slaps to the wrist did the trick! Thanks again! reply to this comment (Fran—11/05/2009) Wow--the hitting across the wrist thing works! Thought I&apos;d have to send it for repair--or buy another camera. I had tapped it before with my hand but hadn&apos;t tried the wrist. Thank you fD!!! Now--the lens cover still taps closed incessantly when I power off. Is there a way to stop this? reply to this comment (Jenn—11/06/2009) After tapping it on my wrist for a while and not being successful, I hit it with a rod like it was a piece of junk so hard that it dented... then it came back to life. Thanks!! reply to this comment (G money—11/09/2009) Hitting it actually works!!!!! hahaha. I turned on mine and slammed the bottom on my palm and it works. reply to this comment (jen—12/13/2009) you&apos;ve got to be kidding me... i just bnged mine on the bottom and it worked. I can&apos;t believe it! i borrowed my mom&apos;s camera, and freaked when I thought I broke it. Now, it works... and she&apos;ll never know! thanks for helping to solve this problem everyone! reply to this comment (Mr. West—12/22/2009) hit is against your hand niggaa that shit worksssssssssss yeeeeeeeeeeee

-thanks for listening im kanye west this camera is my shit since GLOW IN THE DARK

--thanks for came out Taylor Swift suck my nuts ya country ass bitc reply to this comment Disgusted (02/11/2010) Moderator could you delete this post . It is not productive at all yet offensive reply to this comment (Mitch—01/08/2010) Might be the hitting creates a better contact with the battery , rather than having anything to do with the lens mechanics. Would think a &apos;metal on metal&apos; hit would be needed for that reply to this comment (Mitch—01/09/2010) OOOOO yes , its working again , took screwdriver and tapped the camera all over the place whilst continually powering on and off. Took about 2 mins , then walla !!! Many thanks for the help with this ..REALLY chuffed reply to this comment peterthegreat (12/22/2006) reply to this comment (Brenda Paro—12/22/2006) Hi Jane,

Can you clarify a little? I can definitely help. From what I gather you own the Olympus Stylus 730... but shutter speed and shutter lag are two different things. Do you want to increase shutter speed (take a fast-action shot) or increase shutter lag (the time it takes from when you click to when the picture fires)? What specifically isn&apos;t working? reply to this comment aprilallard (12/14/2006) I am looking for the best under $300 for capturing lots of pictures of my always-moving 6-month old...indoor and outdoor shots, although focused right now mostly on indoor. I have an HP with 4.0 or 4.1 MP and I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the quality of pictures this camera takes. Everything is blurry, I&apos;ve already had to send it back once, and I think my husband purchased it for me a couple years ago because the commercials looked cool (remember&quot;picture pages, pictures pages...&quot;?). Anyway, I also have a 35mm Olympus that I really, really like, but I don&apos;t have to stick with that brand. I do like what I hear about the Canons. I am mostly looking for awesome quality pictures, limited blurriness and help when the baby moves (is this the image stabilization I see mentioned?) under $300, or maybe a little bit above. Thanks to all! reply to this comment (Andrew Skinner—12/14/2006) April,



Just to let you know about image stabilization. It works only with the photo taker/camera itself, not the subject. If the baby moves, the camera won&apos;t stop the blurriness if it has a longer shutter time. On auto settings in low light, the camera will automatically keep the shutter open longer to adjust for the lower light. If you want to take a better indoor photo, you&apos;ll want a higher ISO range (over 1000). Something like the Nikon S7c ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ) or the Olympus 730 ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ) both go up to ISO 1600. The Panasonic FX50 ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ) goes up to ISO 3200, and will allow twice as much light in, creating a shutter speed that is twice as fast as the 1600 setting in similar situations. This might even be a better option for what you&apos;re looking for. All of these cameras are under $300 and should provide enough resolution for sharp pictures. Good luck and happy shooting.



Andrew reply to this comment mOstwanted (12/05/2006) Here&apos;s what i want for my New Cam.

1. GOOD to take INDOOR pictures such as DARK ROOM, or NO LIGHTINGS at all (Concerts, parties)

2. Compact in size

3. not too expensive reply to this comment (Ardi Ounapuu—12/05/2006) Unfortunately it is pretty much impossible to get good pictures in low light using compact size cheap camera. Unless you are trying to shoot non-moving objects. But concerts and parties always involve a lot of fast moving. So in your case the only way is to think about digital SLR... reply to this comment (mOstwanted—12/06/2006) Ardi, whats the BEST compact one for indoor then?

carrying a big camera to a party or dinner banquet makes one look stupid or&quot;pretend to be a pro&quot;

u know what i mean ? =D reply to this comment (Brenda Paro—12/07/2006) Hey,

It&apos;s not an &apos;ultra&apos; compact, but it&apos;s pretty small... please check out the Fuji Finepix F30 ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ). It&apos;s broken some ground in terms of low light performance among digital point and shoots. It has a couple of features that make it really good for this type of shooting:



-&quot;Intelligent&quot;flash, which increases sensitivity to light and turns the flash down as far as possible automatically, resulting in a nicely lit foreground and a darkened background. This means that the camera can use a higher shutter speed than normal in synch flash mode, resulting in less camera blur... huge in dark conditions.



- &apos;Natural Light&amp;Flash&apos; mode takes two shots automatically right after each other, one with flash and one without at a higher ISO, so you can choose the best one.



-High ISO of 3200!! This is pretty darned high and means the camera can shoot in VERY low light. Of course, the images get pretty grainy when you shoot at that high of an ISO, but on the plus side, this camera does a great job of avoiding graininess all the way up to ISO 800 or so, which means that it&apos;s still more usable in low light than most on the market.



It isn&apos;t a perfect camera- it has a few color/ tone issues, but really, honestly nothing that you can&apos;t fix by playing with the contrast a little if you don&apos;t quite like the Auto settings.



As Ardi said, yes to take superb photos in the conditions you&apos;re describing you&apos;ll need a pretty fancy camera. But if you just want a point and shoot I highly recommend the F30 ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ). reply to this comment (mOstwanted—12/09/2006) thanks brenda i will consider it reply to this comment Brenda (11/09/2006) I am considering the new Olympus Stylus 730 but can&apos;t find much info out there about the camera ? Reviews ? Am also considering the Olympus Stylus 800, but I prefer the large buttons and screen. I want a very simple camera to use - strictly just a point and shoot, no manual controls. Any advice or experience with these cameras would help. Thanks reply to this comment (Wandy—11/10/2006) I went to a store to check on the new Stylus 730, and I think that this camera is not ment for someone who is looking for something very simple to use; It has menus withing submenus withing submenus which have very useful features infact, but the problem is that we sometime don&apos;t have to much time to go through those menus in order to get a nice picture, where diferent ocation requires diferent settings; onles you want to use the default setting which sometimes doesn&apos;t give you the result you want. reply to this comment (Brenda—11/10/2006) What stores carry this camera, we do not have any stores in the St. Louis area that carry this camera? Thanks for the info. reply to this comment (Ben Keough—12/14/2006) Hi, I noticed that you havenât marked any replies as the&quot;best answer.&quot;Are you still looking for an answer? If so, I recommend you re-submit it on digitalcamera-hq.com  so it will have a better chance of being noticed. These days it looks like most questions are being answered within a few days. Good luck! reply to this comment Savannah (10/06/2006) I am about to have a baby and I would prefer to capture those rare moments on camera when he might smile, etc.. I hate how my current camera has a delay time between pictures which causes for lots of missed photos. reply to this comment (Brenda Paro—10/06/2006) Hi Savannah,

There is really no such thing as a digital camera with no delay between photos, but what you&apos;ll want to look for is one with a very short recovery time so that you can take photos almost immediately after each other. You&apos;ll also want one without much shutter lag- that is, the amount of time from when you push the button to when the photo actually snaps.



A few good ones to look at for those features are the Sony Cybershot T10 ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  )- or the T30 ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ), which is a little more advanced and expensive than the T10 in other ways, but measures about the same as far as speed. These have about 1.6 seconds between shots and about .4 seconds shutter lag- this is excellent in the world of digital cameras.



You can also get into extremely high-end cameras- like the Nikon D2X ( digitalcamera-hq.com/digita...  ) that measure something like .25 seconds recovery time. But I&apos;m not sure what price range you&apos;re looking at.



Do keep in mind either way that when the flash is on, any camera is going to slow down quite a bit... a 1.6 second recovery time may become something like 2.5 seconds instead.



I hope that helps somewhat. reply to this comment

 Zoom Error (Pat Walters—12/28/2008) 
I loved this camera until it got a&quot;zoom error&quot;. I had it fixed approximately six months into the 1 yr. warranty. It took about two months to get the camera back. Then within the next six months it happened again. I was able to fiddle with the lens to get it working for a while. However, now it needs to be repaired again - at a cost of $145C. I would not mind getting it fixed but how long would it last? - Probably Not!

 It... broke? (LQ—12/25/2008) 
It worked pretty well, in a technical sense, as the settings don&apos;t allow for too great of a photo, but recently, when i started to turn it off, the lens protector began to click in place over in over in a series, then it will stop and the lens will &apos;open back up&apos; and then it closes and clicks in place once again, and then turns off.

I want to find my warranty so I can send it in. I plan to get a dslr this coming year though, so I should be fine.

Image quality is o.k. and there is not too great of a range of settings (manual), but then it is a compact pointXshoot. Fits into pocket. The focus on the shutter button is pretty unresponsive, also.

 Zoom Error, Should be (but isn&apos;t) being covered by 1 yr warranty (Jenni Lipski—04/09/2008) 
this camera has worked well for me up until the camera randomly stopped working between photos. it had no recent impact or damage or heat/cold/water exposure. it was impacted once the first week i had it and got a small dent in the corner of the body/housing and a tiny crack but only on the outside of the screen (could still easily view the photos on the large viewfinder). the problems are definitely NOT related, they are set 8-9 months apart. the screen says&quot;zoom error&quot;upon trying to boot the camera on and then it beeps a few times and automatically shuts off. Since they wont cover it under warranty b/c of the small dent and tiny crack, they said it would cost $150 to fix. i&apos;d rather buy a new one.

sucks to read that others are having the same zoom error problem, which further validates the likelihood that the problem is inherent in the camera and NOT a result of my dropping my purse (which it was in and&quot;damaged&quot;with dent&amp;crack) the first week owning the camera.

beware of the zoom error!

 Big disappointment (LB—11/07/2007) 
I am having the same zoom error problem and my stressful issue is that I can&apos;t find my receipt. I refuse to pay a hefty repair fee to have it fixed when it&apos;s not even a year old! I&apos;ve tried charging the battery, lightly tapping it like people have suggested and nothing worked - it&apos;s very upsetting. I take very good care of my belongings and it looks like I&apos;ll be buying a new camera. This is the last Olympus camera that I buy!

 Stay away (Gary LoGuidice—02/25/2007) 
Despite having tremendous features,most of my pictures were way below average when shooting indoors. Poor flash range (I guess normal for a subcompact)and lots of noise. I hate to pay restocking fee but what good is a camera that takes bad pictures.I tried all of the available setting to try to keep this device because I love the features but the bottom line is still really poor. Anyone who likes this camera must be blind.

 not bad (LeRoy—01/14/2007) 
not what they claimed say its water proof and give warning label say not to emerge in water or get wet, but over all not a bad camera, it&apos;s not a Nikon
