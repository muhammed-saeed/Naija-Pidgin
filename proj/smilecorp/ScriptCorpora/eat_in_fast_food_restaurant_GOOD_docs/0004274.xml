Starvin Marvin Takeaway Restaurant introduces Lancaster to the Parmo
 
Starvin Marvin bring Teesside’s delicacy to Lancaster

The Starvin Marvin in Lancaster is the first and only takeaway restaurant to sell the Parmo .  The Parmo is a Teesside delicacy, Starvin Marvin’s Parmos are made from 100% chicken fillets covered in golden breadcrumbs and then deep fried. Bechamel sauce and a layer of cheese is added and it is then grilled with a range of toppings.   You can view the range of Parmos offered by Starvin Marvin  takeaway restaurant online menu .

Parmo or Parmesan is a popular food dish primarily sold in take aways throughout North East England, especially popular in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, where it originated. Its original name was‘Escalope Parmesan’and is made from pork meat or chicken and is served both as a restaurant meal and a take-out snack, often accompanied by chips and salad.

The Parmo was created by Nicos Harris, a chef with the American army in World War II. He was wounded in France but was brought to the United Kingdom to be treated in a British hospital. Eventually, he moved to Middlesbrough and opened a restaurant on Linthorpe Road where he created the Parmo at The American Grill in 1958.

His son-in-law, Caramello, still lives in Teesside and continues the family tradition. The Parmo is somewhat similar to the veal or chicken Parmigiana which is commonly eaten in Italian restaurants across the world.

Starvin Marvin only offers the Halal chicken fillet Parmos.  Making a Parmo involves deep-frying a flattened chicken or pork fillet in an egg and breadcrumb batter, then smothering it in thick Bechamel sauce before topping off with cheese (the original Parmos were topped with Parmesan cheese, hence the name) and then grilling or baking in the pizza oven. Originally veal was used but later this was replaced by pork. In more recent times chicken became more popular as more Muslim-owned takeaway restaurants opened.

An increasing number of take away outlets have started using processed chicken instead of real chicken breast, presumably to keep costs down. Parmos made with processed chicken are generally recognised to be inferior in quality to those made with chicken breast.  Starvin Marvin’s parmos are made from 100% chicken fillets

The Parmo is generally available in two sizes:

•             Large or full Parmo

•             Half or regular Parmo (sometimes known as a“ladies’parmo”)

Starvin Marvin offers a variety of Parmos

Original Parmo

Hotshot Parmo, Pepperoni, peppers, garlic butter&amp;chilli

Bolognese Parmo

Hawaiian Parmo, Ham and pineapple

Meat Feast Parmo, Pepperoni, chicken&amp;ham

The Parmo’s are usually served in a pizza box along with its chips/fries and side order due to its large size, though a large round polystyrene tray is also common.
