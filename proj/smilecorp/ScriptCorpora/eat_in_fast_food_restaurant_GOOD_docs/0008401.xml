 Burger King 

 Name: Burger King 

 Type of Food: Burgers, Fries 

 Interesting Fact: According to the Burger King there are 221184 possible ways to order a Whopper, their signature sandwich. They sell about 1.7 billion of Whoppers each year.

 History: In 1954, James McLamore and David Edgerton opened their first Burger King restaurant in Miami Florida. The Original Whopper® Sandwich was introduced in 1957. The great success of the early restaurants made the Burger King concept a natural for international expansion. In 1963, the first international franchise restaurant opened in Puerto Rico, and in 1969 the first Canadian “Home of the Whopper®” opened in Windsor, Ontario. Today, the Burger King system operates more than 11,000 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states and in more than 60 countries and territories across the globe. Approximately 90 percent of Burger King restaurants are owned and operated by independent franchisees.

I love Burger King! The burgers and fries are delicious. I also like the Hershey’s Sundae Pie.

McDonald’s–very long line

Wendy’s–long line

Burger King–no line

I’m in a hurry–so I go to the drive thru at Burger King and get a Whopper Jr.–I take 2-3 bites before I fully taste and smell the tainted meat.

My wife would have been parked and at the counter after the first bite, but being my usual debating husband self (even with the wife not with me at the time)–my first response is to say, it’s fine, you’re overreacting–I go to take another bite and take a big sniff just before–ohmigod, that is funky

There is a reason that there is no line at Burger King–other than rancid meat–they really haven’t had an imaginative thought that they have presented well since 1965 and the original Whopper–which effectively distracted from the smaller McDonald’s classic hamburger.

It is amazing how a good decade or two can“beef”up the finances and stave off later decades of funky food and funky mismanagement.

OK–so let me finish off this latest desperate dash to Burger King–so I present my 1/3-eaten Dumpster Jr. to the lady at the counter, hoping that she may take a whiff and save future lives that spill over from the long McDonald’s and Wendy’s lines–but, no such luck, she immediately whips out the money in cash (even after I paid with a credit card)–shows no confidence that any future meat may actually be fresh–and that’s it–I go home to a wonderful day of diarrhea–courtesy of the former #2 Burger giant of the world–coasting along on its billions–unwilling to manage an effective ad campaign–unable to present an appetizing new food line–oh no, here comes the creepy King with the plastic head–I’m outta here
