 (a) Zoning regulations. Any list of any item, including but not limited to zones or uses, is exclusive. If a use or other item is not listed, it is not permitted.

 (1) Zone boundaries shown as approximately following the property line of a lot shall be construed to follow such property line.

(3) Zone boundaries shown as approximately following right-of-way lines of streets, alleys, railroads, or other identifiable boundary lines shall be construed to follow such right-of-way or boundary lines. (4) Where any public street, alley, or right-of-way, or any portion of the same, is officially vacated or abandoned, the area comprising such vacated street or alley shall acquire the zone of the property to which it reverts. In the event such street, alley, or right-of-way was the boundary between two (2) zones, the new zone boundaries shall be at the new property line. (5) Where further uncertainty exists, the Planning Commission, upon a written application or on its own motion, shall determine the location of the boundary by written decision, giving due consideration to the location indicated on the Zoning Map, the objectives of this chapter, and the purposes set forth in the zone regulations. 
 (c) Record of interpretation. The Planning Director shall keep a record of interpretations of the zoning regulations and zoning map made pursuant to this section which shall be available to the public for review. (d) Covenants. When, in the reasonable opinion of the Planning Director, the design or configuration of a new residential structure or an alteration, addition or improvement to an existing residential structure, may lead to a violation of the Municipal Code, the Planning Director may require that prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, as applicable, a covenant shall be recorded, guaranteeing that the owner and successors in interest shall comply with the Municipal Code, or specific parts thereof, with respect to the property.
