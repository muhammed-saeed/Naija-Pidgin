With advances in technology and remote systems that allow you to log into your company cash registers and account activity, it has become much easier to monitor your restaurant&apos;s financial transactions from afar. It&apos;s a little more difficult to manage people remotely, especially when you&apos;ve been a hands-on owner from the restaurant&apos;s inception.
 
Step 1

Visualize your restaurant running smoothly as you sit on a cruise ship or in your airplane seat far from the premises. See every aspect of the day and evening flow with perfect ease and success. Close your eyes and see the door opening, everyone in their proper places, customers streaming in and cooks serving up perfect plates.
 
Step 2

Write down the steps you saw in your visualization. When you&apos;re at the restaurant, you often don&apos;t take into account all the details that make your place run smoothly because as the owner, you jump in where necessary. Visualizing the eatery running smoothly without you is the first step toward making it a reality, according to the website Restaurant Manager.
 
Step 3

Post the processes you gleaned from your visualization in a spot where all employees can see it. Understanding your vision and seeing the results helps employees know their part in the overall operations of the restaurant. They can clearly see how they each play a role in the eatery&apos;s success.
 
Step 4

Include your manager in decisions that affect the restaurant so she can feel a sense of ownership when you&apos;re not there. Imbue the same passion you have for your business in your managers and staff.
 
Step 5

Start slowly if you&apos;ve been a hands-on owner. Leave for short periods during each shift to see how the restaurant runs without your presence. Give a key to a manager to open for a while before you leave. Stop in during closing to check on the day&apos;s results. Slip in while the building is closed to check on cleanliness and food storage. Once you&apos;re convinced the staff can manage well without you, it will be easier to move on and manage the restaurant remotely.

Tips

 Consider your absence when you&apos;re hiring. Look for independent employees who have a history of taking responsibility for their own results. During interviews, ask potential candidates how closely they&apos;ve been supervised in the past and how they&apos;ve dealt with decision-making in previous jobs. Have team leaders and managers who have experience running all aspects of a restaurant. 
 
Warning

 Don&apos;t micromanage the restaurant when you&apos;re not there or you could undermine the authority and confidence of your managers. While you can keep track of automated systems like cash receipts, ordering and payroll remotely through the computer, you shouldn&apos;t call your managers every hour to get updates. Make yourself available for crises or problems that need your insight, but leave the details to your competent staff.
