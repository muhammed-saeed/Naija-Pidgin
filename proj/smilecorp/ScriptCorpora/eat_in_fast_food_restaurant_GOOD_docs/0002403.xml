About Cheese 
 
Cheese is a generic term for a diverse group of milk-based food products. It consists of proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. Hundreds of types of cheese exist and their styles, textures, and flavors depend on the origin of the milk, whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.
