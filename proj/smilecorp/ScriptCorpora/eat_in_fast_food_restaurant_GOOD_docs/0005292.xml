Let&apos;s face it: Hungry kids don&apos;t make great travel companions. Keep them stuffed with these tips:

 

 Plan to leave just before a meal, and pack that meal to go. Otherwise, when you eat before you leave, bathroom breaks are sure to follow shortly into the trip. Plus, having a meal to use as a “bribe” for good behavior works well. Pack a backpack of treats for each child that includes a mixture of healthy snacks. They&apos;ll love cinnamon raisin soft pretzels , apple ladybugs and trail-mix cookies , for instance! Every hour or so, pass the backpack back and let kids pick one or two snacks to munch on. If your kids like to try new foods, look for treats they don&apos;t see every day. Visit ethnic grocery stores and load up on boxes of exotic looking snacks to keep them entertained and full. Don&apos;t shun fast-food. The addition of salads, veggies and wraps to many fast-food restaurant menus mean choosing a nutritious meal is possible. (Choose green-light foods noted in our healthy eating guide .) Plus, the added bonus of playrooms and bathrooms, toys in kids&apos; meals and being able to leave the mess behind, make them worth visiting.
