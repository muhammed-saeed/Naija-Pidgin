 Goodbye Time Clock - Goodbye DOIS - I WILL NOT Be Back in 8 
 Editorial by Rick Owens - April 6, 2007
 Rick Owens: Postal 
 Employee Network Founder Retires 
On Monday April 2nd PEN founder Rick Owens - that&apos;s me! - retired from 
 USPS after 34.5 years of service. Of those years, the last 32 have been 
 spent as a city letter carrier and the remaining 2.5 as an LSM, letter 
 sorting machine, operator. I will miss my coworkers very much - many of 
 them have worked side by side with me for over 20 years. It already seems 
 strange not having to punch a time clock - I&apos;m certain I will get over 
 that very quickly.

I must also tell you that although I worked my last years as a letter 
 carrier experiencing much daily pain in my knees, feet, hips, and back. I 
 would have attempted to carry on for at least another year or so if I 
 could just stomach the manner in which USPS is managing this postal 
 service and their employees.

In my humble opinion USPS has pulled off the biggest corporate raid 
 this nation has ever seen...bar none. These folks knew exactly what they 
 were doing with this postal reform issue - they knew it - but, neither the 
 public, our government, our elected officials, or the mass mailers out 
 there had a clue what the real outcome of postal reform was to be. USPS 
 knew and they weren&apos;t about to share that information with us.

USPS has taken, and will continue taking, their new found freedom to 
 act as a &apos;for profit&apos; company and run it straight down the throat of 
 postal employees and the postal public.

HQ started planning long ago for this postal reform thing. One of the 
 least watched issues - mail delivery - will, in my opinion, become one of 
 the most important and highly published changes to come out of reforming 
 the postal service - I am speaking of contracting out mail delivery. Who 
 knew? Again, who knew?

Of course we had HCR, highway contract routes, long before 
 postal reform, but only in very remote sparsely populated areas. In 
 September 2003 USPS had the Postal Operations Manual (POM) wording changed 
 to allow HCR carriers freedom to complete door to door delivery almost 
 anywhere. Now that postal reform has been cleared, it&apos;s full speed ahead with 
 contracting out delivery of this nations mail.

I could go and on and I may one day, but for now lets just say that I 
 will miss my customers and coworkers but I am glad that I will not be a 
 part of where this service is going under the current powers in 
 Washington, D.C..

 Why Are We Raising Postage 
 Rates? 

As a young retired military leader currently employed with the United 
 States Postal Service working in a Processing&amp;Distribution Center 
 (P&amp;DC), I get a daily panoramic view from inside the mail giant working 
 behind the scenes in an industrial environment. I love the work I do 
 processing, distributing and handling U.S. Mail and using some of the 
 state-of- the-art technology available to get the job done. I can tell all 
 the readers that from my own perspective that we could put our two cents 
 in for the next few years like Im doing right now and our U.S. postage 
 would still be the most affordable rate around the globe.

At the same time I am frustrated with the unprofessional and inappropriate 
 behaviors on the part of the front line leaders I am exposed to in this 
 super-sized government agency. Based on my daily experiences I can see the 
 signs and symptoms that have led to the pain of many current and past 
 employees who have unfortunately resorted to or considered a fit of rage 
 within a system that ignores complaints, minimizes employee training, and 
 discounts the talents their employees bring to the table. Instead, we 
 focus on how much mail we can cram on a processing belt and into automated 
 machinery as fast as we can while accepting shortcuts and overlooking 
 details due to the fast pace of the day in a deadline oriented business.

Our front line leaders push and divide employees by way of exclusion, 
 favoritism, through use of bully tactics, gawking techniques, and use of 
 threatening postures while hovering over employees creating the feeling of 
 being in a concentration camp. Supervisors and managers chase and hide 
 behind quantities of mail instead of processing the mail by the numbers. 
 Floor supervisors diminish their credibility by disrespecting their bosses 
 behind their backs by addressing them with names associated with their 
 hair color such as Little Red Riding Hood, and Blondie and physical 
 attributes like being bucktooth blatantly in front of the troops. Floor 
 Managers have made comments to groups of employees stating you wouldnt 
 have liked to work for me 26 years ago Im thinking hmmm, you know 
 something youre right!

Opportunities to discuss business issues are rare to nonexistent until it 
 is time to fill out a survey that is perceived by the employees to benefit 
 the managers who have learned to master the yes and no questions so they 
 wont have to be bothered with details. A favorite boasting tactic for 
 management in my facility is to tongue lash employees with threatening 
 comments to the effect of if you dont like it here, you can go work at 
 the fast food restaurant down the street. Why should anyone run from poor 
 leadership? Most of the masses have worked hard to earn their position in 
 the organization through interviews, testing, background checks, medical 
 screenings, sweat in the trenches, and from a few extra points for holding 
 Old Glory as a military veteran. If you can make it through all that and 
 do your job well then youve earned the right to work for the Postal 
 Service.

Being treated with dignity and respect doesnt stop when we swipe our 
 badges at the gate. We focus on individuals more than teams inside the 
 P&amp;DC making the facility a personality distribution center rather than a 
 facility that concentrates on teams and processes. It takes a village to 
 raise this postal child with the first initials U.S., last name Mail. On 
 any given day I often see 2-3 supervisors and or managers standing around 
 shooting-the-lip about their retirement, the latest sporting event, or 
 complaining about whatever and at the same time ignoring the benefits of 
 the diversity surrounding them to improve operations.

Lets say these folks each make a $50,000 salary, thats $150,000 standing 
 around getting paid to do nothing. If there is a need for a supervisor 
 lets teach them coaching skills and get rid of the babysitter mentality. 
 If we really want to save some money the company could keep $50,000 of the 
 $150,000 to put back in petty cash and let a self-directed team of 15 
 employees divide the $100,000 for consistently exceeding goals better than 
 an untrained individual without coaching skills and who isnt a resident 
 expert, and I bet pretty soon you wont be able to recognize the place 
 because you just motivated a team rather than an individual with a cash 
 incentive.

The team can call a manager for assistance if intervention is needed to 
 complete the task at hand. These adults who make important decisions 
 outside the facility like buying houses, cars, insurance, and raising 
 children would continue to make important decisions at work by building 
 bridges across operations so we are communicating and tapping into the 
 abilities of all members to safely and effectively get the mail processed 
 in the least amount of time. Changing times requires changing minds. The 
 park your car, park your brain mentality does not work in the 21st century 
 especially when our customers can vote for our service with their voices 
 and their feet. We need all hands on deck to be empowered so we can 
 collectively check the altitude of this sonic Eagle and soar above 
 danger so we can get to where we are going quickly.

At some point in our history we are going to have to put people in front 
 of mail. I believe we do mail well, but I think we do our own people 
 poorly! My point is these behaviors are intimidating and conducive to a 
 hostile environment that potentially exposes each and every employee to 
 direct or collateral damage in the form of deaths, injuries, and declining 
 service that will impact our bottom line. I strongly believe that if we 
 take care of the people our service to every address in America will be 
 off the planet and unmatched by any competitor.

Until managers come out from behind the numbers and share business 
 knowledge about postal operations, facility operations, postal reform, 
 transformation plans, rate hikes and whatever else is on the horizon I 
 guess Ill have to keep reading the newspaper, listening to podcasts, 
 surfing the web, and watching the media to get what I cant get from my 
 home away from home inside the Postal Service. And when my neighbors ask 
 me the postal worker questions about business that affects their business 
 I guess Ill refer them to the Public Information Officer. I ask again, 
 why are we raising postage rates?

 Did USPS HQ Recently Advise Local PM&apos;s to Move Mailboxes to Street? 
Editorial by: Rick Owens - PEN - March 31, 2007 - Also see reader 
 comments.
It is our belief that recent passage of postal reform has given USPS 
 authority to cease their goal to break even and move full speed ahead 
 toward being a &apos;for profit&apos; entity. It is also our belief that USPS needs 
 to make money in order to survive and thrive but they do not need to 
 operate as private commercial company than can do whatever they deem 
 necessary in order to make a profit.
Headline news across the nation today and yesterday reveal numerous 
 stories detailing local postmaster&apos;s sending official USPS letters to 
 local postal customers advising them that if they would move their 
 mailboxes to the street it would be safer for their letter carrier and 
 their service would improve.
Naturally, moving your mailbox to the street would speed up delivery, but 
 most likely not for the customer - only for street delivery times for that 
 particular carrier route. And, we all know what happens next - your number 
 of deliveries is ultimately increased.
Please read the following stories found across the nation today - March 
 31, 2007. It is our belief that all the local PM&apos;s did not decide at the 
 same time to seek this move - they were asked to do this by USPS HQ. 
 Please post comments at our newsfront&gt; PEN

 The regulation for converting modes of delivery is Postal Operations 
 Manual 631.6. NALC branches should monitor conversions and ensure proper 
 procedures are followed. It may be paranoid, but the goal of the USPS 
 could be to make contract delivery easier in the future. Door-to-door 
 delivery is what has made city delivery unique since 1863.


Don Cheney
Auburn, WA

 Conversion of Mode of Delivery (POM 631.6) 
In this section, conversion refers to changing existing mail delivery to a 
 more economical and efficient mode. The key to converting existing 
 deliveries is identifying those deliveries that are most costly to the 
 Postal Service. Delivery managers can go into any delivery territory where 
 delivery has been established for over 1 year and solicit to convert the 
 mode of delivery if it would be cost beneficial to the Postal Service.

Postmasters should not establish a mixed delivery area where the 
 carrier must zigzag from the door to the curb when previously the carrier 
 took obvious shortcuts to effect delivery. Postmasters must weigh the 
 advantages and disadvantages of converting less than 100 percent of the 
 deliveries.

Customer signatures must be obtained prior to any conversion. In 
 single-family housing areas (including manufactured housing and mobile 
 homes) where the residences and lots are owned, each owner must agree to 
 the conversion in writing. Owners who do not agree must be allowed to 
 retain their current mode of delivery.

When a residence is sold, the mode of delivery cannot be arbitrarily 
 changed prior to the new resident moving in. The existing mode of delivery 
 must be retained. If an owners association represents the community, it 
 can direct the mode of delivery for the community. In rental areas, such 
 as apartment complexes and mobile home parks, the owner or manager can 
 approve the conversion.

 Follow the Money and The Ultimate Day in Being Micro-Managed 
February 12, 2007
 Follow the Money
 This article is being reprinted just as written but was cut from a 
 larger article.
March 2006 - Name Withheld by PEN

Why are the instructions to city carrier management to not count flats 
 coming in with your parcels, SPURS, or from the BMC, but it is clearly 
 noted in the Management Instructions that all cased volume is counted?

Why did Western Area decide sequenced coverage&apos;s in DOIS no longer is 
 credited to the street time and as far as that goes, why, last year, did 
 we only receive credit for only one sequenced mailing on one day even if 
 two or more gets delivered?

How come we cant update DOIS Base information when carriers bid to new 
 routes or when new deliveries are added? (And speaking ofNotice that DOIS 
 itself was updated recently a known problem with the system itself and 
 now its fixed? And its so much more user friendly to boot! Why are we 
 to believe that this program is any better than the former program?)

This particular theorist offers, we are simply being tricked. When you 
 trick people into doing more than the workload would indicate, you save 
 money. Even with using overtime hours, it saves because the Agency does 
 not have to pay additional benefits or the cost of training new employees.

Could all this be tied to the pay of our Postal Executives? Note PCES 
 and Executives have a pay and evaluation process that differs 
 significantly from EAS employees. Their pay is based on a national cost 
 system and the bell curve for their location in the evaluation system is 
 different from the bell curve for EAS scale employees. As in most crimes 
 if you follow the money you find the answers.

HmmmAnyone else want to offer up a theory?

 The Ultimate Day in Being Micro-Managed
 January 2006 - Name withheld by PEN

I am writing this after one of the worst days experienced in the Postal 
 Service by most of us, the day after Martin Luther King Holiday, the 
 ultimate day in being micro-managed. A day after a holiday that only 
 government workers, banks, etc, take the day off while the rest of the 
 world is working and entering mail into our system. The day we needed the 
 latitude to manage the mail and our people - but this has been taken away 
 from us.

The day, how we are to manage was forecasted days ago, because our 
 bosses have this crystal ball to tell us what is best for our units. That 
 we need not start any of our carriers before their official start time, 
 maybe a half hour early, but dont even think about before 0700, for their 
 power of 20/20 hindsight is all so awesome you better have called that 
 decision correctly. You must meet the threshold of curtailed mail, for 
 they know better than you how to manage your own unit, that you will have 
 everyone off the street by 1700, though you do not have the vehicles for 
 the auxiliary help you know you need to meet this criteria, and if you 
 were able to get your people into vehicles, then you are sending them 
 without scanners to make their MSP scans and accountable scans.

Of course the PTFs you need to hire will not be there because your 
 FTER says you do not need them. Those two hampers of parcels are not going 
 to impact the street times. The two days of accountable items will only 
 take a moment as each attempt is made. The savior of our budgets, the DPS 
 mail, two days worth, which was run backwards, skips ahead, and pulled 
 down wrong would not add to the street as we are directed to have our 
 carriers not to come back to the unit until they deliver that missequenced 
 mail on their routes.

Dont forget the EXFC scores we still have to plan to take that hot 
 case mail back out to be delivered mail that was originally mishandled 
 in mail processing but as you are surely aware, DOIS gives you plenty of 
 allowance to absorb these extra trips. Traffic of course does not enter 
 into the total picture, because in our perfect world, there wouldnt be 
 any traffic, especially since everyone will be back well before 1700. Hey 
 (!) and do this without any use of Penalty Overtime! Oh and the full 
 coverage, the ADVO and/or whatever local coverage you get definitely would 
 not have any impact on your DOIS variance.

You need to take this coverage out today because then you would be 
 forced in taking out two coverages the next day or the day after and we 
 all know that it is perfectly safe to require our mounted routes to take 
 two or more coverages on the side because of all the room they have in 
 their CRV/LLVs. For the foot routes or park and loop routes, it doesnt 
 take any time at all to case one or more of those coverages directly into 
 the case, the case that your carriers are already two fisted casing 
 because of the mail volume the volume that our bosses said that we dont 
 have too much of.

How do I know this? Because they told me it was so! If I dont make 
 these numbers, if I dont get my people out of the office in time, if I 
 dont make the cutoff by 1700, than there must be something wrong the way 
 I manage. So, that being said, I should not have to be directed to 
 begin my day with the very first carrier reporting to duty and to end my 
 day when the last carrier comes off the street, because you already know 
 this will make the difference. Besides, most of us are still in the office 
 anyway trying to play catch up with everything else. They will know how 
 well I manage because Im faxing in the Carrier Analysis report by 1300 
 everyday along with every other unit in my Area and within the District, 
 because I simply do not have enough to do to fill out my day, like 
 customer service issues, employee issues, growth management, selfaudits, 
 boss issues etc, etc, (I usually doodle while Im continuously pushing 
 the redial after each busy tone I get whats another ten minutes of my 
 day anyway?).

Now tomorrow I get to tell how successful I was on this incredibly 
 remarkable day after the holiday. How many did I start before 0700? Why 
 did this person get out so late? Why did you not make 1700? The DOIS said 
 you were suppose to! Why? Why? Why?!? Why did you not accomplish this? 
 Well, I say cautiously, Because I was trying to follow your 
 instructions? One manager commented to me, Do they want us to succeed? 
 It seems that we have so little control of our units, with all the 
 responsibility. I think it is incredible we can accomplish as much as we 
 do.

And, we do accomplish a lot! But its so frustrating those moments of 
 glee come crashing down as soon as you open the next Email to inform you, 
 that yet again you are on another Vital Few list get that Action Plan 
 together!

Until next time

 GPS Baby Monitor Coming Soon to USA 
 Carrier Vehicles
 by Rick Owens - PEN Founder
October 9, 2006
 Top 

I read with interest the story POSTIES&apos; SUSPICION OVER GPS INTRUSION . I am not going to reference or 
 provide sources for my thoughts here - I&apos;m just stating my thoughts as to 
 where USA letter carriers are headed sometime within the very near future.

Just around the corner in the transformation of this service is a GPS 
 device waiting to be installed inside your postal vehicle. This device 
 will send signals to a tracking program installed on some USPS base and 
 said signals will be redirected, via smart technology software, to your 
 supervisors desktop. The information received from these GPS devices will 
 be instantly shared with your managers DOIS program. DOIS will want to 
 know why you were parked in the 1000 block of Easy Street longer than 13 
 minutes when DOIS estimates show that delivery within the 1000 block of 
 Easy Street should consume no more than 9 minutes of your street time. 
 You, the carrier, will be asked why you were on Easy Street so long - or 
 your supervisor will call you on the call system installed inside your 
 postal vehicle and want to know what in the hell are you doing...taking 
 another break?

It&apos;s coming guys and gals and it is not far away. Can&apos;t prove that, but 
 my gut says it&apos;s so. Oh, by the way, on the flip side MSP points won&apos;t be 
 needed any longer. (please add comments on this editorial under the story 
 mentioned above on our homepage )

 Reliving The Birth of DPS 
If I am correct we first had DPS, delivery point sequenced, mail added to 
 carriers daily plates. Carriers were told that bringing DPS mail online 
 would allow stations, and post offices, to receive mail earlier, carriers 
 would receive their residual mail earlier at their cases, and, ultimately, 
 allow for earlier delivery or more timely delivery of the mail. Not.

The sole reason was, in fact, less office time equals more street time 
 equals longer routes (=) abolishment of routes (=) less carriers needed 
 (=) cost savings for USPS which should equate to savings on postage rate 
 increases for the public...oops, lost my direction there.

I suppose DPS is saving USPS money in less office time for carriers, 
 less clerks because of automation equipment, and abolishing routes. The 
 way I see it, however, is... critical errors are occurring everyday on 
 every route in every city across the country - machine errors - DPS 
 errors. A new form of mail has been given birth by DPS automation...loop 
 mail. Carriers attempt to &apos;un-loop&apos; (if that&apos;s a word) this mail by 
 killing the bar codes or by placing this mail into the &apos;Loop Mail&apos; bin - 
 but, more times than not this mail is dumped right back into the mail 
 stream and continues to loop over and over until it is given special 
 treatment by some postal employee somewhere. Most times this is important 
 mail for customers - sometimes even critical to their business, lives, or 
 future.

If carriers were permitted to case DPS mail errors would be caught in 
 the office and this would greatly enhance the chances of getting DPS 
 errors sorted to their proper destination in their DESERVED timely manner. 
 Oh but we can&apos;t do this - that would be as good as saying that this 
 automation technology was a failure and the cost wasted. Ask most any 
 carrier and they&apos;ll tell you that DPS mail can be cased and corrected much 
 faster in the office than on the street. They&apos;ll tell you that they&apos;re 
 ashamed of the errors that they now bring back to the office - errors that 
 did not exist before DPS came into town. They&apos;ll tell you that operations 
 for them ran much smoother when they were allowed to case all mail.

Well folks, just wait DPS Flats is coming soon to a city near you - 
 maybe even your city. This, I&apos;m certain, will be another round of even 
 less office time (=) more street time (=) equals even longer routes (=) 
 even more route abolishment&apos;s (=) even less carriers needed (=) even more 
 cost savings (=) even more savings on postage rate increases for the 
 public...oops, lost my direction again.

 Letter Carrier Pay is Fair 
 by PEN Editor Rick Owens
July 4, 2006 

After almost 34 years as a USPS letter carrier I just today found the 
 following at the NALC website .

February 2002
 
 
  Starting Wage Maximum Wage City Letter Carrier $15.85 $20.98 
 after 12.4 years UPS Package Car Driver $16.21 $23.17 
 after 48 months FedEx Courier $14.49 $21.58 
 after 4-5 years Source: FedEx Corp. and 
 International Brotherhood of Teamsters 
 
I thought many of you would be interested in reading this since 2006 is a 
 contract renewal year. Keep in mind that the above table was generated in 
 2002 - one year after our current contract was negotiated (2001-2006).

It was interesting for me to note that after only 4 years UPS and FedEx 
 jump way ahead of USPS letter carriers.

I admit that our pay is fairly good, but when you think about the street 
 portion of a letter carriers job you may begin to look at this closer. On 
 most streets that you deliver to daily you may see UPS or FedEx speed onto 
 the street while you&apos;re performing a park and loop - he/she will make one 
 or two deliveries and then speed off again - you&apos;re still walking that 
 loop wiping sweat from your brow.

Granted - they MAY be speeding and running around to make certain they 
 complete their rounds on time - I really don&apos;t know - but, I do know that 
 it is much easier to jump out, deliver one or two stops, and then speed 
 off to repeat this on another street. I also believe that UPS doesn&apos;t even 
 load their own vehicles.

It&apos;s just my opinion, but I believe our pay should match or exceed the 
 higher of either UPS or FedEx at any given year or month of 
 employment.

 Is the Term &apos;Going 
 Postal&apos; Really a Misnomer? 
by Rick Owens - PEN Editor and Owner
 Top 

Some say yes. Many say no - it is not a misnomer.

Regarding the tragedy in Goleta the Federal Times writes&quot;Previous shootings at postal facilities in 
 Edmond, Okla., in 1986 and Royal Oak, Mich., in 1991 took 18 lives. The 
 incidents spawned a stereotype of postal workers as violence-prone and 
 psychotic. The Postal Services Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace 
 issued a report in August 2000 that found postal workers are no more 
 violent than workers in other professions.&quot;

I agree that given normal circumstances postal employees are not any more 
 violent than other workers in other professions, but I contend that the 
 phrase &apos;Going Postal&apos; does have a degree of truth to it in many instances. 
 Further, I believe if an unbiased investigation could be taken of postal 
 employees one would clearly see that the vast majority of postal employees do think this term rings true...at times.

I believe that the general public does not bunch all postal employees into 
 one group of misfits and mentally challenged. I also believe that many 
 postal employees, and almost all of the general public, think that when 
 the phrase &apos;going postal&apos; is used it is meant to point out that postal 
 employees are under a lot of stress to perform as needed or as required 
 and sometimes an individual just can&apos;t cope with the demands facing them 
 or the postal regulations that govern their work and life. This is not to 
 say that what happened in Goleta could have been prevented by USPS or 
 anyone else.

A vast number of postal employees feel that they are subjected to more 
 stress while working at USPS than they would be if employed elsewhere. I 
 do not think this is true in all postal positions, but I do believe the 
 carrier craft, and other postal positions, feel that they are under 
 constant stress and duress to meet USPS productivity demands and goals set 
 to meet or exceed previous productivity records.

Generally, postal employees believe the term going postal to mean that 
 this person has reached their individual breaking point and that either 
 postal rules, postal regulations, or postal management contributed to this 
 persons breakdown. The straw that broke the camels back so it seems. It 
 does not mean that postal employees are more violent than employees at any 
 other job - it just means that the stress of their postal position coupled 
 with possible other life problems became to much of a burden for them and 
 literally sent them into a mental breakdown of sorts.

It is highly likely that Jennifer Sanmarco experienced such a breakdown. 
 She clearly had more problems than her previous postal life, but the 
 tragic murder of so many fellow postal employees clearly points to the 
 fact that she felt her postal position was her biggest problem. Was this 
 the fault of USPS? no. Could USPS have done more to help Sanmarco with her 
 problem? maybe, maybe not. I only point this out in an effort to explain 
 why the term going postal even exists at all.

As a postal employee with over 30 years service I do not take the term 
 going postal as a personal insult because I would never let myself reach 
 such a mental state. I have learned what my limitations are and do not 
 worry too much about postal productivity goals that I cannot reach. I have 
 also taught myself to ignore what happens around me that I cannot control. 
 It seems obvious to me that Jennifer Sanmarco could no longer control her 
 mental state. She could not see the light at the end of the tunnel. The 
 problems in her personal life coupled with her real or imagined problems 
 with the postal service, or former coworkers, blinded her reality and led 
 her straight to hell.

To me - that&apos;s what going postal means.

 Bulk Mail Outnumbers 1st Class - Carriers Outnumber Clerks - Managers Outnumber Coffee Cups
 by: Rick Owens - PEN Editor and Owner
 Top 

 Bulk Mail Outnumbers 1st Class: Yes it is true. Over the past year 
 or more we have seen bulk business mail, many customers refer to it as 
 junk mail, overtake First Class Mail volume that is processed by USPS. As 
 a long time postal employee I knew this was coming long before the facts 
 actually arrived at HQ. I&apos;ve stated this time and time again here at PEN.

I became a postal employee way back in the early 1970&apos;s. At that time of 
 course 1st Class mail was our prime product and outnumbered BBM by a long 
 shot. However, soon those at HQ decided we needed to increase BBM volume 
 because it would increase our revenue. So, the push to provide more 
 &apos;sale-ability&apos; to BBM started. Bulk mail became Bulk Business Mail and 
 color-coding was born to help insure mailers that their product would be 
 delivered within a certain &apos;window&apos; of operations... three days I believe 
 it was.

All mail loaded onto our processing plant docks was weighed on scales and, 
 if I recall correctly, given an estimated piece count according to the 
 weight of one or more pieces. For example - a pallet of bulk rate local 
 newspapers would be rolled to the scales and weighed. Then the volume of 
 pieces would be estimated via the total weight of the pallet, less the 
 weight of the pallet itself, and divided by the weight of one or more 
 pieces - this would provide an &apos;estimate&apos; of the number of newspapers on 
 the pallet for processing. The vast majority of all mail processed was 
 weighed and reduced to an estimated piece count for processing. We did 
 this for years. My opinion? This resulted in inaccurate volume history. 
 Weighing mail soon gave way to measuring mail by feet or inches to 
 estimate volumes. Again, according to my reasoning, producing false 
 estimations of volume processed and then recording these numbers into USPS 
 records to use for SPLY (same period last year) computations in the years 
 to come.

USPS sold BBM to large mailers and sold it well. In fact, the processing 
 and window of delivery was sold so well that these mailers must have said&quot;why pay 1st Class postage when we can get 1st class service paying only 
 bulk rates.&quot;Why indeed - that would be a costly mistake to pay for 1st 
 class processing and delivery when USPS guarantees you that your product 
 will be processed within 24 hours and delivered within 72 hours.

Guess what? a few years later along came customer coding in addition to 
 color coding. What is customer coding? well, that&apos;s a term I made up 
 because I can&apos;t recall what USPS calls it, but it is the customer/mailer 
 notes that you see on bundles of bulk rate mail demanding, requesting, or 
 advising delivery by such and such date. Now folks, the way I see this is 
 that a demand of delivery date attached to any bulk rate mail should raise 
 that mail to second or first class status and rates. However, USPS did not 
 and does not see it that way.

I agree that we need to guarantee the mailer that we will process their 
 mail by a certain date, but the delivery date will be according to the 
 rate paid. In other words - at NO TIME will bulk business mail be raised 
 to 1st Class delivery status. If the customer desires his mail to be 
 delivered on February 1st and 2nd then he will pay either 1st or 2nd Class 
 postage. If not, then their bulk mail will be delivered within three days 
 after it reaches the station, branch, or post office of destination.

 Carriers Outnumber Clerks: Think about it - babies are born every 
 minute of every day - people are living much longer than when the post 
 office was born - more people than ever are able to buy or build a home - 
 business openings increase almost every year as the population increases. 
 All of this leads to more delivery points for the postal service. In other 
 words - delivery points are increasing and, so they say, mail volume is 
 decreasing. It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to see that the number of 
 employees needed to process mail has deceased - and, as more and more 
 automation comes online these numbers will continue to decrease. I have 
 stated this time and time again (read the editorials below).

It is evident to me that the lost of clerk craft positions is not solely 
 due to lost volumes, but mostly due to automation of the mail. In fact, it 
 is my belief that postal service volume records over previous decades are 
 inaccurate to the point of providing false volume comparisons to this very 
 day. I do not believe this was intentional. I believe it was just that we 
 had no other way to quickly count mail other than estimating volume of 
 pieces. Today most mail processed is counted by machine and piece counts 
 ARE. the most part, accurate. These accurate counts when compared to 
 historical estimations leave one with the assumption that drastic amounts 
 of volume have been lost. Is this true or is it just that we now count 
 each and every piece via automated equipment and arrive at an accurate 
 count instead of an inaccurate estimate. Think about it and you decide.

 Managers Outnumber Coffee Cups: During my first years in the post 
 office I noticed that many, if not all, of the supervisors could be seen 
 roaming the mail room floors with their ever present cup of coffee lodged 
 between their fingers. Scouring the area for those of us who needed a 
 reminder as to just exactly where our work area was and what it was we 
 were supposed to be doing. Very similar to what I assume postal HQ&apos;s must 
 look like on many days.

Now that DOIS and other management duties have been reduced to computer 
 generated programs that need constant updates throughout the work day 
 postal supervisors seem to forget about their coffee cups gathering dust 
 in the break area or in their drawers. All day long it seems that they sit 
 at their desk with their eyes glued to a computer screen that is reaching 
 out to cyberspace, gathering some historical productivity data, and 
 returning it to them in the form of &apos;here&apos;s what you need to do today.&apos;

Whether they want to admit it or not postal managers ARE, more or less, an 
 employee under direction from their computers. They cannot make a firm 
 decision without conferring with their non-coffee drinking computer 
 manager first. What seems ironic though is the fact that their computer 
 manager is the employee of another computer manager somewhere down line 
 and in another city entirely. It seems that each computer manager has a 
 computer manager of their own located somewhere out in cyberspace. Seems 
 confusing doesn&apos;t it? Well, it is.

The computer managers stated above are slowly starting a new revolution - 
 the decrease in frontline management. In the not too distant future these 
 computers will take the place of your current supervisor and he or she 
 will be gone - but, guess what? Their coffee cups will remain while their 
 owners will get relocated to another computer manager in some other far 
 away city. Then, because computers don&apos;t drink coffee, computer managers 
 will outnumber coffee cups.

That rationalization seems kind of stupid doesn&apos;t it? But does this make 
 sense... if computers tell your manager what he or she should do then in 
 the very near future why will we need the frontline supervisor at all?

 &quot;I 
 Can&apos;t Afford to Contribute the&quot;MAX&quot;to Thrift Savings 
 Posted September 6, 2005
 Top 

Believe it or not, there are Postal Employees who honestly believe they&quot;Can&apos;t Afford to contribute the Max&quot;to their Thrift Savings Plan.

If you don&apos;t believe me, then simply ask a few FERS covered Employees and 
 ask them if they contribute the&quot;Max&quot;to their Thrift Savings. You will be 
 surprised by their answers!

I don&apos;t know what these people are thinking or even how much they 
 understand about the Retirement System they are covered by but I know a 
 way for them to contribute the Max to their Thrift Savings and NEVER MISS 
 THE MONEY.

Contract Raises, Cola&apos;s, and Step Increases are a source of additional 
 income that an employee has never had in their hands so they have never 
 been dependent upon them.

By simply taking any of the above mentioned additional increases and 
 immediately applying them toward their&quot;Thrift Cap,&quot;then they would 
 eventually contribute enough to&quot;Max&quot;out their&quot;Allowable Contributions.&quot;

These people would never miss the money because they never depended on it 
 and their argument that&quot;they Can&apos;t Afford to contribute the Max&quot;toward 
 their Thrift Savings wouldn&apos;t stand up.

So the next time you run across anyone who&quot;WON&quot;T&quot;rather than&quot;CAN&apos;T,&quot;Max out their Thrift Contributions, tell them how they CAN actually afford 
 to do it.

 What About This DOIS Thing? !
 January 2005 - Rick Owens: Postal Employee Network
 Top 

You know, I don&apos;t know if we carriers have been blessed or cursed here in 
 Montgomery, Alabama - my hometown . I guess only time will 
 tell. Here&apos;s why I say that...

Last year the NALC and USPS reached an agreement, via a Memorandum 
 of Understanding, that blocked continued use of traditional inspection and 
 evaluation methods for route adjustments. ( Read Here ) 
 Then on December 7, 2004 USPS backed out of this agreement
( Read Here ).

Well, it seems our local NALC president signed off on a local MOU in 
 October 2004, as per the aforementioned national MOU, that allows local 
 management to adjust routes via DOIS, MSP scans, and other questionable 
 digital data - yes, I did say DOIS. When I heard this I just got sick all 
 over. What I know of DOIS, at least locally, is this...

The data contained within the DOIS program used by your carrier 
 supervisor is not a flawless software data system - it may be possible that 
 the information produced via DOIS could be without error - but that would 
 only be true if the data entered into the DOIS system was flawless and kept 
 current. Even without data errors I contend that DOIS data can be flawed 
 because of mitigating human and real life factors such as traffic 
 conditions, bad weather, customer questions or service, carrier sickness, 
 etc etc - but, that&apos;s another story entirely.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but...

The &apos;projected street time&apos; that DOIS produces every morning for your 
 supervisor is a fixed time that has been determined via previous 1838s and 
 3999s completed on THAT particular carrier. It takes a minimum of two 1838s 
 and one 3999 to ascertain what a carriers true projected street time is on 
 his route and what his/her percent to standard (for casing ability and 
 projected office time).

Without this DOIS data being current, via current 1838s and 3999s 
 completed on you, the projected street time for your route is incorrect, 
 your percent to standard is woefully wrong, and your projected office time 
 is totally flawed. Why? Because this information belongs to the last carrier 
 on your route that underwent inspection and count via at least two 1838s and 
 one 3999.

For example - the route that I now hold, route 0443, was the only route 
 in my station to check over 8 hours during our last route inspection and 
 count way back in 2003. I was not on this route during this inspection - I 
 was the regular carrier on route 0439. Pay attention here... because of 
 this, the projected street time, my percent to standard, and my office time 
 are all incorrect in DOIS daily computations because all of this data is 
 based upon 1838s and 3999s completed on a different carrier back in 2003. 
 Since I have been on this route there have been no 1838s or 3999s completed 
 on me for route 0443.

Now our station manager is attempting to abolish an auxiliary route and 
 divide the territory among four carriers - myself included. DOIS data is 
 telling him that I have 30 to 45 minutes undertime every day. This just 
 isn&apos;t true. The DOIS figures that he is looking at are totally flawed 
 because of the factors I pointed out above. In order to ascertain what my 
 true projected street time is, my percent to standard, and my office time he 
 must complete at least two CURRENT 1838s on me and one 3999. Without doing 
 this he is attempting to add onto my route using someone else&apos;s street and 
 casing ability.

You may be suffering under these same conditions. Have you had the 
 minimum of two 1838s and one 3999 completed on you since you won your route 
 via bid or assignment? If you have not, then I would bet you that the DOIS 
 info for your route pertains to the previous carrier and not you.

With all that said, let me say this...

I am not and have not been a supervisor, not since 1986 anyway, and I am 
 not privy to all that DOIS does or contains - but, I have been told by two 
 supervisors, not in my station, that my assumptions are correct. If I am 
 wrong then I apologize, but I believe I am totally correct.

If you know different then please write me here:

 Hazardous Duty Premium Pay for Letter 
 Carriers
 November 2004 - Rick Owens: Postal Employee Network
 Top 

I have been employed by USPS for 32 years now - almost 28 of these as a 
 city letter carrier. I can say , without a doubt and reservation, that at 
 times the job of carrying this nations mail can be very dangerous and 
 stressful. For this reason I have, for years, said that carriers deserve a 
 hazardous duty premium for all hours spent on the street delivering the 
 mail.

During 27 of my 28 years as a city carrier I have been the regular 
 carrier in two of my cities largest and most dangerous public housing 
 projects. I have been threatened numerous times. I have had to hide behind 
 buildings when gunfire started while I was in the middle of long park and 
 loops and at least two blocks from my vehicle. I have been cursed and told 
 not to show my face again in this neighborhood. Over and over I have been 
 forced into stressful situations that could have not only ended my postal 
 career, but also my life.

If I am correct, and I think I am, Postal Inspectors are offered 
 retirement at a much earlier date, and age, than other postal employees 
 without reduction in the amount of their pension. I think this is fair since 
 they are placed in dangerous situations that other postal employees are not. 
 But, I believe this to also be true about carriers. I think fair is fair and 
 it would be fair to provide carriers with a premium for street duties in 
 high crime areas/cities.

While delivering these housing projects I seldom see our local 
 police...maybe once per week or when they answer a call for help. However, I 
 am there each and everyday. Yes, I am a carrier by choice. Yes, I keep my 
 route by choice. No, I do not think it is fair that we do not get some sort 
 of return for the danger that we are subjected to. Maybe a premium per hour 
 increase while on street time. Or, maybe an earlier retirement date (age and 
 years) without reduction in pension amount.

For what it is worth - this is my opinion.

 Employee Access to USPS Intranet Blue 
April 2004 -
 Rick Owens - Postal Employee Network
 Top 

I have said this many times before and still can&apos;t 
 understand - why did USPS build, or have built, a postal intranet that did 
 not include access to ALL postal employees?

I receive an email newsletter from USPS entitled USPS News 
 Link. Many of you receive this same newsletter. Have you ever noticed how 
 many times the newsletter references Blue? Have you ever noticed how many 
 times Link says go to Blue and do this or do that to make life easier 
 for you? We would like to - wouldn&apos;t we?

I was informed this month that USPS is finally getting 
 around to having the USPS IT team build in limited access to Blue for all 
 postal employees. IT, they say, are still working on the security issues 
 related to allowing us to access Blue from home (at least I would hope that 
 access would be from home - they didn&apos;t actually say we would have access 
 from home).

USPS designed online services and sales for postal 
 customers long ago. If customer access is secure enough then why could USPS 
 have not built Blue secure enough to at least allow employees limited access 
 many months ago.

We trade securities online. We bank online. We purchase 
 goods and services via credit card online. Why would it take so long to 
 allow normal employees equal access to Blue? It was said before that the 
 reason all employees did not have access is because USPS needs to protect 
 their infrastructure. God - I hope our infrastructure isn&apos;t online 
 somewhere... even on their Blue - if it is we&apos;re standing on ground that is 
 shakier than I thought.

I will close this by saying that I commend USPS for their 
 recent effort to allow at least limited Blue access to all employees, but I 
 give them a failing grade for designing a company intranet that did not 
 allow access by all employees...even if it were limited access.

 Where Have We Been - Where Are We Going? 
December 14, 2003
Rick Owens - Postal Employee Network
 Top 

We&apos;re coming to the close of another year in our lives and 
 one more postal year closer to our retirement. Since I first started with 
 USPS way back in 1973 I have seen so many changes that I would need to write 
 a book to list all of them. Some good changes and some bad (as far as I am 
 concerned).

Overall I have enjoyed my postal career and the people I 
 have worked with. In some ways it is humorous to us old-timers to watch the 
 actions and spirit of postal newbie&apos;s. The &apos;big picture&apos; of exactly how 
 large the postal service is has not yet sunk into their train of thought - 
 even though the tasks in front of them sometimes seems to be much more than 
 they had realized.

I have been a clerk. I have been an LSM operator. I have 
 served 204b. I have served OIC. And, I have completed some details thrown my 
 way. But for the last 28 years I have served as a city letter carrier.

 
    USPS Mailster

When I first became a carrier there was one Mailster left 
 at our station (click photo above). If memory serves me correctly the 
 scooter was privately owned by one of the carriers there, but he had special 
 permission to continue using the scooter. The remainder of the carriers used 
 the old postal jeep that would be way too small to carry the amount of mail 
 we deliver today. Automation (DPS), route abolishment&apos;s, and route 
 adjustments have made the majority of carrier routes almost too mail heavy 
 even for the LLV&apos;s that we use today.

I have said this before and sadly I still believe this 
 today - it seems to me that the postal services future will have almost as 
 many letter carriers as we have today but other postal positions, mostly the 
 clerk craft, will be drastically reduced due to outsourcing, plant closures, 
 work sharing, and more detailed automation of mail processing. Even window 
 services will be handled mostly by private companies.

I must tell you that it makes me sick to my stomach to see 
 what &apos;may&apos; happen in the very near future of postal employees. I say this 
 because I have an extremely deep abiding respect for the institution of the 
 Post Office Department of days gone by. It is my personal belief that postal 
 services to this nations public and business community is something that 
 should be protected by the US Government and provided to our people at any 
 cost just as the government provides military protection for this nation.

It is sickening to me to reduce the postal services of 
 this nation to a bickering over costs related to continuing free and 
 responsible mail acceptance and delivery to our citizens...but, that is 
 exactly where we have landed. Certainly we have a responsibility to provide 
 services at the least cost to our citizens, but this, to me, does not mean 
 closing rural post offices, shortening window hours, outsourcing any part of 
 human resources, playing with mail processing via work sharing, or looking 
 for ways to outsource postal services to private sector companies.

These are my opinions and you may not share these same 
 beliefs - I respect this, but remember one thing...the Post Office 
 Department was born to bind this nation together via personal, governmental, 
 and business correspondence... correspondence processed by postal employees 
 and delivered by postal employees - not placed in the hands of private 
 sector companies to process at the cheapest rate possible.

 What Would USPS Do? 
November 24, 2003
by Rick Owens - Postal Employee Network
 Top 

 DM News reports that telemarketing companies are announcing lay-offs and closings 
 due directly to the &apos;no-call&apos; registry formed by the Federal Trade 
 Commission. I would like to take this scenario even further by speculating 
 as to what effect a &apos;Do Not Mail&apos; registry would have on USPS and USPS 
 employees. What would we do? What would USPS do?

A &apos;Do Not Mail&apos; registry (see Group Pushes for &apos;Do-Not-Junk-Mail&apos; Registry ) would, in effect, allow USPS 
 customers nationwide to opt-out of receiving standard mail - better known as 
 junk mail to the public at large. It would only be my guess, and yours, as 
 to how such a registry may be managed or trickled down to the large standard 
 mail companies such as ADVO . 
 But it is my assumption that such a registry would be managed the same way 
 USPS manages their Address Information Systems - OR - the same way USPS 
 reports to mailers which address is vacant and which is not - which is a 
 business and which is not.

Simple, really. Customers taking 
 advantage of a Do Not Mail registry would submit a USPS provided form, USPS 
 would then enter this customer information into their databases, and large 
 mailers would be required to obtain, or purchase from USPS, current Do Not 
 Mail registers. Companies that did not update their address information 
 systems would likely be subject to fine and penalty from USPS and, most 
 likely, the Federal Trade Commission.

After the dust fell, all address 
 systems were updated, and all large mailers were cooperating with the Do Not 
 Mail Registry requirements USPS, and the mailing industry, would then begin 
 adjusting their work forces in like fashion to the telemarketer industry. In 
 other words - jobs would be abolished.

From where I sit a Do Not Mail 
 registry would be a death blow to USPS employees, and possibly USPS, because 
 of the sheer standard mail volume that we process each and every day.

 Now What? 
October 29, 2003
by Rick Owens - Postal Employee Network
 Top 

Today&apos;s headlines at DMNews.com says USPS, 
 UPS Plan Rural Offering. I have not been able to find any press release 
 or information from USPS on this subject - I&apos;m sure it is forthcoming after 
 a good &apos;cover&apos; story has been penned by USPS management.

Does it seem as though we&apos;re partnering with competition 
 here folks, or is it just me? Why should we accept rural packages from UPS 
 when the service was sold by and originated at UPS? Maybe I am missing part 
 of this story somewhere.

The way I understand it is that UPS will accept the 
 package addressed to a rural location, process it through their ground 
 system to the point where it loses profitability for them, and then turn it 
 over to us for the final leg of its journey. Sure we make a small fee on the 
 service, but we have basically lost the customers business because the 
 customer started their packages journey at UPS not USPS!

We complete the touchdown, but the other team gets the 
 points - NOW WHAT!?

 They DON&apos;T Own the United States Postal Service 
 Top 

October 24, 2003
by Rick Owens - Postal Employee Network

President Bush and his Cabinet does not own the US 
 Military and would not have the right to down-size our Armed Forces and turn 
 protection of the USA over to a government contractor (private firm). 
 Likewise, our Postmaster General, current USPS executives, the Presidents 
 Postal Commission, and any and all commissions, committees, or boards of 
 governors are not free to set the future existence of our US Postal Service 
 - neither in part nor whole.

The above statement is my own personal opinion and may or 
 may not be applicable law. The way I see it our current President, and his 
 staff/cabinet, and our current PMG, and his current staff/executives, are 
 elected or appointed to keep their ships afloat in the best manner that they 
 can and at the least cost to the American public possible - they are not in 
 their position to undermine the service that has been historically provided 
 to the American public by the US Government or the United States Postal 
 Service.

No matter how old you are while reading this you were born 
 with a right to mail service provided by our government at the 
 least cost to the citizens. This does not mean that Bubba&apos;s Mail Service has 
 a right to handle, sort, process, or deliver any correspondence that you 
 have entrusted to the US Postal Service. Similarly, Bubba&apos;s Security Force 
 is not to be entrusted with protecting our American borders from invasion by 
 a hostile foe.

If you have not noticed, our government is being sold off 
 to the highest bidder (government contractors) piece by piece. Well, this 
 sell-off seems to be &apos;in the works&apos; for the United States Postal Service. It 
 started a few years back by allowing outside firms to process mail - I 
 believe they refer to it as work-sharing. Private companies accept tons of 
 mail from state, city, county, and government agencies, as well as mail from 
 large firms, and pre-sort this mail before it reaches the USPS processing 
 center. What this does, USPS says, is speed up our operations and thus 
 allows the service to operate at a lesser cost to the public.

Say what? Actually what it does is provide profitable 
 businesses for already wealthy companies and abolishes jobs for current and 
 future postal workers. The cost, which is basically passed on to the public 
 in one way or the other, is just diverted from USPS paying employees to 
 process this mail to private companies paying their employees at a lower 
 hourly rate. In the long haul the cost of processing and delivering this 
 mail more or less remains the same to the American public.

On the horizon we have the recommendations provided by the 
 President&apos;s Postal Commission - which is heavy with suggestions and 
 proposals from large mailers (who, in most cases, utilize work-sharing) and 
 USPS executives who think they own the United States Postal Service. I&apos;ve 
 got news - the American Public owns the US Postal Service - always 
 has. But, why are we, as citizens, allowing these elected and appointed 
 officials to set up the postal system to fail? By this I mean - moving, or 
 out-sourcing, any operation or service historically provided by the United 
 States Postal Service to a large private firm or company is, in my opinion, 
 a failure of duty to our nation and its&apos; citizens.

To borrow a recent caption from Federal News Radio -&quot;Are You Being Set Up to Fail?&quot;Are we? Does 
 someone somewhere know something that we do not? Is there a secretive &apos;plan&apos; 
 being discussed behind closed doors to abolish most of the services provided 
 by this nations Postal Service?

My opinion isn&apos;t worth two cents to those who are steering 
 this postal ship, but my opinion is not directed toward those people... my 
 opinion is directed toward current and future employees of the United States 
 Postal Service, to the little old lady who each day looks for a card from 
 her grand child, to the soldier serving in some far away land that smiles 
 when he gets a letter from his wife or family, and to your children and mine 
 who so desperately need a postal service provided by, protected by, and 
 enforced by the United States Governments United States Postal Service - 
 formerly known as the US Post Office Department.

 Pay for Performance 
 Top 

August 27, 2003
Except for the heart attacks I believe your current physical standing sounds 
 very similar to mine and this for this reason I can also say I agree with 
 you about being compared to other carriers half my age is not reasonable, 
 but if they choose this program in the future I hope I will have the 
 opportunity to go back and be reimbursed for my&quot;high performance&quot;years. It 
 seems to me it would be hard to set up a program that could be fair and 
 equitable knowing the vast differences in the routes and modes of delivery. 
 I guess it will be a wait and see, but I&apos;m not at all excited about the 
 prospect of being compared to a six foot male half my age.
GLAS

August 17, 2003
Pay for performance would be okay IF a reasonable set of standards could be 
 formulated. This can&apos;t happen for two reasons: 1) Management cannot be 
 expected to be reasonable (especially if a management bonus is involved) 
 and, 2) Management WILL find a way to abuse it and misuse it. Even now, 
 route inspection numbers are routinely falsified and adjustments made 
 according to arbitrary and subjective standards set by overzealous managers. 
 Routes are often adjusted to what management wants to accomplish for 
 themselves instead of the requirements of the office. The result is 
 outrageous overtime figures, forced overtime for carriers (in violation of 
 the National Agreement), diminished customer service and strained 
 labor-management relations.

 and there is no way I can move or deliver like I used to. I cannot even 
 carry a satchel now, which doesn&apos;t affect me since I am an all business

I believe in pay for performance but I don&apos;t believe it 
 should be based
 on physical assertiveness because of the age and limitations of many
 postal workers. I do suggest that pay for performance be based on ideas
 brought about by employees to improve the business. Ideas of the mind
 have no age discrimination.
 
 from Anonymous
8-12-03
I think that you are fooling yourself to think that pay for performance 
 means that you must do something that your body is not capable of. It means 
 that you will do everything possible to insure that the Postal Service is 
 positioned to be a world class organization that the world envies. In my 
 mind it is a sleepy, lazy dwarf.  This is to say that there a lot of 
 employees that choose not to do what they are capable of and the 
 organization suffers as well as our customers. I am disappointed that you 
 would oppose pay for performance. I think that we are missing the point when 
 the employees and their union representatives let an opportunity slip 
 through their fingers and allow management and other staff employees get 
 their pay for performance. This is an embarrassment when you consider they 
 receive pay for taking actions and not even touching the mail. This is on 
 the back of us all.

Commenting about the pay for performance proposal:
It is the worst system in the world. This is the main cause behind violence 
 in the workplace. It makes the managers crack the whip in to Hitler type 
 antics to assure their bonus. It turns the carriers against each other 
 competing for a money bonus, and always jealousy as to why someone else got 
 a bonus and not them. As always it is a buddy system awarding bonus&apos;s to the 
 favorite runners. The worse possible system that could be implanted.

Sounds suspiciously like what Rural Carriers were doing 
 for years. Main problem is that just like the last rural contract, 
 management can change the standards and require more and more for less 
 pay. We had a pay-for-performance system that most rural carriers now want 
 to exchange for an hourly based system.
- Craig

Craig is referring to the recommendation below that 
 comes from one of the Postal Commissions Subcommittees

Pay-for-Performance. The Subcommittee 
 believes strongly that performance based compensation programs are 
 effective tools that, when designed correctly, can be used to align the 
 goals of management and labor and result in improved efficiency and 
 service quality. The Subcommittee, therefore, recommends that the Postal 
 Service undertake a careful study of performance-based compensation 
 programs for both management and represented employees, and that it work 
 with the unions and management associations to design and implement a 
 performance based compensation program that is meaningful to Postal 
 Service employees and assists the Postal Service in meeting its 
 productivity and service quality goals.

 Guest Comments Regarding Combining the Unions 
 Top 

August 24, 2003
Steve, Charlotte, NC
As a former RCA and current City Carrier, I agree that the best interests of 
 ALL USPS employees would be better served by one strong union.

That being said, I must also mention that the work performed by city 
 carriers IS MORE DIFFICULT and DESERVES the higher pay that City Carriers 
 now receive.

Somehow we must find a way to have a united voice, but still have effective 
 representation for our individual crafts.

I have been a regular rural carrier for 13 years and a sub for 4 years 
 before becoming regular. I feel the evaluated system is absolute 
 foolishness. There is petty dickering over seconds and minutes. There is no 
 such thing as an&quot;average month&quot;and trying to compare all rural routes, 
 nationwide. I have never received a fair count as I have a seasonal business 
 that inflates my package count during the Christmas season when package 
 volume is heavy, but it never hits at count time. I should receive partial 
 credit for this heavy volume but never do. I find counting mail unrealistic 
 and unfair to special circumstances on my route. Mail count is not a true 
 measure of the carrier&apos;s work.

I agree that all employees should be represented by one union. The current 
 fragmented arrangement creates a lot of competition between the union 
 negotiators who use the differences to the disadvantage of the whole 
 organization.
Simply said: There is more strength in a united voice. The whole is greater 
 than the sum of its parts. 

also from Anonymous 
I agree that the two should be combined. It is like we have two different 
 companies. One cases DPS, one does not and in fact will discipline a carrier 
 who does. We have passed the time for doing this and this issue should be 
 addressed immediately. The only problem with it is that the NALC will never 
 do it due to the flack that they would catch over lost overtime. Lets be 
 real here. There is no incentive for a city carrier to get done early since 
 they are paid by the hour and will be rewarded for their efforts with more 
 work, a nice auxiliary trip from a poor performing carrier.

 Abusive Employee 
August 5, 2003
 Top 

Hi,

I&apos;m having a problem with a carrier at my local office and I don&apos;t know 
 where to turn to for help.

I&apos;m a part time carrier and the person with whom I am having the problems is 
 the full time carrier I work under and I also live on the same route of 
 which we both work. However, that is just the tip of the iceberg because I 
 cannot get anything done about the problems on a local level, as the 
 postmaster basically ignores the issues brought up by myself, other 
 employees and/or customers, because of who this specific Full time carriers&apos; 
 son is. I say this because her son is in a &apos;high&apos; office in this tri-state 
 region and is &apos;over&apos; our post office as I&apos;m told.... Am I wrong or is this a 
 conflict of interest and should never of been allowed (having a mother/son 
 in a position where one is over the other)?

I personally feel this is a conflict of interest and shows favoritism toward 
 this woman and feel that because of this I (and others) have no where to 
 turn to be treated fairly by this employee, if I do not agree with what she 
 says or does or if I take up for myself, I have been told that she will 
 cause me to lose my job.. Everyone walks on pens and nettles at our office 
 when anything concerns this woman and afraid to speak up or to offend this 
 woman in fear of it causing problems with their employment. 

 Everyone at our office is aware of the things this carrier (elderly woman) 
 does, including the postmaster, but again are afraid to speak up and have 
 something done about it..... I don&apos;t know what else to do to protect myself 
 from retaliation and discrimination because I do plan on speaking up for 
 myself and my rights in the future regardless of what happens to my job...

A couple problems are: This woman has lied on me, both on the route and in 
 the post office, she blames her mistakes on me both on the route and in the 
 post office (forwarding mail, etc.. etc..), has showed my parents personal 
 mail from their lawyer around the post office to several employees, after 
 they filed a complaint about a couple of their letters missing (this 
 employee is friends with or are in the same democratic club, etc.. with the 
 woman my parents are involved in a land lawsuit with). She made some rude 
 comments while showing their private letters around the mail room. Am I 
 wrong in thinking that not only is this unethical, but against postal 
 service rules (sharing private mail with others)?

She has made rude remarks about where I live and what I live in, etc.. 

 She has made and sold dinners for the Democratic Woman&apos;s Club locally while 
 working on the job, both in the post office and on the route and has 
 delivered the dinners to those who wanted them on her route while she was 
 delivering the mail. I know this happened for almost the entire 2 years I 
 have worked there and heard it happened before I started there. Not to 
 mention selling dinners&amp;delivering them on her mail route and raffle 
 tickets for her church and her granddaughter, etc.. Not one word was said 
 about this, even though it offended many people... The postmaster even 
 purchased some of the dinners!

Am I wrong in thinking that this is 100% against the postal service rules 
 and regulations?

If someone files a complaint against her, about mistakes she makes on the 
 route or if they were treated rudely by her, I have Personally Seen her 
 delay mail on a couple occasions and force some customers to come into the 
 post office to pick up their packages even though the packages would either 
 fit in their boxes or in a safe place at their residence, (however this 
 would be my word against hers, unless the customers would speak up) I also 
 have notes that she left me telling me not to listen or believe to what 
 specific customers have to say about her, their problems and her calling 
 them&quot;Assholes&quot;and troublemakers and so forth right in the notes...... 

 Customers suffer the brunt of this woman&apos;s retaliation, as if they complain 
 either to her or the post master, they are then subject to her whims and 
 abuse.. As I have been told by customers themselves and other employees at 
 my office, that the customers used to call and complain so much on this 
 woman and nothing was getting done, that they finally gave up calling 
 locally and had no one else to turn to....

I can&apos;t get any help at my local office or even the regional office which is 
 over my office (that is where her son works), so are there any phone #&apos;s or 
 people I can contact for help??? I&apos;m desperate and don&apos;t know where else to 
 turn for advice or help...

Thanks,
Help Me in East Kentucky

 Former Postmaster Speaks on Delivery After Dark 
July 20, 2003

I am a former Postmaster in Needles California. The 
 temperature in Needles reaches 120 plus in the summer. During my tenure I 
 instituted a plan by which our letter carriers would be back in the office 
 before the extreme heat took effect. I believe this plan should be in place 
 in every city in the United States where carriers are forced to wait until 
 late in the day to get their last mail run. The Needles residents voiced 
 their opinion and overwhelmingly approved this plan. Our mail comes from San 
 Bernardino, which is some 240 miles distant. We received two HCR trucks with 
 first class mail each day. One at 5AM and the last run arrived at 9AM. What 
 we did in Needles was to cut the 9AM mail. The carriers would come back into 
 the office at around noon, and case that mail for delivery the next day. I 
 believe carriers lives and health are more important than ODIS scores. 
 Evidently so do our customers when asked.

Thanks for allowing my two cents.

I carried mail in Las Vegas for 15 years and always 
 brought this matter up during the summer months. I wished that we had a 
 Postmaster like Mr. Chaney. The power company, construction companies, and 
 many other companies allowed their employees to come in early during those 
 hot summer months, so that they would not be in the heat during the 
 afternoon, when it was the hottest part of the day.

I applaud you Mr. Chaney for your compassion for the employees and you 
 seemed to treat them as human beings first and employees second.
