 Why Junk Food Is Bad 
 
 
 Image provided by Phillie Casablanca 
 Food is what makes us who we are. It affects the shape of our bodies and helps us grow into adults. Unfortunately, not all food is good for us. These types of food are known as junk food. They are foods that are high in calories, low in nutrients and usually contain harmful synthetic chemicals.

Most junk foods are processed food; thus, they are no longer in their natural state. In addition, they are stripped of certain essential nutrients. Junk foods such as candy, chips, cakes, candy bar, chewing gum and ice cream are usually added with chemical preservatives and synthetic vitamins. The purpose of this is to prolong their shelf life; therefore, it can help reduce costs. Some of the most dangerous ingredients found in junk food are genetically modified ingredients (GM ingredients). Independent studies have linked genetically modified food to birth defects, organ failure, infertility and cancer. Because most junk food does not have sufficient levels of essential vitamins and minerals, it does a poor job increasing our long term energy, boosting our immunity, and assisting cell growth and development. It is also very bad for our health because it contains harmful synthetic chemicals. These are some of the many reasons why junk food is bad for us.

Many of us choose junk food over organic food because it saves us money but we do not realize how much money we may lose in the long run. Consuming small amounts of junk food is not a big hazard to our health, but when we consume it on a regular basis, junk food can lead to major health problems later on in life. Junk food is usually high in calories. Our bodies do not like to waste energy; therefore, the excessive calories are usually stored as fat, causing weight gain. Eating junk food for long periods of time can lead to obesity, vitamin deficiencies, heart disease and other health problems. These health problems can lead to very expensive medical bills.

If we can see how junk food affects our internal body structures, we would change our eating habits in a heartbeat. Since we cannot see how junk food affects our bodies, we need to listen to our bodies and watch for signs of health problems so we do not destroy our health. Your physical and mental health rely heavily on the types of food you eat. Avoid eating junk food on a regular basis so your health will not prematurely deteriorate.
