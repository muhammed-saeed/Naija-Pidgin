 Aerodynamics of Road
 Vehicles 
 A book review by the&quot;Lone
Danger&quot; Nick Demma   I will proceed with this book review by
 presenting a totally unorganized mess of comments. There is a section on drafting where
 the relative coefficient of drag is presented for both the leading and the following cars
 as a function of the distance between them. First we consider two poorly streamlined cars
 that have coefficients of drag (Cd) of .47. As the distance between them decreases from a
 separation that is twice the car length, the Cd of the leading car falls to 80% of the
 value that it was without the other car. The Cd of the f ollowing car is about 85% at the
 same initial separation, but it rises to more than 100% when the separation is a bit more
 than half car length and then it falls to 40% as the distance approaches zero. 
 Even tailgating idiots do not benefit much from drafting because you
 have to get extremely close to get the large benefit. Bike riders in a pace line learn to
 ride with only a couple inches of clearance between the tires and this is why they do
 this. Now for the shocking news. If we use streamliners that have Cds of only .17, the Cds
 are 100% for the leading car and 80% for the following car when the separation is 2 car
 lengths. When the separation is 70% of one car length, the Cd of the leading car has
 fallen to about 70% and the Cd of the following car has risen to 100%. As the separation
 approaches zero, the Cd of the leading car falls to 18% (!!!, yes, eighteen) and the Cd of
 the following car rises to 130%. 

 This astounding result suggests that you should try
 desperately to stay in the lead when racing streamliners and that staying in the lead will
 be quite easy because the following streamliner is doing most of the work. The lead is a
 good place to be when crossing the finish line anyway. It is as if the leading car is
 parting the air and then bringing it back together and slamming it right into the nose of
 the following car, while the bow wave of the following car if filling up the low pressure
 region that would otherwise cause drag for the leader. These results are so
 counter-intuitive that I would like some empirical confirmation of this effect from riders
 in the Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) races. The information about drafting inspires this
 question: How far away from a streamliner does one have to be in order to initiate a clean
 pass, without helping the leading streamliner by reducing its drag? For the streamliners
 that have Cds of .17, here&apos;s the table: 
 
 
 Separation Leader Follower  0.00 18% 125% 0.25 38% 120%  0.50 58% 110% 0.75 80% 93% 1.00  91% 89% 1.25 93% 86% 1.50 95% 85% 1.75  97% 84% 2.00 98% 84% 
 The separation is the distance
 compared to the vehicle length and the drag is the percent compared to being totally
 separated. 
 
This table indicates that you shouldn&apos;t let
 the gap go lower than one vehicle length, so pull out to pass before this happens. The
 feedback from HPV racers, however, is that this reverse-drafting effect doesn&apos;t occur and
 that you are better off in back, so there is some discrepancy between the wind-tunnel
 tests and the race track. Maybe we are not achieving the low Cd of .17 due to
 practicalities like wheels and holes in the fairings. The book covers aerodynamics so
 comprehensively that you can find plenty of contradictions. 

 One section describes how adding a hemisphere to the front of
 a cylinder lowers its drag coefficient from .8 to .2 (more about this later), but another
 section (page 74) says this:&quot;On the drag problem of a body, it might be mentioned
 finally that the shape of a body in front of the largest cross-section has only minor
 influence on the total drag--as long as no separation occurs already there. The main
 contributions to the drag force originate from the rear part of the body. It is not so
 important to find a proper shape to divide the oncoming flow but it is very important to
 design a rear body surface which brings the divided streamlines smoothly together. Optimum
 shapes are streamlined bodies having a very slender rear part, which is not suited to road
 vehicles.&quot;I suspect that the qualification&quot;as long as no separation occurs
 ...&quot;is critically important because otherwise it makes it sound like we could ride
 around in bricks as long as we build nice tailboxes for them. The fact that the drag for
 the leading streamliner can decrease so much when another streamliner is following it does
 suggest that the tail is important because it is difficult to imagine how the following
 streamliner could affect the airflow in the front of the leading streamliner. 
 
 Drag
 Coefficients for Different Bodies: Circular Plate 1.17   Sphere .47   Half-Sphere .42   Cube 1.05 Flat Side Facing Wind Cube .80 Edge Facing Wind Circular Cylinder .82 Twice As Long As Wide Circular Cylinder 1.15 Length Equals Width Circular Half-Plate 1.19 Long Side On The Ground Streamlined Body .04 2.5 Times As Long As Wide Streamlined Half-Body .09 Lying On The Ground 
 
 This suggests that a Lowracer is in trouble
 even if it has a nice streamlined shape and a flat bottom. The discussion of ground
 effects raised the issue of ground clearance for a trike and the influence on drag. On
 page 394 we have this:&quot;The flow volume between the vehicle and the ground and thus
 mainly the vertical forces are strongly dependent on the car&apos;s attitude relative to the
 ground. ... Very small ground clearances result in positive lift since there is hardly any
 airflow between the underbody and the ground. With increasing ground clearance, the
 airflow in the nozzle-type space between the vehicle underbody and the ground produces low
 pressures causing overall lift to be lowered to negative values and then to rise again as
 ground clearance continues to increase. The increase in overall lift is due to the fact
 that the flow velocity under the car decreases as ground clearance increases, thus
 reducing the low pressure level. Air drag increases as a function of ground clearance
 though this increase is smaller by one order of magnitude than that of the lift forces.
 ...lift variations occur mainly in the nose of the car.&quot;The variation of drag with
 ground clearance is such a weak function that the design should be based on other
 practical considerations rather than drag. Note that the drag gets lower as the clearance
 decreases, which contradicts the information presented in the table a couple of paragraphs
 ago. 

  One reason why there is so much confusion over
 aerodynamics is that there are these effects that reverse directions. Compared to a smooth
 ball, a dimpled golf ball has more drag at low speeds and less drag at high speeds. The
 speeds at the golf course are high, so the balls are dimpled. It would probably be better
 to have a smooth nose and then a trip-wire turbulator if you could control the orientation
 of the ball during its flight. The book does not discuss the design of NACA ducts or
 turbulators, although there is discussion about where to put the vents to achieve the
 desired air flow. This too is complicated and merely leaving a hole in the back of the
 bike does not guarantee that air will flow out of it. 

  The chapter on motorcycles shows two lowracer
 streamliners from about 25 and 50 years ago. These things look like they belong in the HPV
 races because the rider position is exactly like the position in contemporary lowracers.
 When reviewing any technology, it is usually amazing how early there was significant
 progress that everyone later forgets about. 

 The book devotes almost as much attention to lift as to drag.
 Bikes don&apos;t go as fast as cars so they do not generate as much lift, but they weigh so
 much less that lift is even more important anyway. When riding a streamliner in a
 crosswind, you have to lean into the wind to balance. The shell is then acting like a wing
 and generating lift. The Easy Racers Bike by Gardner Martin is infamous for crashing at
 high speeds because of this effect. I have experienced front wheel chatter on my bike. The
 front wheel becomes airborne and it blows downwind a bit before coming in contact with the
 ground again. The cycle then repeats with a frequency high enough for the rider to
 experience it as chatter. Ordinarily, we try to ride while simultaneously remaining
 upright and controlling the direction of travel. When this chattering starts, you
 basically have to choose either one or the other of these goals. Instinct for self
 preservation seems to favor remaining upright because it is the most immediate problem,
 but the direction of the wind and the location of traffic can make the direction of travel
 a high priority also. Riding in these conditions is more than moderately disconcerting and
 it inspires daydreams about trikes. 

 If we accept the premise that keeping the front wheel on the
 ground is a worthwhile design goal, then we find the section on nose design interesting.
 There is a comparison between an up-turned nose (ugly), a bullet nose (symmetrical), and a
 down-turned nose (ground-hugging). The Cd is worst for the up-turned nose (slightly); the
 other two are very close. More significantly, the lift is much higher for the up-turned
 nose. The lift is best (actually negative) for the down-turned nose. 

 There is one plot that shows the drag for various shapes as a
 function of the length to width ratio (L/D)of the vehicle. Shapes with completely blunt
 ends have Cds from about .8 to 1 whether they are round or square in cross section. If the
 back is left blunt and the front corners are rounded to the point where the front is a
 hemisphere, the Cd gets down around .2 when L/D is between four and eight. The Cd is not a
 strong function of L/D as long as L/D is greater than three. The best shape is the one
 that is rounded on both ends and the taper is so long that there is no middle; half of the
 shape is nose and the other half is tail. The drag gets down to about .12 when L/D is six.
 Unfortunately, they don&apos;t have the case where the back is square and the front has a long
 taper, so it is difficult to directly compare the hemispherical nose to the long nose. The
 difference between the hemispherical nose and the long tapered nose is a difference of
 only .08, but much of this may be due to the long tapered tail on the best design.
 Although .08 doesn&apos;t sound like much in absolute terms, the difference between .2 and .12
 is a drag reduction of 40%, which is quite significant. Earlier I was speculating that
 longer is better but it is intuitively obvious that eventually the skin friction will
 cause the drag to go up with increasing length. The plot also has skin friction plotted
 and the plot of Cd as a function of L/D goes through a minimum when L/D is six for the
 best shape that has a long tapered nose and tail, so there is the answer. 

 There is data on how much drag is due to various features on
 a car. If the baseline car has a Cd of .34, then the Cd rises to .55 when you mount a
 conventional racing bike on top of the car in an upright position. This effect is already
 gross, so imagine what the drag would be with a rider on it! Of course, we already know
 that upright bikes are gross, so there you have it. The mirrors on a car can be
 responsible for 5% of the drag in spite of their area being nowhere near 5% of the total
 cross sectional area. These examples illustrate the importance of attention to detail. 

 There is much interesting information about the aerodynamics
 of trucks. Large improvements are available by rounding the edges, adding deflectors on
 the tops of the cabs, and adding side skirts that cover the wheels and the space between
 them. These improvements greatly reduce the spray on adjacent cars that are trying to
 pass. With gasoline at ridiculously cheap prices in the USA (yes, $1.50 is still
 ridiculously cheap), we will continue to lug around these big square boxes until the
 permanent global energy catastrophe begins about ten years from now. (For information
 about this, see www.dieoff.org .) 

 I haven&apos;t read much from the chapter on heating and cooling,
 but I am going to cover my windows with low-e window film. This film looks like a mirror
 from the outside and it rejects 99% of the ultraviolet light, so I will not need to wear
 sunglasses inside and the solar heat gain will be reduced enormously. In the middle of
 summer I may use multiple layers of film. The film will be taped to the outside so that
 there is little light scattering in the plastic. If the film were on the inside, the light
 would go through the plastic twice. With the film taped to the outside, I could remove it
 quickly if I don&apos;t get home by the time it gets dark and I can argue with police that it
 is a temporary installation. On a car windshield, this film would be very illegal in many
 states. 

 The plots of Figure 4.126 on page 226 show what happens when
 a nice streamlined shape of length L is height e above the ground. The drag (Cd) is given
 as a function of the dimensionless ratio e/L. Let&apos;s say the streamliner is 3 meters long
 so we can put some real numbers on things. The Cd is .058 when e/L is .4, which
 corresponds to a height off the ground of 1.2 meters. The curve is getting flat at that
 point, so there is little benefit in going higher. The region that we are interested in is
 crammed into the left side of the plot and the lowest data point is a Cd of .091 when e/L
 is .04, which is 12 cm or 5 inches in our example. The slope of the curve at this point is
 .02 (delta Cd) divided by .1 (delta e/L), which is .02/.3 meters or .00067 per centimeter. 

 In other words, who cares? If the ideal shape is corrupted by
 having wheels, the Cd goes up to .14 anyway. The wheels add so much drag that getting
 higher off the ground at the expense of exposing more wheel is not worth it. We should be
 careful with this conclusion, however, because the plot doesn&apos;t go below the 5 inch
 clearance. The next figure (4.127) has more data at lower clearances and the data came
 from a difference source. Apparently they had a different shape (more blunt) because they
 are saying that the Cd is .25 when e/L is .041. Here&apos;s the table: 
 
 Height(cm) Cd 12.3 .25  6.9 .26 .9 .35 
 
 This agrees with some other plots that show
 the drag going up almost exponentially as the clearance approaches zero. There are curves
 that don&apos;t show this but this is because they don&apos;t have data at low enough clearances.
 From the table we can conclude that: 
 A reasonable clearance of 2.7 inches will have low enough
 drag.  Increasing the clearance from this point will not reduce
 the drag much and the drag may go up because more wheel is exposed. Decreasing the height below a half inch is undesirable because
 of drag and practical considerations. We should spend less time worrying about Ground Clearance Vs
 Drag and more time riding. 

 There are plots that show the drag and lift forces as a
 function of the angle of attack. Figure 4.127 on page 226 has plots of the drag and the
 lift for three different ground clearances as a function of the angle of attack. 

 
 
This is the figure that I pulled the data out of for the
 table . Recall that for the ride height of 12.3 cm, the
 Cd was .25. This Cd went through a minimum when the angle of attack was zero, so the drag
 goes up for nose-up or nose-down positions. Bear in mind that we have a nice streamlined
 shape. When it is horizontal, the minimum ground clearance is where the body is widest,
 which is about 30% of the way back from the nose. After that the clearance increases
 because that&apos;s the way it&apos;s shaped. When the clearance is 6.9 cm, the minimum drag occurs
 when the nose is raised by a couple degrees. The nose-down positions produce more drag at
 all ride heights. The attitude has more influence on the lift. There is down-force when it
 is level for all three ground clearances and the down-force goes through a maximum when
 the nose is down at angles ranging from 2 to 6 degrees for ground clearances ranging from
 6.9 cm to 12.3 cm. 
 
 The relationship between down-force and drag is
 reasonable. You get down-force by flinging air upward and it takes power to fling air
 around so the drag goes up. Formula I cars trim their wings for a particular course
 because of this. For a very twisty course that has few straight sections, you want maximum
 down-force to blast through the corners and the drag doesn&apos;t matter so much. On a course
 that has fewer turns and more straight sections, you want minimum drag so you can go fast
 on the straight sections and you cool it on the corners. Some cars have so much down-force
 (&gt;3g) that you could drive them on the ceiling but they also have 700 hp and we can&apos;t
 do this on a bike. 

 The book has information about the drag of wheels as a
 function of whether or not they are rotating. We scientists like these goofy experiments
 even though nobody is going to win the Indy 500 in a car that has non-rotating wheels, so
 who cares? Whether or not the wheels rotate influences the drag by only 1 or 2 percent,
 but the lift is affected anywhere from 12 to 43 percent because of the Magnus Effect. This
 suggests that most of a wheel&apos;s drag is due to its translation rather than its rotation.
 In other words, a non-rotating wheel that sticks out of the top of a streamliner would
 have about the same drag as the ones that touch the ground and this drag is substantial
 because a non-disk wheel is aerodynamically lousy. 

 I am becoming increasingly convinced that the fast bikes
 are the ones with the good detail work and that a variety of shapes work well. If you
 leave gaping holes in the side for the handlebars to swing out and you leave the entire
 bottom open, you will not have a fast bike no matter how long the nose or tail. (Don&apos;t ask
 me for the web site that shows my first streamliner!) Some very fast streamliners have
 rather blunt noses, but their detail work always looks great. It seems that it&apos;s important
 for the fairing to be one nice blob as opposed to a conglomerated mess of different pieces
 like a car. You can measure how well the detail work was done by listening to the bike go
 by. If you can hear much of anything, it wasn&apos;t done right. The Varna streamliners, for
 instance, are very quiet even at high speeds. 

 The book says this about Kamm-Backs: An aim of shape
 development is to make the static pressure at the end of the vehicle&apos;s body, the so-called
 base pressure, as high as possible, and the base itself, where this base pressure acts, as
 small as possible. This requires drawing in (tapering) the rear, a technique called&quot;boat-tailing&quot;. Figure 4.43 shows the extent to which the drag of a body of
 revolution can be reduced by tapering. The optimal tapering angle of 22 degrees given in
 this diagram should be taken only as indicative; the specific optimal angle depends on the
 upstream history of the flow. Extending the rear end encounters a saturation effect; with
 increasing length the positive effect on drag becomes progressively weaker. If the rear
 end is properly truncated, which is called bob-tailing, very little drag-reduction
 potential is lost. This confirms the idea of Wunibald Kamm. Kamm&apos;s conclusion was that you
 should find the point where the tail is half as wide as the maximum width of the vehicle
 and cut it off there. There is little benefit in having it extended beyond this point
 because the piece that you keep effectively tricks the air into thinking that the rest of
 it is there anyway. 

 My overall impression of the book is that it is full of
 interesting data and it is very informative. If you are interested only in information
 that is relevant to building a streamlined bike, then much of the book will not be
 applicable. If, on the other hand, you are a scientist like me, then you will find the
 whole book fascinating. I doubt that anyone who bought it would be disappointed.
