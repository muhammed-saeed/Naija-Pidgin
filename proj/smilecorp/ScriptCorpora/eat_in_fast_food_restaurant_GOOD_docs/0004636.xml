 About Mama Blogging Awards 
 
 Call out the bucket brigade,’cause I’m on fire 
 Posted: July 12, 2012 | Author: Mama&apos;s Empty Nest | Filed under: blogging , awards | Tags: Blogging , Home , Life | Leave a comment» 
 I don’t know what the weather’s been like where you live, but here we had quite a hot spell with high temperatures and humidity.  Given my dislike of that kind of weather, I felt like I could just have burst into flames.   Spontaneous combustion anyone?

Thank goodness for air conditioning, otherwise I would have been calling out the bucket brigade to douse the flames of heat.  But this week, the temps have fallen into more doable digits (at least for me) and thankfully, cooler nights have returned.

I admit I moaned and groaned a lot inside my air-conditioned house because I couldn’t open any windows to get fresh air since doing so was like living in an oven.  I really covet cool, fresh air to sleep well at night.  Yes,  I wilted and whimpered when I had to be outside for any length of time too.  As it turns out, I was on fire anyway; I just didn’t know it!

Yesterday as I read some of my favorite fellow bloggers’posts, I learned that my blog has been awarded the“Blog On Fire Award.”Whew, last week during our hot spell, that really would have been appropriate!  But even though my blog was named‘on fire’this week, I’m quite comfy and happy with both the award so graciously given to me by my good friend, Dianna, over at These Days of Mine ,–thank you so much! -  and the cooler weather at my house.

This award only requires me to link back to the person who bestowed the honor upon me, list eight interesting facts about myself, and pass the award to some of my favorite blogs.   Dianna invited her calico cat Sundae to‘write’her acceptance post and list eight facts about her kitty life.
 
Just chillin’under the family room ceiling fan
 
I thought that was a fun idea,  so I asked my prima donna calico cat, Callie, to‘write’this post and let you learn fascinating tidbits about her.  So here’s Callie (in italics) with her two eight cents:

1. I am definitely Mama’s cat—I hate the heat as much as she does!  Papa always feeds me first thing in the morning, and then I’m ready to go exploring outside.  But just because I don’t come running when one of them calls me, they leave me outside when they go to work!  When Mama comes home in the afternoon, I’m roasted! I can’t wait to get into the air conditioned house,  plop down on the cool kitchen floor, and wait until she brings me cool water to drink.  Or sometimes, I just situate  myself on the coffee table under the ceiling fan in the family room. 

2. I know it seems beneath my dignity as a cat because it’s a‘dog’thing to do, but I will do tricks for treats.  I will sit on command, dance in a circle, beg, and then get my own treats out of the treat jar–I try to grab a big paw full.  I love those treats! 

3. I’m the official yard guardian.   I see those pesky other critters that try to sneak into Papa’s vegetable garden.  I keep my eye on them in case they get too close, and then POW!  I’ll pounce on them or chase them.  Just the other day, I caught a mole and proudly deposited it right outside the French door on the deck…right where my humans would see it.  Well, Mama almost stepped on it…in her bare feet….I’m still not sure why she got so mad about that.  I mean she sure seemed happy when I caught all those dumb field mice that were nesting under the deck. 
 
Me with one of my fun, young ones
 
4. Sometimes I have to admit it gets kinda lonely around here with all my fun humans (the young ones) gone.  I really like it when they come back home to see me.  I get so excited I twirl in circles, rub against them, and even lick my boy’s ears.  (Well, he’s all grown up now so I guess you would call him a man.)  Gosh, I miss them!  When our Grandpa person was still alive, he mowed our yard and I was so afraid of his big green tractor.  I liked him a lot, but not that noisy tractor of his!  I wouldn’t go near that thing.  But now that he’s gone, and we have his green tractor in our garage, I like to lay on it a lot.   Mama thinks I miss Grandpa, and you know what?  She’s right. 

5. I love being outside in the dark, but Mama and Papa won’t let me go out at night any more.  Just because I’ve been sprayed a couple of times by a skunk, I guess.  I really didn’t see what the big deal was about that and why Papa gave me a weird bath— twice !  I really don’t like baths–weird or otherwise!
 
 
What does he see in that thing, anyway?
 
6. Sometimes I get irritated when Mama pays more attention to that strange box thing she puts on her lap than me.  So I just jump up on her and walk across the part where she makes her fingers go.  Sometimes I lay down right on it, so she will pet me.  But then, how rude!  She just shoves me off.  Papa seems to spend a lot of time on his box thing too, so I climb on the back of the love seat to try to attract his attention.  If he ignores me, I jump on him. 

7. I love bling! The shinier, the better.  If Mama takes her jewelry off and forgets to put it away, I always find it and carry it in my mouth to a place where I can play with it.   I’ve tried to pull  bracelets off her arm, earrings out of her ears, and one time even hid her diamond engagement ring from her for two days!  Shiny jewelry makes such a fun toy!  I don’t get it when she calls me a‘cat burglar.’ 

8. I’m such a lady, I don’t like to make much noise, so I don’t meow very loudly.  So unladylike to howl, if you ask me.  My litter box is in the garage, so when I need to‘go,’I sit at the door and stare at my people.  If they don’t see me, I go find them, slap them a little with my paw, and then run back to the door.  Finally, they get the drift!  Humans really can be so dense sometimes!  Since I’m a very quiet meower, I used to scratch at the garage door when I wanted back inside the house, but boy, did that make Mama mad.  So a few years ago, she hung a big jingle bell on the garage door knob.   When I want in, I just ring the bell.  They come running to let me in, just like Pavlov’s dogs!  HA! Yep, Mama and Papa think they’ve‘trained’me, but I know who’s the boss.  Just don’t let Mama know that I told you that.  She likes to think she’s in charge around here. 

So now that Callie told you all her little intricacies, it’s my turn again to write.  As for naming blogs who deserve this award, several of my blogging friends already seem to have it or they are not that into awards.   So I’m deviating from the norm here.  I think if you’re a reader and you’re also an avid writer, you’re already“on fire”as writing is probably one of your passions.  So please accept this award if you’d like it.

As for me, I know I’ll never throw a bucket of water on my passion to be‘on fire’to write, but I sure hope to stay cool while doing so.  And on that note, I’m off to get a nice tall glass full of ice cubes and iced tea.  I may be on fire, but I know how to stay cool.

 Where liberty dwells 
 Posted: July 10, 2012 | Author: Mama&apos;s Empty Nest | Filed under: 4th of July , Flight 93 Memorial , freedom , Independence Day | Tags: Life , Travel | 4 Comments» 
 We celebrate the day feasting.  Bar-b-que grills fire up all over the country and plates are filled with picnic food galore–everything from hotdogs to watermelon.    Enthusiastic backyard games of softball, volleyball, and badminton continue throughout the day.

Marching parades wind through hometown streets, and there may be patriotic speeches or concerts in other areas.  Everyone’s attire includes red, white, and blue while Old Glory waves from the front porch flagpole.  Stars and stripes bedeck buildings and houses.

The sound of firecrackers pops through the air and as dusk commences its descent on the day’s activities, everyone jumps in the car in search of an awesome fireworks display to ooh and aah over in the summertime night sky.

It’s the way we Americans commemorate the fourth of July, our Independence Day.  It’s the way our family usually celebrates too.  But not this year.

Since the fourth landed on a mid-week day and almost everyone in our family only had that one day off, we couldn’t celebrate the holiday together due to work schedules and distance.

The newlyweds now live in the state south of us and son lives in the state next door.  Only oldest daughter lives close by, in the city.  She arrived at the homestead Tuesday night with a great idea for how the three of us – Mama, Papa, and Daughter – could spend the day on the fourth.
 
Flight 93 memorial then
 
She suggested a day trip.   A couple years after the 9-11 attacks, we visited Flight 93’s crash site in Shanksville, PA on our way to the Outer Banks, North Carolina for vacation.  Oldest daughter, who had just graduated from college and started her new job, was unable to accompany us on that trip.

At the time, only a makeshift memorial existed in honor of the Americans who lost their lives in the quiet Pennsylvania farmland that infamous day.  Now there is a permanent memorial at the site and our daughter wanted to see it, especially because she’d missed our previous visit there.

Since the area is an easy drive from our home, we decided to venture there and then meander around to see what other sights we might encounter.

Years ago when we visited the crash site, I wept when I stepped out of the car.  This time tears did not fall,  but the sense of solemnity in this peaceful, serene place where terror struck so vividly engulfed me.
 
Flight 93 memorial now
 
Gone was the makeshift chain link fence serving as a memorial wall with mementos lodged in  it,  including a local firefighter’s coat.   In its place a beautifully designed tribute exists.  Gazing out at the field of grass and wildflowers, it’s almost unfathomable to imagine the violence of that day.

We weren’t the only ones who decided to spend a few moments on Independence Day visiting the Flight 93 Memorial Park.   Vehicles filled the parking area,  yet there was hushed silence among those of us who walked the grounds.

On a hot, summer day, we read the informative placards, we viewed the area where the plane went down, we walked silently to the memorial where we read the names of those who lost their lives, we noted the mementos left in honor, and we sat on a bench quietly contemplating and remembering the day life changed for all of us Americans.  In the silence, it seemed our country’s flag provided a form of taps as it flapped in the gentle breeze.

 It was a fitting way to celebrate Independence Day and the freedom we treasure in the United States of America, to remember that freedom isn’t free , and to understand that sometimes the cost of freedom is extremely high and painful.   But freedom is worth the cost.

 This Land: a photo essay 
 Posted: July 3, 2012 | Author: Mama&apos;s Empty Nest | Filed under: America , my country | Tags: Home , Life , Photography | 12 Comments» 
 This Land Is Your Land 

By Woody Guthrie

(Click on each photo if you’d like to see a larger picture.)

 

 This land is your land, 

 

 This land is my land 

 

 from California 

 

 to the New York Island
 

 

 From the redwood forest, 

 

 to the gulf stream waters
 

 

 This land was made for you and me. 

 

 As I was walking a ribbon of highway
 

 

 I saw above me an endless skyway
 

 

 I saw below me a golden valley
 

 

 This land was made for you and me.

 Late June’s recurrent holding pattern 
 Posted: June 26, 2012 | Author: Mama&apos;s Empty Nest | Filed under: Summer , writing | Tags: Life , Writing | 12 Comments» 
 

You know the old adage, “mum’s the word?”

Well, not only has mum been the word lately at Mama’s Empty Nest, but Mum has been fairly mum herself as well.

Definition of mum:  (adj) silent, not saying a word.   The origin of the word possibly came from “mmm,” the humming sound we humans make with our mouths closed, which indicates either unwillingness or an inability to speak.

Shakespeare used the word in Henry VI when he wrote: “Seal up your lips and give no words but mum.” 

In other words, keep quiet, say nothing, shut your trap.  The saying “mum’s the word” worked its way into our language as a means to advise another person to not reveal what he knows about something, to keep a secret, or stay quiet on the subject.

If you regularly follow my blog, you’ve probably noticed I’ve been awfully mum in the last week or two.  Throwing in some synonyms for the word  – mute, speechless, uncommunicative, wordless – adequately describes me right now.  And I know it!

I can’t admit that I’ve been quiet because I know something I shouldn’t reveal because that’s not it.  I don’t know a secret about anything !  So I honestly have no clue why I’ve been so uncommunicative (which is very unlike me anyway).

Should I blame my wordless state on busy-ness?  No,  I cannot.  No more busy days than usual.  Oh, there has been a little wedding planning (two more to go), some strawberry picking and freezer jam making sessions, a bit of cleaning and household chores here and there in between my hours at my job, but nothing that demands my full attention.

Even my computer sits idle.  I check my email occasionally and then shut off the distraction.   Logging in to Facebook has become a rarity because I see those words asking me to declare what’s on my mind, and I’ve got…nothing, no status updates, nothing interesting to say.

If I do fire up my laptop, I sit and stare at the blank screen and I am…. speechless.  Wordless.  I feel like I have nothing to impart, even though my notebook of blog ideas paints  an entirely different picture.  I just don’t feel like saying it or writing it or even thinking about the ideas long enough to put a sentence together.

It’s like I have a disorder – a non-communication complaint, summer speechlessness, or author’s apathy.  I can’t decide whether it’s just writer’s block or summer’s siren song of idleness.

In my younger days, I could be quite the talker, making chit-chat and small talk to fill any awkward silences.  But as I’ve aged, I’ve become more of a listener than a talker.  And honestly, sometimes I really have nothing to say.  Absolutely nothing .

This speechless state has woven its way, spreading like runners of ivy, into my writing.  I don’t want to bore my readers with just any old words.  I won’t publish a blog merely for the sake of publishing every day….or two…or 12.  If I have something worth writing, it also needs to be something worth reading.  And alas, I feel no compulsion to write.   And so I’ve been mum .

I hope I haven’t been disappointing, but I fear I may have been just that for those of you who log into this blog each day expecting some new post from me.   Bear with me, my faithful readers, I’ll get my words back.

For now, in my book I call Opportunity , my deck and the coolness of the evening after a warm summer day (yes, cooler weather came back for awhile) are calling out enticing me.

My softly cushioned patio chair whispers, “Come hither.  Come rest and bask in the quietness of a country evening.  Inhale the scent of freshly mowed grass and savory strawberries, plucked from the garden.  Listen to the birds warbling their sing-song melodies.  Feel the gentle breeze as it ruffles your hair.  Gaze westward and witness another spectacular sunset.   Evenings like this won’t last for long.  Maybe tomorrow you will find your words.” 

[Blogger&apos;s Note: I actually wrote this in late June last year and because I am yet again in this predicament of having no motivation or inclination to write anything new and feeling quite mum, I decided to reblog this post.    What surprises me is this seems to be a recurring theme around the last week or so of June.  Hmmm.....summer doldrums, summer sunstroke addles my brain, summer makes me mute??   What do you think?]
