Opportunity
 
With the economy in its current condition, there really has never been a better time to start an Avon business. Avon has been a household name since 1886, offering high-quality products at affordable prices. Our business is based on personal relationships with our Customers and other Representatives we help begin their new Avon careers. The earning opportunity is limitless, based solely on how much you want to put into your business. See many FAQ&apos;s below or call me anytime at (619) 512-AVON (2866) and I will be happy to tell you more!



 Frequently Asked Questions about Starting Your Avon Business 


 What is the total investment required to start up my business? 

The cost of starting your own Avon business is less than a family dinner at a fast food restaurant. As you complete the process on the next several pages, you will receive full information about getting started in your business.


 Will I receive materials to start my business? 

You will receive Avon brochures along with product samples, sales training and reference material. As a new Representative you also have the opportunity to purchase selected products and samples at special promotional prices.


 What is a &quot;campaign&quot;? 

The two-week selling period supported by a brochure that offers customers different products 26 times a year.


 What information will be required from me in order to establish my account? 

As an Avon Representative, you will be given an automatic line of credit. As such, we will require the standard personal information that is requested whenever credit is extended, including your social security number.


 How much can I make selling Avon? 

You earn at least 40% commission on beauty products in your first order, regardless of the size when your order is placed online. You will continue to earn at least 40% commission on beauty products in your second, third and fourth orders of at least $50. Throughout your Avon career, you can continue to earn as much as 50% on beauty products, depending on your order size. You can increase your earnings potential by recruiting, training, and mentoring new Representatives.


 Do I have to keep products on hand? 

At Avon, you are never required to keep a stock of products on hand. You may find, however, that your customers have personal favorites that are helpful for you to have available for last-minute needs. In addition, as a Representative, you are offered exclusive promotional opportunities to purchase products in advance. Again, these are opportunities, and are not mandatory.


 How often do I have to place an order? 

Avon has 26 sales campaigns throughout the year. Each campaign reflects a two-week selling period marked by promotional offers and/or new product introductions. Contacting your Customers every campaign gives them the opportunity to purchase their Avon favorites, see new products, and take advantage of special offers. You&apos;ll find that contacting new and potential Customers on a consistent basis will result in your placing an order each campaign.


 How long does it take to receive my order once it is placed? 

You will generally receive your order within 2-3 business days after the order is submitted.


 How do I receive future brochures? 

Every two weeks, when you place a product order, you purchase your future brochures. Brochures are always ordered four weeks ahead so that you will have them in plenty of time to include them in your Customers&apos; orders, and to share them with potential new Customers.


 Do I have to pay for shipping, or do my customers pay a shipping fee? 

As long as you place your order on-time, there is never a shipping fee for you. If you wish to receive an order at a different time from your regular scheduled delivery you have the option of receiving it for an additional fee. Surcharges apply for Alaska, Guam, and Hawaii.

You can also sell through a personal website. Your Customers can either order products that will be shipped to them directly from Avon or that will be included in your order for you to deliver to them.


 How do I pay for my order? 

Payment to Avon is due within two weeks of your order being shipped. This gives you time to deliver your orders and collect payment from your Customers. You can pay by check, money order, credit card, or online directly from your checking account using Avon QuikPay.


 Am I required to attend meetings? 

Avon offers extensive on-line training that you access 24 hours a day, seven days a week to enhance your business.

Additionally, our District Sales Managers and I hold group meetings designed to share product training and program incentives. Your attendance is not mandatory, however, for the success of your business, we strongly encourage your attendance. You will be contacted about these events in advance in order to add the event to your calendar.


 Do I have to have parties? 

You are not required to have any parties. However, many Representatives find group selling to be a very lucrative way to sell more products, broaden their customer base, and build their network marketing organization. If you do choose to participate in group selling, we offer various training and support materials to assist you.


 Is it hard to sell Avon? 

Avon is one of the best known brands in the world, which makes it easy to sell. Most Representatives even find that Avon &quot;sells itself!&quot;


 OK, how do I get started? And what happens after I sign up? 

So glad you asked! In a few easy steps, you can become an Avon Representative and start your own business.

You may also build your personal website to sell products to customers and manage your business. Within the next few days, I will follow up and offer you additional personal training opportunities to ensure that we get your business off to a successful start.
