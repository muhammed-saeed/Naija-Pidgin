I&apos;m sorry but merely tacking &quot;I work in retail&quot; doesnt justify being a prick to someone from behind a counter. I work in a prison and deal with people every day who do a lot worse things than trade in a game without a manual - what do you expect them to do? Incinerate them incase &quot;Ben&quot; looks down his nose at them?

Grow the hell up.

jeez... who&apos;d let their discs get scratched?

i keep them in the cases and carry them to trade to gamestop in a bag. those discs are NEVER scratched, warped or ruined. and i always include the manual. i&apos;m surprised people treat their games like shit.

I don&apos;t see how he&apos;s being a prick in any way, shape or manner. He&apos;s being completely direct with the customers, offering an explanation as to why the game isn&apos;t worth much, and telling them, honestly, that they&apos;re better off not trading it in.

Also, look at it from the other perspective; Gamestop isn&apos;t here to take in garbage, we&apos;re here to take in games that we can actually give to someone else without feeling ashamed of ourselves. So, when we get people coming up to us with broken cases, discs that look like they saw the mean end of a grinder, and a manual that clearly has been chewed up by a dog, I&apos;d say it&apos;s perfectly fair to judge them for it. Would YOU sell something like that to someone? Fuck no. And, as a gamer, I honestly find it insulting to be handed games that were clearly treated with no respect.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not the end of the world, but the anger directed at customers who quite clearly don&apos;t give a shit (or are pricks to begin with) is fully justified. I&apos;ll be nice to people in the store, certainly, but I&apos;ll certainly get mad when I look over the game sections to find cases tossed haphazardly around the store with no regard to the employees.

You want me to be nice to you, as a customer? Treat me with respect, and I&apos;ll do the same. The inability to put game cases back where you found them and yelling at me for simply doing my job is not going to win anyone points in their favor.

I&apos;ve worked in retail and thankfully i don&apos;t work in it anymore. It is crap, but as much as the customer takes their day out on you, you don&apos;t have to take your bad day out on them. If you get an arsehole just deflect them to the manager, thats what managers are paid for, and be grateful you don&apos;t have a job like policing/nursing/social worker/entertainer/barman where you REALLY get to deal with the ugly side of the public.

I&apos;ve worked with people like Ben who get little power trips out of tormenting people and i&apos;ve been served by people like Ben who treat you contemptously for no reason. Bad manners is just plain bad manners regardless of the excuse, and attitudes like that poison the workplace and the work atmosphere and put places out of business.

You hate your job? Quit, and spare the rest of us your tempertantrums.

Customers are venomous arrogant cunts, ALL of them, and I shall continue to believe that until a customer gives me a reason not to think that, I&apos;m always udnerstanding and unless the employee is actually being a bit of an arse then I try to be as good a customer as possible, retail and working with customers is mind destroying.

Being direct with a customer and advising them it isnt worth trading it in is perfectly fine, its actually a nice thing to do. Its the childish attitude and &quot;OMG!&quot; over the top responses and judgements of people who might not keep all their game cases in a platinum lined containter inside a bank vault that made me think he was acting like a bit of a prick.

It might be hard to understand as gamers, but stretching that whole point to make an entire feature? Please.

Furthermore, I cant get my head around the sheer volume of responses saying that by working in retail you all &quot;understand&quot; how he feels because customers are all morons. Take the post above in point, &quot;customers are all venemous arrogant cunts?&quot; Be sure to tell your mum thats what she is when she does your christmas shopping.

Also, on a slightly different but still related topic, you get people like the person quoted in the letters to the editor about turning the 7 day return policy into a 7 day rental.
 
Who doesn&apos;t do that I&apos;m not going to buy a game thinking it will be good for the overpriced Australian 100 dollars for a new game and find it SUCKS and KEEP IT? No of course not I&apos;ll return it because it is LOGICAL.

I worked retail for years. This is the average customer he&apos;s describing. They tend to get much worse. The truly nice and respectful customer, whom shows a glimmer of intelligence and understanding, is a rare find indeed. We treasure each and every one of you we find.

I&apos;m not saying everybody is rude when it comes to shopping/haggling/trading, but I have been spit on by more people than I have have been treated kindly and fairly by. Sad thing is, I&apos;m very polite and understanding when it comes to customer service, and have been told many times I&apos;m too nice. It had landed me as employee of the month a few times, but never made dealing with the general populace any easier.

Working retail takes a toll on you. People&apos;s rudeness and self-absorbed selfishness can erode away most of what is nice and kind about you, leaving behind an etched bedrock of apathy and bitterness. Needless to say, I am not the&quot;bouncing little ball of sunshine&quot; I used to be. (an actual descriptor given me by co-workers)

Honestly, I can connect with him. I&apos;m not saying I agree with everything he describes, but I can fully understand where he&apos;s coming from.
 
When I ran a counter at a Subway, I found the majority of people you have to deal with are reasonably polite and don&apos;t cause unnecessary waves, but there was this great saying I heard years back: 10% of people are assholes and the other 90% are assholes 10% of the time.

So, someone will come in, buy five dollars worth of something, then act aghast that you expect them to count out the giant pile of pennies and put them into some sort of easily countable order, while you deal with the line out the door of other customers.

Or they talk among themselves for 10 minutes until they reach the counter... and then get down to the business of figuring out exactly what it is they want.

Or they&apos;re so busy talking on their cell phone that they mime their order to you, then get pissed when you put something on it they didn&apos;t want.

Or they send their husband into the store to order their food, only he&apos;s an idiot and has to run outside the store every time you ask him a question.

Or they, in a completely misguided attempt at helpfulness say &quot;I have the 97 cents&quot;, then spent three minutes digging it out of their purse or have to run out to their car for it.

Or the person who comes in two minutes before you close, takes five minutes to make up their mind, ignores you when you say that you&apos;re closing, then sits down for 15 minutes eating their sandwich, leaving behind a gigantic mess.

Or when a group of people come in and one of them comes rushing up to the counter... this will be the one guy who *doesn&apos;t* know what he wants to order.

One of my personal favorites, the people who nit-pick your sandwich making... to no logical outcome. They want mayo. You put mayo on it. That&apos;s too much... you take half the mayo off. That&apos;s too little... you put more on it than was originally there and they&apos;re happy.

Another favorite and this one happened all the time. A couple comes in. She goes to the bathroom and he refuses to order his sandwich before she returns... like he&apos;s afraid he&apos;ll order the wrong sandwich for himself.

And the &quot;20 years later&quot; version. The old married couple where the husband doesn&apos;t know if he likes mustard and has to ask his wife. Seriously, how do you not know if you like mustard or not, but this, again, happened all the time.

But the vast majority of people knew what they wanted, didn&apos;t waste yours (or other customer&apos;s) time, only complained when there was a legitimate problem, and treated you like you were a human being. But get two or three of the above examples in a row and you wanted to chlorinate the gene pool.

Woah there, calm down. That is called utilizing a return policy. There is an ocean of difference between that and going in buying a used game knowing full well you have no intention of keeping it.

I love this line. &quot;Funny how games have matured as a medium, yet most of the people who play them have not.&quot; It&apos;s true, at least a large portion of the overall amount of people who play videogames is.

 Ok Ben doesn&apos;t sound like a dick at all to me. Every one of you ignorant idiot fucks who leaves your games out of case lying around needs to be stoned to death. I let my friend borrow my brand new game cuz I was finishing an old one, next day I come over and ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR OF HIS GARAGE was my new copy of Just Cause 2, not in the fucking box. I&apos;m OCD. I was NOT happy.
 
When you put the quality of game over human lives, it&apos;s time to take a step back and ask yourself what obsessed person you&apos;ve become.

Perhaps you should look to Comic Book Guy.

I&apos;ll agree to the first part (to an extent); while it is supremely frustrating to get games traded in that look like they&apos;ve seen a nuclear war, it&apos;s not the worst thing that happens.

However, as for your second point, a LOT of customers are morons or, at least, act like morons in the store. A pretty decent percentage of customers are fine people who at least treat us civilly, but the rest act like assholes.

&quot;Are you kidding me? It&apos;s only worth that much? You guys are rip-offs!&quot;
&quot;No, I&apos;m not okay with the game being rated M for Mature, but he wants it so I&apos;ll get it.&quot;
&quot;Why don&apos;t you have *insert game of choice* in stock?&quot;
&quot;You didn&apos;t greet me properly, I want the customer service line and your names.&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t want to hear about your damn discount card. Just give me the game.&quot;

That&apos;s a few of the things we hear quite often. Then, of course, is customer behavior.

- Bringing a shopping cart from Wal-Mart into the store.
- Letting their kids run loose.
- Grabbing cases off the wall, looking at them, then putting them back wherever they feel like.
- Stealing from our store
- Trading in stolen games
- Telling us they don&apos;t need help, then asking for it ten seconds later
- Asking us if we can tell them how much their games are worth over the phone, then getting angry when we tell them we have to see the games first.

On and on. Enough people are decent human beings to not really get aggravated, but a lot of them do act like morons. Even my mother, on occasion.

That amount of swearing wasn&apos;t really necessary.

When we get someone who ends up with a &apos;negative credit&apos; we just tell them we can&apos;t take it, because we can&apos;t. No need to insult them until they have insulted us. Honestly, I think this guy is oversensitive.

I&apos;m going to cry foul on this one, due to sampling bias.

The people who treat their games well, generally don&apos;t trade them in.

I would be pissed to if people drought in games like that. I make it a chore to keep my games in shape, from the disc to the manual so if I trade it in the next person can have a game in great shape.

its funny, i used to work at a gamestop and all that stuff in the article didnt really piss me off when it happened. you know what DID piss me off? forced to work unpaid overtime to organize all the shelves that are just gonna be screwed up 10 minutes into the next day anyway as well as &quot;pennying&quot; out items, which means we just throw crap out, and we couldn&apos;t even keep it because it was considered &quot;stealing&quot; company property. seriously, you have any idea how stupid it is to throw out 7 collecters editions of burning crusade because no one would buy them?

There&apos;s actually a pretty good reason why they won&apos;t let employees take home such items. Because it&apos;s a time-delayed theft problem. I worked in food service and at the end of the night, you had to throw everything out. Every so often, a manager would fail to see the logic of this and allow employees to take home food that would otherwise be thrown out.

Within a week, said manager realized why this was a bad idea when right before close, suddenly all this extra food gets made.

Less of an issue in retail, but a cagey manager could order a whole bunch more of something he knows will later get zeroed out, then claim the rewards later on. Where I work we damage out various parts and some vigilance is needed to make sure that managers aren&apos;t damaging out perfectly good parts to take or give to their friends.

I have the dimmest possible view of our corporate masters, but most of these policies exist to combat real problems.

 Something you probably haven&apos;t thought about (those of you who still insist on complaining about the trade in value of used games), is that GS is going to end up eating a shit ton of money on games they accept which then don&apos;t sell. Next time you go into your local GS, take a look at the original Xbox game section, or the ever expanding PS2 section, or hell, ask them how many used PS2 systems they have in their system room. I bet the answer will be around 50 or so (we have around 75 used PS2 systems in ours). GS will be eating a lot of that profit loss because there&apos;s no way in hell those will all sell. They could probably send them off to be recycled or something, but I would bet that they won&apos;t get what they paid for them, and they&apos;ll profit from it.
 
Except that GameStop doesn&apos;t actually pay for those games. They give store credit, a worthless currency everywhere else. They don&apos;t pay out a cent for used games. You can only use store credit in their store, and since you receive so little of it for trading in a game, there&apos;s a fair chance that you&apos;ll have to add cash to your purchase. That&apos;s where they make their money.

So, if you trade in your copy of Fallout 3 and you get $5.00 store credit, then never use it, they got a game for free. There&apos;s only room for profit with that business model. It&apos;s a great business model, but bad for customers. It&apos;s why I don&apos;t deal with Gamestop. $0.00 payout on used games(all of my games are in mint condition from box to manual to disk), and if you don&apos;t buy something with your store credit from them, they got your game(s) for free.
 
But we do pay cash for games and game systems. In my store, at least half of the trades coming in are not for store credit. I&apos;m not sure if you live in another country than me or what the deal is, but GS DOES pay cash for games where I&apos;m at. As for the store credit, when you use $20 store credit on a new game or whatnot, you&apos;re getting whatever you buy cheaper, where do you think that $20 comes from? GS eats that, that&apos;s how the credit system works, that&apos;s how they &quot;pay&quot; for the trade.

Secondly (as it applies to the store I work at since we have a cash trade option), deciding to take store credit and then not spending is not GS&apos;s fault. There is a victim mentality showing its head here. If you don&apos;t like the amount offered for your games, don&apos;t trade them. If you don&apos;t want the in-store credit, take the cash option or don&apos;t trade them. If you feel the store is evil and money-grubbing, then don&apos;t trade or buy from there. My point is, and always has been, if you don&apos;t like it, THEN DON&apos;T TRADE!

As an employee at GS, non-trade transactions are easier and create less work for me, so I won&apos;t be offended in the least and will welcome the customer&apos;s proactive statement towards my employer&apos;s policies.

I&apos;ll never understand how careless some people can be with their games. Even my worst games I treat like priceless artifacts, they still deserve respect. How hard is it to keep the manual safely tucked away in the case along with the disc?

&quot;Worst case scenario: Sure, you might only get $1 for your mint-condition copy of FIFA: Street, but that&apos;s more than anyone else in their right mind would ever give you for it.&quot;

Please keep in mind people, that Ben and the store that thinks this way about your property would gladly turn around and sell said &quot;worthless&quot; property to another customer for $9.99. That&apos;s about a 1000% mark-up. Hell, selling it at $4.99 is just about a 500% mark-up. Just so he can take it home and bring it back for an exchange if it doesn&apos;t work, thereby providing FREE quality control service for the company? On a game they themselves would not have paid more than a DOLLAR for?! There&apos;s selling at a profit, there&apos;s gouging and there&apos;s burning down any merchant that dares sell Vaseline in the vicinity and then viciously sodomizing you.

 I don&apos;t understand, what do you people do with your games? I keep all my boxes, discs and manuals in the best condition I can and out of harms way, most people I know do this. I don&apos;t understand why you&apos;d pay all that money for games and not look after them.

Most of the pre-owned games I buy (Australia) are very passable condition, there&apos;s occasionally some bad scratches and I&apos;ve had to take back a disc or a manual in a bit bad condition, but most of the time it&apos;s only minor scratches and slightly worn boxes (which is to be expected).

Like every other person that works in retail, you sound so high and mighty on your throne behind the counter.

How mighty you are. Putting customers in their places, and justifying a company&apos;s silly practice of opening new product.

EDIT: Ack, I just noticed I necro&apos;d this, it was in a link at the bottom of the page, assumed it was new content!

I still maintain that EVERYONE should be made to do a six month placement in either a fast food restaurant, supermarket or other kind of store, so they have six months of having dealt with the public at a base level.

Not only would it be educational, but it would mean the entire country had an idea of what it&apos;s like on the other side of the counter. Just think, in about 40 years, there&apos;d only be a tiny minority of people with no empathy for their waitress/server/cleaner etc.

This may chip away at the infuriating attitude of so many people that the moment someone has a name badge, they&apos;re no longer human, just a machine designed to serve your every whim.

The few times I&apos;ve had to complain about bad service in a store, it&apos;s NEVER been the fault of the staff, it&apos;s always been an idiotic move by management, or a truly dumb decision by the company itself, so I always write letters to head office, instead of doing the dick move of just bitching in the face of the nearest victom wearing a company shirt.

Might feel good to vent at some random staff member, but it does no good, ruins their day, and nothing gets done.

Most of the time, what you&apos;re bitching about, they hate too, but it&apos;s company policy, and the company sure as hell isn&apos;t going to listen to anyone as insignificant as the employees.

Universal Truth: The vast majority of nerds and gamestop employees are judgemental douchebags with vast amounts of insecurities who have nothing better to do than complain and shit themselves. I&apos;ve had the same xbox 360 for 6 years with no problems so far, I always hand in my used games in immaculate condition with the manuals and even the little ads that come in them. My discs are always in immaculate condition as well because I actually have a brain and don&apos;t throw them around my house or drop them into a blender. So your &quot;universal truth&quot; is horseshit. So try not to be so ignorant and judgmental. How about you plug up the bleeding orifice in between your legs and not give a shit if people scratch there discs or otherwise.

Really nice to point out and I have to agree people do not take care of their games anymore &quot;or know how to do iso dumps to play back ups&quot; &quot; I try my best but x-box 360, ps3 will wear down your disc no matter what you do unless it&apos;s.. it bluray&quot; but I have over 2000 games in my collection all with manuals, cases, box-art, every game and I make sure every game is playable.

Like so many, I have more than once regretted lending games to friends given the resulting treatment. Fuck, it makes my blood boil! Now the &quot;more than once&quot; element possibly renders me stupid for not learning my lesson the first time, but I try to be nice to my friends. How the fucking almighty they let their kids get hold of discs etc is beyond me. I keep all my games and controllers out of reach, and both my kids know there is an early grave for them should they so much as look at the Xbox with a hint of mischief. They can try and fit sandwiches into my wife&apos;s Wii if they want.
