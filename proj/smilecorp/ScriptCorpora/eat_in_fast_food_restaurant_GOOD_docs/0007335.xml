		Dear Webby: Replacement for MS Publisher Â  Friday, February 15, 2008, 02:37 AM Zoom the font size for best readability!
Good Morning,!
Friday, February 15, 2008 I do not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month, 
and I feel myself infinitely the happier for it.
--- Thomas Jefferson

If you&apos;re not part of the solution, you&apos;re part of the precipitate.
--- Henry J. Tillman Thanks to Robert for this story:
Three men, an editor, a photographer, and a journalist are covering 
a political convention in Miami. They decide to walk up and down the 
beach during their lunch hour. Halfway up the beach, they stumbled 
upon a lamp. As they rub the lamp a genie appears and says 
&quot;Normally I would grant you three wishes, but since there are three 
of you, I will grant you each one wish.&quot; 

The photographer went first. &quot;I would like to spend the rest of my 
life living in a huge house in St. Thomas with no money worries.&quot; 
The genie granted him his wish and sent him on off to St. Thomas. 

The journalist went next. &quot;I would like to spend the rest of my life 
living on a huge yacht cruising the Mediterranean with no money 
worries.&quot; The genie granted him his wish and sent him off to the 
Mediterranean. 

Last, but not least, it was the editor&apos;s turn. &quot;And what would your 
wish be?&quot; asked the genie. 

&quot;I want them both back after lunch&quot; replied the editor, 
&quot;The deadline for tomorrow&apos;s newspaper is in about ten hours.&quot; , if you like the Dear Webby Daily Humor Letter,

The teacher asked the children their names one at a time,
and for each to spell their name out loud. When she came to
a young Pakastani boy and asked his name.....

&quot;Ravashanka Vankatarataam Bannerjee&quot; he replied.

&quot;How do you spell that? asked the teacher.

&quot;My mother helps me&quot; said the little boy. Give a friend a free gift subscription to the Humor Letter. Thanks to Deeli&apos;s Bonehead reports: An INTERNATIONAL BONEHEAD AWARD
goes to HSBC bank in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, UK Bank is open February 7, 2008 - Easingwold, North Yorkshire, UK - Ananova

A five-year-old boy pushed a bank door and it opened - 
19 hours after it was supposedly locked up for the weekend.

Oliver Pettigrew wandered into the HSBC branch in Easingwold, 
North Yorkshire, as his dad used a cash machine outside.

Dad Daniel, 50, said &quot;Oliver vanished and then appeared again. 
He said,&apos;Dad, the bank is open&apos;.

&quot;At first I thought he was joking - but it was.&quot;

Daniel and Oliver called police after walking right up to 
the vault of the deserted bank on Saturday. The bank had closed 
for the weekend at 4.30pm on Friday.

An HSBC spokeswoman said there was a &quot;malfunction&quot; with the 
catch on the door. She said customers&apos;savings had not been at risk.

Oliver&apos;s mum Alison, 44, said: &quot;There were no alarms. If not for 
Oliver that door could have been left open until Monday.&quot; http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2717572.html?menu= Thanks to Noella for this picture of the recent ice storm Get a Dish Network for as low as $19.99/month

Re: Publisher Dear Webby,
HI, how are you? As always, thanks for the great humor and advice.
I look forward to reading your humor everyday.
I have emailed a few times and you always help me out, so here I am
again needing advice! 
My daughter is working on a school paper and needs microsoft publisher
or desktop publisher (same thing?) I was wondering if theres a free
version that I could get online for her to use.
thanks in advance
 Happy Valentines Day!
Tam Dear Tam
Just get Open Office from http://www.openoffice.org/ It&apos;s publisher, called IMPRESS, seems to be better than 
Microsoft&apos;s publisher anyway.
And Open Office is free!

February 14, 2008 - Miami, Florida - UPI
 
Federal authorities in Miami were holding a Massachusetts man 
after he allegedly tried to leave the country with more than 
$1.3 million in stolen cash. 

Allen Seymour of Oxford was headed to Venezuela with his 
family when a money-sniffing dog detected the cash in the 
baggage compartment of a private aircraft at Opa-locka Airport. 

FBI Agent Albert D. Lamoreaux said Tuesday that Seymour 
illegally obtained the cash from a Massachusetts lawyer through 
a complicated series of transactions. The lawyer, identified only 
as R.D., was under federal investigation in a case involving the 
misappropriation of $1.99 million belonging to a client. 

Authorities said they believe Seymour was attempting to flee to 
Venezuela. Besides his wife and five children, he was also 
taking the family dog. http://www.arcamax.com/newsheadlines/s-302668-678797
