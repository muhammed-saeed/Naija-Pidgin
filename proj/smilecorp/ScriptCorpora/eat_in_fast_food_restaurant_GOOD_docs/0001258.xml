One of the Hottest Burger Franchise Opportunities Available!

Metro Burger®was designed to meet consumer demand for an ultra-premium gourmet hamburger, served quickly and at a price consumers can afford. This burger franchise opportunity brilliantly closes the gap between the fast-casual and full-service hamburger concepts in today’s marketplace. Perfectly designed for inline strip malls and free-standing buildings and averaging 1,800-3,000 square feet, Metro is the only urban-chic-concept burger franchise.

 A Proven Industry 

Americans have had a long love affair with hamburgers as evidenced by the approximately 12 billion burgers consumed in the U.S. last year. Of this number, it is projected that nearly 80% of all hamburgers are prepared and purchased outside the home. Owning one of our franchise locations is your entrance to this $100 billion (and growing) industry.

Now considered one of the hottest burger franchise opportunities, Metro Burger is the culmination of our founders’50-plus years combined experience in restaurant ownership and operations. Every aspect of this burger franchise system was designed based on their experience and expertise, leading to greater efficiencies and cost-savings opportunities than any other similar franchise.

 Who We Need 

We are seeking franchisees who have good business acumen and strong work-ethic, recognize the potential of burger franchise opportunities, and commit to follow our proven system of operation. Experience in retail is helpful but not a must. We are confident in our ability to train our franchisees to successfully duplicate our system so we do not require franchisees have any previous experience in the industry. Franchisees must also have the minimum financial qualifications necessary to fund the opening of the franchise.

 Getting Started 

We estimate that the typical length of time between signing the Franchise Agreement and opening your franchise is 3 to 4 months. This includes the time necessary to select a site, construct your restaurant, complete our initial franchise training program and hire and train staff. Our franchisees benefit from our extensive experience relative to selecting the right location, negotiating the lease, and constructing the restaurant on time and on budget.
