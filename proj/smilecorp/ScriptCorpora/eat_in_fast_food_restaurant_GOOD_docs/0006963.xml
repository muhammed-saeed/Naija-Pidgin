How much faster can a bi turbo muffler make your moped go? 

In: SciTech › Automotive 
 
Rate This Answer
 
With no other changes on a bike in perfect tune, switching the stock muffler for a performance exhaust will add near 5 to 10 mph.. Some drawbacks are it&apos;s loud, the engine is under more stress (higher RPMs), the rest of the bike is built for 30 mph!
