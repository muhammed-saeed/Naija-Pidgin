 LIVID. May 8, 2012 By: 5555555 read more 
 
I go to this mcdonald&apos;s often. The staff are always very short and unwelcoming, especially at the drive-thru. Last night I went to get myself a large ice water which they do not charge you for, I have never been charged for water from Mcdonalds before. The girl in the drive thru then insisted she had to charge me for it due to&quot;kids&quot;using them to do drugs. I asked if I could speak to the manager, he then explained the same thing to me, I told him how that isn&apos;t right and I won&apos;t be returning to this mcdonald&apos;s again. He then rudely shoved the water out of the window at me and slammed the drive thru window.

Had a wonderful visit, i often go to this mcdonalds and have a good visit. The staff are very friendly as well as the mangers. I recommend this McDonalds to anyone.

Ive never had a terrible time at this McDonalds, and cannot believe previous comments. staff and managers are all respectful and seem to work hard.

 A JOKE September 24, 2011 By: OSCARWINNER read more 
 
Firstly I wish I could give less than half a star!

Vile. Disgusting. Should just pack it up and let a real fast food restaurant take its place. This sorry excuse is ran by toddlers and infants and managed by people who are as useless as people in comas.
Food is either marinated in salt or cold. Staff would much rather joke around than do their job. The city dump is cleaner than the lobby and the bathrooms... well enter at your own risk if your seeking an STI or a few open sores.
I&apos;ve delivered babies faster than it takes to get from Window 1 to Window 2 in drive thru.
Just terrible. Drive an extra 2 minutes and get your McDonalds from Centennials location. Apparently they train there!

 DISGUSTING AND INCOMPETENT June 28, 2011 By: KIMBERANN read more 
 
If only we had seen the reviews on here before hand. My father got us dinner from there around seven, and my brother&apos;s fajitas were marked with a&apos;use by 3:39pm&apos;. Then when we tried to call about it- no answer. Apparently we also got not salad dressing (they both got side salads) Brilliant, just brilliant. Please, take the extra five minutes to go to another McDonalds

 FOOD QUALITY May 12, 2011 By: ELINOR read more 
 
Asked for my hamburger to be cooked fresh as I don&apos;t like my meat out of the warmer. (they can keep it in there for up to 1/2 hr) Got it and it was cold. took it back waited for a replacement, not much better. Spoke to the manager and all I got was excuses. Will not eat there again.

 FOOD WAS COLD May 10, 2011 By: NON-MEMBER read more 
 
Most disgusting burger i ever had. I ask that it be made fresh before I placed my order and was told yes. First burger that they gave me was cold, I didn&apos;t even have to take it out of the box to know that. Returned it to the counter
got another one that was warmer but NOT hot. Tasted like cardboard. This was a take out order. Phoned the manager and all I got was excuses.

 HORRIBLE August 30, 2010 By: ERICJONES223 read more 
 
This is one of the worst McDonald&apos;s I have ever been to. The employees were all kids just joking around like they were at a party or something! Even the manager was young! I mean like 16 or so! And he wasn&apos;t doing anything to stop the goofing around, he actually was a part of it all! After waiting a long time to get my food, I found it difficult to find a clean table to sit at! Absolutely HORRID ... the food was cold and my fries weren&apos;t fully cooked! I will never be stepping foot in there ever again! McDonald&apos;s should really reconsider promoting these KIDS when they are clearly too immature for that amount of responsibility! I highly recommend that anyone who reads this should avoid this restaurant!
