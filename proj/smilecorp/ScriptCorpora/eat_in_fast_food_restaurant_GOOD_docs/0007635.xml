Always one in the thread.
 
 &quot;In a case that could set the first broad judicial standards for the use of Tasers , a federal appeals court in California has ruled that the police can be held liable for using one of the devices against an unarmed person during a traffic stop.
 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, said the electrically disabling device constituted excessive force when used against an unarmed man who did not pose a threat, and it refused to allow a police officer immunity for its use.&quot;
 
 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/us/01taser.html 
 
 

I guess it is time to abandon the taser for the old fashion nightstick to the face. &quot;I said comply!&quot; 


+1 Self-centered anarchists never support the enforcement of order in our society. That is usually due to them living the same life as &quot;Line Cutter Lucca&quot;. Tasers are convenient, but pepper spray, night sticks and choke holds are just as effective and never get any press.

 Posted: 2/5/2012 10:24:01 AM Getting stuck in the drive thru line is one of the reasons that I always walk in to place my order. Typically, it cuts my time quite a bit shorter with me getting out with my order before drive thru customers that arrived when I did.

Buzzzzzzzz.

Apparently we have another loser. Keep reading to learn that she is white (possibly from PR and an if so, American citizen).

But, I am sure you are not racist or prejudiced or anything like that.

I used to do that, but I&apos;ve found that most places will prioritize the drive thru ahead of the people actually standing in line... I just avoid the busy times now, or go somewhere else.

Nothing diferent. Crazy bitch is crazy. 

Then why your first post 
Because I have noticed a shift from a Taser being used as an alternative to a firearm when prudent and safe to do so to another tool along the lines of pepper spray and batons. I think a large amount (obviously not all or maybe even most) of taser use could be avoided by better people skills which seem somewhat lacking today. Then again the culture that is being policed seems to need more tasing. I never once said it was a bad tasing. You guys have very poor reading and thought processing skills sometimes.

because thats where the use of Taser belongs.

Once its time to escalate the force response from talking to something higher, taser is an appropriate force level. Going hands on, going to batons ( many agencies don&apos;t even use batons anymore )....in many cases will result in more injury than tasing.


 +1 Self-centered anarchists never support the enforcement of order in our society. That is usually due to them living the same life as &quot;Line Cutter Lucca&quot;. Tasers are convenient, but pepper spray, night sticks and choke holds are just as effective and never get any press. Perhaps it&apos;s time to start teaching our LEOs pain compliance submission holds again in the academy... lets face it... there is a big population of miscreants out there that need to get their asses kicked a few times to get their heads on strait! 

Increased liability to the officer and agency if we implemented your ideas.

She was fighting the officers, what you have them do instead?
 
Nothing diferent. Crazy bitch is crazy. 

Then why your first post 
Because I have noticed a shift from a Taser being used as an alternative to a firearm when prudent and safe to do so to another tool along the lines of pepper spray and batons. I think a large amount (obviously not all or maybe even most) of taser use could be avoided by better people skills which seem somewhat lacking today. Then again the culture that is being policed seems to need more tasing. I never once said it was a bad tasing. You guys have very poor reading and thought processing skills sometimes. 
 

The taser was never intended as an alternative to a firearm.

Granted, but it filled a gap between a baton and rounds fired. They are a wonderful tool but their increasing use for things that would have been soft hands or less years ago is document-able and real. User Info

No they were intended to be used instead of impact weapons or heavy hand techniques.

I&apos;d rather an officer taser me than go baton or ass kicking.

&lt;––––been tasered, no big deal.

The taser is BELOW the baton in terms of force levels.
Do you honestly think a taser causes more damage than being whacked with a baton?

Therein lies the problem with your thought process.
When the police show up, it is not a negotiation.
Here is how I would have handled that call.

Miss you are trespassing.
You are being ordered to leave.
If you fail to obey this lawful order, you will be arrested.

If the person leaves, code it and go 10-8.
If she doesn&apos;t put that car into drive by the count of 3, hook her up.
And if she resists or chooses to fight back, then that is her choice and she can deal with the consequences.
I don&apos;t have time to coddle those with the entitlement mentality.
What about all those hard-working, law abiding people behind her who manage to obey the rules of life?
Their time is worth something.

 I&apos;ve got to wonder if keeping the line backed up for 20 minutes was worth teaching the bitch a lesson. 

I hope they kept serving the ones stuck behind her, unless the drive through is such that everyone gets stuck. User Info

 &quot;They pulled on her a couple of times, and then they Tased (stunned) her again, and when they Tased (stunned) her the second time, she just flopped out of the car like a fish.&quot;

5 seconds of intense pain, with only probe wounds to show for it the next day.
The alternative is being beaten into submission with whatever impact weapon is handy.

you mis understand the &quot;gap&quot; that the tazer fills, let me enlighten you;

gun
Baton
pepper
hardhands
tazer
soft hands
harsh words

the tazer is less tramatic, has less chance for inury(for all involved), has less lasting effects then anything above it in use of force.
a few departments have it above hardhands, but even still, I would rather be tazed 100 times then peppered once, or take a baton strike. User Info

 For a large woman with impaired mobility a count of only three seems a mite brisk.

This is my guess. She probably has some sort of mental handicap and people have let her get away with shit like this her whole life. My wife works for an agency that deals with developmentally disabled adults. She has stories like this. There are some that want to get a job and be like anybody else in the community. But there are plenty that are plain white trash. But somewhere along the line they&apos;ve gotten some diagnosis and have learned how to play it to their advantage. Sounds like somebody called this woman on her bullshit. User Info
