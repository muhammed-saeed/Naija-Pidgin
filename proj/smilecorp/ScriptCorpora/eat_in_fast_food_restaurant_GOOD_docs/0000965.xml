 Mumbai–Koli Seafood Festival

Did you know that there is something known as the Koli Seafood Festival that is periodically held in Mumbai! And is in its sixth year!

I got to know about it from Blogger Finely Chopped’s Facebook Page.

From what I gather, this month it was held in Versova (Vesava) in Andheri–from 28 to 30 January 2011.

Fresh Lobsters, Crabs, Squids, Shrimps, Prawns, Clams, Caviar, Pomfret, Tuna and various other varieties of seafood–you name it, they had it. Cooked to perfection–the Koli Style.

Read what bloggers who visited had to say about the Koli Fish Festival:

 The prawns were so fresh that they almost swum out of our fingers and began to sing “Sheila Ke Jawani”. – Finely Chopped 

 Some Food Seduction happening at Follow My Recipes 

And Sassy Fork who has savoured their delicacies a couple of times at various locations across Mumbai.

Check out their blog-posts about Mumbai’s Koli Seafood Festival. And some seriously droolworthy pictures. More photos on the Finely Chopped Facebook Page .

 Some Matar Paneer please! 
Posted by PA under Food talks | Tags: Cooking for Dummies , Easy Recipes , Indian Recipes , Recipes |
 Leave a Comment   
Oh well we are backing to cooking. Sigh! Shaadi vaadi kya kya karvati hai!

Here we have some Matar Paneer for you, dear blog readers.

Matar is the Hindi word for Green Peas. Paneer is the Hindi word for Cottage Cheese.

This version of Cottage Cheese with Green Peas – Matar Paneer has miniscule amount of gravy. You can even make it with more gravy.

A simple and easy recipe to execute, doesn’t take much time. Provided you have the two main ingredients handy… ha-ha I know I am wicked!  Imagine you enter the kitchen deciding to make Matar-Paneer and then realize that you neither have Matar, nor Paneer. Then you rush off to the market to get hold of these. In such a case even the fastest recipe would take time to execute.

Tips for Newly Weds – Always plan the weeks’ menu in advance and accordingly do the grocery shopping.

Well, back to the Matar Paneer. You need:

 Paneer – Cottage Cheese – There are different kinds of these available in the market. I prefer the softer version – it’s more delicate in texture. Matar – Green Peas – I prefer them fresh. Onions Tomatoes Garlic Turmeric Salt Green Chillies Cumin seeds Coriander Powder Coriander Leaves Red Chilli Powder Garam Masala 

The Recipe – not very difficult – even bachelors can make this.

In a pan or cooker (you can use any of these), heat some oil, add cumin seeds, garlic and chopped green chillies. Add some chopped onions to this and stir for a few seconds, just enough to make the onions slightly golden brown.

Get them off and allow these onions to cool for a few seconds. In a mixer, make fresh tomato puree and add these golden-brown onions to it. The output would be a thick paste of tomatoes and onions.

Put this tomato-onion paste back in the pan and add few more drops of oil. Add salt, turmeric, red chilli powder and coriander powder. Stir for a few seconds and add some water. The quantity of water would depend on the quantity of gravy or curry that you need. Since in this version we intend to have negligible gravy, we add only about half a glass of water. Most of it would dry off in a few seconds. Add fresh green peas to this and stir for a while. Now add diced paneer. This generally goes in the end as paneer aka cottage cheese, in itself, doesn’t take much time to cook. You may even add stir fried cottage cheese. That also tastes good. In this version, we do not stir fry the paneer. We add it as it is. Once the paneer is added, stir for a few seconds. Sprinkle some fresh garam masala and garnish with coriander leaves.

Serve hot with a variety of Indian breads – Roti, Chapati, Parantha, Puri. You can even make a sandwich with it.

 When in China do as the Chinese do

…not really though!

Especially if you are PA!

We decided to grace Mainland China–Powai–Mumbai one evening. PA was a bit sceptical to begin with as she isn’t much into Chinese food. She doesn’t even know how to hold a pair of chopsticks properly. Forget eating with chopsticks. Oh! But the food was yum and the ambience was nice. As it was a busy weekend, we made it a point to get prior reservations. Our table was right at the far end of the restaurant, top-centre. It was a huge round table, spacious to hold ample food. Pa quite loved the sitting arrangements. There wasn’t much hustle-bustle and movement in our side of the restaurant; much needed for a quiet dinner.

So if you happen to visit this restaurant, you know which table to go in for.

What we had–Mint Mocktail (don’t remember the exact name though)–Gallons of Jasmine Tea (I am hooked!)–Chicken Soup–Crab Sweet Corn Soup (Forgot to photograph that!)–Prawn Crackers–Braised Duck in Oyster Sause–Steam Whole Fish with Black Pepper Sauce–Lychees with Icecream

The food was indeed very good and the service was nice and polite with personalized attention.

We were looking for imported Lamb (not Mutton) and Indian Wild Duck. They had Indian Lamb and Indian Duck (not the wild one). Most people out there were having lamb. Having had an overdose of Lamb for the past few days, we decided to skip the lamb. And hence opted for the Batak aka Duck–even though it wasn’t the wild varieties.

 PA and her love for potatoes 
Posted by PA under Food talks | Tags: Cooking , Easy Potato Recipe , Potato |
 Leave a Comment   
Puri Bhaji turned out to be one of the specials for breakfast at Seasonal Tastes, Westin Mumbai one day. And it was indeed out of the world. So, what does PA do in such a situation? Quickly get hold of the chef and request him to part with his recipe for Aloo Bhaji.

This variant of Aloo Bhaji can turn out to be a good start for PA’s tryst with cooking. What say!

Aloo is the Hindi name for Potato. Bhaji, pronounced as Bhaaji is the dry version of Curry. It can also be called Subji or Subzi.

We now present to you Cooking Tips for Dummies, PA style! 

So, of whatever I could remember from the Chef’s recipe, we hit the kitchen floor.

For the Aloo Bhaji, you need:

 A couple of Potatoes, but of course! Jeera (Cumin Seeds) Green Chillies Tomatoes Onions Salt Turmeric Powder Ginger Garlic Coriander Powder Fresh Coriander Leaves Red Chilli Powder Green Peas 

Now that you have the ingredients, let’s get on with the task.

Boil the potatoes. Drain the water and allow them to cool down for a few minutes. Gently peel off the skin. You can then either dice the potatoes or gently mash them. Ensure that you don’t mash it into a paste!

Heat some oil in a Kadhai or Karahi, an Indian Wok generally made of iron or stainless steel. I used vegetable oil for this. Add some cumin seeds and chopped green chillies to the oil. Stir, add the potatoes and stir again so that the cumin-chilli mixes well with the potatoes.

Get hold of a pan and heat little oil in it. Add chopped onions and stir till they become slightly golden brown in colour. Add fresh ginger and garlic paste to this. Then add grated tomatoes. You may even use puree or tomato paste. Add a handful of green peas. Stir for a while and sprinkle some salt, turmeric powder, red chilli powder and coriander powder.

Add the tomato-onion mixture which by now would almost look like a paste, to the potatoes. Stir for a while and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.

You may also add some Amul Butter at the end.

You can have this with a variety of Indian breads–Puri, Roti, Chapati or Parantha.

Experiment with this Aloo Bhaji and tell me if you liked it. Do some random variations to it and if it turns out well, let us know.

We never miss a chance to spot gems, isn’t it! This one is from CNNgo. 
 
40 Mumbai foods we can’t live without : From street food spice bombs to favorite fasting foods and meat dishes fit for a Mughal invader, here are a selection of foods that any true Mumbaiker revels in–By Sanjiv Khamgaonkar

The history of food in Mumbai is closely linked to the growth of this city from fishing village to megapolis. As wave after wave of immigrants from all over the country came with dreams of gold in their eyes, they brought their culinary treasures with them. The result? A smorgasbord of cooking styles and street food that reflects our cosmopolitanism as much as our carbohydrate-fueled work ethic.

Here’s a sampling of 40 must-try foods that define Mumbai’s food culture , with Muslim, Gujarati, Goan, Coastal, South Indian, Parsi and of course local Maharashtran influences.

1. Akuri on toast

Move over scrambled eggs, the Parsi Akuri cometh. Rated as one of the great Parsi dishes, every family has its own special way of making this breakfast meal. Though variations of the ingredients are vociferously debated, Akuri is usually made by scrambling eggs with onions, tomatoes (or even raw mangoes when in season), red chilli powder, green chillies and topped with fresh coriander. Others add milk, jeera (cumin) powder, curry leaves and even ginger and garlic paste.

Try the Akuri on Toast at Jimmy Boy, 11 Bank Street, Vikas Building, Off Horniman Circle, Fort. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2266 2503

2. Baida roti

This one is an interesting envelope. Spiced meat—chicken or minced mutton, even bheja (brain)—and whipped eggs with masala-fied fried onions enveloped in a square shaped dough and pan fried. Though served with sliced onion rings and green chutney, they’re delicious even without accompaniment.

A lot of people swear by the Baida Roti at Bade Mian, Tullock Road, Behind Taj Mahal Hotel, Apollo Bunder, evenings only. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2284 8038

3. Batata vada

Whether it’s for breakfast, teatime, or anytime, one thing is for sure, Mumbaikars can’t live without the Batata Vada bite. This well-liked fast food dumpling is made by mashing boiled potatoes with green chilies, ginger, garlic, lime juice, turmeric, and fresh coriander, then dipped in a besan (gram flour) batter and deep fried. It’s served either with a green chutney or fried green chillies.

Virtually every street corner will have an outstanding Batata Vada seller but it’s hard to beat the ones made at Shrikrishna, near Chabildas High School, Dadar Market.

4. Butter chicken

This ubiquitous dish traces its roots to the days of the Mughals when calorie counting was a thing of the future. This must-order dish when Indian families go out for dinner is made from chunks of chicken, marinated overnight in a yogurt and spice mix that includes ginger garlic paste and lime juice. It is then grilled or pan-fried. An ultra rich sauce made with butter, tomato puree, cumin, garam masalas and fresh cream is then poured over it. Best had with Indian breads like rotis, naan or parathas. Don’t confuse it with chicken tikka masala, which is a story for another day.

While available at every kind of eatery, the butter chicken at Punjab Grill is worth dying for. Level 3, Palladium Mall, Phoenix Mills, Lower Parel. Tel: +91 (0) 22 4347 3980

5. The Bombay sandwich

This street side invention is a combination of the most unlikely ingredients. Lavishly buttered white bread and sandwiched between them thin slices of beetroot, boiled potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion rings, and mint chutney. Cut into four triangles so that you can handle all the layers without spilling them, you get the most refreshing tangy taste, after each bite. A toasted version steams up the vegetables inside and adds another dimension. Truly, there is no other sandwich quite like it in the world.

Though widely available through out the city, try it at Amar Juice Centre, near Cooper Hospital, opp. Juhu Galli. Or the Mafco Stall outside Worli Dairy on Worli Sea Face.

6. Bheja fry

Bheja, or goat brain, sautéed with tomatoes, onions, turmeric, green chillies, spices and garnished with fresh coriander, is a staple of all those with hardcore carnivorous leanings in the city. Eaten with a roti (Indian bread) or pao, this melt in the mouth dish has a rich Muslim heritage behind it and you often find that one plate is not enough.

Radio Restaurant, 10, Musafir Khana, Palton Road, Tel: +91 (0) 22 2261 7171, serves up a really good Bheja Fry.

7. Bombil fry

Bombil, or Bombay Duck, is a fish (and not a duck) found in plenty in the waters around Mumbai. A fisher folk favourite, Bombils are flattened, then dipped in a spice-filled besan (gram flour) batter and fried. This crunchy-on-the-outside and mushy-soft-on-the-inside fish dish can be eaten on its own as a starter, or as a main course with chapattis.

Gajalee restaurant does a mean Bombil Fry. They have branches at Hanuman Road, Vile Parle (E), Tel: +91 22 26114093. And at Phoenix Mills, Lower Parel, Tel: +91 22 2495 0667

8. Brun maska

You may wonder how bread and butter can become such an iconic union. But it’s not merely bread and this is not merely butter. It’s brun or gutli pao—a local bread that is unique to Mumbai—and it’s crisp and hard and crumbly on the outside and soft inside. The Brun is then sliced and lashings of butter are applied lavishly. Some even sprinkle quite a bit of sugar. It is usually accompanied by the sweet Irani chai. Dipping the brun maska in the chai is the only way to eat it.

Available at most Irani restaurants, the Brun Maska at Kyani&amp;Co is historic. 657 Jer Mahal Estate, Opp. Metro Cinema, Dhobi Talao, Tel: +91 (0) 22 2201 1492. Also try it at B Merwan, Opp. Grant Road Station (E), Tel: +91 (0) 22 2309 3321

9. Bhel puri

The most commonly sold chaat on the streets of Mumbai, every bhel walla will have his own matchless blend and a considerable 7pm fan following. While the ingredients—puffed rice, papadi (small crisp deep fried flour puris), sev, onions, potatoes, raw mango and sweet and sour chutney—remain the same, it is the proportions in which they are thrown together on the street side that makes the difference.

Bhel puri is available everywhere. The stalls at Chowpatty and Juhu beaches draw throngs of die-hard fans. But if you want a bhel puri with ambience, try it at Sea Lounge, Taj Mahal Hotel, Apollo Bunder. Tel: +91 (0) 22 6665 3366

10. Chicken mayo roll

Almost every school or college canteen serves it. Most single screen cinema houses showing English movies display it during the interval. Most bakeries will have their version, neatly wrapped in cellophane, at the counter. Some grocery stores in up market areas stock it along with grain and rice. It’s hard to believe that plain boiled chicken doused in sweet-ish mayonnaise with a celery leaf for dressing, all wrapped up in a bread roll can be so popular in a spice loving city. But it is.

One of the creamiest chicken mayo rolls can be had at Paradise, Sindh Chambers, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Colaba, Tel: +91 22 22832874. Or try it at Candies, Mac Ronells, 5A Pali Hill, St. Andrews Road, Bandra (W). Tel: +91 22 26424125

11. Chicken manchurian

Here’s a dish that even the Chinese over on the mainland haven’t heard about. Snigger, snigger. Yet it’s on the menu of the roadside handcart Chinese food hawker and the Chinese restaurant in the fancy five-star hotel. Chicken manchurian, a phrase that has come to be the face of Chinese food in India, is nothing but deep-fried batter-coated chicken cubes in an onion, green chillies, garlic, vinegar and soy sauce gravy. Eaten with rice, it never fails to get a sigh of contentment from those partaking of this gastronomic oddity.

If you want to taste the real thing, try it where it was created, China Garden, Om Chambers, Kemps Corner. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2363 0841

12. Butter garlic crab

It doesn’t trace its roots to Chinese, Continental or Indian cuisines. It comes from Butter Land, an imagined place that thrives on the premise that anything tastes great with melted butter. A delicious, simple dish, a big crab is drowned in tons of butter garlic sauce that seeps into every nook and cranny and coats every morsel of the flesh. Crack open the crab and take a bite. You’ll know immediately that sweet crabmeat and butter with a twist of garlic is a combination made by gods.

The best butter garlic crab can be found at Mumbai’s most famous seafood restaurant. Trishna, Sai Baba Marg, Near Rhythm House, Kala Ghoda, Fort. Tel: +91 22 22703213

13. Dhoklas and farsaan

These popular snacks are so integral to food loving Gujaratis that no meal is complete without them. And when traveling abroad, they don’t leave home without a little parcel tucked away in their luggage. Dhoklas or‘khummun’are made from the fermented batter of chickpeas, steamed and then spiced with chillies and ginger and tempered with mustard seed. Farsan, a broad term for savories encompassing sev and gathiya are crisp deep-fried spiced gram flour creations in pasta like shapes.

Several stores stock these popular snacks. But try them here: Chedda Dry Fruits&amp;Snacks, 41 Ridge Road, Walkeshwar. Tel: +91 22 (0) 2369 9442. Dave Farsan Mart, 10 Babulnath Road, near Chowpatty. Tel: +91 (0) 22 6657 8311. Go-Go Snacks, Bhavan’s College Lane, Chowpatty. Tel: +91 22 (0) 2361 9968.

14. Falooda

This adaptation of a Persian dessert was brought to India by the Mughals. A rich drink, Falooda is vermicelli mixed with milk, almonds, pistachios, a bit of rose syrup and the key ingredient—sabza or basil seeds—topped up with two scoops of ice cream. Refreshing, rosy, energizing, it’s a great pick-me-up on a hot day.

Badshah, at 152/156 LT Marg, Opp. Crawford Market. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2342 1943, has a reputation for their falooda.

15. Fish and prawn curry

These two dishes are as old as Mumbai herself (remember, this city started off as a fishing village under various kings and sultanates until the Portuguese and English discovered it in 1534). This coconut-based light curry can be prepared using a variety of fish or prawn. But the most popular curries use surmai (kingfish), pomfret (butter fish), bangda (mackerel) or bombil (Bombay duck). And the only way to truly enjoy it is with par boiled country rice.

For Konkani and Malvani style fish curry  go to Sadichha, B-5 Gandhi Nagar, Opp. MIG Club, Bandra (E), Tel: +91 (0) 22 2651 0175. For Karwar style fish curry there’s Fresh Catch, Lt. Kotnis Marg, Near Fire Brigade, Off L J Road, Mahim (W). Tel: +91 (0) 22 2444 8942

16. Frankie

Inspired by the Lebanese pita bread wrap and suitably Indianized, the Frankie, or should I say the Tibbs Frankie, has satiated hordes of the hungry in search of a quick lip-smacking snack. Basically, it’s a juicy naan bread with an egg coating and stuffed with mutton or chicken, rolled up and sprinkled with a unique masala that gives it its special flavor. The vegetarian option does not use eggs and the stuffings include paneer or potatoes.

Available all over the city. For a Tibbs Frankie closest to you, call +91 (0) 22 2821 4698

17. Gujarati thaalis

In fast food terms think of this as a large, all-you-can-eat combo platter served on your table in unlimited quantities. Three types of farsan (fried snacky things with a plethora of chutneys). Two kinds of vegetables. Two kinds of lentils. Dal and kadhi (hot and spicy yoghurt based dish). A basket of different rotis and puris (deep fried breads). Two kinds of rice. Two desserts. And mango pulp which the purists pour all over the plate. All this for a modest price. Gasp! A note on Gujarati cuisine: most dishes tend to be on the sweet side and that makes an interesting combination with the spiciness of the food. Mumbaikers either love it or ignore it.

Try Golden Star Thali, 330 Raja Rammohan Roy Road, Opp. Charni Road Station, Girgaum, Tel: +91 (0) 22 2363 1983. Or, Chetana, 34 K Dubash Marg, Kala Ghoda, Fort. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2284 4968

18. Kheema pao

Minced mutton cooked with onions, garlic, tomatoes, chillies and spices takes on many avatars here. In its original form, it is refereed to as plain Kheema. Topped with a crisply fried sunny side up egg, it is called kheema single fry. And scrambled with eggs, it is called ghotala. And all three are best eaten with Mumbai’s signature pao bread bun. Traditionally a breakfast dish, it is now eaten at all times of the day or night.

Try it at Stadium Restaurant, IMC Building, Veer Nariman Road, Churchgate, Tel: +91 (0) 22 2204 6819. Or at Olympia, Rahim Mansion, 1 Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Colaba, Tel: +91 (0) 22 2202 1043.

19. Kebabs

While the kebab per se may not be unique to Mumbai or the region, a few varieties that emerged from the Bohri Muslim community are truly unique. Gurda (kidney) and kaleji (liver) top this list. Charcoal grilled, they go great with freshly sliced onions and a squeeze of lime.

Try it at Ayubs, on the street behind Rhythm House, Kala Ghoda, open only in the evenings. The best beef kebabs are to be found at Sarvi, 184/196 Dimtimkar Road, opposite Nagpada Police Station, Byculla (W). Tel: +91 9833 533 305. And for some outstanding north west frontier style Kebabs, go to Peshawari, ITC Grand Maratha, Sahar Road, Andheri (E), Tel: +91 (0) 22 2830 3030

20. Kolhapuri mutton

The hotter the temperature of a city, the hotter the food. And it’s true of this mutton dish that has its roots in Kolhapur, a city in the south of Maharashtra. It comes in two coconut based gravy variations. The nuclear strength version is called Tambda Rassa (a red chili spiced extravaganza). And the milder version is called Pandhara Rassa (yoghurt, cashew nuts and raisin embellished). Both go well with either rotis or rice when you’re in the mood for a feast.

Taste the heat at Purepur Kolhapur, 1, Aditya Apartments, Parleshwar Road, Parleshwar Mandir, Vile Parle (E). Tel: +91 (0) 22 2613 4569

21. Kanda poha

A must-have in Maharashtrian families, you will rarely find a badly made kanda poha dish. This simple, easy to make snack is made with kanda (onions) and poha (flaked rice) mixed with chopped potatoes and green chillies, sometimes even peas. Tempered with mustard seeds and garnished with fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, it lights up dull days. And cements the many days in a marriage together.

Try it at Aswad, L J Road, Opp. Shiv Sena Bhavan, Dadar (W). Tel: +91 (0) 22 2445 1871

22. Misal pao

Quintessentially from Pune, this rustic dish is made from a mix of curried sprouted lentils, topped with batata (potato) bhaji, poha (rice flakes), chivda, farsan, raw chopped onions and tomato. This hot and spicy dish is eaten with pao bread. To cut the fire, add some yogurt.

A good version can be found at Vinay Health Home, 71/83, Jawahar Mansion, Fanaswadi-Thakurdwar Corner, Girgaum. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2208 1211

23. Modak

A Maharashtrian sweet prepared during the Ganesh festival around August, modak is offered to Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, because it is his favorite sweet. Wheat flour dough kneaded with milk, stuffed with grated coconut and mixed with sugar or jaggery. Shaped like a teardrop and steamed or fried. Typically 21 are made as an auspicious offering to the god and tons more for the rest of the family. It’s a pity that it’s made only once a year and in this region.

Some sweet shops do keep modak during the festival season but it is made of khoya (thickened milk) and is not the real thing. For that, you’ll have to drop into a home that is celebrating the festival.

24. Mutton dhansak

Representative of Parsi cuisine, the mutton dhansak falls in the category of soul food. It is mutton cooked till tender in a lentil dal laden with spices. And it is eaten with browned rice topped with deep fried onions, garnished with mutton kebabs and sprinkled with a crunchy mix of chopped raw onions, raw tomatoes and coriander. And the aftereffects are usually exhibited in a sound afternoon nap.

This rich dish, outside of a home, is best had at Ripon Club, 123A MG Road, Opp. Bombay University, Fountain. Find a member to take you there. Failing which, go to Britannia, Wakefield House, 11 Sprott Road, Ballard Estate. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2261 5264

25. Mutton sukke

Mumbaikers break out into sweat over this Malvani-style mutton dish. Chunks of mutton on the bone marinated in a hot Malvani masala and fried with onions and garlic and red chillies until everything browns and the meat is tender. It can be eaten with chapattis or wadé, rice flour pancakes.

Try it at Jai Hind Lunch Home, 6 Mantri Corner, Gokhale Road South, Dadar. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2431 4256

26. Patra ni machhi

Another top of the line Parsi dish. This is freshly caught pomfret, marinated in a chutney that includes grated coconut, green chillies, fresh coriander and mint leaves, cumin, sugar, lime and salt. It is then wrapped in banana leaf and steamed for about ten minutes. Gently unwrap and consume quietly, close your eyes and savor the flavor of a culinary culture that will fill your senses.

A very good patra ni machhi can be had at Ideal Corner, 12/F/G, Hornby View, Gunbow Street, Fort. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2262 1930. Only available on Saturdays.

27. Pao bhaji

This specialty dish from the by-lanes of Mumbai has mashed steamed mixed vegetables (mainly potatoes, peas, tomatoes, onions and green pepper) cooked in spices and loads of butter. It is eaten with pao, which is shallow fried in even more butter and served with chopped onions. Sometimes cheese and paneer (cottage cheese) are added. People from all over India come to Mumbai to eat pao bhaji.

Though widely available at local restaurants, try the sinful pao bhaji at Sardar, 166A Tardeo Road Junction, Opp. Bus Depot, Tardeo. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2353 0208

28. Prawns koliwada

Contrary to popular belief that this dish originated on the Konkan coast, it is actually a very Mumbai dish and the story goes that it was created in the Sion fishing village, or koliwada, by—and here’s the twist—a north Indian immigrant from Punjab. These deep-fried prawns marinated in a batter of flour, spices and ginger garlic paste can be identified by their signature red color. And they are crunchy yet melt in the mouth. Pick the smaller sized prawns, they taste better.

Try the real thing at Hazara, GTB Nagar, Near the Gurudwara, Sion (W). Tel: +91 (0) 22 2409 2617

29. Nalli nihari

The phrase“breakfast like a king”gets taken to another level when you dig into a plate of Muslim nalli nihari. You could probably fight a war after this power meal made of soft and tender mutton shanks in a rich, greasy gravy filled with marrow and steeped in spices, the flavors exploding with delight. A crisp roti makes for the perfect accompaniment. Can you stomach this for breakfast?

The best Nalli Nihari can be had at Noor Mohammadi, 179 Wazir Building, Abdul Hakim Noor Mohammadi Chowk, Bhendi Bazaar. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2347 6188. Just make sure you reach before noon or you may leave disappointed.

30. Puran poli

A festive dish made by Maharashtrians and Gujaratis especially during Holi (to celebrate the end of the winter season) and Dussehra (to celebrate the triumph of Lord Ram over the demon Raavan). It is made by simmering chana dal (yellow gram) with sugar or jaggery (molasses or gur) till it dries up, and then hand-ground to smoothen it out. Nutmeg and cardamom powders are the flavorings. Palm sized balls of this paste are stuffed into wheat flour dough and rolled out to be roasted on a tawa frying pan with a little ghee (clarified butter). Do add a lot of ghee when you’re eating them, they taste tops then.

Puran polis can be found in some grocery stores but they are a poor mass produced version of the real thing. The real ones can only be found in a Maharashtrian or Gujarati home.

31. Ragda pattice

This twin delight is a combination of ragda, soft spicy rugged flavored chickpeas, and pattice, mashed potatoes shaped into fat patties and fried. The ideal way is to eat it is to crush the ragda with the pattice and pile on the accompaniments—finely chopped onions, tangy tamarind sauce and fiery green chutney. Mash it all up and dig in for the true flavor of Mumbai.

A favorite street food, it is part of the chaat family and is commonly found all over. A good place to try it is Kailash Parbat, Sheela Mahal, 1st Pasta Lane, Colaba. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2284 1972

32. Sabudana vada

For Maharashtrians, sabudana vada is the traditional‘upvas’or fasting food and the really hardcore folk fast up to four times a week. And the good news is that the restaurants never fail to oblige with hot crisp sabudana vadas for those who don’t have the time to make it at home. Sago is soaked until it puffs up. Crushed boiled potatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves and salt are kneaded in. They are then fashioned into palm-sized patties and deep fried until they turn crisp and golden. And then one bite leads to another and another.

Sabudana vadas are available at most Udipi hotels and roadside stalls. But try the ones at the R K Studio Canteen, Chembur. They are really special.

33. Samosa

It’s best to bite into a hot one, hiding under a street stall during a typical Mumbai monsoon downpour. When you go through the crisp crust, you meet the steaming and savory-with-a-hint-of-sour chunks of spiced potatoes and peas. Lovingly shaped into triangles and deep fried, these calorie busters are worth the one week that you’ll need on the treadmill to work it off. But a samosa can also give you heart at that last leg of your day when transport is not in sight, it’s dark and there’s a long way home.

You can ask for Guru Kripa samosas at many stores across Mumbai. Or go to the original Guru Kripa Hotel, 40, Guru Kripa Building, near SIES College, Sion. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2407 1237

34. Sizzlers

As kids, a sizzler was part of the“growing up in Mumbai”experience. The sight of a sizzler arriving at your table, like an old steam engine, sizzling and steaming and spluttering to a halt in front of you, was an exciting experience. A combination of grilled meats and vegetables served on what looks like a hot chunk of black iron, with a side of mashed potatoes or fries and gravy. Sizzlers come in several vegetarian options too. Long lines at restaurants are a testimony to its enduring popularity.

Give sizzlers a try at places synonymous with the word. Such as Kobe, 13/14 Sukh Sagar, Hughes Road, Opera House. Tel: +91 (0) 22 23632174. Or Yoko, West View, S V Road, near Akbarally’s, Santacruz (W). Tel: +91 (0) 22 2649 2313

35. Sorpatel and vindaloo

These Goan specialties set your taste buds on fire and grandmothers are rumored to pass out feni shots (a strong Goan brew made from palm or cashew nuts) to douse the flames. The sorpatel has all parts of the pig, including its blood, in the recipe. And the vindaloo is made with chunks of fatty pork meat cooked with spices, red chillies and lots of vinegar. Ideally, they are eaten the next day, after having spent the night soaking in all the juices and flavors.

Try sorpatel, vindaloo and other Goan delicacies at City Kitchen, 301 Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Fort. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2261 0002. Or, New Martin Hotel, 11 Glamour House, Strand Cinema Road, Colaba. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2202 9606

36. South Indian‘meals’

“Meals Ready”is a common sign found outside South Indian restaurants. In front of Udipi hotels, a euphemism for all south Indian cuisine, it means vegetarian meals laid out on a thaali, a stainless steel plate, or on a traditional banana leaf. A couple of vegetables, sambar (spicy and sour lentils and vegetables boiled with masalas and spices), rasam (a hot and fiery lentil soup-like dish) and curds (yoghurt) served with heaps of rice and eaten in that order. A non-vegetarian version of the‘Meals’can be found in‘Military’hotels.

Try the‘meals’at this 68-year-old haven: Rama Nayak’s Udipi Shree Krishna Boarding, bang outside the Matunga (E) station. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2414 2422

37. Zhunka bhakar

This dish has deep roots in the farming and working class communities of interior Maharashtra. Considered the common man’s food, a political decision was made at the highest echelons of government to make it available everywhere. Overnight, thousands of zhunka bhakar stalls opened, none pricing it more than Rs 10. Traditionally, the zhunka is made using chopped onions tempered with mustard seeds and kadipatta leaves mixed with chickpea flour and is dry. It is eaten with jowar (millet) bhakri or roti.

Try the stalls opposite Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (originally called Victoria Terminus) and BMC Headquarters.

38. Varan bhaat

If you wanted to name one truly soul satisfying food of Mumbai city, then this would be it. The simple and truly humble dish is made by lightly tempering cooked-till-soft toor dal (a lentil) with ghee (clarified butter), turmeric and cumin powder. Served over steaming hot rice, or bhaat, it assumes magical, mythical proportions.

A staple in Maharashtrian homes, that’s really where you should be eating it. But do give Diva Maharashtracha a try. T H Kataria Marg, Mahim. Tel: +91 (0) 22 2445 4433.

39. South Indian tiffin (idlis and vadas)

What started as tiffin in British India—a light meal that was had between meals—has become a rage all over the country. And especially in hard working Mumbai. Here you will find a South Indian tiffin available every half a kilometer and at any time of day or night. These steamed (idlis) or fried (vadas) dumplings made with multi-grain lentil batter are best scooped up with coconut chutney or dunked into hot sambar (spicy and sour lentil and vegetable soup, boiled with masalas and spices).

The finest South Indian Tiffin can be found at Madras Café (+91 (0) 22 2401 4419), Anand Bhavan (+91 (0) 22 2401 5745) and Idli House (+91 (0) 22 3246 0111), all located around King’s Circle, Matunga.

40. Vada pao

In the vast fast food world of Mumbai, this is the tastiest“cutlet in a bun”by a mile. And no, it’s not available at McDonald’s. Every Mumbaiker’s favorite on-the-go snack, the vada pao satiates millions every day. And the recipe, hard to duplicate because each stall owner has his own secret ingredient, uses a combination of boiled potatoes mashed with fresh coriander, green chillies, a bit of ginger and sometimes garlic, made into palm-sized balls, dipped in a chickpea flour batter and deep fried till golden. They are stuffed into a pao, which has been applied with a layer of spicy green chutney and a fiery red garlic crush. Tastes best when eaten hot.

It’s a crime to eat vada pao anywhere else but on the street. Try Ashok Satam’s Stall, on the Flora Fountain side of the Central Telegraph Office (CTO), Fort.

 Mumbai’s 10 best new restaurants in 2010 –The only thing we don’t like about these 10 best breaks from dal sabzi is booking in advance

From the hottest table and most coveted seat, to the sexiest starter and most enticing soundtrack, CNNGo replays the year in restaurants, bringing you the best of what’s arrived on Mumbai’s culinary circuit in 2010.

1. KOH by Ian Kittichai, Marine Drive

There are several reasons to take your date to KOH, InterContinental Marine Drive’s sexy new Thai restaurant. It’s all slick black surfaces and plush leather with accents of purple, yellow and blue; you can’t help but start your night at the curved bar that’s right by the entrance; and you get to share sizzling stone rice for two, half cooked at your table over lava stone. Definitely the hottest table in the city.

Manned by Ian Kittichai, celebrity chef with successful projects in New York, Barcelona and Bangkok, dining here feels like a night out at a tony lounge in the Meat Packing District, complete with neon pink lights and metallic ceilings. Add to that impeccable service and food that gets progressively better with every course (Chai Mai soup – rice cakes – green curry–luscious coconut cheesecake), and KOH could easily be one of 2010′s best moments.

InterContinental Marine Drive; tel. +91 (0) 22 3987 9999; www.ianchalermkittichai.com

2. Fifty Five East, Santacruz

You should probably wear comfortable shoes to Fifty Five East, the Grand Hyatt’s new restaurant that requires diners to traipse from one“show kitchen”to the next, picking from about a hundred dishes that warrant frequent return trips. Are you being served? Not here.

Bright lights beam through laser cut ceilings and rows of LCD panels will keep you looking alive, as you walk around the 6,500 square foot space decorated by Super Potato, the Japanese interiors firm that did Wink and China House. While the food selection is random—Lebanese, Japanese, Thai, Indian and Western Grills—most dishes are tasty. Charm the chefs at the live counters and you may just be able to take a recipe home.

Grand Hyatt, off Western Express Highway, Santacruz (East); tel. +91 (0) 22 6676 1149, open for breakfast, lunch and dinner; www.mumbai.grand.hyatt.com

3. Indigo Deli, Lower Parel

Lower Parel’s modern-day mill workers suited up for Indigo Deli’s second outpost when it opened up at Palladium this year. But then, so did shoppers from the mall, mothers lunching with their daughters and loads of solo lunch regulars.

Now, all sets of diners happily co-exist at Malini and Rahul Akerkar’s latest restaurant, making it close to impossible to get a table here without calling ahead. And often even that can’t guarantee you a seat. Dig into bacon and cheese beef burgers at lunch time, console yourself after a tough day with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and buy truffle oil on your way out.

Palladium Mall, Phoenix Mills, Lower Parel; tel. +91 (0) 22 2498 6262; www.indigodeli.com

4. Two One Two Bar and Grill, Worli

It was a waste of 4,000 square feet of prime Worli space, that unremarkable resto-lounge called Magick, deserted on most nights. It’s lucky that life gave it a second chance, one that resulted in an Italian restaurant where a Milanese chef bakes Camembert, sears tenderloin and tuna to perfection and successful 30-somethings sip on wine and sometimes, mushroom cappuccino soup.

Co-owned by Fire n’Ice’s Ketan Kadam and three other guys who named Two One Two after the temperature at which water boils, this mid-town eatery is mostly defined by woody interiors, high back chairs, luxurious couches and an additional al fresco section. In a zip code devoid of hip dining options (Copper Chimney is too old-school and Don Giovani shut down), chef Alex Bignotti’s Two One Two is perfect for an interesting ultra urban dining experience.

12 A, Hornby Vellard Estate, on the same road as Nehru Centre, Worli; tel. +91 9920838529 / +91 (0) 22 24901994; Facebook group

5. Pali Village Café, Bandra

It’s hard to pull off crumbly cool decor and a wine-only menu, but the young couple that owns and runs Pali Village Café have done it well. Peeling walls, old fans, foldable, rusty steel chairs, empty cages and paper menus define one of the most popular new restaurants this side of the sealink.

Despite the super slow service and small portions that everyone loves to crib about, here, in the glassed-in courtyard space and along art deco balconies surrounded by green plants and quirky music, Bandra’s creative and Bollywood lot sip on melon Sula sangria and eat wafer-thin pizza and pannacotta to the soundtrack of Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Check your case of the blues in at the door.

Pali Village Café, next to Janata Bar and Restaurant, Pali Naka, Bandra (W); tel. +91 (0) 22 26050401

6. Ziya, Nariman Point

Ziya was among a handful of restaurants that created a big buzz before it launched, and managed to live up to the hype. Housed in the Oberoi Hotel, Ziya is the second new Mumbai restaurant from Michelin-starred chef Vineet Bhatia. His other is Azok, which also serves contemporary Indian cuisine.

Indian recipes get the royal treatment at this gold and cream hued restaurant. The result? An imaginative menu that relegates staples like black dal and paneer makhani to the accompaniments section, making room for the more twisted and new school uttampam lasagna and tandoori chicken dosa.

A quick and painless (read less expensive) way of doing Ziya is by ordering the express meal which includes soup, fritters, chicken or vegetarian dosa and dessert; at Rs 1,300, it’s a better deal.

Ziya, Oberoi Hotel, Nariman Point; tel. +91 (0) 22 6632 4343; www.oberoihotels.com

7. Villa 39, Colaba

In the chaotic Colaba district populated by junk shoppers and bar hoppers, Villa 39 is a great place for the fine diner to fit in.

A vision in creamy white, this Italian restaurant forms a clean canvas for dramatic chandeliers, brightly hued Sangria Romano and flamboyant food. It may not get everything on its ambitious menu right, but try the Terrina di Mozzarella Caprese, Spiedini di Pollo and Gnocchi alla Piemontese.

The bar area is quickly growing into a coveted townie weekend spot where seats are hard to come by.

Amarchand Mansion, 60 Madam Cama Road, Colaba; tel. +91 (0) 22 6657 3939; Facebook group

8. Trilogy, Juhu

Its launch may have seemed over the top—the luxurious red carpet, strict door policy, hand-picked celebrity guests and VIP section with waist-high champagne flutes—but the suburban dancers knew it was reason to celebrate. Finally, a real night club on the north side!

Trilogy is a two-tiered, sea-facing club, bar and lounge housed inside Juhu’s Sea Princess Hotel and is the second production by the Tham brothers, the first being Colaba’s Henry Tham. Mumbaikers will know that means more yum Pan Asian food—get the sushi and batter-fried chicken supported by a range of bright and expensive cocktails served by fedora-wearing bartenders. Also worth checking out: The psychedelic light installation on the ceiling and Trilogy’s smoking room with a view. If you manage to keep from choking, that is.

Hotel Sea Princess, Juhu Tara Road, Santacruz (W); tel. +91 (0) 22  2646 9500

9. Veda, Lower Parel

We snuck into this yet-to-open Indian restaurant at the Palladium to find opulent splashes of color, operatic chandeliers and intricate baroque detailing.

Veda, a New Delhi establishment by fashion couturier Rohit Bal and restaurateur Alok Aggarwal, is all set to launch its first Mumbai outpost next week. The original got listed by Conde Nast Traveler magazine as being among the 100 best restaurants in the world, mostly for the rich Indian bridal kitsch it symbolizes and in the land of Bollywood it could work as well.

If the interiors are anything to go by, it’s capital gains for Mumbai.

S 8, Palladium, Phoenix Mills compound, Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel, tel. +91 (0) 22 2490 0055; www.vedarestaurants.com

10. Chez Vous, Churchgate

French food in Mumbai! Enough said. Replacing Churchgate’s iconic Sundance Café, Chez Vous will be Mumbai’s first French bistro and will serve authentic cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is a joint collaboration between head chef Cedric Combe, Satyen Melwani and Frederic Fernandez, who thinks that Mumbai is now ready for escargot and more.

Visit this black, white and absinthe green space (spread over 1,342 square feet) for lunch, and you can choose from a prix fixe menu with over 15 rotating dishes, while dinner is a la carte all the way.

Personally, co-owner Fernandez can’t wait to scarf down the avocado and goat cheese appetiser, as well as the crab creole. What excites us most is the extensive wine list, 60 percent of which is exclusive to the restaurant, and he suggests falling in love with Paris Je t’aime—a potent combination of champagne and absinthe. Parfait!

Ground floor, Eros Cinema building, Churchgate; slated to open October 22.

 Count before you eat. But how?

Tell me one thing…

Seriously, wokay?

When people ask you, ‘What is your daily calorie intake count?’

How do you answer? And what do you answer?

Not that I feel like being answerable for the food that I eat. But still I am curious.

And what happens when people count and eat? One gram of X has Y amount of calories. How-how-how do you manage to count and eat? I am quite intrigued to know the process that goes into it. Do you also get to enjoy every morsel of food that you put in your mouth or is it the just the brain working overtime doing calorie math?

Assuming you eat a typical Gujarati Thali with an assortment of curries, veggies, lentils, Indian breads and sweets thrown in, then how do we do the math?

How about a typical Indian Dosa with the accompanying chutney and sambhar?

Chronicles of PA#1

This is were PA turns into a 50′s style housewife.

And sings Raag Bhayankar.

PA needs to go and buy vegetables from the bhaaji market. Something that she has never done before. She has been to the bhaaji market a couple of times before, albeit hardly ever alone. It’s usually with Mom. But she is petrified of going alone. But she has to. What needs to be done, needs to be done. She also needs to run other errands and accomplish other gharelu tasks which albeit need to be accomplished outside the house, like getting milk, going to the temple and giving daan/donation, etc.

PA being PA needs a chronological order in which she needs to do all this. Some sort of a flowchart would rather be preferable, she thinks. However Mom refuses to fulfill this wish of hers, instead offers her a chronological order which PA needs to mentally make a note of, so insists the mother.

The mother also gives PA important pointers which will help her in doing the task at hand efficiently.

Instructions given to PA:

1. Take a wallet which has the required cash handy in it. Keep chutta/chillar/loose cash/coins separately. (Tips from PA–Yes, PA also gives tips–Chillar plays an important part if you intend to play the household types, the 50′s style)

2. Carry wallet, shopping bag (as plastic bags of the flimsy kinds are banned) and some other food items in a separate bag which need to be donated at the temple.

3. Once outside the house–Go to ABC bania shop and buy x number of y packets of biscuits. How much would each cost, PA asks just so that she knows where she is heading in life err…in her mission. Well, PA needs to know the cost implications beforehand, nah? Anyways, z is the amount that she needs to pay the bania for the said number of biscuit packets. Good, PA thinks, now she won’t have to do mathematical calculations in front of the bania else she might forget the other gharelu-shopping instructions.

4. Place the packets of biscuits in the bag containing the other food items which need to be donated.

5. Go to the temple and give the donation wala bag–basically anna daan to any needy person or beggar sitting outside the temple. Important pointer by Mom–Make sure you give this donation to a needy person outside the temple and NOT to any visitor who is visiting the temple for darshan and certainly not to any passer-by. Knowing PA’s lost-mindedness, this is indeed a very important and crucial point. Imagine what would happen if you give daan to any random person??? Also another important point, make sure that you don’t stand there for long as other beggars would mob you and take care of your wallet and mobile at this time. Beggars would mob PA?!!! Kya din aa gaye hain!

6. Once done with Step 5, walk a few steps ahead of the temple, you will notice a nariyal-wala…err coconut wala. Next to it would be OUR bhaajiwala–the baajiwala that we usually buy fresh vegetables from and next to it would be the fruitwala. PA tries to ratofy, so our bhaajiwala is basically between the nariyal-wala and the fruit-wala. Repeat thrice. Done.

7. Go to OUR bhaajiwala and tell him to give you 1 Kilo of Tomatoes, Half Kilo Dhoodhi and Pao Kilo Bhindi. Tell him you are xyz Aunty’s daughter and he will recollect, so says the mom.  You can then choose the required vegetables from the lot yourself or tell the bhaajiwala to do the needful in case you are confused. PA anyways prefers the later. Tell him to keep the stuff ready while you do the rest of the shopping. Haan, we are anyways his regular customer. Itna toh karna hee chahiye, nah? And tell him to sort the tomatoes, dhoodhi and bhindi of the kinds that xyz aunty usually buys.

Question time for PA: Whats Dhoodhi? Whats Pao? She gets a demonstration for Dhoodhi. Now whats Pao?! 250gms, my lovelies Now ratofication time: Tomatoes, Dhoodhi, Bhindi–One, Half, Pao…that’s the order. Important pointer by Mom–Make sure that you call‘dhoodhi’a‘dhoodhi’only in front of the bhaajiwala, he wouldn’t understand otherwise. Don’t call it by the various other names or nick names that you have bestowed on it. Pointed to be noted, mere aakaa. PA also makes a mental note of the approximate amount that she would need to pay the bhaajiwala depending on the current market price of the said vegetables.

8. Once you’ve placed the order with the Bhaajiwala and instructed him to do the needful, its then time to buy Potatoes from the potatao-wala. Now where the hell is the potato wala??? PA wonders aloud. Behind the Fruit-wala. Oh ya, refer step6. Behind the fruitwala is MNO shop…Alright I need to buy Potatoes from MNO shop, PA interrupts. Noooooooooooo, says Mom…MNO is a salon!!! The Potato wala is behind the fruitwala and infront of this MNO shop. Okay, don’t go in to this MNO salon asking for potatoes, PA tells herself.

How much do I need to pay the potato wala, PA asks.

Rs. X, says Mom.

Rs. X per potato?

Noooooooooooo, Rs. X for the one kilo of potatoes, NOT PER POTATO. Else people around the city would be eating vada-pavs for a 100!!!!

Err.

9. Once you go to the potato-wala, you will see two varieties of potatoes. Here manual sorting is required. Choose potatoes from the better of the two qualities, the one which is slightly more expensive than the other. Well, how do I do the manual sorting, so asks PA. How may potatoes do I need to choose via this manual sorting, asks PA. One kilo. How much will be one kilo potato? You’ll know by andaaza. Err…what is andaaza…you tell me by quantity. Approximately n number of potatoes. Good I can never get this andaaza thingy ever!!!

Here there is a three step process in choosing the right potato: 1. It shouldn’t be too soft else it will go bad easily and soon. 2. It shouldn’t have too many holes in it. 3. It shouldn’t have green patches in it else it will be too kacca. Rehearsed -1,2,3…done. Sort and put these potatoes in a tokri and get 1 Kg of these. Okay.

Pay the potato-wala. Get these potatoes in the shopping bag you that you have taken from home.

10. Once done with the potatoes, come back to the bhaajiwala and collect the vegetables that you has told him to keep ready. Make sure that you tell him to put extra masala. Err…masala? Whats that? Free dhaniya, ginger, mirchi etc. He knows‘masala’. You don’t need to explain him that. Good.

11. Then go to DEF milk shop. If that is closed go to PQR milk shop. And get half a litre of milk for giving it in the temple tomorrow morning.

12. And then come back home.

And this is what eventually transpired when PA was out on her gharelu mission:

Step1: As instructed. Ekdum.

Step2: As instructed. Ekdum ekdum.

Step3: At the bania shop–PA sees a man taking a walk inside the shop. She wonders if he is a customer or is he The Bania. She thinks of the repercussions if she asks the man for biscuits and he turns out to be a customer. Aap owner…err dukandaar ho kya, PA asks just to be on the safer side. Yes, he says. Good. And buys the biscuits.

Step4: As instructed. Ekdum *multiply by* 4

Step5: PA was petrified of this Step. The word M.O.B was playing Raag Bhayankar in her mind. Also PA had to be extra careful and cautious that she doesn’t give the daan to a temple visitor or a passer-by. It had to be a needy person. PA had scenes cropping up in her mind of giving daan to a temple visitor and the embarrassing looks on either faces. What if the other person uttered some not so nice words. PA needs to be extraaaa careful. Very careful. She carefully scans the crowd outside the temple. Locates and urchin kid and hands him the entire bag of daan. And moves away swiftly before the other beggars and urchin locate her and pounce on her! Done with Step5 safely.

Step6: Locates OUR bhaajiwala and grins at herself.

Step7: PA walks up to the bhaaji wala, smiles at him (why did PA smile at him, even I wonder) and tells him–ek kilo tamatar, aadha kilo dhoodhi aur pao kilo bhindi in the tone of an expert. Bhaaji wala smiles back at her. Err too many smile exchanges. Why do I need to smile so much in the bhaaji market…Its after all just a bhaaji market. Need to keep a check on that. Aap yeh sab bhaaji nikal ke rakho…main xyx aunty ki beti hoon…unke regular tarah se pack kar ke rakho…tamatar ache aur lal, bhindi choti size ki aur dhoodhi ummmm…. errr…. acchi wali. Aaap yeh sab nikal ke rakho main paanch minute mein aati hoon. Done with Step7, finally!!!!

Step8&amp;9: Located potato-wala. Thankfully didn’t go inside the salon and ask for potatoes! Thank God for that! At the potato wala, a lot of women in their 40′s were sorting and choosing potatoes. Err…why am I here? Anyways, PA tries to see if she can squeeze in somewhere, stand aaramse and sort+choose potatoes. Par aisa toh hota nahin hai, PA observes. So, she squeezes herself and stands between two 40-ish women who were totally engrossed with the sorting and choosing. PA looks at each one of them. They look back at her. Well by now they had guessed that PA was about to take baby steps in the art of potato sorting-choosing-buying. PA observed their procedure and along with the 3 pointers given by mom, did the sorting and choosing and kept the potatoes in the tokri. And hands over the tokri to the dukhandaar. Ek kilo, she says. Do kilo, he says. Nahin nahin mujhe ek kilo hee chahiye, PA says. Par aapne tokri mein do kilo daala hai, toh de doon kya? Nahin, PA says. Takes one kilo, pays him and does away with Step8

Quantity‘n’went for a toss as that depends on the potato size. Lesson1 of the day. A woman pushed PA with her bums at the potato wala and didn’t even say sorry. There is no time for sorries in the bhaaji market. Lesson2. Bhaaji market mein bhi koi sorry bolta hai kya!

Step10: Went back to the bhaaji wala and collected the vegetables. Told him to add masala. Dhaniya daala? Ginger daala? Hari mirch daala? Err…. baaki sab daal, PA asks. Yes he says and waves a green jhaadi at me. Yeh bhi daalon kya? Haan haan daal do. PA didn’t have any clue as to what that small green jhaadi was until she came home. It was the kari patta, by the way. I get confused with all these pattas!

I ask him how much only to realize that he has also accounted for the‘masala’instead of giving it free. PA should have asked for the free‘masala’AFTER doing the payment. Very important lesson of the day. The great indian housewife is someone who is able to extract these freebies from bhaajiwalas. Aha! Pleasures of doing grocery shopping in the bhaaji market. Something that you can never experience in the malls. A first for me…even though I failed at it miserably.

And blunder of blunders–I snap back at the bhaajiwala…OUR bhaajiwala and tell him in front of some 7-8 other customers of his that yeh masala toh aap hamesha bhaaji ke saath free dete ho! He grinned back sheepishly at me. He had no other choice. PA realized that thsi is actually an art…the art of vegetable buying and the art of getting the best deal as well as freebies. Never ever talk about best prices and freebies in front of other customers. Never ever. Thats harakiri. Good that the bhaajiwala didn’t murder me!

Step11: Thankfully milk is available at DEF milk shop else she would have had to walk down to the other one! Doodh hai? Aadha litre wala? (PA was about to aadha kilo dhoodh…thankfully she realized before the words could reach the shop-wala’s ears. Haan madam. Kaunsa chahiye? Koi bhi de do. He keeps 2-3 packets in front of me. All were of the same price so PA choses the one which was more fancier looking. Err…what else! Pays him, places the milk packet aaramse in the shopping bag and heads home.

Step12: PA reaches home safely.

Thus ends PA’s maiden gharelu maha-puraan.
