 Case Study: A Seasonal Business Aims to Survive the Off-Season

 Indian Tacos!!! 
 Hilah Cooking Hilah 10 Jul 2012 | 12:24 pm Indian tacos AKA Navajo tacos are like tacos but made with Indian frybread (AKA Navajo frybread) in place of the tortilla. They are drop-dead delicious. (And pretty much drop-dead unhealthy due to the frying and the, uh…all the frying.) They were invented in the 1860s by the Navajo after their“relocation”by the US government.“Relocation”seems like a nice word for it, but it was not nice. They were forced at gunpoint to walk 450 miles to an overcrowded internment camp. Rations of wheat flour, powdered milk, and lard were supplied. Indian Frybread was the…

 Hand Blender Salad Dressing 
 Amateur Gourmet Adam Roberts 10 Jul 2012 | 10:44 am Ever since I made that 60 second aioli, I’ve been thinking a lot about hand blenders. Ferran Adria, one of the world’s great chefs, uses a hand blender; that was his aioli recipe, after all. If a chef of his stature uses a hand blender, surely there must be something to it. Off the top of my head: it’s easier to clean than a regular blender. Whatever vessel you use for blending (a nice big jar, for example) can also be used for serving. Because you can move it around, you can make sure that you blend every last bit. It works better for smaller quantities. Plus: it’s…

 Mayflower bartender Sambonn Lek to leave U.S. 
 Tim Carman 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am Last year, bartender Sambonn Lek said goodbye to the Town&amp;Country Lounge, where he had calmed more frayed nerves than a therapy dog, before the Mayflower Renaissance Hotel closed and replaced the outdated bar. On Friday, the Cambodian native will say goodbye to the Mayflower — and to the United States, where he has, for more than 35 years, mixed drinks for some of his adopted country’s most powerful residents.

 Pie’s emotional ingredient 
 Cara Kelly 11 Jul 2012 | 11:54 am Few foods in the United States elicit as much emotion as pie. The classic dessert is as deeply woven into Americana as faded Levi’s and McDonald’s arches.

 How To Cook Fish For A Crowd 
 Adam Roberts 11 Jul 2012 | 10:11 am Our friend Emily (who also happens to be Craig’s awesome manager; she’s in the apron on the right) had us over for dinner the other night and she pulled off something I would never be brave enough to attempt at a dinner party: she cooked us fish. Fish is so tricky and temperamental, I’m nervous just to cook it for myself, let alone a crowd of people. I’ve seared fish in a pan, I’ve broiled fish in the oven. These techniques work fine for one or two, but for four? Five? Six? What do you do? Emily had the perfect solution. And it was such a smart solution, I plan…

 Hummus For Dinner 
 Adam Roberts 9 Jul 2012 | 11:16 am Hummus is many things: a party snack, a sandwich filler, a way to use up leftover chickpeas. But dinner? Hummus for dinner? Preposterous! Hey: I understand where you’re coming from. Hummus is a glorified dip and who eats dip for dinner? But ever since I left New York, I’ve been missing my lunches at Hummus Place in the West Village. So last Monday, for dinner, I decided to recreate my regular lunchtime Hummus Place meal, only this time it would be for dinner. Click here to read the rest of this Amateur Gourmet post» 
 Blue Plate Oysterette 
 Adam Roberts 5 Jul 2012 | 11:24 am See the way the light is hitting the white wine in my glass? That’s a summer moment, a California moment; it’s a moment that transcends anything critical I might say about the restaurant where this moment took place. Not that I have anything critical to say. Blue Plate Oysterette is situated on Ocean Blvd. in Santa Monica and if you took this same restaurant and relocated it to a shopping mall in Minnesota, you would think it had no reason to exist. And you would be right. But sitting there in Santa Monica, as it is, facing the Pacific ocean, the sun hitting it on its way down in…

 Chinese Spring Rolls with Chicken 
 SteamyKitchen 10 Jul 2012 | 10:20 pm How authentic Chinese Spring Rolls* should be: smooth, light, crisp-crackly skin and small enough to enjoy in 4 bites. The filling is also light, full of tender-crisp vegetables and you should be able to taste and distinguish every single ingredient in the filling.Unfortunately, the only time you can find really awesome Chinese spring rolls are when you make them at home, Chinatown restaurants or at my Mom’s house *Spring Rolls or Egg Rolls? Well, either one is fine. Some people call these crispy fried rolls“Spring Rolls”and others, like my Mom, refer to them as“Egg… 
 Introducing Steamy Kitchen Wok and Rice Bran Oil! 
 SteamyKitchen 6 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am One of the most asked questions I get is,“what kind of wok do you recommend?”To me, the perfect wok has to be:- easy to cook with, easy to clean- made of cast iron material for superior heat retention, but light enough to lift with one hand- enamel on the outside so that it wouldn’t scratch the stovetop surface- friendly for gas, electric, glasstop and induction stovetops- glass lid so I can see what’s going on in the wok- steamer rack insertAll of these qualities were a must for the perfect wok. Since I couldn’t find one on the market, I designed one myself… 
 Pork Belly Buns Recipe 
 SteamyKitchen 2 Jul 2012 | 5:30 am Pork Belly Buns is probably one of the biggest Asian food fads to hit American palates, right next to Korean Tacos and Bo-Ba Tea. It’s no surprise, since since pork belly is essentially where the much-loved bacon comes from. Slow-cooked pork belly is sliced and simmered in a sweet-savory Vietnamese caramel sauce and sandwiched between soft, pillowy steamed buns. But it doesn’t stop there–a hit of spice comes from kimchi and flash-fry of fresh chilies and green onions.My version of Pork Belly Buns is sort of a mashup between three cultures: Vietnamese caramel braising…

If I think“Chicago”, I immediately remember Grant Achatz painting our table with candy gems, fruit baubles and sweet jams.Tomorrow, I’m heading back to Chi-town to speak at a food blogger event hosted by Verizon Wireless. Included in the trip is a free evening the day I arrive (can I sneak into Alinea? will they notice if I don an apron and pose as staff? can I hide under someone’s table?) and a super-secret supper that I… 
 How to cook perfect rice in the microwave 
 SteamyKitchen 25 Jun 2012 | 11:05 am We used to live in planned community before we moved out here on our homestead. It was one of those neighborhoods where you signed a contract stating that your mulch will never be less than 6″deep. We got a letter once that we were in violation of contract. someone actually TOOK A RULER TO OUR MULCH. Who has that much time, really!?When we designed that house, we were given a palette to choose from for our paint colors, inside and out, carpet colors, countertop colors and cabinet colors. We had flown in to do the design session, so we only had a few hours to plan the entire house. Such…

 MOTOism: Blueberry Mochi 
 Moto 10 Jul 2012 | 10:20 am Hi, welcome to my new column, MOTOism. I’ll mostly be cooking here, as always, with the occasional restaurant rant, to keep everyone on their toes. It’s summer, it’s hot, and it’s time to make an easy dessert that doesn’t boil the kitchen. Over the weekend, I made batches of macarons, but I still haven’t figured out my new oven so most of them were disastrous.  Plus the turning oven on when it’s 90˚F outside is pretty stupid. I had some friends over and needed a simple dessert that doesn’t require baking, and I had shiratama-ko in the pantry,… 
 Forest Feast: Postcard from New York 
 Kayoko 9 Jul 2012 | 8:32 am I just got back from the most lovely weekend in New York City. A dear friend from college is getting married this summer so we threw her a “Spice Shower” dinner party in our friend’s backyard in Brooklyn. It was a warm evening so we passed out fans (which we needed!!) and served summery drinks. We made Basil Lemon Cocktails with basil syrup, vodka or gin, seltzer and a lemon slice (for the basil syrup, just make some simple syrup and toss it in the blender with fresh basil). Each guest brought a different spice in a jar and a favorite recipe to go with it for our bride-to-be. We served…

Like the Americano highball I wrote about a couple of weeks ago, the Aperol Spritz fills the role when the weather is scorching and you want something simple, refreshing, and light enough to allow you to drink during the day and still allow you to make it to the evening’s festivities.

But nothing prepared me for the actual visit. An unsuspecting visitor, like myself, will first be daunted by the 300-plus dilapidating stone steps. One must go up these…

Together with the other elements, we create “Gaia”, like a shot of green bursting forth from the hardest rocks… 1 serving Ingredients 1 small pecan (approximately 1 inch long) 2 inches of fresh lemongrass ½ ounce of rhum agricole blanc (e.g. Martinique) 1 teaspoon fructose sugar powder 1 teaspoon blue curaçao 1/5 teaspoon butterscotch schnapps 2 ounces Hoegaarden beer Total: about… 
 Lamb and Fresh Herb Khoresh

What about all those extra hot dog buns left over from 4th of July? I’m thinking lobster salad again. Nothing fancy, just delicious chunks of chilled poached lobster meat stuffed in a bun with mayo and a little light seasoning. How about Rasa Malaysia’s version of the famous Classic New England Lobster Roll? I may not have the special buns for this classic,…

 Japanese Fried Chicken Bento 
 Rasa Malaysia 5 Jul 2012 | 11:04 pm One of my favorite bento is chicken karaage, or Japanese fried chicken bento. In the United States, chicken kaarage is also referred to as sesame fried chicken in many Japanese restaurants. Other than chicken teriyaki, chicken karaage is probably one of the most popular combinations when it comes to Japanese bento. If you have had Japanese food or lunch box, I am sure you have tried the crispy and flavorful Japanese fried chicken. I simply can’t resist the good taste. Making restaurant-style bento is actually easier than you think, and the whole process of assembling the different…

 Rice and Sesame Pancakes 
 Heidi Swanson 2 Jul 2012 | 7:39 pm After traveling quite a lot this spring, summer has taken on a completely different rhythm. As most of you know, because of this, I&apos;ve been keeping close to home, and it&apos;s nice. Saturday mornings are my favorite, and they&apos;ve developed their own little ritual. I get up early and go to the farmers&apos; market, driving the back way, through North Beach, where it&apos;s quiet, empty, and peaceful at that hour. At the market I look at the bay and the bridge, and buy eggs, and favas, and strawberries and flowers, and sometimes get cappuccinos with friends. Wayne bakes bread while I&apos;m gone, and when I get… 
 Cinnamon Vanilla Sunflower Butter 
 Heidi Swanson 26 Jun 2012 | 5:23 pm This one is for my sister - a lifelong sunflower seed enthusiast. I flipped to page 205 of Marisa McClellan&apos;s new book, Food in Jars, and there it was - a recipe for homemade Cinnamon Vanilla Sunflower Butter. Here&apos;s the thing - if you have sunflower seeds, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla bean paste (or pods), you can make it right now. It takes next to no time. As I&apos;m sure you can imagine - it&apos;s perfect on good toast. But you can also thin it out to the consistency of (a sweet) tahini - great with apples or pears, or as a component on grilled sandwiches. This sunflower seed butter calls for what…

 Heidi Swanson 14 Jun 2012 | 6:21 pm There&apos;s a small restaurant in our neighborhood known for great pizza. And yes, the pizza is on point. But, really, it&apos;s their salads I crave - substantial, always changing, made from whatever looks great at the market. I&apos;d tell you the name of the place, but scoring a table is already enough of a wait. It&apos;s Ragazza. I ordered a ringer of a salad the other night, and have been making a version at home in the days since - kale, farro, lots of avocado, carrots and fennel tossed with a creamy green garlic dressing. It&apos;s as good as it sounds. The version I&apos;ve been making is down below, or you can…

 France, 2012 - The Rest of Monflanquin and Villeneuve Sur Lot 
 Alice Q. Foodie 9 Jul 2012 | 7:02 am When not touring around the local area or taking field trips to Bordeaux, my time in Southwestern France was spent mostly in Monflanquin, a small town in the Lot et Garonne region (#47 to be exact). This is where my friend Vince has a house that I stayed in for the first half of my trip. One evening we picnicked at a table perched on the edge of the hill the town sits on - so much so that there is a bench only one side of the table. The view was incredible and the food simple but perfect. (This seemed to be a recurring theme in France, actually.) On other evenings, we… 
 Bardot Bars - La Jolla 
 Alice Q. Foodie 1 Jul 2012 | 12:16 pm When I was up in La Jolla last week checking out Ariccia Italian Market, I couldn&apos;t resist stopping in the new Bardot Bars store - a shop on Prospect selling fancy ice cream bars. I was intrigued for a few reasons. For one thing, the whole concept just seems so ridiculous. It&apos;s a store that sells ice cream bars! For $5.50 a pop! In one of the most expensive real estate locations in town! I can&apos;t help but wonder how many they have to sell per hour to pay the rent there overlooking the ocean. Secondly, they looked so pretty in the pictures with the assorted colors and designs on… 
 Ariccia Italian Market - La Jolla 
 Alice Q. Foodie 29 Jun 2012 | 12:17 am Until now, as far as I&apos;m aware, there really hasn&apos;t been a place to get a good Porchetta sandwich here in San Diego. (Somebody is probably going to tell me I&apos;m wrong about that, but that&apos;s ok because we can always use more.) The porchetta panini at the new Ariccia Italian Market in La Jolla is here to change that. It&apos;s made with their own housemade porchetta, pictured below, a balsamic onion marmalade and Suzie&apos;s Farm arugula, piled onto a Sadie Rose ciabatta bun and grilled on a panini press until hot and crunchy. Their porchetta is a pork belly tightly wrapped around a pork loin… 
 France, 2012 - Bordeaux 
 Alice Q. Foodie 25 Jun 2012 | 10:56 am One of the highlights (maybe even the highlight) of my trip to France was a day trip to Bordeaux from Monflanquin (about a two hour drive.) Vince called it &quot;Mini Paris&quot; - and I can&apos;t disagree. It&apos;s jammed with cafes, shops and similarly beautiful architecture, but missing the crowds that can make Paris feel a bit oppressive. One thing I wanted to do on this trip was eat least one fine dining meal, preferably at a restaurant with a Michelin star. Not that I put so much stock in Michelin stars, but if you are going to eat at a Michelin restaurant might as well do it in… 
 France, 2012 
 Alice Q. Foodie 17 Jun 2012 | 7:55 pm After a great four days in San Francisco, I flew nonstop to Paris and then on to Toulouse to visit a friend of mine who has a house in the village of Monflanquin, a small bastide town in Southwestern France. I expected the flight to be cramped and uncomfortable, but traveling on Air France was actually not bad. The food was terrible, but the Heidsieck Monopole Blue Top champagne they served before the meal and Cognac they poured after helped a lot - as did the salami, butter and cornichon sandwich I brought from Acme Bakery. If you don&apos;t like the meal - a choice of Salmon…

 Guest Post – Shannon Muir from AmoXcalli Cooks Recipes out of Weeknights With Giada 
 ShMuir 30 Apr 2012 | 12:00 am My name’s Shannon Muir, and you can find me partnering with Gina Ruiz over on the book review site AmoXcalli; Gina of course also runs Dona Lupe’s Kitchen.  Recently one of the books I managed to get for review was Weeknights With Giada by cooking show host Giada De Laurentiis. Gina knew that I planned to try several recipes before writing my review, though AmoXcalli focuses more on readability and usability of a book versus the details of it–especially since that site primarily reviews fiction, but is open to any good books. In talking with Gina, it seemed like a good…

 Fried Catfish 
 9 Jul 2012 | 1:28 pm Please welcome Hank Shaw as he serves up a Southern classic—fried catfish. ~Elise Fried catfish is an icon of Southern cooking: For many, there simply isn&apos;t any other way to prepare it. Arguments rage over whether it&apos;s best deep-fried, battered, breaded with cornmeal, or even just simply dredged in flour. This, to my mind, is a healthy debate.

 Tarragon Corn Chowder 
 6 Jul 2012 | 4:20 pm This is a soup made for summer, fresh and bright. Compared to many corn chowders that can be a bit on the heavy side with cream and bacon, this chowder is rather light. It gets its body from Yukon gold potatoes and fresh corn. The cool thing about this soup is the way the soup base is made—after you strip the kernels from the cobs, you just simmer the cobs for half an hour. You could use this method for any corn or vegetable soup for which you wanted a stronger corn flavor. I love the way tarragon pairs with corn, to me its a perfect taste complement. But if tarragon isn&apos;t your thing, you…

 Grilled Sweet Potatoes 
 1 Jul 2012 | 2:25 pm Have you ever tried grilling sweet potatoes? It&apos;s quick and easy. You just peel the sweet potatoes, slice them into 1/4-inch slices, paint them with olive oil, sprinkle on some salt, and place on a hot grill. To serve, you want to slather them with some sort of vinaigrette—olive oil to keep them from tasting too dry, and an acid like lime juice or lemon juice to balance the sweetness of the sweet potatoes. We played around a bit with this recipe, after thinking we had &quot;discovered&quot; the wonderful combination of lime, cilantro, and sweet potatoes, only to find out many others have made a… 
 Grilled Romaine Lettuce 
 1 Jul 2012 | 8:36 am One of the great things about being a food blogger is that it compels you to be somewhat adventurous in your food. If you had told me a few years ago that I would not only be happily eating grilled romaine lettuce, but encouraging others to do the same, I would have thought you were nuts. Why in the world would anyone want to grill lettuce? Lettuce just isn&apos;t part of the grilling food group people! You know, burgers, ribs, beer can chicken. Grilled lettuce? Why that&apos;s just... just pretentious, that&apos;s what. Well the joke&apos;s on me, and anyone who loves salad and also loves grilled things, but…

 San Francisco Restaurant Finds Way Around California Foie Gras Ban

Now, the Presidio Social Club is claiming it is exempt from the law, because it is on Federally owned land. According to San Francisco PBS station KQED, the restaurant manager told them,“…the restaurant is not subject to state or local jurisdiction because it is located on the Presidio Trust, a former U.S. Army Base now operated mostly as a national park. The Social Club (which contrary to its name, has no members and is open to the general public) plans to begin with foie gras sliders on July 14, Bastille…

 Scallop&amp;Asparagus Orzo Risotto - in Spite of the Heat 
 Ruth Daniels 5 Jul 2012 | 6:26 am Another hot day, ending with some rain meant no barbecuing and no wish to heat up the kitchen. So what did I make for dinner.... I thought a quick sear of scallops and some salad, but, while I was looking through my &quot;Pins&quot; for spicing inspiration, I found a Shrimp Orzo dish from A Couple in the Kitchen. Obviously, the heat had affected my brain, because, as we all know.... any form of risotto requires standing directly over the pan, stirring and stirring and stirring for at least fifteen minutes. Scallop&amp;Asparagus Orzo Risotto That said, in the end it was super tasty and… 
 Too Hot to Boil Water 
 Ruth Daniels 4 Jul 2012 | 8:16 am Perhaps it will cool down later, but the last couple of days have been too hot to cook. When I say to hot to boil water... I DO mean on the stove! So last night&apos;s dinner, which was supposed to be pasta...after all, I am this week&apos;s Presto Pasta Night host... consisted of a simple salad to accompany another great grilled flank steak. True, I already have lots of my own variations and a bazillion more bookmarked or pinned, but I was in too much of a hurry Monday morning to actually look them up. Good thing the awesome ingredients sort of made the meal themselves.

The cake is from Martha Stewart, and I will tell you that her cupcake recipes work GREAT in my experience.

It&apos;s the best buttercream I&apos;ve ever had, at least in recent memory. It&apos;s so lovely and light textured.

 Julie 21 Jun 2012 | 4:01 pm This is a pretty, delicious and healthy side for cookouts and potlucks. Make it now because it&apos;s really the best with fresh, sweet summer corn. I grilled the corn to give it smoky flavor, but sometimes corn is so tasty this time of year that you don&apos;t need to cook it at all (I guess it&apos;s technically &quot;raw,&quot; but that&apos;s not a problem in this case!). Just cut it off the cob and add it to anything. I created this recipe for a blogger recipe contest sponsored by Hodgson Mill. They make whole grain flours (really good ones), and also pasta. The very first homemade southern cornbread I ever baked was… 
 Slow Cooker Chicken-Chickpea Curry, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free 
 Julie 13 Jun 2012 | 9:39 am I&apos;ve been loving my slow cooker lately. The ability to cook once and have more than 3 meals worth of food (for 2 people) is incredibly alluring. A lot of slow cooker recipes involve some extra steps like browning meat, sauteeing vegetables or heating up the liquid, but not this one. When I came up with this recipe, I was in the process of moving (I have a huge kitchen now--cooking is so much more exercise!), so I wanted to pile everything in the slow cooker as is and pretty much forget it. You do have to remember to add the beans and coconut milk towards the end, but I am okay with… 
 Quinoa-Crust Pizza, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free 
 Julie 25 May 2012 | 8:10 am This recipe is a lot of fun. I think it&apos;s fun for anyone, but if you don&apos;t eat gluten, it may be extra fun. I saw it on Tasty Eats at Home, and the description of a chewy pizza crust with olive oil-crisped edges made with little more than quinoa and water sounded too interesting not to try. You don&apos;t even have to steam the quinoa! Just soak it for at least 8 hours, then puree in a food processor or blender with enough water to make a batter. Then you pour it into a hot skillet with a slick of olive oil, listen to it sizzle and bake until golden brown. Add your toppings (I really loaded it up… 
 Duck Ragu, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free 
 Julie 20 May 2012 | 1:10 pm I tried a new duck recipe over the weekend, and I&apos;m making it part of my permanent repertoire. I have a favorite recipe for braised duck legs with rustic homemade pasta (the only homemade pasta I make, it&apos;s totally worth it, and requires no special tools), but this one caught my eye because it sounded like a nice variation on my favorite. This takes time--you are slowly braising the duck to make it gorgeously tender--but I consider it an easy recipe. Why? There aren&apos;t a lot of steps or fussy prep work. It&apos;s just like any other braise or stew: sear the meat, saute aromatics, add cooking liquid…

 Waiter Rant 
 
 Crazy Sexy 
 guru 6 Jul 2012 | 11:56 am I need to refill my Lipitor prescription so I walk into the local Rite Aid with Ann in tow. “I’ll check my blood pressure while you’re waiting,” Ann says. Ann’s blood pressure is perfect, but she has a strange fetish. She likes the crushing feeling of a blood pressure cuff on her arm. She also like Indian burns. In case you’re wondering, she’s exhibited no other masochist tendencies–at least not yet. Ann settles in to the blood pressure machine with a big smile–like a little kid getting into one of those crappy rides you find in supermarkets. Luckily for me,… 
 You Must Be This Young to Ride This Ride 
 guru 27 Jun 2012 | 4:51 pm It’s Tuesday night and I’m walking through the Meadowland’s State Fair with my girlfriend, Ann. The weather is cool and breezy and attendance is sparse. That’s good because I won’t have to wait to get on a ride. And man, I love amusement park rides. “So what ride do you want to go on first?” Ann asks, as we leave the petting zoo. I petted dirty llamas and miniature ponies as a favor to her. I don’t like seeing animals cooped up. “Why don’t we start off easy?” I suggest. ‘”How about the Rock&amp;Roll over there?” Ann can get sick reading on a plane. The Rock…

 No-Yeast, No-Rise, Champagne Pizza Dough 
 scott 9 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am I promised myself that, before the summer is over, I would learn to make fabulous pizza at home.  It turns out, making pizza at home is a fascinating problem.  Almost everyone I know eats pizza at home, but hardly anyone makes it… unless you count baking a frozen DiGiorno or putting toppings on a pre-baked crust.  My self-challenge encompasses aspects of both innovation and practice, and with a food as technique-centric as pizza, there’s no getting around the need to practice. I’ve made about 30 pizzas so far this summer, and my technique and confidence increases with each one.… 
 Slow Motion Egg to the Face 
 scott 22 Jun 2012 | 10:21 am To make an omelet, you’ve gotta break a few eggs. To learn to use a Phantom v.12 high-speed video camera, it’s best to break those eggs as dramatically as possible. This was shot at 6900 frames per second, which is fast enough to capture the worst facial expression I’ve ever made.

 From Water to Ice In An Instant–Supercooled Water 
 scott 13 Jun 2012 | 7:14 pm The video above is not camera magic – I actually poured a bottle of water into a room-temperature glass and watched it instantly turn into ice. I stumbled upon this phenomenon when I was experimenting with the optimal temperature at which to serve Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Long ago, I modified the freezer in my basement to maintain precise temperature control using a PID controller. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been sampling cans of PBR at different temperatures. Incidentally, I have concluded that PBR is best served right around –8.5C. At that temperature,… 
 Introducing Modernist Cuisine at Home 
 scott 29 May 2012 | 1:41 pm This morning, we (the Modernist Cuisine team) announced our next book, Modernist Cuisine at Home. You can read all about the book at the Modernist Cuisine website, but it gives me tremendous personal satisfaction to finally get to share this project with the world. Although I only joined the MC team at the beginning of the year, already well into this book’s development, I have had the privilege of helping our team finish the book, which I believe will make a serious impact on home cooking. If you’re a regular reader of SeattleFoodGeek.com, you know that bringing Modernist cooking… 
 Hypermelon – Watermelon Vacuum-Infused with Energy Drinks 
 scott 21 Apr 2012 | 6:21 am This may be the most dangerous food I’ve ever created. I came up with the idea near the end of a very long day of work, when delirium had set in and all of my ideas were at their most absurd. But, in the morning, the idea still lingered with me, so, despite my sense of impending moral conflict, I present Hypermelon. Hypermelon is melon that has been vacuum infused with an energy drink. Strong vacuum pressure causes the cellular structure of the melon to change, and when atmospheric pressure is returned, the melon sucks up a proportionally large amount of any surrounding liquid. In these…

 Well, MomCooks Readers, I’m Back! Call It A Failed Experiment! 
 Elizabeth 10 Jul 2012 | 7:22 am Well, readers of MomCooks, I’m back. I thought I could just move all my food-related posts onto a different blog, but it turns out that I really do need separate blogs. It’s just easier for me to keep everything straight in my head. But what I really realized over the last few months is that I had given in to my own insecurities. You see, this has never been a traditional food blog anyway. It’s always been my place to collect recipes I find around the internet, my own online recipe box. And then I have my blog Table for Five, which is my personal blog. But when traffic…

 Happy Blogiversary to Me! 
 Anne Coleman 2 Jul 2012 | 6:10 am Cooking with Anne turns 7 this year on July 4th, and in honor of my new-found maturity at such a ripe old age, I thought I&apos;d come clean.When I started this blog, it was sort of like every other blog out there; chatty, filled with personal info, serious at times, silly at times. I feel like I&apos;ve gotten away from that (I know I have) so I want to share where I&apos;m at.Blogs are supposed to be personal in nature and I realize most of what I&apos;ve shared lately hasn&apos;t been very personal other than the fact that my recipes are mine. Big deal. There are thousands of blogs that share personal recipes and… 
 A Very Veggie Garden 
 Anne Coleman 30 Jun 2012 | 6:00 am Every year for a very long time now, I&apos;ve grown a garden behind my house. No matter where I lived there was something there that I was tending. Flowers, vegetables, fruit or herbs, I was out in the sun each morning checking on seedlings or pruning and weeding larger plants. I didn&apos;t always have a bumper crop, but I always had something to tend to. Tiny little zucchini.Now that I&apos;ve moved (and last year was close to the end of the growing season and I had to leave my garden behind) the yard is not so big and quite weedy. I also haven&apos;t had the time to devote to a full garden. I did… 
 Hello! 
 Anne Coleman 12 Jun 2012 | 11:47 am I sometimes wonder if being on camera comes natural to everyone in the world but me. I get nervous and tongue-tied and my eyes wander everywhere but the camera. I sat down today and after 8 tries have a short intro video (with a guest!). If we&apos;ve never met in person you get a tiny glimpse of what I&apos;m like in real life. I&apos;m hoping to get rid of my fears and actually make a cooking video some day soon. No, I&apos;ll never be on The Next Food Network Star, but I do hope to at least connect a little better with my readers.Alright Mr. Demille, I&apos;m ready for my close-up...© 2009… 
 No-Bake Vanilla Snowballs 
 Anne Coleman 11 Jun 2012 | 8:57 am Taken directly from my post at Family.com for No-Bake Vanilla Snowballs, these are easier and cuter than ever thanks to Pop-Secret&apos;s Magic Colors microwave popcorn. A pretty blue hue adds just the right touch. These are perfect for parties, bake sales or after-school snacks. Regular popcorn is just as good and any colored cereal can be used. This time I went with Trix because it&apos;s such a vibrant contrast to the blue popcorn. Experiment and see what you can come up with!No-Bake Vanilla SnowballsIngredients:One 12 ounce package white chocolate chips or white coating4 cups popped popcorn2… 
 Pull-Apart Oven Sandwich 
 Anne Coleman 4 Jun 2012 | 11:28 am Who doesn&apos;t love ham and cheese? It&apos;s even better when it&apos;s heated. This has much of the same flavors as the Baked Ham and Cheese Sandwiches I&apos;ve made before, but with a different presentation for a little more &quot;wow&quot; factor at the table.Here&apos;s the deal with these; any meat or cheese works and you can use just mustard or honey mustard on the insides and you don&apos;t really need any on the outside of the loaf. Any way you slice it, it&apos;s delicious. Start with a loaf of Italian bread. Cut 13 times to make 6 sandwiches (12 slices of bread) and two ends. Don&apos;t cut all the way through to the… 
   
 
 Cheese and Biscuits 
 
 10 Greek Street, Soho 
 10 Jul 2012 | 8:15 am There are some people, amongst both bloggers and professional critics, who like playing the role of contrarian. They&apos;ll be the first to call out any given foodie trend as having jumped the shark (usually before most of the rest of us have even heard of it), will delight in posting the first negative review of a universally adored restaurant just to see what kind of reaction they can provoke, and will huff and puff and roll their eyes at any indication that anything so utterly tedious as a consensus is forming about where to eat or drink. Which is all fine, of course - it wouldn&apos;t do if we… 
 Sticks&apos;n&apos;Sushi, Wimbledon 
 29 Jun 2012 | 3:41 am Wimbledon used to be the place that restaurants went to die. It&apos;s strange how the smartest areas of town seem to suffer from a dearth of decent eating options; look at Hampstead, for example, with its couple of half-assed gastropubs and a Gaucho Grill, or Knightsbridge&amp;West Brompton where people go to see and be seen eating salad. You&apos;d think that where the disposable income goes, good food would inevitably follow but the opposite seems to be the case; where times are hard, and incomes low, restaurants fall over each other to offer great value and a great time. In areas that they don&apos;t have… 
 Nightjar and Fifteen, Old Street 
 19 Jun 2012 | 7:53 am It was an evening that started out with such promise. Finding myself with an hour to kill before a 7pm reservation at Fifteen, I took the opportunity to check out Nightjar, a cocktail bar (or I think we&apos;re supposed to call them &quot;speakeasies&quot; these days for some bloody reason, like we’re going through our own pretend prohibition) hidden away between two shabby cafés just a little further down City Road. Down a stairway so dark I had to feel for each step, into an even darker room lit by little more than a couple of candles and the soft glow of customer iPhone screens, is a glittering bar… 
 Medlar, Chelsea 
 12 Jun 2012 | 4:00 am Time Out recently released a list of the &quot;top 100 dishes in London&quot;. It&apos;s an interesting read even if (in fact, as ever with these lists, particularly if) you don&apos;t agree with every choice, but if nothing else just goes to show the astonishing diversity of dining out in the capital; you can question the quality of food here if you like, but there&apos;s absolutely no arguing with the variety. Anyway, amongst the lobster rolls and salt beef beigels and lamb chops is the Duck Egg Tart from Medlar, an artistic arrangement of moist, sautéed duck hearts and crunchy lardons orbiting a perfectly… 
 Bistro Union, Clapham 
 11 Jun 2012 | 9:30 am &quot;Let me explain the concept at Tex Mex Tapas&quot;, the evening will invariably begin. &quot;On this side of the menu are a bewildering number of completely unrelated items that look good value at first until you realise that each is the size of a postage stamp and you&apos;ll need about ninety to gather enough food together to form a decent meal. They&apos;ll arrive as and when we, the restaurant, decide to send them to you, not in whichever order makes the most culinary sense, and most will be straight out of the fridge as our tiny kitchen could never cope with cooking them all to order. On the other side of…

 Eating&amp;Sleeping in Sao Paulo (Again) 
 Krista 1 Jul 2012 | 8:17 am Back to Sao Pauo for the third time and for a few weeks. And yes, I did buy more Havianas. I’ve really fallen in love with them as“hausschuhe.”I definitely would not choose to wear them for a long walk anywhere, but inside the house, they’re fantastic. I had a bit of a false-start with housing in Sao Paulo this time. I tried using Air B&amp;B and rented an apartment, only to arrive and find that the toilet wouldn’t flush. The owner was generally responsive, but he kept telling me there was a trick to flushing the toilet. I couldn’t figure this mysterious… 
 The Return to London, Second Part 
 Krista 30 Jun 2012 | 9:57 am Back to London. And the giant glowing orb in the sky actually cooperated for a moment. Everything was beautiful. (Look closely at Tower Bridge and you can see the Olympic Rings, getting ready for their descent.) I worked well, I ate well, I WALKED well. London is an incredible city to walk in, and I stayed entirely above ground during this part of my visit. I moved into the compact but efficient Zetter in Clerkenwell for five nights. This made me more than a little teary-eyed because I was staying just a few blocks away from my old flat, a flat I lived in for over five years. Amazing how… 
 Wedding in Tuscany 
 Krista 28 Jun 2012 | 7:40 am Is it allowable, to duplicate the wedding of friends for your own selfish purposes? Because I truly could not imagine a more perfect location or wedding than the one I just got back from in Tuscany. My friends Jen and Leigh commandeered the movie-set-perfect Borgo Casabianca for an entire long weekend. The villa is in a small town called Asciano, about 90 minutes from Florence. It was all so very Stealing Beauty. I kept waiting for them to play Nina Simone. Do you see what I mean? This was the wedding dinner, where chandeliers hung from the trees and flowers were in abundance. Borgo… 
 Quick Trip to Florence 
 Krista 27 Jun 2012 | 7:52 am Krista on Tour continues. I dropped by Florence on the way to the wedding of two good friends in Tuscany. I haven’t been to Florence in, um, 20 years? Maybe 19. It’s full of tourists. Like super-full of tourists. I explained to my traveling companions that Italy has a worryingly low birth-rate. I’m not sure my friends believed me because I just sounded so dire and pessimistic.“There are no Italians left in Italy! Good pizza will become a myth!!”So who wouldn’t want to raise children in Italy? Italians, apparently. Here…read this about the hows and… 
 The Return to London, First Part 
 Krista 26 Jun 2012 | 7:30 am Back to London, a trip in two parts. And although it was gray and rainy and dreary for the entire Part I of my visit, it was still amazingly wonderful. To the few citizens of Chicago who read my fair blog, I hope that if we do not ever meet, I have at least one little small impact on your life: You pack your bags and go to London sometime. Eight hours on a plane is NOTHING. It is worth it. You should go. (But leave your sweatpants and pillow at home. Just a pet peeve of mine on airplanes. A bit precious, innit?) Although I saved money on the Amsterdam leg of my trip, I SPENT money on this…

 DDL 9 Jul 2012 | 12:36 pm Yes, it’s that time of year again.  For the second consecutive year, the National Association for the Specialty Foods Trade held its annual convention in Washington DC, and we trekked down to the nation’s capitol to discover what’s new, hot, and happening in the food world.  The Fancy Food Show is home to 2,400 exhibitors showcasing 180,000 products spanning every possible facet of gourmet food and beverage, with representation by over 80 countries and regions. After checking in and picking up my badge, the Press Room Manager said to me,“I don’t need to tell… 
 Experience: A Taste of Revel 
 DDL 31 May 2012 | 11:21 am According to Google Maps, the journey from my office to the front step of the Revel Resort in Atlantic City is a relatively short 1 hour and 34 minute trip.  An invitation to join the Taste of Revel event, paired with the opportunity to cut out a little early from work last Friday, seemed destined to create the perfect gateway to the weekend. What could possibly go wrong? Two hours after leaving work, I had only just crossed the Walt Whitman Bridge into New Jersey.  Having experienced the rare joy of sitting in rush hour traffic both into Philadelphia and out of it, I was looking at… 
 Reconciliation, Healing, and Charcuterie – Part 2 
 DDL 4 May 2012 | 12:49 pm This the middle of the story.  If this looks unfamiliar to you, you may want to start with Part 1. Even though I kept my eyes locked on the entrances to the rail tracks, Dave still managed to sneak up on me.  Since he’s not active on Facebook, I hadn’t seen many recent photos of him, and to my surprise, he looked substantially the same as he did in college, although I’m sure the same can be said about myself.  We were both older but no worse for wear. Not wanting to waste a moment of catching-up time, we decided to stay in the building while we plotted out our day. We headed… 
 Reconciliation, Healing, and Charcuterie – Part One 
 DDL 15 Feb 2012 | 11:13 am “This feels the same, doesn’t it?”Dave said this somewhere in the vicinity of 70th street, as we ambled up Fifth Avenue, a brisk walk that had its beginnings at 32nd Street and Park Avenue. In actuality, our journey began over 16 years ago, but, due to a combination of factors, had suffered an unfortunate suspension that had lasted for far longer than it should have. His comment made me smile, and, in spite of my aching legs and lingering back pain, I could not have agreed more. All in all, it did feel quite the same. He was the best man at our wedding. But for years before… 
 A Contest! Chocolate! A Chocolate Contest! 
 DDL 6 Feb 2012 | 9:56 am I’m not very good at contests, which is why long time readers of this site have never seen me host one. The way I see it, if I announce a giveaway, there are two possible scenarios: either there’s so little participation (or, even worse, none at all) that I’m left picking a winner from a field of two or three readers whom I probably already know, or there’s a flood of entries, and I have to deal with the pressure of picking one deserving entrant with very little guiding criteria. Oh, and then there’s the fulfillment aspect of it all, wherein I drive around for…

 Another Aspect of Aspic 
 Tracy Schneider 11 Jul 2012 | 2:25 pm We call it jello in the old U.S. of A., where it is sweet and jiggly, but here in Europe they call it aspic, and it&apos;s taken to a whole other dimension. Just the other day I went to my favorite Biergarten along the Neckar. They have an impressive list of simple regional dishes. My goal is to try them all, from Handkäse mit Musik, to Schwäbishe Käsespätzle, and I&apos;m off to a good start. I took the plunge and ordered Eisbein in Aspik, or ham hock in aspic, prepared in a terrine and cut into slices before it is plated. The meat is flavorful and fatty. As for the aspic, it had the… 
 The Misty Tundra of Bristol Bay, Part Two 
 Melissa Trainer 11 Jul 2012 | 8:14 am I spotted a celebrity up here in Bristol Bay early yesterday morning. Now, admittedly she wasn&apos;t a big blonde bodacious celebrity. She was the Cornelia Marie, a big seaworthy gal who was working hard on the dock of the Peter Pan Cannery.  A massive crab boat featured in the reality television show, The Deadliest Catch, the Cornelia Marie is moonlighting out here in Bristol Bay for the summer.

 Leslie Kelly 10 Jul 2012 | 9:17 pm We&apos;re smack in the middle of cherry season in the Northwest, and the Rainiers are particularly plump and sweet. Once I start chomping, I can&apos;t stop.  Part of the reason cherries are such a treat is that the window is so short for enjoying those juicy gems. A friend brought me a 10-pound box from an orchard near Wenatchee, two-and-a-half hours from Seattle, and the first thing I did was eat my fill. But while savoring, I started making plans for Rainier cherry jam. The batch from last summer disappeared in a big hurry and I wanted to recreate that incredible, very pretty spread. It… 
 Summer Sipper: VSOP Lemon Derby

 A New Recipe for the Best Brownies 
 Rebekah Denn 10 Jul 2012 | 10:44 am To me, my mom&apos;s brownies have always been the best in the world. I felt almost disloyal at the book release party for Jess Thomson&apos;s book,&quot;Pike Place Market Recipes,&quot;where chefs at Steelhead Diner prepared recipes from the book, to find myself saying&quot;These might be the best brownies I&apos;ve ever had in my life.&quot;The book is about Seattle&apos;s landmark public market, filled with well-tested recipes and well-told stories. (I wrote a little more about it here.) I appreciate the flying fish and Rachel the Pig and all the other things that come to mind when we…

 Paris Booksigning: This Saturday, July 14th 
 David 12 Jul 2012 | 5:56 am I’m doing a little booksigning this Saturday at La Cuisine cooking school in Paris. It’s going to be an informal affair and if you’d like to come and get a book signed, this is your chance. There will be copies of Ready for Dessert, The Perfect Scoop, and The Sweet Life in Paris and I’ll be at the school, from 5:30 to 7:30pm, which is located at 80, quai de l’Hôtel de Ville. You can get a map, and more information, at the Facebook event page. Happy Bastille Day! 
 Tahini and Almond Cookies 
 David 9 Jul 2012 | 11:55 pm It was a treat to spend a tasty afternoon in Tel Aviv with Natalie Levin, of the blog Oogio.net, who is a passionate baker. Upon meeting, one of the first things Natalie did was hand over a bag of homemade treats, which included a sack of these Tahini and Almond Cookies. Although I didn’t dive in right away (to be polite), after we visited the outdoor market, when I got back to my hotel, I opened the bag and found myself in love with the crumbly, buttery texture and the slightly exotic taste of smooth tahini (sesame paste)–which I’d never had in a cookie. There was also a… 
 Israeli Breakfast 
 David 6 Jul 2012 | 10:27 am I’m not at my best in the morning. Actually, I’m not at my best until at least 2pm. (Although actually, some might argue it’s even a little later.) To me, breakfast is meant to be enjoyed in monk-like solitude. It’s a time where questions are prohibited and talking should be kept to an absolute minimum. Travel, of course, is fraught with all sorts of ways designed to thwart my precious few moments of quietude in the morning. There’s waking up in hotel rooms and stumbling toward the breakfast room, where unfamiliar people await, sometimes wanting to actually… 
 Israeli Salad 
 David 3 Jul 2012 | 10:07 pm When I met Maya Marom in Tel Aviv, she handed me a box of spices and flavorings, which meant that when I returned home, I could recreate many of the wonderful dishes that I enjoyed there. The best things I had in my travels were the salads loaded with fresh vegetables, which are served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and are especially welcome when the temperature climbs in the summertime. Maya was born in Arizona, but moved to Israel when she was three months old. She is a self-taught cook and baker, and has a gorgeous blog, Bazekalim as well as self-publishing her own food magazine. When… 
 The Hummus Factory 
 David 2 Jul 2012 | 8:09 am Almost all of the people I spoke with said they rarely make their own hummus, simply because the store-bought stuff was as good – if not better – than what they could make at home. (I guess it helps to think of it like peanut butter, where the homemade is very good, but store-bought will suffice.) People have very strong opinions about hummus, like they do about other things, in Israel. And if you mention a particular brand, or a place that makes it, you’re likely going to be told–with absolute certainty–that there’s another one, or place, that’s…

 The Holy Grail of Authentic Sichuan Cooking

The place where you can find it: Boston&apos;s Posharp Store, which sells online. chilibeanpaste agrees that Juan Cheng is essential, and recommends chopping the paste very fine before using it, &quot;which seems to release more flavor.&quot; Discuss: Authentic Sichuan Chinese Ingredients 
 Can You Tell If Corn Is Going to Taste Sweet? 
 Sarah Perry 9 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am Is there any way to tell by looking if the ears of corn you&apos;re buying are going to taste sweet? Are white varieties automatically going to taste sweeter than yellow ones? According to raytamsgv, the color of fresh corn doesn&apos;t tell you very much about its sweetness. Instead, it&apos;s the plant&apos;s genotype that determines how it tastes. Different varieties of corn start out with different amounts of sugar, raytamsgv explains. Varieties designated &quot;su&quot; (such as the popular Silver Queen) are traditional varieties with a moderate amount of sugar; they must be picked at just the right time and eaten… 
 Is a Shaken Martini an Abomination? 
 Sarah Perry 8 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am Is a shaken martini with lots of tiny ice slivers an abomination? JMF thinks so. While shaking is great for drinks containing juice or other cloudy ingredients, it doesn&apos;t jibe with JMF&apos;s aesthetic preference for clear cocktails. Plus when a martini is stirred, it has a sexy, silky, oily texture; shaking introduces excessive aeration, and the resulting ice slivers cause too much dilution. But e_bone loves a shaken martini precisely for the ice slivers, which a friend calls &quot;sleet.&quot; Sneakeater likes the icy bits too, but also gets that cocktail purists sees the slivers as a flaw. Maybe it&apos;s… 
 Why Do We Need Tomato Paste Anyway? 
 Sarah Perry 7 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am Considering that we all have canned crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce in our pantries, achilles007 wonders: What&apos;s the purpose of tomato paste? Well, Dirtywextraolives explains, tomato paste is a concentrated version of those other products, a source of flavor, body, unctuousness, and umami without extra liquid. It can even act as a binder for sauces. LauraGrace buys tomato paste in the squeeze tube for maximum convenience, or buys it in the can and freezes what she doesn&apos;t use in individual portions.

 Does Bottle Color Affect Nocino’s Taste? 
 Sarah Perry 6 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am Every year, quasistoic makes a batch of nocino, a liqueur made from green walnuts mellowed in red wine for at least a year. &quot;Last year&apos;s batch has mellowed into deliciousness, and we&apos;re one week into infusion of this year&apos;s batch,&quot; quasistoic reports. But quasistoic&apos;s mismatched collection of bottles used for aging has raised a question: Why did the batch aged in dark-colored bottles result in reddish nocino, while the liqueur aged in clear bottles ended up a drab, muddy brown with lots of suspended sediment? A further mystery: The muddy-looking nocino aged in clear class tasted indisputably…

 The Diss, Updated: Calling Asian Food “Hipster” 
 John Birdsall 11 Jul 2012 | 4:03 pm Asian is America’s takeout food, the stained box of kung pao in the nation’s culinary fridge. It was that way in the 1960s; it’s like that today, still, despite huge demographic shifts. Why, in 2012, don’t we take Asian food more seriously in this country? Some do. Certainly Chowhounds (that’s a lasting legacy of Chowhound, which just turned 15: teaching America—via the professional food writers who mine it for content—all about pho bo and xiao long bao). But most paid food critics, save mostly for the Jonathans (Kauffman and Gold), just don’t know how to talk about Asian… 
 Make-Ahead Car Camping Recipes 
 Amy Wisniewski 9 Jul 2012 | 1:03 pm Camping food is best when it&apos;s kept simple, but that doesn&apos;t mean it has to be boring. The CHOW Test Kitchen has developed a few recipes that&apos;ll give your camp food some flair but are still really easy—start them at home and finish them over the campfire. There&apos;s a versatile blue cheese butter you can throw on grilled steaks and coal-roasted potatoes, a riff on s&apos;mores using homemade chocolate graham crackers, and a mix-ahead cornmeal pancake batter that you can toss in the cooler and use in the morning to pour over sausages in a cast-iron pan for a take on &quot;toad in the hole.&quot; And just for… 
 Cantina Bell: Taco Bell’s Chipotle Wannabe Is Weak 
 John Birdsall 5 Jul 2012 | 3:01 pm Downscale Chipotle with Latina-chef branding: That’s my takeaway after sampling Taco Bell’s Cantina Bell menu, which launched today. The compact line of burrito bowls, cheeseless burritos, and chips and guacamole has been called “gourmet Mexican,” but it definitely has aspirations more along the lines of Chipotle than of Rick Bayless, even though the menu was “created” by a chef (and future Top Chef Masters contestant), Miami’s Lorena Garcia. Photographer Chris Rochelle and I swooped down on the Taco Bell in San Francisco’s semigritty Tenderloin neighborhood (the Cantina Bell… 
 As American as Steamed Rice 
 John Birdsall 3 Jul 2012 | 10:29 am As the nation pauses on July 4th to cook burgers on backyard cart grills and jockey for prime spots on the lawn to glimpse hazy fireworks shows, it’s time to acknowledge the truth: We are a nation divided. I’m not talking here about rifts between Tea Partiers and supporters of individual mandates, or between marriage defenders and marriage supporters (it’s complicated). I’m talking about the divide between those who don’t have rice cookers permanently on their kitchen counters and those who do. I’m talking about America’s growing rice hegemony. Traditionally—and by that I mean… 
 Craig Claiborne Had Balls 
 John Birdsall 29 Jun 2012 | 8:56 am For a guy whose life was wrapped in the fiction of bachelorhood and whose death proved so deeply lonely, Craig Claiborne managed to father a hell of a lot of children. Not actual kids (Claiborne was gay, at a time when a whole generation of unmarried homosexual men were winkingly tagged “bachelors”), but—as Thomas McNamee shows in his absorbing bio, The Man Who Changed the Way We Eat—as New York Times food editor, writer, and restaurant critic for a couple of decades starting in the 1950s. Claiborne, who died in 2000, had enormous influence. He still does—even if nobody reads him…

We had been planning a move, but only within Providence; when this particular job offer came along, however, she had to take it. So we quickly finished packing the apartment, and sent our belongings into storage. We took an SUV&apos;s worth of immediately necessary items, along with ourselves, our baby, and our two cats, and stayed in a hotel north of Boston for just over a week, while my wife finished up her… 
 Taste Test: A Guide to Black Pepper 
 Max Falkowitz 11 Jul 2012 | 4:00 pm [Photographs: Robyn Lee] There&apos;s no shortage of places to get your black pepper from; as one of the world&apos;s most popular spices, it&apos;s grown all across the world&apos;s spice regions, from India to Indonesia to Ecuador and Brazil. We don&apos;t talk much about terroir when it comes to spices, but it&apos;s worth thinking about. After all, peppercorns are fruits just like grapes, and soil, growing conditions, and variety of peppercorn are all going to have an impact on flavor profile. How strong are these flavor differences, and how do they pan out with food? We tasted peppercorns from seven major growing… 
 Weekend Cook and Tell Round Up: The United States of Grilling 
 Alison J Herzog 11 Jul 2012 | 3:30 pm Grilled Cranberry-Orange Zinfadel Bread with Orange Mascarpone Cream. [Photograph: Kosher Camembert] Our last challenge for Weekend Cook and Tell was for all of you to share your grilling feats. We called this The United States of Grilling.

 16 Great Square Slices in NYC 
 11 Jul 2012 | 12:45 pm VIEW SLIDESHOW: 16 Great Square Slices in NYC When we think of New York pizza, we often envision a pointy-tipped classic slice. Or when we think about the city&apos;s newer pizzerias, increasingly, we&apos;re dealing with a Neapolitan or neo-Neapolitan pie. But there&apos;s no end of great square slices in the city—from puffy Sicilian to thinner, garlicky grandma slices to newer innovations like pickled vegetable pizza. Here are 16 of our favorite square slices in the city. What&apos;s your favorite? The List Adrienne&apos;s Pizzabar»L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens»Pizza Cotta Bene»Artichoke Basille… 
 Daily Slice: Vodka Slice at Pomodoro 
 11 Jul 2012 | 11:00 am Daily Slice gives a quick snapshot each weekday of a different slice or pie that the folks at the Serious Eats empire have enjoyed lately. [Photograph: Dave Katz] People actually seem to like Pomodoro, which almost looks like a caricature of a pizza shop on its Spring St. corner. The lunch crowd tends to be relatively large, the selection is broad, and it&apos;s open very late on weekends (sign says 4 a.m.). Unfortunately, Pomodoro&apos;s signature Vodka slice ($3.50), which has gotten rave reviews on Yelp and beyond, will leave most pizza fans wanting more (or, in this case, a bit less). Less, in this… 
 The Great Slice Drought of Los Angeles is Over Thanks to Vito&apos;s Pizza

 Daily Slice: Funghi at Grandaisy Bakery 
 10 Jul 2012 | 11:00 am Daily Slice gives a quick snapshot each weekday of a different slice or pie that the folks at the Serious Eats empire have enjoyed lately. [Photograph: Dave Katz] Perhaps the pizza cognition theory rings particularly true for me, but I generally don&apos;t enjoy cheeseless, sauceless pies. A good white pizza? Sure, especially if there&apos;s garlic involved. A marinara pie? Not my first choice, but I enjoy the occasional slice. But a pizza with neither sauce nor cheese? I&apos;ve only come across a few in my time, and even fewer that tasted good. Fortunately, Slice&apos;rs in Manhattan can find a standout sauce…

 deb 7 Jul 2012 | 2:52 pm Look, guys. It’s Saturday. I don’t want to blow anyone’s cover or make you feel worse if you shivered out the week in an over-air-conditioned cubicle but I have to tell you: I think everyone is on vacation but us. I think they’re on beaches, building sandcastles, accumulating freckles, having lobster rolls for lunch and cherry pie and juicy peaches for dessert. I don’t think they’re thinking about us at all. I’ve already broken my please-don’t-be-so-dull-as-to-discuss-the-weather-Deb rule once this week and I don’t want to do it again,… 
 flag cake 
 deb 3 Jul 2012 | 2:38 pm Last year, I brought a flag cake to a 4th of July rooftop barbecue. Earlier in the week, I’d harbored fantasies about making an elaborate ice cream cake or layered berry yogurt popsicles or salads teetering on the edge of food safety standards but New York City, as it always seems to be in the first week of July, was at the crest of a week-plus of ever-increasing temperatures and stickiness, a summit where it tends to linger for a few even more airless days before finally releasing the thunder and lightening, sinking the mercury back to a brief day or two of something resembling…

We return well-rested and smiling, sandy grit in the bottom of our suitcases, traces of whatever had vexed us before we left deliciously eviscerated from memory, and almost giddy with excitement to start scraping spaghetti from the underside of the high chair again. But this is the first time—with barely a“Sayonara!”as he ran out the door or a single“Wish you were here!”postcard from…

The various intersections of cold chicken and cold pasta are littered with foods I’d rather forget, such as those macaroni salads with shredded, overcooked chicken, suspiciously squicked together with mayo in a clear plastic take-out container of dubious expiration at the nearest corner deli.

 Peach Gazpacho and Ginger-Peach Sorbet 
 Beth Bader 22 Jun 2012 | 1:23 pm Once a year I completely eschew any pretense of grace and manners and lean over the kitchen sink to gorge on fresh peaches.&quot;Schluuuuuuuuuuuuurp!&quot;I inhale, yet the juice still runs down my hands and chin as the perfectly sweet flesh gives up every last bit of peachy nectar. Most fruits, with the exception of pears and very few others, do not ripen after picking. They get softer, yes, from a

I will confess that I have a problem with buying too many vegetables, especially when I find unique varieties. There are worse obsessions. Mine is, 
 Pretty in Pink: Beet Risotto 
 Beth Bader 31 May 2012 | 8:44 pm We&apos;ve been battling the beet for some time around our house. What was once a reviled vegetable by my spouse is now beloved and, yes, requested even. In fact, requested often enough (and in season twice a year here) that I&apos;m starting to dig a bit deeper to create new recipes for this root. The Roasted Beet salad dressing and the Blueberry-Beet Smoothie from our book are still my favorites, but

 Beth Bader 24 May 2012 | 3:29 pm I like adult food as much as the next Mom. Sometimes, I just have to channel my inner five-year-old to get the kid to enjoy adult food as much as I do.  Hot pink adult food, with tiny, little perfect lettuces and fluffy goat cheese. Otherwise known as roasted beet dressing with microgreens if you want to be mature about it. Where&apos;s the fun in that? Beets are still hit and miss for the kiddo,

 Happy Dozen - Steamed Pork Buns with Prunes

My book project is chasing me like a terrier, consuming most of my daytime (…AND nighttime–have you ever dreamt of recipes? I do!). Recipe testing and writing is dictating my schedule, and taking this part of the process as serious as I do, it’s a lengthy process. After a day’s worth of testing, more testing and writing for the blog isn’t really the first thing that comes to mind. And since I don’t want to bore you with something mediocre, today’s recipe unfortunately took a tad longer. Ok, ok, here…

 Tomato Tarte Tatin Recipe 
 Béa 11 Jul 2012 | 8:51 pm Tomato Tarte Tatin Recipe Maybe I should call this recipe the 3 Ts: Tomato Tarte Tatin. A tarte tatin is a very French business. And a tomato tarte tatin is everything I love about summer. It’s sunshine on your plate: a blend of sweet and savory flavors; it’s a beautiful burst of color on your table too. So pretty and full of joy! I don’t know about you, but this is the way I see some of upcoming lunches happen: a slice, or two, of tomato tart with a large salad on the side. One evening, I even decided to serve small portions of the tart on pretty slate plates to start a… 
 Food Styling and Photography Workshop in France 
 Béa 28 Jun 2012 | 7:32 am A picnic in the garden THE ORIGINAL IDEA behind finding ourselves in the south of France in May for our food styling and photography workshop was to enjoy beautiful weather and time outside. Both Lara and I dreamed about it. I had traveled to the Languedoc-Roussillon region before and felt comfortable with it. I kept memories of the scenic Canal du midi with its plane trees, poplars, and barges; luscious markets; and generous sunny days with an everlasting feeling of being on vacation. I found the area and landscapes as attractive as I remembered them. Even better in fact when, on the day of… 
 Such a happy cherry tart

Lulu exclaimed as she reached for one golden piece of crust from the tart I had left to cool on the kitchen countertop.“Attends !”(Wait!) It was already too late. Her mouth was full and she was smiling, reaching for more. By looking at the cherry tart with its missing crust around the edge (not the one you see here in the picture), you’d have thought that tiny mice had come in the house for a snack. I am no blaming Lulu. At her age, I, too, was…

 Béa 12 Jun 2012 | 10:56 am That I was brought up surrounded by apple, apricot, strawberry, myrtille, mirabelle, quetsche–and cherry fruit tarts.

But before then, I am, too, enjoying a slice of the tart with a glass of sparkling rhubarb spritzer.

How much I love this time of year! If I could, I’d pack *it* tight in a box, so that I’d have these beautiful mellow days handy for the warmer months to come. I am not looking forward to the toasty days of summer. In reality, I am more of a spring kind of girl, when the weather stays gentle and nothing is extreme. So the greens. Since I’ve been able to find fresh fava beans and peas this season, I have…

 Happy Father&apos;s Day! 
 Amy 17 Jun 2012 | 8:35 am Just in case you were wondering why I haven&apos;t been posting: we&apos;re back home in Canada for a visit. I love being back and seeing my family and just relaxing, and Shuma loves all the attention and the space, especially the back yard. We miss Hideaki though. He keeps asking me to take pictures and I keep forgetting to take them, or when I do I don&apos;t upload them (I rarely open my laptop, which may be a contributing factor to why I&apos;m enjoying myself so much). So here&apos;s one from a few days ago, with a promise to upload more to Flickr. Happy Father&apos;s Day to Hideaki and all… 
 Rain, rain 
 Amy 2 May 2012 | 12:57 am Rain, rain, don&apos;t go away. Little Shuma wants to play! Yup, the kid loves rain, and who am I to keep him out of it? Thankfully his grandma sent him a raincoat a few months back, so he can keep dry in style. She sent some adorable rainboots too, but they&apos;re still too big so I got him a pair with froggies on them. He loves them and has been wearing them around the house, so was very glad to get to use them for their intended purpose. Just one problem: he very quickly found a puddle that was deeper than his boots. Mom, you&apos;re going to have to send some thigh-high waders next!  
 Dinosaur Suit 
 Amy 29 Apr 2012 | 9:17 pm Grandma sent this stripey number from Canada, and even though it&apos;s meant for the summer Shuma&apos;s already wearing it. A long-sleeved onsie and skinny pants add warmth without distracting from the friendly T-Rex. Here&apos;s a closer look. I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d get Shuma to stand still, but then he learned how to blow bubbles and all he wanted to do was stand around doing bubbles. I&apos;m really proud of him, but it&apos;s kind of boring- when I was blowing bubbles for him at least I had something to do. He&apos;s cute to watch though, especially when he takes a break from blowing to… 
 Thailand Day Two 
 Amy 21 Apr 2012 | 7:08 pm Our second day was pretty uneventful, so I&apos;ll take this opportunity to show our hotel. We stayed in Kalim, a tiny bay just north of Patong, at Kalim Resort, and as I said in the last post the&quot;resort&quot;is a misnomer, but it was nice enough. When planning the trip it seemed to be the nicest hotel of all the affordable packages I saw, and it turned out to be clean, with spacious rooms, friendly staff (who totally doted on Shuma), a basic but nice pool, and decent breakfast. The other guests mostly seemed to be on package tours as well, so I guess that&apos;s how they get most of… 
 Thailand Day One 
 Amy 18 Apr 2012 | 7:40 pm Yes, that&apos;s right, day one of a vacation we took a month and a half ago. I&apos;m going to make you slog through several posts about the trip, because I took hundreds of pictures and if I post them all at once then your scrolling finger will get all tired out. So anyway, we went to Thailand last month. This trip was a long time coming, in a few ways. First of all, we&apos;ve never had a proper family vacation. I don&apos;t just mean with Shuma, I mean Hideaki and I. We&apos;ve been married 12 years, and have done some travelling together, but no real vacation with just the two of us, as…

 Mourning Joe: Funeral Home Installs a Starbucks 
 12 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am Well, here&apos;s probably the worst barista gig we&apos;ve heard of: The Robinson Funeral Home in Easley, South Carolina, is installing a Starbucks. No more need for relatives to be distracted during services by a caffeine craving when they can slurp their way through a grief-uccino or sip on some coffin coffee! Starbucks is not allowing the funeral home to put up signage outside, purportedly because this isn&apos;t a full-size store (yeah, we bet that&apos;s why), but owner Chris Robinson assures local reporters the joint is open to the public as well. Hmmm, something about this smacks of poor taste, and it&apos;s…

 CityMama™ 22 Jun 2012 | 4:15 pm One of my favorite ways to do chicken salad with a&quot;secret&quot;ingredient. 1 cup chopped cooked chicken 1 small apple, cored and chopped 8-10 seedless grapes, halved 1/4 of a sweet onion, minced palmful of cashews, rough-chopped palmful of fresh Italian parsley, chopped 2 tbsps of mayo (I like Vegenaise) or Greek yogurt 2 tbsps light Hidden Valley Ranch dressing (the secret—it adds a nice herbal kick!) fresh ground pepper Combine all ingredients and mix well. Allow flavors to mingle at least one hour in the fridge. Garnish with fresh summer fruits—I used apricots and raspberries,…

 Camps that provide lunch FTW! 
 CityMama™ 8 Jun 2012 | 11:12 am One of the things I look forward to about summer vacation, besides not having to set an alarm clock*, is not having to pack lunches. Except, oh wait, if your kids are in all-day camps, guess what? You still have to pack lunches. ...but not at Camp Galileo! Camp Galileo partners with Choice Lunch to provide, healthy, yummy, and customizable lunches for all of their campers. Cost is $30 per week, or, another way to put it—not having to think about packing lunches? Priceless. They even have an app so you can order lunches on the go.

 Chicken and Dumplings Recipe from a Real Southerner 
 CityMama™ 21 May 2012 | 11:45 am What do you do when you have a fresh batch of chicken stock, some leftover chicken, and three hungry kids? Make chicken and dumplings! Now, despite my abiding love for it, chicken and dumplings is not a part of my culinary tradition. As with other Southern dishes like shrimp and grits, Brunswick stew, and pulled pork, it&apos;s a dish I&apos;ve made with varying degrees of success over the years. This year, though, I finally decided to just get it right once and for all. This a tried and true recipe from my friend Lisa Frame who lives in the South. I&apos;m passing it along with her…

 Sweltering days: a Pinot Grigio and a Rosé to cool off with 
 Wai Xin, CSW 11 Jul 2012 | 4:00 pm Ah, Summer. The season of dressing light, ditching the covered shoes and bringing out the flip-flops. Hit the beach and bake the skin to a crisp brown. This may sound great for most people in the world but when you’re actually here in the midst of drowning humidity between 80 to 90 per cent and combined with average temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius, it’s almost as if Singapore is a giant dim sum steamer. So unless you are a piece of siewmai (steamed Chinese pork dumpling), read on. I write about wines, I love wines and I study them. But truth be told, my beverage score card for… 
 Making your first classic pound cake 
 Mandy 10 Jul 2012 | 4:00 pm When I was a kid, my family rarely shopped at the supermarket. If we did, I would always beg my parents to get me a box of Sara Lee’s pound cake. To me, Sara Lee’s pound cake was the best cake in the world. If I was having a bad day in school, I would open the fridge, cut a slice and eat it, and everything instantly seems brighter. So it was no surprise that the classic pound cake was the first cake I baked from scratch. Besides hoping to recreate my childhood treat, the cake was easy to make. The list of ingredients is short and everything can be found in the neighbourhood supermarket. 
 A food truck in New York City: Wafels&amp;Dinges yummy Belgian waffles 
 Jeannice 9 Jul 2012 | 4:00 pm Food trucks have been gaining in popularity throughout the US and New York City has many of them. They tend to be priced lower than most sit-down places and even though some of them have long lines, you still get your food pretty quickly as people in the trucks typically prepare food from a limited menu. There are even many Smartphone apps that follow the movement of trucks and update their locations so it’s now easier than ever to find the truck you’re looking for! Very coincidentally, I recently moved to New York City, considered by many to be the food mecca of the world; and having… 
 Oxtail Bo Kho, a Vietnamese beef stew with Coke and Laughing Cow cheese 
 Aun 8 Jul 2012 | 4:00 pm A few weeks ago, I mentioned that, while attending the Noosa International Food&amp;Wine Festival, S and I had eaten one of the best oxtail stews we’d ever had in our lives. It was prepared by Chef Mark Jensen of the very famous Vietnamese restaurant Red Lantern, which is in Sydney, Australia. Traditionally, Bo Kho is made with cuts like brisket or shank. It’s also one of those traditional dishes that has no really defined and universal recipe. While certain ingredients might appear in most dishes, all mothers (and grandmothers) and chefs who make Bo Kho seem to have slightly… 
 Puppy Treats: Sweet Potato Balls 
 S 5 Jul 2012 | 4:00 pm On August 9, 2010 our first dog, Sascha, passed away. We were in Sri Lanka for a wedding at the time and received the news just as we checked onto our flight home. Her departure was sudden. I can still remember my disbelief. After all, she had been full of energy and vitality. As we left for the airport just days earlier, she had gazed down at us from the top of the stairs with that mix of imperious aloofness and doleful sweetness that made her special in our eyes. She was 11, but had not shown any signs of slowing down. On the same day we lost Sascha, we also discovered that I was pregnant.

 Paolo di Marchi: The Philosopher-Peasant of Chianti Classico (Part 1) 
 Richard Auffrey 11 Jul 2012 | 1:00 am As a child, Paolo di Marchi, the owner and wine maker of Isole e Olena in the Chianti Classico region, loved to grow things, to work in the family fields. He preferred to have toy tractors rather than race cars. Because of his interests, his father affectionately referred to him as the &quot;peasant&quot; of the family.I first met Paolo four years ago at a local tasting and was impressed with his wines and personality. He was down to earth, charming and intelligent. His Chianti Classico is one of my favorite wines of that type and his iconic Cepparello is superb. I have several…

 Rant: No More Burgers&amp;Cupcakes 
 Richard Auffrey 9 Jul 2012 | 1:00 am Whatever happened to originality? Where are the shepherds, leading the flocks, rather than the sheep who simply follow the latest trend?I am getting very tired of these food trends that never seem to end, which hang around far too long and which seem to consume the city. From cupcakes to burgers, so many people try to jump on the bandwagon and offer their own version of the latest trend. The market then becomes saturated and you almost cannot walk without bumping into some incarnation of this latest trend. Sure, the first few places that started the trend might have been pioneers, yet why… 
 All About Chianti Classico 
 Richard Auffrey 6 Jul 2012 | 1:00 am &quot;When the peasant eats a chicken, either the peasant is ill, or the chicken is.&quot;--Italian proverbSince my recent journey to the Chianti Classico region of Tuscany, Italy, I have written a number of posts about my experiences and are planning to write other posts for the near future. It was a beautiful, fascinating and tasty region, one that I highly recommend you visit. This is a region with a rich and vibrant history, and one which straddles both tradition and modern advances. There have been significant changes to the region within the last 20 years, and the quality of their wine has never…

 My First Sale, $35 for a School Silent Auction 
 Dave 21 Jun 2012 | 5:05 am In May I auctioned off a loaf of bread a week for 4 weeks at Frankie&apos;s school&apos;s silent auction and it sold for $35! Week 1: Baguettes. Making a few loaves a day presents a huge statistical challenge. Make a couple hundred loaves and you&apos;re cranking a well-oiled machine, one loaf sucks and it&apos;s no biggie, make 3 and one is bad, big problem. This time, a good day. All 3 nice specimens I was proud to give away. Below is the image of the prize and my baking specifics below. I hope the breads were acceptable.

 A simple curried cauliflower 
 Dave 28 May 2012 | 9:58 am This cuisine is amazing. I made this for side to take to a bbq today. Cauliflower was roasted at 350F with oil and salt for 40 minutes. In another pan I heated up vegetable oil and turmeric, coriander, cumin, mustard seed, diced jalapeno, garlic and shredded ginger. The spice and pepper mix was pureed (adding some water to slurry it up) and poured it on the roasted cauliflower. I added some currants and golden raisins and let it sit at room temperature before serving. 
 Big grain waffles, a robust preparation 
 Dave 23 May 2012 | 7:32 pm In matters of food and parenting, my favorite author is Mathew Amster-Burton (@Mamster, author of Hungry Monkey). I don&apos;t have a quote, but he says not to try to hard to get your kid to try new foods, let their peers take care of it. I like this advice and comply diligently. I&apos;d like to have a beer with him sometime (hey, if you&apos;re ever in Columbus ...). In addition to the parenting wisdom, he describes a version of overnight yeasted waffles we&apos;ve made for a long time now.The only difference is I don&apos;t separate egg yolks/whites or beat whites or anything like that.

 &apos;Food Chain&apos; Filmmaker on Farmworker Exploitation, Fair Pay 
 Joanne Camas 11 Jul 2012 | 2:00 pm Documentary filmmaker Sanjay Rawal gave Epicurious a look behind the scenes of Food Chain, his film about the lives of farmworkers in the U.S. In part one he discussed the supermarket industry, which produce is most difficult to harvest, and surprising information he learned while researching the topic. Here Rawal describes living conditions he&apos;s seen for farmworkers, talks about which well-known food celebrities and activists are supporting Food Chain, and suggests ways consumers can get involved. Your film alleges that as many as 10,000 farmworkers are kept as slaves in the U.S. Where did… 
 Toasted Coconut Chips and Other Winning Tastes 
 Regina Schrambling 11 Jul 2012 | 12:00 pm That fuzz over to the left, which looked perfectly clear in LightRoom, is one of the best things I tasted last night at the best thing the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade has ever done for NYC food writers: Move its summer show to Washington and spare us schlepping all the way over to 12th Avenue to the Javits Center to plod down miles of aisles tasting hundreds of &quot;fancy&quot; foods.

 Julia&apos;s Bouillabaisse 
 Carolina Santos-Neves 11 Jul 2012 | 9:00 am Last night I made Julia Childs&apos; Bouillabaisse recipe, the 10th recipe in our countdown to her 100th birthday. Ahhh, Bouillabaisse, how I love thee! I love all fish stews really. So much so that I ate an incredibly flavorful Bouillabaisse on Sunday that a Maine-based chef friend whipped up knowing that I would be eating Julia&apos;s version a couple of days later. The first thing that came to mind as I started mincing the leeks and onions for this Julia recipe was &quot;will this version be as tasty?&quot; In this recipe, from Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1, Julia suggests using a variety of… 
 Devoting Our Attention to Eating 
 Shauna Ahern 11 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am &quot;One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating.&quot; --Luciano Pavarotti Years ago, my brother said something sort of strange to me. &quot;I wish there were a way I could take one pill and it would cover my nutritional needs for the day. Then I wouldn&apos;t have to bother eating.&quot; I looked at him, tilted my head sideways, and kept looking at him. In the end, I didn&apos;t really say anything. What could I say? That I wasn&apos;t sure how exactly he was related to me? A day without stopping to consider the next bite? Hours…

 Awesome Shit That I Want Monday 
 michelle 9 Jul 2012 | 6:12 pm You may be aware that both Brian and I are big nerds, although in different ways. I’m a bookish history dork, and he’s a fantasy game-lover. And what are fantasy game-lovers suckers for? Dice. Granted, these“What’s for dinner”dice are run-of-the-mill six-sided dice, which are admittedly not as appealing to the aspiring Dungeon Master as their twenty-sided brethren, but still: when you can work a die roll into meal preparation, you’re four-fifths of the way to getting your Level 5 Chaotic-Good Rogue Eladrin of a spouse/partner/SO/roommate/etc to start… 
 Run Rabbit Run 
 michelle 8 Jul 2012 | 3:35 pm A preliminary note of caution: if you (1) are six years old, (2) have a pet bunny or (3) are my mother-in-law, you’re going to want to scroll right past the first photo in this post. You may want a parent or guardian to do the scrolling for you and tell you when you can open your eyes again. I’ll wait a minute while you go get him or her. Ready? Okay, SCROLL! Yeah, that’s a rabbit. Brian’s been wanting rabbit for a while, so I obliged this Thursday with rabbit sausage from Cindy Pawlcyn’s Big Small Plates. There’s really no good way to photograph a dead…

 michelle 3 Jul 2012 | 10:23 pm You’d think I’d have learned my lesson about farmer’s market-darling vegetables with the ramps. But no; like a sucker, I spent the better part of my evening fussing over squash blossoms. (Eventually, I called it a night and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.) I’m on vacation this week. I guess you could call it a“staycation,”except that that particular portmanteau makes me want to throw hot milk into a kitten’s eyes. Vacations that don’t involve travel usually involve two things for me: (1) a random act of body modification and (2)… 
 Shit With Screwed Up Priorities Monday 
 michelle 2 Jul 2012 | 8:48 pm Food and kitchenware loving peoples of the world, I think we’re going off the rails on a bit of a crazy train. A foodie-type email list to which I subscribed recently commended the Herriott Grace e-shop to me, and while browsing it, I found this spoon. I read the listing very carefully, noting that the TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLAR price tag is for a single spoon only, meaning that this spoon costs $18.46 per inch. No where in the listing did it indicate that: This spoon was carved from a piece of the True Cross. This spoon was carved from a branch pruned from the White Tree of Gondor. 
 It’s the name of a town, but it’s also the name of a nut. 
 michelle 30 Jun 2012 | 9:51 pm One more reason not to like our buyers: because of all the madness, I have not yet had the opportunity to bust out the ice cream maker. I mean, it’s the last week of June already! One-third of the summer is gone, and all I’ve done is line Haagen Dasz’s pockets. UNCOOL. Strawberry season is practically gone, and I was seriously deficient in butterfat at my last checkup. My efforts were further stymied by the dogs, who took out the bag of peaches bought with ice cream-making designs. See, we thought we’d put up a gate blocking the front hall of the new loft for…

 To relish once again — Regaining her appetite after cancer treatment 
 JoeAnn Hart 11 Jul 2012 | 11:26 am Back in the 1920s, all-white-food parties were all the rage, with fashionable hostesses serving up such wan delights as poached sole in cream glaze, vanilla cocktails, and meringues. My take on this concept? Blech.But one day last summer, I celebrated — if that is the word for it — my first all-white food day. Tepid oatmeal with milk for breakfast, cool clam chowder for lunch, and a warmish baked potato for dinner. The day’s diet had nothing to do with retro style, and everything to do with cancer treatment and its handmaidens of mouth sores and nausea. All I could stomach was soft,… 
 Blogging the salmon — Will the salmon continue to return to Bristol Bay? 
 Culinate staff 11 Jul 2012 | 7:11 am Fishing activist Paul Greenberg — author of the book Four Fish — is blogging on the New York Times this summer about the great run of salmon in Alaska&apos;s Bristol Bay. The bay is under threat from mining interests who would like to extract the area’s other natural resource: precious metals. So Greenberg is on the scene, recording what may be the end of the line for the bay’s salmon population. from Sift 
 Eating op-eds — Questioning the conventional wisdom 
 Culinate staff 10 Jul 2012 | 7:23 am The New York Times has gone foodie on its op-ed pages lately, with three opinions challenging conventional food-related wisdom.Here on Culinate, columnist Matthew Amster-Burton has expressed skepticism of the traditional pieties surrounding family dinner. Now comes social science to back up the scoffing, with a study declaring that sure, family dinner matters, but overall family connectedness matters more:Our findings suggest that the effects of family dinners on children depend on the extent to which parents use the time to engage with their children and learn about their day-to-day lives. 
 Aaron Bobrow-Strain — The bread historian 
 Amy Halloran 9 Jul 2012 | 11:18 am Aaron Bobrow-Strain studies politics, especially the politics of food and agriculture. And he loves bread. In his recently published White Bread: A Social History of the Store-Bought Loaf, Bobrow-Strain kneads these two interests together. White Bread uses factory-produced bread as a lens for looking at the history of food movements in America. Bobrow-Strain traces the various attitudes toward bread specifically, and the American diet in general, that have circulated with the rise of the industrialized food system. Why did you use bread to look at food movements? I think honestly because…

 Culinate staff 9 Jul 2012 | 7:26 am First came Martha Payne, a Scottish 9-year-old so disgusted by her school’s lunch offerings that she started a blog about it titled Never Seconds. Her blog went viral — and her school got mad, banning her from taking any more photos of her meals. On the Wired blog Superbug, science writer Maryn McKenna wasn’t pleased: Here we have a kid who got excited enough about feeding children well that she not only changed the food in her own district — within two weeks, officials were allowing children in her school to have “unlimited salads, fruit and bread,” which apparently was the…

 Scalloped Potato Gratin 
 14 Jun 2012 | 11:27 am I was passing through the kitchen yesterday trying to come up with a quick and easy side dish to go with the steak we were going to cook Tony for Father&apos;s Day on Sunday. My mind instantly went to potatoes and I realized that I didn&apos;t get around to posting the delicious scalloped potatoes that I made for him for his birthday! Super easy side dish especially if you use the slicer attachment on you food processor. He loved them and might just be seeing a repeat performance on Sunday! See all the cheesy goodness with the delicious little browned bits that everyone fights over? 
 The Birthday Boy&apos;s Bourbon Country Style Ribs 
 21 May 2012 | 11:08 am Tony loves meat. I mean he really loves meat. I think if he were pressed to answer, pork would come first, beef second and then everything else just because. I knew for his birthday he would want some meat. As luck would have it I found some very reasonably priced boneless country style ribs when I was shopping. Lucky Tony! I made the marinade the night before and added the meat to it in the morning. Once we tasted it I realized this marinade would be perfect for just about any meat that is being grilled. Can&apos;t wait to try it on some pork chops…

 Bluxome Street Winery 
 Erin 20 Jun 2012 | 7:00 am Apparently there’s a winery just two short blocks away from my apartment and I didn’t know about it for the entire year I’ve lived here. I could chalk up my misstep to a lot of various excuses but in my defense it’s a little bit hidden and I’m a tad oblivious at times. Thankfully a post on the LiveSOMA blog alerted me to their existence. Of course, in the interest of full-disclosure, what initially made my visit to Bluxome Street Winery a top priority was the knowledge that a man who sharpened knives would be parked outside their monthly soiree known at the… 
 Goat Cheese and Strawberry Grilled Cheese 
 Erin 18 Jun 2012 | 10:42 am Note: This post was originally published on Eat Boutique. Grilled cheese is my life. Or it was from the ages of 2 through 12. Back then I would happily have eaten a grilled cheese with a glass of milk for lunch every single day. If that meal was then followed by a Today’s Special marathon (especially if it included the Muffy gets her tonsils out episode and an hour or two of Barbie doll accessory organization then I was the happiest kid on the block. Unfortunately, it seems my mini-diva self wasn’t very kind to my sandwich chef aka grandma. I don’t recall how the… 
 14 Fancy Foodie Nail Polish Names I Love 
 Erin 11 Jun 2012 | 9:19 pm I know that a lot of people (myself definitely included) love reading the names of cosmetics and get a kick out of the clever tuns of phrase that are stenciled onto various lipsticks, blush compacts, and eye shadows.  I’ve also noticed that when it comes to my manicure and pedicure addiction the choice of polish is definitely swayed by what the color is called. For instance, I spent multiple months two winters ago alternating between OPI’s Black Cherry Chutney and Mrs. O’Leary’s BBQ simply because the names sounded delicious. It helped that each of these colors…

I’m a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I flipped through Sophie Dahl’s new cookbook, Very Fond of Food, admired the pictures tremendously, and even made a delightful recipe without having a clue as to who she was. After thoroughly stuffing my face, with what just might become my new go-to lunch, I looked her up online and discovered that Sophie is a former fashion model, contributor to British Vogue, cooking show presenter, and is married to Jamie Cullum.

 Caramel-Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars 
 jennifer 9 Jul 2012 | 5:38 pm On my refrigerator, there is a little card from Penzeys that reads, &quot;Love people. Cook them tasty food.&quot; With all the things I bake, sometimes I like to come up with something especially for a particular person. In the case of these bars, my intention was to make something for Quinn. I incorporated a few of his favorite things, like caramel and chocolate. If I had been making these for anyone else, I would likely have included some chopped nuts. When given the choice, he opted to leave those out of the equation. In this case, I have to admit that he was right. 
 Weekly Mix 
 jennifer 6 Jul 2012 | 11:30 am Happy Friday! I hope everyone had a fabulous 4th of July! We kept things low-key around here. Quinn took off a few days this week, so that indirectly meant that I have taken off a few days, too. Never fear, though. I&apos;ll be baking in full-force again next week. Before I start sharing all the good stuff, I want to introduce you to a new feature on BoB. I&apos;ve partnered with KitchenAid to help try out new ways to share and recommend their products that I love. Check out the storefront! 
 Lemon Ice-Box Bars 
 jennifer 5 Jul 2012 | 2:07 pm I&apos;m sure at least a few of you are thinking that lemon bars are not exactly ground-breaking material. But, these are not your typical lemon bars. No, these are far better. They&apos;re like lemon bars for grown-ups. 
 Strawberry Cream Cheese Bread 
 jennifer 2 Jul 2012 | 10:03 am It&apos;s been a while since I made a quick bread. They&apos;re truly one of my favorite things to bake, although I don&apos;t seem to make them often. Anyway, I decided to take advantage of all the summer berries by making a simple bread with strawberries. Of course, what goes better with strawberries than cream cheese? Granted, I&apos;m pretty much always looking for an excuse to use cream cheese, but this is truly a fabulous use for it. 
 Weekly Mix and Birthday Giveaway #5 
 jennifer 29 Jun 2012 | 11:46 am Happy Friday, everyone! Can you believe it&apos;s almost July 4th?!? We don&apos;t have big plans other than watching the Hudson River fireworks from our roof. No matter your plans, I hope you all have a happy and safe holiday. If you&apos;re looking for some baking inspiration, I&apos;ve put together some ideas for you. As I was looking through all the sweet things I pinned this week, I immediately noticed a pattern. Cherries! While I&apos;ve yet to get in gear this summer with baking with cherries, there are lots of food bloggers already on top of things.

 Low-Cal Summer Cocktails 
 Uli Iserloh 8 Jul 2012 | 2:57 pm A big part of the Skinny Chef philosophy is enjoying life and celebrating food. For those concerned with calories, a good happy hour doesn&apos;t have to ruin your diet... especially with these cocktails clocking in at 200 calories..

 Garlic Scapes, Cosmic Balance and a Pan-Fried Sea Bass Fillet 
 Jonny&amp;Amy 23 Jun 2012 | 3:52 am Now that we’re done with our annual yogic vigil of the summer solstice and our cosmic karma has been rebalanced, it’s time for us to concede that we’re not really very good food bloggers. Not that any remaining readers won’t have noticed this of late, given the infrequency of our postings, but hey, karmic balance is a lengthy and troublesome business don’t you know. However, I refer not to our lack of new content as much as to the fact that until comparatively recently we hadn’t tried garlic scapes. A few years back there was an explosion in the popularity… 
 Pincho Moruno: Hidden Waters Reveal Miraculous Pork Belly Kebabs 
 Jonny&amp;Amy 6 Jun 2012 | 6:26 am St. George, the patron saint of England, whose plucky, dragon-slaying derring-do is taken as emblematic of the English spirit, far from being a native of the British Isles, or for that matter, far from ever having come close to visiting them, was actually an adventurous squire of the modern-day country of Georgia who lived around the third century AD. In a similar vein, Spain’s national icon, the highly venerated black Madonna of Guadalupe, to whom thousands flock annually, was unlikely to have been a Christian and there is some doubt that she was a virgin either. The Moorish legend of… 
 Portuguese Soup with Chouriço Oil: The Next Big Thing 
 Jonny&amp;Amy 9 May 2012 | 2:17 pm Right before it was yesterday’s news and tossed on the cultural junk pile as passé, everything was the next big thing. Devotees of Anthony Bourdain will know that as of two weeks ago, Croatian cuisine is the new black. Prior to all this, somewhere between Spanish food blowing up into our collective consciousness and the advent of Ecuador in the global gastronomic stakes, in 2010 Portugal flickered briefly into view, largely on the strength of David Liete, before vanishing under the rising tide of new and undiscovered. Not so for Dan Gilbert and Carla Gonçalves of Philadelphia’s… 
 Discovering Mamposteao 
 Jonny&amp;Amy 3 May 2012 | 5:17 am Named for the grandson of Puerto Rico’s first governor, the southern city of Ponce is blessed with appropriately distinguished architecture. The equal of few in the Americas, it is a delightful surprise for the visitor. That conquering Americans were responsible for the preservation of the city’s historic district is equally surprising. Prior to defeat in the Spanish-American war, Ponce’s status as an important industrial city in the Spanish Americas was secure. Built on sugar, coffee, rum and banking, and populated by a rash of European immigration, the Victorian era saw…

I told you I would try and hold on to my promise from the last post. To celebrate our attempt to get back in the blog game we are offering a pretty awesome contest.

 A Whole Foods in South Austin Opening June 19th 
 Michael Chu 16 Jun 2012 | 1:39 am There&apos;s a long awaited Whole Foods Market opening up in the Shops at Arbor Trails shopping complex (at MoPac Expressway and William Cannon) across the parking lot from the South Austin Costco. All day today, media had the opportunity to tour the new Whole Foods Market four days before the grand opening on Tuesday, June 19, 2012. Here&apos;s a quick sneak peek of the new market. At 39,600 sq ft, this newest Whole Foods Market is a little less than half the size of the flagship Whole Foods on Lamar in downtown Austin. The space is beautifully lit by a mix a natural and artificial lights… 
 What I Ate: Michi Ramen (5/18/2012&amp;6/8/2012) 
 Tina Jiang 13 Jun 2012 | 12:50 am Finally, authetic ramen in Austin! Ramen is one of our favorite foods, and, when we lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, we ate it regularly. Since we moved to Austin, it&apos;s been a major challenge finding good ramen. We&apos;ve tried a few places in town - Kome Sushi Kitchen, Musashino Sushi, Bonsai - and have been disappointed. When we visited Houston in January, we tried six different ramens and still didn&apos;t find what we were looking for - some were simply no good, others were not authetic (more fusion style with Vietnamese or Thai flavors in the broths). The soy sauce based ramen… 
 Credit Scores and What Really Affects Them 
 Michael Chu 23 Feb 2012 | 8:51 am Over the years, I&apos;ve heard a lot of different theories about how to increase your credit score. Most of them are grounded in some truth, but are based on incomplete knowledge. For example, a lot of people say that given the choice to buy a car with cash or finance it, you should finance the car to build credit. Although, that is generally true over time (in the short term, the auto loan will actually hurt most credit scores), there are often better ways to increase one&apos;s credit score without the initial negative effects and without having to pay real money on interest. A credit… 
 What I Ate: December 31, 2011 (Taste of Ethiopia) 
 Tina Jiang 3 Jan 2012 | 10:03 pm We met up with some friends at Taste of Ethiopia (1100 Grand Avenue Pkwy Pflugerville TX, 78613 512-251-4053) for lunch. This was our first time dining here, and it won&apos;t be the last. The food was great, the owner (her name is Woinee Mariam) and staff were so nice, and there&apos;s something so special about sharing a meal with friends where everyone ate out of the same plate. The detailed descriptions below are from the restaurant&apos;s website http://tasteofethiopiaaustin.com. (more…) 
 What I Ate: December 30th, 2011 (Austin Cake Ball) 
 Tina Jiang 3 Jan 2012 | 9:32 pm We discovered Austin Cake Ball (3401 Esperanza Crossing, Suite #104 Austin, TX 78758 512-215-3633) about two years ago. We hadn&apos;t had cake balls before that and had only read about them (and it didn&apos;t sound very tasty). Well, when we had these cake balls, we knew we had stumbled upon something great! Recently we tried cake balls from another local bakery and it only validated our high opinions of Austin Cake Ball. They can be purchased locally or online at www.austincakeball.com. We bought half a dozen which came in a convenient tin (larger size tins are also available).

 North Park Neighbors: Coffee&amp;Tea Collective 
 Jay Porter 11 Jul 2012 | 7:46 pm This is the first in a series of posts about some of our neighbors, who I see shaping North Park into perhaps the most vibrant and stimulating neighborhood in San Diego. Every city neighborhood needs great coffee shops, and in North Park we have several. The newest is Daniel Holcomb’s striking Coffee&amp;Tea Collective. Daniel sources and roasts all the beans himself, and the Collective makes both pour-overs and espresso drinks with extreme attention to detail. I see some inspiration from Intelligentsia’s cafe on Abbott Kinney in Venice, but clearly this is a project driven by…

 Ham Mac and Cheese Recipe 
 Bobby 10 Jul 2012 | 12:47 pm Ham and macaroni and cheese go perfect together. I am always looking for different types of meat to go into my mac and cheese, and ham was a good choice. You can use several types of pasta for this recipe, such as macaroni, shells, or penne. The process to making this dish is very easy. After the noodles are done boiling, a delicious cheese sauce is prepared. The sauce is mixed with the pasta and ham and placed into a baking dish. The dish is then topped with buttery breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese and baked in the oven. This is also a great way to use up leftover ham. Ham macaroni and cheese… 
 Baked Tacos Recipe 
 Bobby 6 Jul 2012 | 1:46 pm I never thought about baking tacos in the oven before but it makes perfect sense. I really enjoyed how everything was warm and the cheese was melted. The process of making these delicious baked tacos is very simple. The taco meat is browned in the pan and seasoned, it is then mixed with refried beans, stuffed into taco shells, and topped with cheese. The tacos are then placed into a casserole dish and baked in the oven for a few minutes. After the tacos are done baking you can top them with your favorite condiments such a salsa, lettuce, tomato, and guacamole. If you want the tacos crunchy,… 
 Honey Mustard Chicken Wings Recipe 
 Bobby 29 Jun 2012 | 3:30 pm There is just something about that flavor of honey mustard sauce brushed on grilled chicken wings that I love. These wings are not just brushed with a sauce but they are marinated for even more flavor. The marinade comes ingredients such a BBQ sauce, hot sauce, Dijon mustard, orange zest, and honey. One ingredient that I really found to stand out in this recipe is the orange zest. Adding orange zest to the marinade delivers and interesting and unique flavored to the chicken wings once they are done grilling. If you want the most flavor, the chicken wings should be placed into the marinade… 
 Steak Gorgonzola Recipe 
 Bobby 26 Jun 2012 | 11:55 am The combination of grilled steak and Gorgonzola cheese is truly delicious and amazing. This recipe for steak Gorgonzola consists of marinated steak, alfredo sauce, Gorgonzola cheese, and pasta. Apparently they have this at the Olive Garden, but I have never tried it. The original recipe called for a balsamic vinegar glaze but I could not find it, so I decided to leave it out. The steak is marinated in Italian dressing, fresh rosemary, and lemon juice. The steak should marinate for at least an hour and if you want the best results, you should allow the steak to marinate overnight in the… 
 Avocado Fries Recipe 
 Bobby 23 Jun 2012 | 1:46 pm These avocado fries are a very unique and delicious appetizer. If you are looking for something different to serve at a party or just to make at home, you should give this recipe a try. Basically this recipe consists of sliced avocados that are rolled in breadcrumbs and then fried until golden brown. Rolling the avocado slices in the breading mixture does require a little work, but its well worth it. The coated avocados do not take very long to cook in the oil, so be careful not to burn them. They should be golden brown in about 30-60 seconds. The highlight of this recipe is the cilantro…

 The History of the Martini 
 Kate 9 Jul 2012 | 7:40 am Picture courtesy of Wikimedia  (As with any post or book dealing with Food History, the typical caveats, dealing with regionalism and incomplete records, apply.) For such a classic cocktail, the history of the Martini is murky, with various stories being thrown about as truths, when in fact most of these are half-truths at best, out and out fabrications at worst.  The most common story out there is that“Professor”Jerry Thomas invented the drink in San Francisco, and documented it in one of the first book of cocktail recipes called How to Mix Drinks.

 The Lambics 
 Kate 3 Jul 2012 | 8:06 am  Out of the entire catalog of Belgian Beers, there is one category that mystifies me. And being born and bred in the United States, where beer ignorance is part of a national DNA, I hadn’t even heard of this style of beer until I was way past my thirties. I am speaking the Lambics, of course; a style of beer noted for its ties to beers historical roots, what with its emphasis on open-air, spontaneous fermentation, as well as the wacky notion that beer tastes better after it ages in a cask.  As we come from a culture where mega-breweries harp on the idea of“freshness…

 Top 10 movie theater candy 
 Amy 15 Jun 2012 | 3:44 am Summer is upon us, and that probably means you’ll be spending a lot of time at the movie theater. Forget about the popcorn (Here’s an insider secret from someone who used to work at a movie theater: it’s usually stale because a lot of places store uneaten popcorn in trash bags for the next day); you’ll enjoy your movie a lot more with a candy treat–and you won’t have to worry about getting butter everywhere. (Image Courtesy of PlacesInTown.com) Here’s a list of the best movie theater candy that will be worth your $12 (that’s about what… 
 Candy Review: Wild Ophelia Peanut Butter and Banana Milk Chocolate Bar 
 ElizahLeigh 13 Jun 2012 | 5:54 am Mass marketed chocolate isn’t necessarily bad–in fact some of it is downright tasty. However, since it’s easily accessible, we’re far less inclined to put it on a towering pedestal in the same way that we might with costly yet typically higher quality artisan confections that have limited distribution. Got a Butterfinger hankering? Pine away all you want, but you’d be wasting precious energy since the flaky nutty chocolate dipped sensation can be found inside any old corner store, pharmacy, or rest stop across America. On the other hand, the next time… 
 Candy Review: Starburst FaveReds 
 HeatherR 8 Jun 2012 | 6:27 am Whenever I dig into a package of mixed fruity flavored candies, I have an entirely predictable response: savor the purples first, then the pinks and reds. (And only after I’ve plucked out those flavors will I offer to share what remains.) Even though artificial grape receives the full measure of my devotion, I’m awfully fond of red candies, too. It doesn’t even matter to me whether the reds are cherry or strawberry or something else; I like them all. So, during a recent meander through a gas station candy aisle, I was thrilled to note that the Starburst selection included a… 
 Candy Review: Panda Blueberry Licorice 
 ElizahLeigh 6 Jun 2012 | 6:54 am Traditional licorice candy isn’t everybody’s cup of tea, but it certainly has an enduring presence whether tucked inside the nightstand of a grandparent or happily gobbled up by boisterous teens in the back of a dark movie theater. Made from Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract mixed with wheat flour, molasses, and sugar, the deep dark chewy sensation–depending on which resource you consult–is also either incredibly therapeutic for the treatment of sore throats and respiratory ailments or bad news for Candy AddictsÂ® who don’t want to fall victim to a premature… 
 Candy Review: Lollipops from Blanton’s Candies 
 HeatherR 31 May 2012 | 6:39 am On a recent vacation in southeastern Tennessee, in which I must have wandered starry-eyed through at least a dozen fudge and candy shops, I kept bumping into these Lollipops from Blanton’s Candies. When I’m on the prowl for new sweets, lollipops donâ€™t often register on my“intriguing candy”radar, probably because I prefer to chew my hard candies rather than suck on them. I find the crunch much more satisfying than the dissolve. But these lollipops caught my attention because of their beautiful, shiny appearance. I loved the bright, cheerful, whimsical colors.

 cool girl 
 katy 11 Jul 2012 | 7:59 am One of the tough things about throwing a party is that there’s never enough time to get everything you want done before the doorbell rings. There have been times that I’m not even out of the shower by the time our parties are actually scheduled to start, because I’ve spent the last seven hours frosting a made-from-scratch cake or running out to buy last minute boxes of powdered sugar. (I know, tough life.) But Chad and I had a housewarming party a few weeks ago, and amazingly, shockingly, I actually had forty five minutes before the party started to get dressed…

 katy 9 Jul 2012 | 3:06 am I actually made this at the very beginning of the summer, and can’t even believe I haven’t posted it yet! Read through the whole recipe—you’ll be shocked how easy this is. I keep a soft spreadable cheese on hand all the time because 1) I love it, 2) it’s easy to set out when friends come over, and 3) this amazing dish. It’s almost like cheating—throw together a few ingredients that are easy to keep in the fridge, and dinner is done! These last few weeks have been so crazy, but our house is finally basically unpacked—…

But the best EVER was getting an extra special box at our mailbox from Parker! In it was this dress, which I’m obsessed with, and a gorgeous top I can’t wait to show you guys! …

But La-Z-Boy has so much more! Their website is full of amazing, customizable, comfortable furniture that are stylish but still completely classic.  I ended up falling completely in love with a sectional sofa—…

So what do you guys think? Is it time to just embrace my pale skin and be done with it? I’d rather have pale, healthy skin than put myself at risk any day of the week. So this summer, I’m all about staying protected (and as a bonus, taking great care of my skin reduces the chances of…

 Why make your own bread? 
 hornedfox 12 Jul 2012 | 1:41 am I wondered why we go to the efforts we do to bake our own bread. In todays society we want everything quicker, faster, NOW! Of course we want it cheaper to and &quot;can you do a deal?&quot; On another post I asked with others about bread making courses in the East of England and have spent a delightful hour touring different real bakers web sites seeing this on the Barfoot Bakery Website I thought I would remind us why our own baked bread is best What&apos;s wrong with modern bread? The concept of &quot;modern&quot; bread changed in 1961, when the standard loaf was effectively redesigned. The British Baking… 
 Stronger flour, weaker bread. 
 Grenage 12 Jul 2012 | 12:55 am Greetings, As I&apos;m still a bit green, I&apos;ve been using a supermarket flour (Asda) with excellent results; it&apos;s 11%. I was bought a fair amount of branded (Allison&apos;s) white bread flour, which is 12%. - and I&apos;m having failure after failure. The symptoms are that the loaf doesn&apos;t really proof properly, slops all over the place so that it flattens in the oven, then has immense oven spring - resulting in huge wholes in the middle of the loaf. After drop-kicking a fourth failure and conceding defeat, I thought I&apos;d ask here. I used Allison&apos;s many years ago for normal yeasted bread,…

 Bolillos with poolish 
 baybakin 11 Jul 2012 | 10:14 pm Living in San Diego for school, I gained a love for the little rolls brought from the local panaderia down the street. Like little mini batards, pulled from the oven and placed in bins alongside racks of pan dulces. Alas, here in the oakland hills the closest panaderia is a 15-20 minute drive away, and the bolillos just aren&apos;t quite like the ones I used to get in San Diego. Most of the recipies I&apos;ve seen are straight-dough, and being that I can&apos;t leave well enough alone, I have developed the following recipe, based off of the Poolish Baguettes in Hamelman&apos;s Bread. The…

 jlach 11 Jul 2012 | 8:12 pm I&apos;ve been trying to make the perfect biscuits for months now. The picture with the jalapeno biscuits is from about a month ago. I had it down. They were perfect, even the plain buttermilk. Now, I can&apos;t, for the life of me, recreate them. The other pictures are of what mine keep coming out like now. I have no clue what&apos;s going on. I&apos;ve bought all new ingredients, and am even weighing them for the recipe.  Here&apos;s the recipe I was using: 2.25 C SR Flour 1/2 C Butter 1.75 C Buttermilk 450 for six minutes, then rotate and throw another pan under to stop browning for about another 10…

 Steak Fingers with Gravy 
 Ree 9 Jul 2012 | 2:36 am When my nephews Nic and Stu came to the ranch to visit a few weeks ago, they worked cattle, built fence, hauled hay, mowed, weedeated, and passed out from exhaustion by seven every evening. They also got poison ivy, a few hundred chigger bites, and lots of scratches from the barbed wire. Marlboro Man and I love building happy memories for them every summer! Ahem. Nic and Stu also ate my cooking, and on the night before they went back to Dallas I made steak fingers and gravy—quite possibly the most fitting meal to feed two teenage boys after a long two weeks of hard labor. They ate it. 
 Strawberry Sparkle Cake 
 Ree 2 Jul 2012 | 4:34 am Get ready to have some fun! I made this cake yesterday for the first time, after having flirted with it for weeks. My father-in-law had brought it to my attention after noticing it in a collection of his great grandmother’s recipes, and when my father-in-law brings a recipe to my attention, it’s the same as him saying“Will you make this for me sometime?”My father-in-law loves sweets, you see, and he also knows that I have a soft spot where he’s concerned. Delivering him sweets is one of my favorite things to do. Different versions of Strawberry Sparkle Cake… 
 Grillin’ Recipe Contest: Winner Videos! 
 Ree 27 Jun 2012 | 10:37 am The second annual Bush’s Grillin’Beans Recipe Contest has been so much fun. The recipe winners traveled to the ranch at the first of June for the big video shoot and cookout, and we all went away having made new friends. It always amazes me that a group of strangers can come together for a weekend and wind up having such a blast together. Here are the four videos of the winners preparing their scrumptiousness on camera. Please pay attention to the winners and not to me, as it appears I did not select a wildly flattering top. At all.

 Easy Calzones 
 Ree 25 Jun 2012 | 4:58 am What’s the difference between a calzone and a pizza pocket? This is one of the mysteries of life I hope to one day know the answer to. We love calzones in our house! Always have, always will. They’re easy to eat, and you can fill them with whatever ol’pizza-friendly ingredients you like. You can serve them with marinara as a dipping sauce or you can pour marinara sauce over the calzones after they’re baked. And you can make them with your favorite homemade pizza crust, which I’m happy to do…OR you can do what I did last night and take this easy,… 
 Pineapple Fruit Bowls 
 Ree 22 Jun 2012 | 6:58 am I just realized something. Several of my recipes over the past month or so have been cold ones. What does it all mean? Oh. I remember now. It’s summer! This is actually less of a recipe and more of a fun way to serve a fruit salad to your family, at a luncheon, or at a summer barbecue. The“dressing”is simple, sweet, and lovely. Grab a pineapple! Then say your goodbyes.   Aaaaaaaaaarrrgh! You had to do it. There was no other way.   Turn the pineapple on its side and slice horizontally, trying as much as possible to go right down…

 Where do you want to eat tonight? A review of the YP.com app #YPcrave #spon 
 Anne-Marie Nichols 11 Jul 2012 | 12:45 pm Moving to Athens, Georgia from Colorado has been made a bit easier by finding new restaurants. I’m blown away by the variety of places to eat out here from barbecue and Southern (of course) to Mexican and Vietnamese. There is even Jamaican restaurant here that serves amazing jerk chicken! As I’ve explored local restaurants, I’ve been looking up reviews on the YP.com app on my iPhone, which you can download in iTunes or on Google Play.

 Filtrete Odor Reduction Filters help create a healthier and sweeter smelling home 
 Anne-Marie Nichols 10 Jul 2012 | 9:23 am When we moved into our new home here in humid Georgia, I was concerned about the moldy smell in our basement where my office is. Even though it’s a walk-out basement with plenty of sunshine and big windows, it still had that musty smell. We immediately plugged in air fresheners and used scented candles, but they only masked the smell and didn’t get rid of it. A few things helped get rid of it such as mopping the floors with a disinfectant and using a LG Dehumdifier. My next step is to replace the basement air conditioning filter with a new Filtrete Odor Reduction Filter. Filtrete… 
 How to save money at the grocery store #infographic 
 Anne-Marie Nichols 10 Jul 2012 | 4:53 am Here are some tips fro All You! magazine magazine to help you save money by avoiding spending traps at the grocery store. However, check out the comments about boneless chicken on the All You! page where the Save Money on Groceries infographic originally appeared. I’m going to agree with some of the posters that buying boneless chicken on sale is probably a good deal - unless you make stock from chicken bones, that is! I’ve also heard from friends who are dog owners that giving your dog RAW chicken bones is OK. However, cooked chicken bones will splinter, so that’s a big no-no. How do… 
 Cucumber, Feta and Red Onion Salad 
 Anne-Marie Nichols 9 Jul 2012 | 2:19 pm I’ve always used NAKANO Rice Vinegar to make sushi rice. However, now that I’ve become more familiar with their products, I use their rice vinegar in any recipe that calls for other types of vinegars. For example, this summer, we’ve been making a lot of salads, so I’ve been making salad dressing with NAKANO Rice Vinegar (instead of red wine vinegar), olive oil and some garden seasoning spices. Also, now that I live in the South, use Nakano’s flavored rice vinegars (like their Red Pepper Seasoned Rice Vinegar) on sautéed greens. I even used NAKANO to season a new crystal wine carafe…

 Zucchini-Coconut Muffins: tropical zukes 
 PJ Hamel 11 Jul 2012 | 11:01 pm Zucchini. Coconut. Not a familiar pairing, you say? Well, maybe not to those of us who grew up knowing only enough about zucchini, a.k.a.“summer squash,”to dislike it. And those whose only thought of coconut was a Mounds bar. But for the younger foodies out there, zucchini and coconut go together as naturally as strawberries, bean sprouts, and avocado. Or chocolate and gingerbread. Lime and mint. How about pumpkin and Parmesan? Charlotte, our newest test kitchen baker, is one such young foodie. She’s added a fresh, 20-something perspective to the recipes you see printed in… 
 Lemon Meringue Cupcakes: Pie baker or cupcake maker: Where do you fit in? 
 MaryJane Robbins 9 Jul 2012 | 2:40 am So, did the title of the blog get you riled up? No worries, I’ve no intention of starting a turf war nor am I trying to stick labels on anyone. I was just pondering the other day where I fall in the baking scheme of things, and thought it was an interesting topic. As a baker, I definitely fall more into the cake category than the pie category. I love to eat pie and I’m pretty happy with my pie making skills, it just isn’t something that floats my boat the same way that making cake or cookies does. Maybe it’s a bit like fashion. I can admire and even desire to own a… 
 Lemon-Blueberry Pancakes: blues you can use 
 PJ Hamel 5 Jul 2012 | 11:01 pm Every time I see a picture of pancakes, I want to drop everything, run into the kitchen, and whip myself up a quick plateful. So why is it that I only make pancakes about once a year – if that? There’s nothing so compelling as a hot-off-the-griddle pancake, spread with soft butter and drizzled with thick, dark Grade B maple syrup. Or, in the case of the pancakes pictured above: tangy-sweet lemon syrup. So what stops me from making pancakes? Inertia, plain and simple. 7 a.m. isn’t exactly my finest hour of the day. The treadmill’s been trod, Facebook checked, emails…

 County Fair Fried Dough: happy fry-day! 
 PJ Hamel 27 Jun 2012 | 11:01 pm Fried dough. Two simple, straightforward words. Fried. Dough. Yet what a wonderful metamorphosis takes place when a simple flour/butter/water dough hits a scant 1/2″of hot oil. POP goes the dough, coming suddenly to life as air, trapped inside, expands to create big bubbles. And what was formerly a soft, pale round of dough becomes golden brown and snapping crisp, the tasty essence of why we love doughnuts and french fries. It’s all about that crisp deep-fried crust and flavor – even though 3/8″of peanut oil could scarcely qualify as“deep”frying. Have you…

 Crushed garlic in a jar (Recipe: moqueca a baiana, Brazilian fish stew) 
 Lydia (The Perfect Pantry) 11 Jul 2012 | 9:15 pm First published in November 2006, this updated pantry ingredient post features new photos, links, and tweaks to the recipe. I learned the original recipe for this Brazilian fish stew from Botucatu Restaurant in Boston, which closed a couple of years ago. Another scandalous confession: I always have crushed garlic in a jar in my fridge. Aaaaayyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeee! I can hear the screams.&quot;What is she doing with that stuff in her pantry???&quot;Well, right up front, let me say that garlic in a jar is never ever better than fresh minced garlic. Never. Ever. So why do I always have a jar… 
 Recipe for cucumber ribbon salad with ranch-style buttermilk herb dressing 
 Lydia (The Perfect Pantry) 9 Jul 2012 | 9:06 pm Necessity -- or is it forgetfulness? or humidity? -- being the mother of invention, this cucumber ribbon salad owes its spectacular ranch-style buttermilk herb dressing to a great pantry, and to my strong desire not to drive five miles to the grocery store for a quart of buttermilk on an unbearably hazy-hot-humid day. Powdered buttermilk, a baking pantry staple that will keep perfectly happy in the refrigerator for months, contributes the characteristic tangy ranch flavor, with a boost from Greek yogurt and a small amount of mayonnaise. I like the combination of dill, parsley and chives from… 
 Recipe for leek and mushroom quiche 
 Lydia (The Perfect Pantry) 7 Jul 2012 | 9:22 pm Trust me on this: you must have a basic quiche recipe in your repertoire, and always, always, always a package of store-bought pie crust in the refrigerator. You&apos;ll be amazed at the magic you can work with eggs, cheese and a bit of dough, plus whatever else you find in the pantry, especially when guests drop in, as they tend to do in summer. Think of this as your all-purpose quiche formula: change the cheese, swap out the veggies, use different herbs and seasonings. You can&apos;t go wrong. I love meatless variations, but if you have some rotisserie chicken or smoked salmon or cooked…

When I find a new recipe and it calls for garlic, I always quadruple the amount without question! Now, we are curing our first harvest of garlic that we started in the garden last fall. We sowed our first sets of seed garlic cloves in the fall following the colder climate method, and is typically the last crop to go into the garden before winter. Garlic is usually planted in the late fall and harvested the following early summer. Here are some general tips and guidelines for growing your own garlic! Get…

There are actually eighteen ways you can eat crawfish this year at the Fest, including the bread and pie I mentioned above,  and  there is the Crawfish Sausage Po-Boy, Crawfish Bisque, Crawfish Remoulade, Louisiana Crawfish Po-Boy, Boiled Crawfish (Suck da Head, Peel da Tail), Crawfish Sack, Crawfish Beignets, Louisiana Crawfish Etoufee, Cajun Crawfish Rice, Fried Crawfish Tails,… 
 Gumbo Number Nine 
 Ryan Boudreaux 9 Jan 2012 | 12:14 pm Do you remember back in the 1990′s there was a little ditty by Lou Bega named“Mambo Number Five”! It was a number 1 hit in 1999 across many charts, including number 3 for the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. If you have never heard the song, you should take a quick listen, then come back for more reading here. Then the parody of the popular song (video below) is actually quite a laugh, as it pokes fun at the same tones, cadence, and styling, but with a set of lyrics that will make you want to go out and order some Chinese! Some time later, the parody song“Combo Number…

I’ll start with the Marketside Southwest Chopped Salad.  These salads are found in the produce section at Walmart, already bagged, and ready to go.  I don’t know if you’ve had the chance to try some of the Marketside products yet but I’ve always loved their pizza, subs, and soups.  They have such a fresh taste…

While he’s a lot more disciplined than myself, I figure every little bit helps so I do what I can.  Yogurt is one of those healthier choices.  I think healthy, filling snacks can be one of the hardest things to keep in the kitchen.  Me and Toby have had a hard time figuring out what to snack on. We can find healthy things but they don’t fill us up and that’s what you need to make it through the day, to carry you until your next meal or snack. Dannon…

 Tortilla Coast Washington DC – Read This First! 
 Adam 21 Feb 2012 | 6:49 am tortilla coast frequent diners card I have unfortunately had the experience of going to the Tortilla Coast restaurant on P and 15th street in Washington DC and have become addicted.  Not only does this Tortilla Coast location have amazing service, but the food is consistently perfect.  Not only do they cook things to order, but the managers come around to your table while and after you finish eating and if something is wrong, they actually fix it without giving any attitude. Your meal starts out with freshly made warm tortilla chips and awesome homemade salsa.  Then they ask you what… 
 Stuffed Pork Loin with Brandied Cranberry Sauce

Over the weekend our oldest, who will be twelve in a month or two, actually made an entire batch of cookies all on her own with no physical help from either of us…just the occasional question. She’s been helping more and more with making dinner and it’s been a big help in overcoming her picky eater tendencies! In fact, tonight she even helped with making dinner and didn’t balk at the addition of spinach… 
 Pizza 17 on 17th Street in Washington DC Reviewed 
 Adam 6 Dec 2011 | 1:54 pm I have always been hesitant to try a new pizza place.  I am way to particular when it comes to a perfect pizza and what I like.  The other night I was hungry and out looking for somewhere to eat when I walked by it.  I never really see a ton of people inside Pizza17 on 17th street in Washington DC, so when I was looking for dinner the other night I almost didn’t stop in.  Thank god I did because the crust and some of the toppings at Pizza17 are some of the best that I have had in the Washington DC area. 1523 17th St NW (between N Church St&amp;N Q St) Washington, DC 20036… 
 Bravo Bistro Bistro Washington DC! 
 Adam 17 Aug 2011 | 7:01 pm So I ordered food through Foodler.com from Bistro Bistro in Washington DC and for the first time the order never made it.  Foodler claimed that Bistro Bistro Washington DC got the order and Bistro Bistro claims that they never saw the order.  Regardless of what happened, I wrote to Foodler to let them know I was upset, and in Foodler fashion they called and took immediate care of me. On the other hand, I also called Bistro Bistro which is one of my favorite local Italian Restaurants.  Not only did they take care of me, but the manager got on the phone, apologized and would not let me hang…

 Can It Forward Day Giveaway! 
 Amy Sherman 11 Jul 2012 | 8:06 pm Saturday, July 14 is not only Bastille Day, it&apos;s also National Can-It-Forward Day. That event, my recent post on DIY, Canning and Preserving and a Home Canning Discovery Kit I received from Ball made me decide it was time to take the plunge and try my hand at canning. The kit had a book on canning, a special rack and lifter, some pectin and Ball jars, which you can find in just about any hardware store. Instead of making a big batch, the kit enables you to make three pint jars which was pretty easy to manage and good for a beginner like me. I made a batch of canned… 
 Bay Area BBQ Championship 2012 
 Amy Sherman 2 Jul 2012 | 7:19 pm The Oakland Fire Department BBQ team shares samples and smiles Liam Mayclem puts on his game face The Bay Area BBQ Championship is back! On Saturday July 7th, 2012, there will be baseball, beer, bbq and a really good time for all at the Oakland Coliseum. Last year I was a judge and got to eat a whole lot of BBQ with my pal and fellow judge, Liam Mayclem. It was the first year and I was happy to help lend a hand, especially because it was also a benefit for Alternative Family Services, a foster care agency in the Bay Area that supports families and kids. Here&apos;s what I learned, BBQ… 
 Learning about Certified Angus Beef 
 Amy Sherman 26 Jun 2012 | 12:50 pm Julie Boggs of Westbrook Angus Certified Angus Beef is not the same as Angus or Black Angus which you may see on everything from beef at restaurants and supermarkets to even fast food burgers. In order to be designated Certified Angus Beef, it must pass a strict set of requirements and USDA inspection and approval, and very little of it does. In fact only 1 in 4 inspected makes the grade. That&apos;s the main thing I learned when I met with ranchers, chefs and restaurateurs to learn about beef and the Certified Angus Beef brand in particular. The ranchers I met bred breeding stock and…

 Wine Road, Sonoma County 
 Amy Sherman 12 Jun 2012 | 8:27 am The view from Everett Ridge Winery Recently I was invited up to Sonoma to visit the Wine Road. The Wine Road isn&apos;t an actual road, but a winery association with a wide variety of members and their mission is to increase awareness of Northern Sonoma County. Think of it as your own personal concierge, available to craft the perfect experiences in the Alexander, Dry Creek, and Russian River Valleys. The Wine Road covers six different AVA&apos;s, represents about 150 wineries, or around half of the wineries in the region, over 50 different lodgings and produces a fantastic map of the area. I go up to… 

 
 Carrie&apos;s Sweet Life 
 
 Beefy Macaroni 
 Carrie 9 Jul 2012 | 4:30 am  When I saw Joelen post this recipe and rave about how much her son loved it I wanted to try it. Maddy has decided to not want to eat supper lately. Not a matter of not liking stuff just a matter of doesn’t want to sit long enough to eat. I thought this might slower her down enough to want to stop and eat. This reminding me a lot of my Grandma’s goulosh but baked and with cheese. Sadly it didn’t catch her enough to enjoy it. But Adam and I did. I do suggest if you are just feeding 2 1/2 people to halve this recipe or freeze half to make a later time as we ended up with… 
 Friday Favorites: What’s Cookin’ Chicago 
 Carrie 6 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am **I’m going to be sharing a favorite blog of mine every Friday of July. Today I welcome Joelen from What’s Cooking Chicago. I love her blog and find myself going there often to look for a recipe because it seems she has everything!! Thank you Joelen for the wonderful blog and sharing a recipe with my readers. Make sure to check out her blog for other great recipes.** This heat wave we’re experiencing in Chicago {among other places around the country} is making me think about other cool treats to whip up. What’s your go-to snack for crazy hot days? For me, anything I… 
 Chicken, Bacon Ranch Tacos 
 Carrie 2 Jul 2012 | 5:13 am To me you can’t have chicken and ranch without bacon. The three flavors are just meant to be married and together. So when I found and added this chicken ranch tacos to the menu I knew I had to make a couple slices of bacon to go with them. And I am so glad I did. These were great. A fun take on traditional tacos. Only thing I would do differently next time is make this sauce because I think it would really compliment them.     Print This!    Chicken Ranch Tacos (From: One Day At A Time) 2 Chicken Breast 1/2 Packet of Taco Seasoning 1 Tbsp… 
 Parmesan Crusted Fish 
 Carrie 29 Jun 2012 | 4:20 am I was at the store the other day getting some groceries. I was picking up some beef when I looked to the left and saw some fresh fish. I walked over and grabbed a package of tilapia. I got home and asked Adam what happened as I had willing just bought fish, but after loving this pesto fish so much I have been craving fish again. This news obviously couldn’t of been more exciting for my fish loving husband! The next day while on a message board I found this recipe and since many people raved about it I decided I had to give it a try. We enjoyed this, and even our 2 year old ate some, I… 
 Lasagna Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms 
 Carrie 27 Jun 2012 | 5:00 am  This months theme was bake with a fresh herb. I will admit I am not one to use fresh herbs, I used the dried more often then as I have them available and I look at the price and shy away. So this was a good challenge for me. I wasn’t feel overly creative with how to add a fresh herb to a baked good so I decided to take the savory route. These mushrooms were awesome. I overfilled them with yummy goodness but they were so delicious! I really need to look into more filled mushroom recipes because we do really love them.    Print This!    …

 Avocado improvisation 
 Hilton Kean Jones 22 Jun 2012 | 2:38 pm The Atkins Diet Geek Blog has a terrific recipe for an avocado and tuna melt. When I saw the picture and description I knew I had to make that…tonight! But, of course, I didn’t have most of the ingredients. Here’s what I was able to do: 1 small can of salmon 2 tablespoons diced jalapeños 1 tablespoon capers 1/2 cup of Mexican cheese blend 1 avocado 4 tablespoons low-carb blue cheese salad dressing   paprika I scooped out the avocado and mashed that up with the can of salmon, jalapeños, capers, and cheese blend. I packed as much of that mix as I could into… 
 Casita Taqueria 
 Hilton Kean Jones 1 Jun 2012 | 3:01 am Tucked away on the corner of a block that houses a terrific restaurant/bar/blues venue of long standing–The Ringside Cafe (their Cobb salads are my favorite in town)–is Casita Taqueria (www.casitatacos.com). Their namesake is their large selection of tacos, a lengthy list including several of my favorite kinds (fish, shrimp, chorizo). Their menu doesn’t end there. There are a variety of items such as sandwiches, appetizers, sangria, beers, salads, and the dish that’s“my usual”there, the Casita Bowl (pictured below). Their menu describes it perfectly:… 
 The Starboard Sea (review) 
 Hilton Kean Jones 12 Apr 2012 | 2:45 pm If I were able to write a novel, the kind of novel I’d hope to be able to write is the one I just finished reading, The Starboard Sea, by Amber Dermont. Usually, I read for entertainment–not quite trash, but definitely escapist stuff. The Starboard Sea is none of that. All of us, in our lives, have done things of which we’re deeply ashamed, things that tragically affect another person’s life, things that we can’t take back. (Well, maybe not that dramatically, but at least we’ve hurt other people, even if only unintentionally.) This book deals with this, on… 
 Patak’s Biryani Paste with Cauliflower and Yogurt 
 Hilton Kean Jones 22 Mar 2012 | 12:47 pm I stumbled upon this years ago. I don’t remember if I read about the basic concept (mashed cauliflower) or discovered it myself, independently. Doesn’t matter. It’s appeared now in tons of blog posts in one form or another. So, here’s my own little personal version. Clean leaves from head of cauliflower and break cauliflower into big chunks. Microwave on high for about 10 minutes. Add one small carton of plain yogurt (regular or fat-free) and mash to almost mashed potato consistency. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of Patak’s Biryani paste and stir well into mashed… 
 My First Steak 
 Hilton Kean Jones 12 Mar 2012 | 3:34 pm I made my first steak, ever! It turned out pretty good. I learned a few things (use less butter to sear the steak; use less wine to deglaze the skillet; my topping of melted butter, minced garlic, and horseradish was perfect; don’t bother with the oven–just sear a little longer on each side; I’m not sure the marinade did all that much–will experiment with others; salt&amp;pepper on light coat of oil on steak worked good; cooking with a cast iron skillet is GREAT!). I bought a boneless ribeye. I asked the young man at the counter all about how to tell the best steaks…

 Slow Cooker Recipe for Sriracha-Pineapple Barbecued Chicken Sandwiches with Easy Guacamole 
 Kalyn Denny 11 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am Use the Sriracha-Pineapple Barbecued Chicken on a sandwich, inside a pita pocket, or on a salad. I know some people think of the slow cooker as only being for cold-weather foods like soup and stew, but truthfully I love my slow cooker just as much in the summer for the way it lets me cook without heating up the house.  This recipe for Sriracha-Pineapple Barbecued Chicken only takes a few hours in the slow cooker, and it&apos;s something that would be perfect you&apos;re having guests and you&apos;d like an easy main dish that can be eaten outdoors.  The Easy Guacamole is optional, but for me… 
 Recipe for Kalyn&apos;s Power Salad Mix (and the quest to eat more vegetables) 
 Kalyn Denny 9 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am This Power Salad Mix is something I eat regularly for a meatless meal! For a few months I&apos;ve been having regular talks with myself about maintaining my weight.  You might remember that when 2012 started, I confessed I had gained some weight, and I&apos;m happy to report that I lost about 12 pounds in the new year when we did that Month of Phase One Recipes.  But for the last few months my weight has been doing that up/down thing again, and lately I&apos;m being honest with myself and admitting that at least half the time I weight about ten pounds more than I really want to.  In addition… 
 Cooking Tips for Gardeners: Cooking with Fresh Parsley 
 Kalyn Denny 7 Jul 2012 | 10:44 am Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad with Parsley and Mint Even though I grew up with a mom who would nibble the garnish of parsley from her plate when we ate in restaurants, I was well into adulthood before I developed a real appreciation of this grassy-flavored herb.  Now I can&apos;t get enough of it, and grow both curly parsley and flat leaf parsley in my garden.  Some cooks adore the flat-leaf Italian parsley and ignore the curly type, but I like both, and actually prefer curly parsley in some salads where it adds an interesting texture.

 Chicken and Potato Curry 
 shriya 4 Jul 2012 | 7:51 pm Since we started grilling a lot this summer I didn’t get a chance to make chicken curry lately. I had some potatoes sitting in my pantry and chicken in my freezer. I ended up making this simple chicken and potato curry. My mom used to make chicken curry with potatoes and I always loved it. So far I never got a chance to make this dish before. It came out as a delicious curry that went great with some fresh chappathis. preparation Time : 40 minutes No Of servings : 4-5 Spice Level : 3 out of 5 Ingredients: Oil: 2 tbsp Fennel seeds : 1 tsp bay leaves Cinnamon sticks: 1″Cloves : 3…

 How to Make Pizza Dough 
 shriya 1 Jul 2012 | 6:34 pm The crust of the pizza is the most important piece and the crust depends on the pizza dough you make. You could buy ready made pizza crust in stores but they don’t taste as good or fresh if you created it yourself with your own pizza dough. Making pizza dough is definitely an art. I am far from an expert in making pizza dough but as practice makes perfect everytime I make it it comes out better. This time around has to be my best of the lot. So if you are just starting out making pizza be prepared to give yourself a few tries. Who knows you may find yourself good at this at first try…

 10 Stuffed Zucchini Recipe Ideas 
 Allen Williams 1 Jul 2012 | 5:41 pm Zucchini (or courgettes) are a prolific vegetable that can feed an army from one or two plants.

 Nutella S’mores Panini…and my TV Cooking Debut! 
 Kathy 3 Jul 2012 | 10:44 pm Today marks something of a milestone in my food career…my first live TV cooking demo! A last minute spot opened up on a local show so I decided to give it a shot. Other than my necklace being tucked inside the neckline of my dress (next time I will remember to bring a mirror!) things went rather smoothly and it actually turned out to be a fun experience. I showed up at the station lugging three bags full of food, cutting boards, cooking utensils and, of course, a grill. Having the chance to chat with some of the other show guests in the green room calmed my nerves a bit. Before I knew… 
 A Taste of Little Italy 
 Kathy 24 Jun 2012 | 9:34 pm A nice way to spend two hours on a weeknight: weaving in and out of restaurants up and down India Street in San Diego’s Little Italy, armed with a“taste passport”and an appetite. This was me last Wednesday, and the occasion was the annual Taste of Little Italy restaurant crawl. These photos might look a bit familiar to any of my Instagram followers who checked the app last Wednesday night (aside: Are you on Instagram? If so, my username is“kathystrahs”–come follow me!)–I was tasting and sharing all evening! (...)Continue reading &quot;A Taste of… 
 Honey Walnut-Crusted Aged Cheddar Panini…and Scenes from Seattle 
 Kathy 18 Jun 2012 | 12:00 am  You need the moody backdrop of a brisk, misty, gray Seattle day to truly appreciate an amazing grilled cheese sandwich, I’ve come to realize. Trudging through the bustling, crowded stalls of Pike Place Market during the Saturday afternoon rush last weekend with my new friend Christie from Pepper Lynn, I saw a beacon of light shining from Beecher’s Handmade Cheese across the street. Grilled cheese to the rescue. Beecher’s and its award-winning Flagship aged cheddar cheese were familiar to me both through a reader’s recommendation in my Great American Sandwich…

Especially with hot summertime weather approaching, I thought I’d try a new“How To Grill ____ on a Panini Maker”series where I can share tips and techniques for cooking indoors without having to heat up the oven.

We had our three“sandwichspotting”stops planned weeks ahead of time: Bakesale Betty in Oakland, Blue Barn Gourmet in San Francisco and The Melt just off the Stanford campus in Palo Alto. As soon as we picked up our rental car at SFO we headed straight out to the East Bay, to finally taste that famous Fried Chicken Sandwich everyone raves about from Bakesale Betty (pictured above, and listed in my Great…

 Diana 21 Jun 2012 | 2:15 pm It’s tempting to make only salads for lunch and dinner during the summer.

Wash some salad greens, toss in some nuts and olives and cheese, whisk together [...]

 Lori Lange 28 Jun 2012 | 3:00 am Love me or Hate me, but while the rest of the world is pushing sugary baked beans, bacon-stuffed burgers, layered Mexican dips and mayonnaise-laced potato salad this holiday weekend, I’m opting to share something a little more healthy:  Simple Marinated Mushrooms This new and wonderful group that I’m a part of–The Red- Faced Runners- has me inspired to eat healthy and keep fit through running and other calorie- burning feats!  Did you hear about The Red Faced Runners?  Please read more HERE- and I hope you’ll join us.  We’re a group of women inspiring each… 

 
 Andrea Meyers: making life delicious 
 
 Grilled Pork Chops with Tandoori Spice Rub 
 Andrea 9 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am It took a while, but I finally brainwashed my boys. When I make grilled pork chops, instead of grousing they now cheer, “Yay! We’re having chicken!” In my defense, I have never ever fibbed and said that we were eating one thing when it was actually another, but I’m pretty sure they got the idea [...] Visit www.andreasrecipes.com for the full story. 
 Fruity Sparkling Summer Sangria 
 Andrea 3 Jul 2012 | 11:30 am My two favorite things for summer parties are pitchers of sangria and margaritas. They are hard to beat for a cold, refreshing drink to share with friends. This sangria is perfect for summer parties and adds a pitcher of deliciousness to your Fourth of July cookout, and it’s easy to make. Just put all the [...] Visit www.andreasrecipes.com for the full story. 
 Grilled Zucchini with Herb Marinade (The Kids Cook Monday) 
 Andrea 2 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am Grilled vegetables have become a favorite at our home, partly because of the flavor and partly because they are often easy to prepare. Our boys help with slicing the vegetables and mixing the marinades, and Michael or I take over at the grill. I’ve tried several different knives with the boys, and our favorite is [...] Visit www.andreasrecipes.com for the full story. 
 Mango Blueberry Greek Frozen Yogurt 
 Andrea 27 Jun 2012 | 6:39 pm We planted our first blueberries bushes four years ago, and they’ve grown from just a few sticks producing a handful of berries to full bushes with loads of berries. I spent time in the garden last night picking blueberries and brought in about four quarts worth and left many, many more still ripening.

 Weekend Gardening: Cilantro in Summer 
 Andrea 24 Jun 2012 | 3:41 pm Has the cilantro (aka coriander) in your garden gone from leafy and fragrant to tall and spindly? It’s probably the summer heat and a natural part of the cilantro life cycle. Cilantro is a cool weather plant and thrives in spring and autumn. When the summer temperatures start to go up, the plant stops producing [...] Visit www.andreasrecipes.com for the full story.

 Lavomatic to Close for Remodel 
 julie 9 Jul 2012 | 11:12 am This just crossed my email…“Lavomatic will close just temporarily. To ensure the restaurant remains open to World Choir Games guests, Lavomatic has timed its temporary closing to coincide with the closing of the World Choir Games. Beginning Sunday, July 15–and for twelve days only—Lavomatic will close just long enough to undergo a total re-design. Expect an entirely new atmosphere: new floors, lighting and furniture. Even the bar is getting a make-over. But the physical décor isn’t all that’s changing. Lavomatic re-opens on Thursday, July 26, just in… 
 Review: Please 
 julie 9 Jul 2012 | 7:28 am Trying to park a stick shift on Liberty Hill can be a challenge, particularly parking downhill and especially while you’re squinting at houses, trying to see an address obscured by some greenery, all the while trying not to be late to dinner. Call me anything, but not late to dinner. I was struggling to find the place because there is no signage.  No valet service.  Please isn’t a restaurant.  It’s a food experience.  Partly, this is because each meal is themed–there is no choice in what you eat, except if you have food allergies (for example, if it’s a… 
 prettiest. eggs. ever 
 julie 8 Jul 2012 | 1:22 pm Aren’t these just the prettiest eggs ever?  I picked these up at Findlay Market from Back Acres Farm and they made some excellent soft scrambled eggs this morning, and will be part of a vinaigrette tonight.  I have two chickens thawing in the refrigerator to make some fried chicken from Back Acres Farms as well.  Too bad we don’t have enough room (or time…) for some urban chicken farming.  I’d love fresh eggs every morning, but this will have to do. 
 World Choir Games: Check out the Market Garden on 5th!

 Happy 4th of July! 
 julie 4 Jul 2012 | 5:06 pm In the past few days I’ve been to Indianapolis for an interview (I, like another local food blogger, got laid off last month), Detroit for a Detroit Tigers game (after kicking ourselves for not bringing our passports, as The Better Half is a big fan of unpasteurized Canadian beer and we were mere yards away from the Bridge to Canada) and now I’m relaxing at home for the 4th in some air conditioning, while reading a book about Queen Elizabeth and drinking sparkling Rose. One can’t be social all the time, can one? I hope you have a fantastic holiday, however you celebrate.

 What Can You Do About the Farm Bill 
 Local Food Sustainable Network 3 Jul 2012 | 11:19 am What Can You Do About the Farm Bill Though this interview was conducted in 2007, and pertains specifically to the previous Farm Bill of that year, the next Farm Bill is coming up in 2012. Much of what Dan Imhoff says in this video equally applies to the upcoming Farm Bill legislation of 2012. Many of us don&apos;t pay close attention to pending federal legislation but most food experts agree, this bill is the most important legislation on the federal docket.

He does everything by hand, and he constantly is learning from his observations and field experiments. As Boutard is readying his corn seeds for planting in this video, he is doing another experiment by separating the 3 different corn varieties onto different plots of land to learn more about their unique characteristics.

 Moodaepo’s (All You Can Eat) Korean BBQ Restaurant. 
 FoodBlog 9 Jul 2012 | 1:12 am An all you can eat Korean surprise is at Moodaepo’s Korean BBQ Restaurant in Fullerton. A surprise, because its exterior does it no justice–It’s a significant, stylish restaurant. Look beyond the strip mall situation.  It’s a whole new world inside. Each prepares his/her food on a tabletop grill. Pick your price, available meat(s) and grill and eat away, then order more if you want to. Though there’s a lot of room, it gets crowded as many are already in the know. A pitcher of Beer to accompany the experience.  Hite, Hite, Hite, Hite—Gun Bae.

Balloons ready for a Water Balloon Fight—Was too busy throwing‘em to get photos of it. Glimpse of our backyard fireworks show…Enjoy the Summer—Eat, laugh a lot and love each day.

 Heat Up and Cool Down with a Bloody Mary Gazpacho Recipe 
 Susan 8 Jul 2012 | 7:42 pm You may have noticed that I complain about the heat a lot.  That’s because it is HOT here, people!  It’s steam coming out of your ears hot.  It’s fry an egg on the sidewalk hot.  It’s the kind of hot that has Linda Ronstadt’s Heatwave on autoplay in your brain.  Even your fingernails sweat here.   And, don’t even get  me started on the humidity! I love how movies, like the 1981 classic, Body Heat, portray our sweltering Florida summers as sultry, sexy and steamy affairs where everyone  moves about languidly peeling off their clothes.   Pulleaze!  There’s… 
 Peter Piper Picked a Peck of: Pickled Cherries 
 Susan 24 Jun 2012 | 1:49 pm For most kids, June signifies the end of the school year and the beginning of summer vacation. For me, it meant the end of school and the beginning of cherry season. I adored fresh cherries! I still do–especially the Bings. Their season is short – only about six weeks–beginning in early June. Every year at this time, I practically pant with anticipation as I wait for those sweet, succulent and sumptuous little jewels of nature to make their appearance in our local markets. Once they arrive, there’s no stopping me. I bake them into muffins, churn them into ice creams and… 
 Homemade Vanilla Extract: Liquid Gold 
 Susan 19 Jun 2012 | 10:53 am If you ask me, vanilla gets a bad rap.  A lot of people – especially those who don’t bake -  perceive it as bland and boring.   I don’t agree.   High quality vanilla beans are delightfully fragrant and earthy, with either warm and spicy or subtle floral overtones, depending on their variety.  Ditto for a good, pure vanilla extract.   They make me swoon! Those of us who bake regularly appreciate the virtues of vanilla extract or essence, as it is sometimes called.  We use it with abandon in cakes, cookies, caramels, custards and ice creams.    I, myself, have been known to…

 A Special Mothers Day Thank You 
 Susan 12 May 2012 | 8:49 pm Dear God, Thank you for allowing me the privilege and responsibility of being a mother. I know that it wasn’t an easy decision for you to make. In fact, it took you eight long years to make it.  Maybe you felt that I wasn’t ready.  The waiting was hard, but I had faith in your plan for me–even though I had no idea what that might be. I remember the exact moment when I learned that I was pregnant.   It was just a few days before Mother’s Day in 1993.  I was sitting in my sunroom, having my morning coffee when I got the call.  When the telephone rang, I didn’t want…

Recipe testing and writing is dictating my schedule, and taking this part of the process as serious as I do, it’s a lengthy process. After a day’s worth of testing, more testing and writing for the blog isn’t really the first thing that comes to mind. And since I don’t want to bore you with something mediocre, today’s recipe unfortunately took a tad longer. Ok, ok, here…

 Magda’s Breaded Baked Chicken Thighs 
 Jenn K 11 Jul 2012 | 2:30 pm This is one of those recipes that came out of opening the fridge and seeing what needed to be used up. There were these lovely chicken thighs and the remnants of a container of sour cream, just screaming to be combined. Here is the result!These chicken thighs are so moist and delicious!  Once cooked they are also great eaten cold.  Don’t expect deep fried flavour or texture here, but do expect amazing taste and the chicken to almost melt in your mouth.Note: There is a print link embedded within this post, please visit this post to print it.Breaded Baked Chicken ThighsIngredients12…

 Alea’s Grilled Honey Mustard Chicken and Red Potatoes 
 Alea 10 Jul 2012 | 2:15 pm This Honey Mustard Chicken and Potato recipe is easy to make and can be cooked on the grill to help keep the kitchen cool. Partially cooking the potatoes in the microwave reduces the amount of time the potatoes must cook on the grill and makes their cooking time similar to the chicken pieces.When I grill chicken I like to use chicken thighs. They are less expensive than chicken breasts. Thighs also have a slightly higher fat content than breasts and are not as thick of a cut of meat; both qualities contribute to creating a tender final product. If you use chicken breasts, you may want to…

 Shrimp and Avocado Salad with Creamy Tarragon Dressing 
 Lynne Webb 11 Jul 2012 | 1:59 pm This easy, flavor-rich salad is made with shrimp, avocado, spinach, lettuce, tomato and topped with a creamy buttermilk and fresh tarragon dressing - ideal for a light summer dinner. [ get the recipe ] 
 Grilled Salmon and Cucumber Radish Relish 
 Lynne Webb 10 Jul 2012 | 1:29 pm A dollop of creamy Boursin Shallot and Chive and a tangy relish of cucumbers, radishes, dill and scallions offer a simple, flavorful way to dress up grilled salmon fillets. 
 Hungarian-Style Summer Squash With Dill 
 Lynne Webb 10 Jul 2012 | 3:59 am This side-dish recipe is an adaptation of one that the Hungarian side of our family has prepared for decades. They never used anything but white patty pan squash, a variety that flourished in their Pennsylvania backyard gardens. I don&apos;t run across it too often where I shop, and in my opinion, zucchini works equally well and produces a more attractive finished dish. You can also use yellow squash or a combination of the two. [ get the recipe ] 
 Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches 
 Lynne Webb 9 Jul 2012 | 1:27 pm These easy chicken sandwiches, topped with a blue cheese sauce, capture all the essential flavors of buffalo wings. The chicken breasts are braised in a combination of butter and hot sauce, so they turn out exceptionally tender and moist, and the braising sauce can be made mild enough to suit those who aren&apos;t loving a lot of heat. Just put the hot sauce on the table for anyone who likes some extra kick. [ get the recipe ] 
 Barbecue Chicken Pasta 
 Lynne Webb 7 Jul 2012 | 1:58 pm This robustly flavored pasta dish combines chunks of tender chicken, creamy smoked gouda cheese, crisp red onion and fresh cilantro with a light coating of a sweet-smoky, barbecue-style pasta sauce.

 Eat Boutique Potluck with Food in Jars 
 Lauren Keiper 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 pm We’re not really trying to hide our love of canning here at Eat Boutique.  Let’s face it, we can’t seem to help ourselves when it comes to preserving beautiful, seasonal food for future use (Concord Grapes, Lemons, Ramps, to name a few).  So to have the chance to sit down and share a potluck with Marisa McClellan from Food in Jars is a real treat.  Want to join us? The potluck will be a chance to celebrate Marisa’s new cookbook, Food in Jars: Preserving in Small Batches Year-Round and we hope you can make it.  The potluck will be from 7-9 pm on Friday, July… 
 Markets of Paris 
 Maggie Battista 8 Jul 2012 | 10:17 am I’m returning to Europe in a few weeks for my first visit to Berlin, Germany and all I can think of is Paris…My first visit to Paris was in the late 90s, just a few years after graduating from a big-city college. Raised in a family of first- and second-generation immigrants who just wanted to stay put in the good ole’ USA, I hadn’t really traveled anywhere. College life had, however, given me a wonderfully adventurous best friend who to this day still has an odd affection for airplanes. And when she needed to toast to her last single lady days before getting married, I… 
 What We’re Loving: Salads 
 Lauren Keiper 5 Jul 2012 | 4:40 pm This time of year, when I think salad, I tend to go straight to the potato or macaroni variety, nearly always a staple at a summertime cookout, and for good reason. On the hottest days, I also love to make a Panzanella salad, rough cuts of bread and veggies tossed in a light dressing.  It can sustain me for days. Thanks to some favorite food blogs, I’ve found some new salad inspiration: For a change, let rice take center stage and leave the lettuce in the fridge with this Wild Rice Salad with Bleu Cheese {from A Thought For Food} Thai Coconut Cucumber Salad just sounds dreamy and… 
 Wicked Good Barbecue 
 Tara Bellucci 2 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am I like to be surrounded by cookbooks.  I let them pile up and inspire me.  Digging in to a new one or leafing through an old favorite make me equally happy.  They are a rainy day comfort, I can pick one up before bed, heck, some even make great beach reads.  And this one–Wicked Good Barbecue–touches Boston, barbecue and bacon jam. Love. -Maggie As a lifelong Yankee, I don’t have to discriminate against barbecue. I’m free to love tangy Carolina pulled pork, smoked Texas brisket, or ribs slathered in the thick, sweet sauce of Kansas City equally and without… 
 What We’re Loving: In Red, White and Blue 
 Lauren Keiper 29 Jun 2012 | 7:00 am Happy 4th of July, almost! To help you get in the patriotic spirit, and to take full advantage of all the gorgeous berries popping up at markets right now, we have rounded up a few stunning new takes on a notorious Independence Day dessert: the flag cake.  Yes, we’ve all seen the whipped topping and pound cake creation at a 4th of July picnic. (And yes, I have made one in my lifetime. Many, many moons ago.)  But do any of us really enjoy it?  I know I would love these versions instead: Tartlets just sound cute.  But, I like everything in petite form.  And I would love to see these…

 Fruity Pebbles Doughnuts 
 Sues 12 Jul 2012 | 4:46 am Is this post a revolt against my childhood? At first I thought it might be. As a kid, I was never allowed sugary cereal for breakfast. Nor was I allowed donuts. Once in a blue moon, we were granted permission to pick out a box of sugary cereal, but it was relegated to snack and dessert time in carefully rationed portions. No fair. I figured I would some day revolt. But it’s a funny thing about growing up. Oftentimes instead of revolting, you start understanding why your parents did what they did and made the rules they made. These days, I would never eat sugary cereal or donuts for… 
 Shrimp Scampi Pizza 
 Sues 10 Jul 2012 | 3:27 am If you think about it, you can turn anything into a pizza. And these are the things I do think about. Sometimes I’ll plan what I want for dinner and then pause for a moment before saying… ON PIZZA. Seriously though, can you think of any dinner entree that wouldn’t be totally tasty on a pizza? I even love salads on pizza, for goodness sake. EVERYTHING works on pizza. And if you’re trying to trick me with dessert, just remember cookie pizza. I’ve never actually made shrimp scampi before. But I do love it. And was craving it one night. But I was also craving a… 
 Cocktail Friday with Molecule-R’s Cocktail R-Evolution 
 Sues 6 Jul 2012 | 8:36 am You know how I am about my Cocktail Fridays. I love‘em. And I love trying new and different recipes all the time. So, when Molecule-R asked me if I wanted to try their Cocktail R-Evolution kit, I jumped at the chance. Molecule-R’s kits are all about molecular gastronomy, so I knew I’d be able to whip up some pretty snazzy cocktails that were completely out of the ordinary. I loved the look of the kit right away. The box was sleek with illustrations that immediately made me thirsty. And intrigued. Cocktail R-Evolution comes with a DVD containing 30 recipes, along with 50… 
 Honeymoon in Los Cabos, Mexico (Part 2) 
 Sues 4 Jul 2012 | 8:54 pm Now that I’ve been married for almost a month (holy heck, this month was the FASTEST ever), I wanted to share the second part of my honeymoon (first part: here). I want to make sure to get it down while it’s still fresh in my memory. Though I have to admit, now that I’ve been back for a week and a half, I feel like I’ve been back forever! Is it time for another vacation yet? Since the G20 Summit was happening at the Sheraton Hacienda del Mar during our honeymoon, they decided to move us to another hotel for a few nights. At first, we weren’t psyched about it, but… 
 Cookie Dough S’mores (and a giveaway!) 
 Sues 2 Jul 2012 | 3:26 am If you’re deeply immersed in the blog world, it’s very likely that you’ve heard of The Cookie Dough Lover’s Cookbook. Everyone is talking about it. And for good reason. It’s one of the most fabulously addicting cookbooks I’ve read in a long time. Plus, it’s incredibly beautiful with photos that will have your mouth watering big time. So, if you haven’t heard about it, I’m here to tell you about it and will consider it my public service duty for the month (I like to get these things out of the way early). First of all, it was written by…

 Kale, Apple, Almond and Pecorino Salad 
 Caroline 7 Jul 2012 | 1:03 pm Yet another kale recipe. I’m hitting it hard core these days–raw. I know, I know, I should probably just start a new blog called“Kale and Rhubarb.”The two ingredients have been the focal point of many of my recipes this year. While visiting a friend in Colorado some weeks ago, I discovered that she has also been on a kale kick. She served this raw kale salad explaining that it was her latest obsession. Her husband reminded her not to over serve it to the point that she got too tired of it and abandon it forever. I am guilty of the same habit. I find myself over… 
 Glazed Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins 
 Caroline 29 Jun 2012 | 11:38 am Oh, what a difference a glaze makes! I have often shied away from sweet, cake-like muffins. I suppose I would rather feel healthy and good about eating a high-fiber bran muffin or go all out and eat a frosted cupcake. Then, somewhere in my food-blog meanderings, I came upon a glazed muffin recipe. I thought that the sweet syrup atop might push a muffin into the sinful treat category enough for me to really enjoy it. I developed this recipe while working with Spice Islands as a Flavor Explorer. In the past, I had never used lemon extract and it had been years since a bottle of almond extract… 
 Introducing…. 
 Caroline 27 Jun 2012 | 9:55 am I feel like I am taking a deep breath, holding my nose,  jumping off a tall cliff and hoping that the blue waters below are as refreshing as they look. We know there will be some rough patches but we plan to ride the waves instead of fight them. And, all in all, it will hopefully be an invigorating swim. Four months and five days ago, my husband unexpectedly lost his job. I wrote about it in this post and hinted at a new venture. Well, this is it. Today we launched our new company, U.S. of Awesome. Last summer, we had the idea to invigorate patriotism and update Americana with some fresh… 
 Soba Noodles with Tofu, Broccoli and Cilantro 
 Caroline 6 Jun 2012 | 7:10 pm This vegetarian noodle dish is satisfying served hot or cold. Make a double batch and have leftovers for easy summer meals. Sometimes I buy new ingredients to force me into trying new things. I’ve had a package of Japanese soba noodles hanging out in the back of my pantry for quite a few months. I was inspired by an episode of Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations where the host learned how to audibly slurp freshly made soba. The footage of the Japanese craftsman creating his prized noodles was intoxicating. With fluid, confident motions, he flattened, cut and cooked the buckwheat… 
 Book Winner 
 Caroline 2 Jun 2012 | 6:49 am I feel such a camaraderie with all of you who shared a comment on the previous post. I LOVED reading about your birthday dessert choices. If only I could quit my job and make work of treating each and every one of you to your celebratory sweet! Thank you for your participation. Reality dictates my ability to send just one book to one winner. I generated a random number, which pinpointed a fellow redheaded strawberry shortcake lover, Rachel, as the lucky gal. Thank you for visiting Whipped. Stay tuned for another book giveaway soon.

 Bacon Topped Petite Turkey Meatloaf with BBQ Sauce 
 Gina @ Skinnytaste 11 Jul 2012 | 9:52 am If you like the sweet smoky flavor of BBQ sauce, then you&apos;ll love these petite turkey meatloaves combined with a little zucchini, my homemade Kansas City Style BBQ sauce, and bacon! A fun twist on an my classic Petite Turkey Meatloaf. I&apos;ve been playing around with this recipe for a few weeks to get it just right. This first started on the grill in foil pockets. When we go camping, my husband makes a meatloaf on the camp fire and we all really enjoy it. But doing this on the grill can yield different results depending on your grill so I decided to stick with the oven for more… 
 Sausage Stuffed Zucchini Boats 
 Gina @ Skinnytaste 10 Jul 2012 | 12:14 pm Summer zucchini hollowed out and stuffed with lean Italian sausage, then topped with marinara and cheese. OMG! You guys are going to love these! I&apos;ve had this concept in my head for a while, but now that zucchini is in full season and my friend gave me some fresh from her garden, I put my idea to the test. The results were simply amazing, thumbs up all around, especially from my picky teen! One boat fills me up, but you can enjoy two and still be in good shape. I love Polly-O part-skim mozzarella because it melts beautifully as you can see in the photo. I&apos;m pretty picky about my… 
 Warm Pasta Salad with Corn and Zucchini 
 Gina @ Skinnytaste 9 Jul 2012 | 7:04 am This pasta salad is heavy on summer vegetables (corn and zucchini) and gets a bit of a kick from red pepper flakes. It&apos;s a great alternative to potato salad and will be a perfect meatless entree or side dish for your next picnic or family potluck.  Please enjoy this guest post from my friend Olga of Mango&amp;Tomato. Olga is a culinary wiz and I&apos;m happy to have her share a recipe with all of you here on Skinnytaste! Hi!

 Broccoli and Orzo 
 Gina @ Skinnytaste 7 Jul 2012 | 12:26 pm A simple side dish which combines orzo, a rice shaped pasta with fresh broccoli, garlic and oil. A perfect side for fish or chicken or enjoy it as a main meal. This was one from the archives that was ((gasp)) missing a photo. As soon as I realized this I whipped this up real quick and updated this post. I love orzo as a side dish because it&apos;s quick and incorporates my vegetables and carbohydrates all into one easy dish. If you can find whole wheat orzo, it&apos;s great here too. I make often and everyone loves it, sometimes I even enjoy it alone for lunch by doubling the portion. Enjoy! 
 Frozen Mango, Kiwi, Raspberry Pops 
 Gina @ Skinnytaste 4 Jul 2012 | 11:37 am Cool off with these homemade frozen fruit pops made with fresh fruit puree. Aren&apos;t these the prettiest things! I just love the vibrant colors you can get from using fresh fruit, and the flavors are refreshing and sweet. Use any fruit you wish, I added a little sugar because my fruit tasted a little tart, but you can leave it out or use stevia if you prefer. Click Here For The Recipe...

 Blueberry Lemon Lime Corn Muffins 
 Elle 11 Jul 2012 | 11:32 am Today is National Blueberry Muffin Day, did you know? Blueberries have been available in abundance in my area lately, and they’ve been so sweet and juicy, so I’ve been buying a lot. We’ve just been eating them by the handful, but this past weekend, the baking mood hit me. I needed muffins, and fast! I did a quick Google search for something different and found a recipe here that used orange juice and zest. I didn’t have either of those things, but I did have some pink lemonade in the fridge, and a lime in the crisper. Where are the damn lemons when you need them? 
 Steak Wraps with Avocado Chimichurri Sauce 
 Elle 9 Jul 2012 | 11:37 am Fresh flour tortillas piled with tender juicy steak, sliced cucumber, grated carrots, sliced radishes and cotija cheese. And for a real punch of flavor, Avocado Chimichurri Sauce. This sauce. It’s entirely versatile. You can change it to suit your tastes or leave it as is, which to me, is perfect. Have it on chicken, fish, pork, beef, vegetables, in wraps and sandwiches--I could go on and on. Oh, on roasted potatoes? My gosh, yes. On pizza! Yes, we’ve done this, too, and it’s fantastic! It’s no secret how much I love Tortilla Land Fresh Uncooked Tortillas. I’m… 
 Kitchen Play(ing) with Land O’Lakes 4 Cheese Italian Blend 
 Elle 25 Jun 2012 | 5:31 am This assignment for Kitchen PLAY is all about cheese. Specifically, the new 4 Cheese Italian Blend from Land O’Lakes. It combines Asiago, Romano, Parmesan and American cheeses into a cheese that you’ll want to use all over the place. It’s tangy and creamy, sharp and mild--all at once. It’s new in your local delis. If your deli doesn’t carry it yet, get on their case--you want this cheese! Land O’Lakes is celebrating summer in a big way. Be on the lookout for 30 Days of Outdoor Dining!

 Sugar Cone Peanut Brittle Ice Cream and Cuisinart Giveaway

But I don’t want any of you to break a tooth on frozen brittle (I don’t want your dental bills, ha!), so we’re going to take that brittle and process the heck out of it so it becomes a velvety“butter.”Like nut butter, only better. Way better! It’s a burnt sugar bonanza in your mouth. Good on a spoon, or dip a pretzel in it, or heck, dip your face in it. But save some for the ice cream! The…

It’s nice and crispy on the edges--and by the way, those edges are so buttery! It’s chewy in the center, and it’s got big fat creamy chocolate chips to appease your sweet side. I’m guest posting today at Erin’s blog, The Spiffy Cookie. Check out my post! There’s a small typo in the recipe I should call your attention to until Erin can get in there and fix it.

 Healthy Home Cooking for Kids&amp;Tuna Wrap Roll Recipe 
 Diana 10 Jul 2012 | 3:00 pm Healthy Cooking for Kids by Emily Rose, is a cookbook that caters to the young palate, but also  has no butter, no white flour and no added sugar.  It does use rice bran oil, honey, whole wheat pasta, plenty of vegetables and whole grains. Emily’s book contains about 100 pages–with 50 recipes, and nice photos to match.  The kids can join in to help with cooking and baking and putting the food on the table because they are simple in preparation and in taste.  Kids seem to enjoy foods that are uncomplicated–and I think this book fits the bill, and also manages to get…

 Cool Low Calorie Strawberry Soda 
 Diana 7 Jul 2012 | 2:25 pm I wanted a drink with a little fizz, but not one with a lot of calories or sweetner.  Here’s a quick low calorie way to go to make strawberry soda yourself. My son would like it sweeter–my husband liked it the way it was.  I used agave, but you can use honey, sugar, artificial sweetner, and make it as sweet or not as you like.   I also used cans of sparkling soda water–if you have to soda stream that would work too, and if you don’t care for the soda water–you can just have strawberry water, my sister does that quite a bit.

The best food for the money in my opinion is a restaurant… 
 Fireworks Pancakes for the Fourth 
 Diana 4 Jul 2012 | 11:21 am I have a friend, Gailann who does freehand pancake designs for her family on special holidays that are always so neat.  Today she made fireworks pancakes–aren’t they cool? She fills squeeze bottles with the different colored batter and goes at it.  Love it. She says they’re hard to flip–go low and slow, and don’t use oil, use a non-stick or they get greasy.  Enjoy your Fourth.  We are just hanging inside since it is so darn hot and we’re still recovering from travel. What are you doing?  Did you make fireworks pancakes.

 Kapalua Wine and Food Festival 2012: Grand Tasting {Maui} 
 Stephanie 11 Jul 2012 | 3:27 pm I woke up from my food coma post Welcome Reception the next morning and thought it was all a dream. Partially because it was, no joke, the best sleep of my life. I’m fairly certain the beds at the Ritz are enchanted, the bedding is probably woven from unicorn hair and the pillows stuffed with magical cotton candy, because seriously, it was a sleep experience like none other. But then I peeked out the window and saw this: And was all like, “Pheeew! I’m still in paradise.”Good thing I got my rest because today was going to be a big day. The prior night’s festivities were just a warm…

 Broccoli Salad 
 Stephanie 3 Jul 2012 | 11:07 am July 4th = America’s favorite pastime. Grilling! I know you’ve got the burgers and hot dogs covered. You should definitely get a big, juicy watermelon. And lots of beer on ice. As for sides…let’s keep it easy. After all, this day is all about taking a break, catching some rays, and finding a patch of grass to lie on and watch fireworks.Here’s an easy breezy recipe to help round out your side dishes. Skip the coleslaw this year and go for this Broccoli Salad. Maybe you’re thinking you’d rather have a side of Pancetta Mac-n-Cheese (I don&apos;t blame you, it would be pretty darn good),… 
 Maui Gold Pineapple Farm + an Umbrella Drink for You 
 Stephanie 26 Jun 2012 | 9:41 am It’s almost impossible to think of Hawaii without thinking of pineapples. Tropical, sweet, and juicy, pineapples taste of sunshine and aloha.I recently returned to Maui for the second time for the Kapalua Wine and Food Festival 8) and I must say, while I was in town, no pineapple was safe around me. I couldn’t get enough of the stuff. I decided I had to go right to the source. Enter: Maui Pineapple Tours. If you’ve ever wanted to frolic through golden pineapple fields (not really recommended – pineapples are spiky), this is the place to do it since it is the only working pineapple…

 Anyone for salad? 
 11 Jul 2012 | 1:09 pm This constant rain has done this to my herb garden.We have been invaded by salad! So salad for tea every night for the next hundred years!Tonight we had salad, new potatoes and beef liver in an onion gravy.T&apos;was delicious. 
 My Two Favourite Girls 
 10 Jul 2012 | 2:35 pm Since the beginning of June I officially became a Mompreneur. Juggling setting up and running a new business on top of everything else is the most tiring thing I&apos;ve ever experienced but oh so worth it.But none of this would have been possible without the great support and advice of my brilliant Mum, Di Overton from Designers Block.And of course my little angel, Tiana, who gives me the strength to keep going.I only hope I can be just as good as a Mum to her as mine is to me. 
 Fish&amp;Chips 
 18 Jun 2012 | 3:37 pm The Pauper&apos;s Kitchen market adventure is expanding to serve real Fish&amp;Chips. So to get some practice in I got the oil heating and made the British favourite. Was utterly delicious. 
 Isn&apos;t that clever? 
 16 Jun 2012 | 3:16 pm I am the Queen of list making. I never start the day without making a to do list. I have a blackboard painted on my kitchen wall to note down my grocery list as and when I run out, as well as errands and appointements, very handy. But I must admit I&apos;m tempted by the Electronic SmartShopper SS-301 by SmartShopper Electronics. Extra bonus it&apos;s a voice recogniser device so you don&apos;t even have to faff about with typing. Brillant. 
 First Stock Up in Blighty 
 14 Jun 2012 | 6:47 am I went for my first stock up on all the British goodies for the market stall last week. I took my nephew with me to help me with the heavy lifting. He&apos;s never been to England so as soon as we got over the channel we went straight for a full English breakfast.The poor lad was gob smacked at the size of it, and only managed to finish half, whereas I, greedy as always ate the whole lot and washed it down with a giant cup of real English tea. Well it would&apos;ve been rude not to!With the Queens&apos;s Jubliee and the Olympics being held in the UK this year there were Union Jack flags everywhere! But I…

 Hella Good Compound Butter for Corn on the Cob 
 Stephen 19 Jun 2012 | 1:25 pm makes about 1 cup Ingredients 1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks) ½ tsp paprika ¼ tsp cayenne ½ tsp lime zest, minced 1 tsp lime juice 1 tsp salt Instructions Set the butter out in a warm-ish place so that it softens enough to stir – but do not melt. Add in all ingredients and combine well. This butter can be used on anything but is particularly tasty if you rub it on corn before it goes on the grill – plus more when it comes off. Enjoy!

 Outdoor Cooking aka How to Deep Fry a Turkey 
 Jodi and Julie 10 Jul 2012 | 9:57 pm My church does an annual Dutch Oven Cooking night where the men get to cook us dinner and we get to learn all their secrets If you don’t have a church group that does this sort of thing, you may be surprised at where you can find something similar. Several years ago we attended a Dutch Oven Cooking demonstration at my local Rec Center that was really informative (and yummy!) This year we were told we would be learning how to deep fry a turkey and I was very curious wondering how that would be possible in a Dutch Oven. Well, turns out it wasn’t done on a Dutch Oven but in a propane… 
 4th of July JELLO and Freeze-Dried Fruit Sale 
 Jodi and Julie 2 Jul 2012 | 11:00 pm If you are having an Independence Day celebration where you are supposed to bring a food dish, I highly recommend the Patriotic Jello I posted about last year. I don’t get to make it this year so I’m hoping some of our readers will make it and let me know how it turned out so that I can pretend I got to enjoy it myself. For a full step-by-step tutorial on how to make this (including how to do it with Freeze-Dried fruits) visit this post. I seriously love that even if I were living completely off of food storage I could have a fun, festive dessert like this! Freeze-Dried Fruit and… 
 Food Storage Made Easy Turns FOUR Years Old! 
 Jodi and Julie 26 Jun 2012 | 1:47 pm This month we are celebrating our“4 years of Blogging”Birthday. It’s crazy to think only 4 short years ago we had no food storage or even any idea of what food storage really was. We started this blog as a way to document everything we were learning, and since then, have come a long way. While we have learned a lot over the last 4 years, we still have so much we want to figure out. We never expected how much we would enjoy this adventure, and are thrilled at the many friendships we’ve built, and things we have learned from YOU our readers! So today, we’re… 
 Thoughts on Fire Preparedness 
 Jodi and Julie 24 Jun 2012 | 11:44 pm This has been quite a crazy week. I was out of town on a little one day trip with my family. I got that dreaded call at 5:00 am from a neighbor. Your heart sinks and you think the most horrible thoughts about what could possibly be happening at home. It turns out my next door neighbor’s house caught fire and there had been some concern about it possibly spreading to my house or causing damage to my property and/or my chickens. Not what you want to hear when you are at least a 6 hour drive from home. We arrived home and everything was ok with my house, but my neighbors house is… 
 Mountain House Sweet and Sour Pork Review 
 Jodi and Julie 22 Jun 2012 | 9:30 pm We get asked about“just add water”meals a lot. Our normal philosophy is to teach a more traditional food storage approach of storing the basics and supplementing with fruits/veggies/meats/etc. However, we do recognize that there is a time and place for having quick easy meal options in your storage as well so we have done a lot of research on the options available. We did a whole post in our“Tax Refund Week”talking about things to consider when buying just add water meals. People always try to pin us down on which company tastes the best because, hey, who…

 Explore the Lighter Side of Grilling With Michelob ULTRA Light Cider 
 Stephanie Stiavetti 18 Jun 2012 | 9:00 am My body pays attention to two signals that summer is finally here: the smell of grilling and the sound of ice-cold drinks being pulled out of a cooler. When the temperature peaks, the only thing that really, truly cools me off is an icy beverage. Over many summers, I’ve tried countless drink options that didn’t leave me satisfied—beer is too dry, wine is too high in liquor, and fruity cocktails contain way too much sugar for my taste. For years, I’ve searched for a light, cool drink that leaves me feeling refreshed. Given my plight, I just about jumped for joy when… 
 Grilled Haloumi Cheese with Olive Tapenade 
 Stephanie Stiavetti 1 Jun 2012 | 9:00 am As a former vegan, I can relate to the idea of being the only herbivore at a carnivorous cookout, wondering what I would eat, feeling like I’d be stuck munching on carrot sticks and corn chips the entire night. Now that I eat—and enjoy—meat these days, I no longer fear the grill…though I do try to limit the amount of meat I consume, mostly for health reasons. But that doesn’t mean I have to give up grilling on the nights I want a lighter dinner. There are many veg-friendly grill options. Have you ever thought of grilling cheese? ...

 Vegetarian Olive Tapenade Recipe 
 Stephanie Stiavetti 22 May 2012 | 11:12 pm Did you know that olive tapenade recipes are not always vegetarian? My formerly vegan self was not aware of this fact, and I was about a year into my veg adventure before someone informed me that one of my favorite spreads was indeed not inline with my dietary requirements. Not a terribly squeamish vegan, I simply shrugged off the fact that I’d been eating anchovies, sardines, or similar small, fatty fish—which would explain the not-so-lovely-tapenade breath—but I did decide to avoid it for the duration of my time on Planet Veg. ...

 Seriously Decadent Almost-Raw Chocolate Truffles Recipe 
 Stephanie Stiavetti 12 May 2012 | 2:20 pm If you’re a longtime reader of this blog, then my ongoing battle with sugar isn’t news. My body really, truly hates refined sugar. It gives me headaches, joint pain, acne, mental fog, and a cornucopia of other unsavories dramas that I don’t really like to talk about. As someone who comes from a long line of sugar fiends—as well as being the girlfriend of a particularly avid sweets lover—sugar is an especially thing to avoid in my life. You would think that after years of battling a sugar addiction, it would get easier to avoid. Not true. There are entire… 
 Vegan Macaroni and Cheese Recipe 
 Stephanie Stiavetti 4 May 2012 | 3:51 pm I’ve been eating a lot of macaroni and cheese lately. Between huge, heaping spoonfuls of real cheese, I’ve been pining for a less milk-heavy version that would appeal to my vegan friends. (and my former vegan self–yes, I was vegan many years ago!) But, vegan cheese leaves a lot to be desired. Career vegans, I know a lot of you are with me on that. ... Read the rest of Vegan Macaroni and Cheese Recipe on The Culinary Life.

Amarena are a sour cherry that come from the Emilia–Romagna region of Italy and you&apos;ll most often find them preserved, as these are, in a sweet syrup. They may be small but they have an intense flavour with hints of vanilla and almond. The last time I used these, they were as a secondary ingredient in an apple strudel but this time, since I now have a 2.5kg jar of them (!) they are going to be the main focus.

We’ll resist using the word “nondescript,” since that’s a phrase with no imagination, but there aren’t many keywords that apply to the Shanghai Dumpling King space. The cash-only spot in San Francisco’s Outer Richmond neighborhood has white walls, numbered tables and lazy Susans. This Shanghai-inspired spot has a sprawling menu with plenty of pork dishes and dumplings, many of them on the sweeter side. We of course ordered two steamers of Xiao Long Bao, potstickers and oversized lion’s head meatball casserole but we enjoyed the Spicy Wonton…

 Laurelhurst Market: Pulling Double Duty in East Portland 
 Joshua Lurie 6 Jul 2012 | 12:00 pm Food GPS - Food. Drinks. People. In Portland, there seems to be a push towards greater efficiency. Coffeehouses like Coava Coffee Roasters and Sterling Coffee Roasters decided that sharing space with another tenant makes more sense for their respective business model. In the world of meat, Olympic Provisions and Laurelhurst Market operate as butcher shops by day and restaurants by night. They’ve already got the product, space and know-how, so why not use it? We started at Laurelhurst, in an East Portland neighborhood by the same name, to experience food from chef-owners David Kreifels,…

 Sicilian Cherry Tomato&amp;Almond Pesto with Couscous 
 jgreghenry 9 Jul 2012 | 7:34 am We owe today&apos;s Sicilian Cherry Tomato&amp;Almond Pesto with Couscousto the Italian city of Trapani, on Sicily&apos;s westernmost tip. It has an identity all of its own. That&apos;s because geographically speaking it is closer both in distance and topography to Tunis than Naples. In fact it&apos;s closer to several African ports than it is to any part of mainland Italy. It owes much of its heritage to the sea and its importance to the ancient trade routes. Trapani flourished as the center of Phoenician trading because it was a navigationally necessary port during the Middle Ages. Without Trapani, links…

 Market Matters- Grilled Summer Squash with Purple Basil Salad 
 jgreghenry 1 Jul 2012 | 12:41 pm Purple Basil&amp;Grilled Summer Squash Salad with Walnuts. Can squash be art? Is zucchini life... One is a question, the other a metaphor. But, here I am (was, it is all so existential) walking through the Hollywood Farmers Market looking for inspiration for this week&apos;s Market Matters. Then just ahead, past the nectarines and next to the fresh basil I see a golden glow. Or I think I do... What can that golden glow be I wonder? So I push my way through the crowd as in a dream when your feet seemed to be stuck in glue. I see the glow, I am almost there. But the crowd, the crowd is in my way. 
 Grilled Strip Steak Brings Old School Ambiance to the Plate 
 jgreghenry 29 Jun 2012 | 2:52 pm I love the ambiance of a good old-fashioned chophouse. Red leather booths, dark lighting, questionable martinis, and oh yeah, steak. Usually damn good steak too. That&apos;s because a good chophouse makes no apologies for its red-meat-centric position. So there is no need to hide behind any of the foodie pretensions of the moment. Chophouses do meat. Several cuts, all of them grilled. Chophouses were never simply restaurants. In another time, on another continent, the original English chophouses could easily be called the16th century gastro-pubs (to borrow an au currant foodie phrase) of their…

 Vanilla Cream Cheese Pound Cake 
 foodess 11 Jul 2012 | 9:48 am Deliciousness in simplicity is embodied by a good pound cake. The old-fashioned recipe contains just a pound of butter, a pound of sugar, a pound of eggs and a pound of flour. There’s logic, if lack of imagination, behind the“pound”cake’s name.  Although the (dusty, cobwebbed) math part of my brain tells me it would be more aptly named“FOUR pound cake”…Geez, that’s a lot of cake! People (myself included) have taken liberties with the ingredient ratios, often adding a leavener other than eggs to boost the cake’s rise. The rich, buttery… 
 Perfect Bacon 
 foodess 4 Jul 2012 | 3:43 pm  Do you ever find simple things that are revolutionary to your cooking? Take this: bacon. Something I love, but never loved making. Cooking more than 4 slices would mean overcrowding the pan, inevitably resulting in uneven cooking. Rubbery, flabby bacon tails attached to charred bacon heads. But let’s be serious–who cooks less than half a dozen slices of bacon at a time? Then one day, I put it in the oven instead. The result? Perfectly crisp, evenly cooked bacon–even for a crowd! My trick is to set a low wire cooling rack inside a shallow roasting pan. This… 
 Creamy Caesar Dressing 
 foodess 29 Jun 2012 | 2:29 pm Hi Friends, And I really mean it when I say friends. I hesitated for quite some time before hitting“publish”on my last blog post. The experience was something I really needed to talk about, but I wasn’t sure that this was the right setting. Is a food blog really the place to unburden life’s traumas? And then I realized, yes, it is. Because that’s what food is really about for me: friends, family, community; sharing life, the trials and the triumphs, around the kitchen table. Recently I took some time to reflect on my vision for this little corner of the world… 
 Happy saved my best friend. 
 foodess 27 Jun 2012 | 3:21 pm My Irish Setter Oliver–who is utterly terrified of his own reflection in the glass shower door, who cowers in fear every time he can smell the oven turned on, who drops to the ground and shows his belly if so much as a teacup chihuahua growls at him–had no qualms about jumping head first into glacial whitewater for what I imagine he expected to be a nice, cooling swim. The same skittery dog–who takes a good 2 minutes marching on the spot in focus before he can muster the courage to jump into the backseat of the car–managed to scramble his scrawny butt out of… 
 Watermelon Milkshake 
 foodess 22 Jun 2012 | 11:43 am On my recent trip to Thailand, I fell in love with a watermelon milkshake. It was after several long, hot days meandering through the Patong markets that Adarsh and I decided to indulge in some poolside R&amp;R. We slipped into the shade under a poolside umbrella, kicked off our flip flops, and ordered watermelon milkshakes from the resort menu. Inside that cold, frosty glass was nothing but juicy watermelon blended with ice and milk, but it was incredible. Frothy, sweet and irresistibly pink. Watermelon is so, well, watery…that maybe you’re thinking (as I was),“In a…

 One-Banana Banana Bread 
 7 Jul 2012 | 5:08 am I know, I know. Not another banana bread recipe. I can’t help myself…I love a good banana bread! And although I do have my favorite “best” recipe (which I haven’t shared yet…so I have to warn you that there will be at least one more banana bread post hereabouts), I can’t help trying out new ones. Especially now that little C is off to school and banana bread makes such an excellent (and not too junky) snack.Before we move on to this particular recipe, if you, like me, are also a big fan of this ubiquitous but soul-satisfying quick bread, I’ve made a… 
 Munggo with Gata and Kalabasa (mung beans with coconut milk and squash) 
 1 Jul 2012 | 9:42 am The windows of our bedrooms face due east so we get the sunrise every day. As much a sunrise as you can get in the middle of the city. Which, actually, has its own special magic…at least to me. Rays of light suddenly bursting into being like so many bright yellow arms reaching around towers of concrete, all at once being reflected and fractured and reflected again, like a beam going through a thousand prisms, against the steel and glass of the stalwarturban sentinels I call my neighbors.I love the dawn. Even if, despite all my best efforts and intentions, I am still… 
 The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies 
 22 Jun 2012 | 8:11 am Since I had had so much success with these Absolute Best Brownies, despite the universal skepticism towards any recipe that claims to be the “Absolute Best” or “Best Ever”, I decided…why not try my luck searching for other “Best” recipes? What would I have to lose? On one hand, it could turn out disappointing, in which case I will only be one batch of something or other worse for wear, maybe a little disillusioned, but that would be a small price to pay if the recipe actually did in fact prove to be the “Best”, or even close to it.With this in mind, I immediately… 
 A Winner...and Another Breakfast 
 18 Jun 2012 | 6:37 am I hope you all had a wonderful Fathers Day weekend...especially the men of the hour, those stalwart fellows we call papa whose broad shoulders and strong arms keep the monsters at bay and whose wild tales water our imaginations. It was a full weekend for us. Not of the jetting off to some fantastic locale full, but that of the Saturday night sleepover with the little one type full. Delicious in its own way, particularly if you, like me, have a weakness for little feeties first thing in the morning.So, as much as I wanted to post the winner for my Frugally Delicious giveaway…

 Inji Curry | Puli Inji | Onam Sadya Recipes 
 11 Jul 2012 | 5:59 pm I have a weird relationship with ginger (inji in Malayalam). It&apos;s weird I can&apos;t really explain it. Let me try though, stay with me ok? So here&apos;s the thing. If I sniff a piece raw ginger, I feel nauseous. It&apos;s ironic because ginger is what people sniff when they feel nauseous. I can never eat a ginger candy. I hate biting into ginger pieces that are added to upma (I always grate and add it) and such. BUT. I love the flavour of it as long as it&apos;s not dominating the dish - like ginger chicken, or adding it to coconut chutney, or even fresh lime juice with ginger. There&apos;s an exception though (I… 
 Vanilla Panna Cotta with Blueberry Coulis 
 9 Jul 2012 | 12:02 am You know what? I always thought panna cotta was this incredibly difficult thing to make. I even thought it would be something like doing the inverted dog position and staying there for 5 mins without moving. Yeah, yoga taught me how tough it is to stay in one position doing nothing. And blueberry coulis. I couldn&apos;t even pronounce that 2 years back. Thanks to Masterchef Australia and watching 8-year olds whip up perfect berry coulis, I finally got around to making it myself. This is a perfect dessert for entertaining for many reasons: - it&apos;s easy. like really really easy to put together - it… 
 How to prepare banana stem for cooking 
 6 Jul 2012 | 12:55 am Vazha Pindi, Vazhai Thandu, Banana Stem, whatever you call it, it&apos;s a pain to prepare before you cook. There, I said it. I postponed buying it for a long time because I just didn&apos;t feel it was worth it to spend this much time and end up with just one dish for two people. I would still need to make the rest of the meal! But, BUT, it&apos;s not all bad. Banana steam is fibrous and nutritious so once in a while, maybe like once a year which is what I do, it&apos;s good to take the time out and do this and maybe eat it with leftover rasam and rice from the previous day.

 Namaste UK ~ Indian-Inspired Kitchen Accessories

Their hand-painted ceramic spice jars are my favourite Closely followed by the gorgeous chest that would instantly lighten up a kitchen corner or even your living room. Ohh and this lovely kitchen rack! I am in love. Colourful teapot They have a range of other products that are not kitchen-related too. I really liked their scarves too but there&apos;s lots of other lovely things to browse through. Happy Thursday everyone! Not a paid post.

 4 Jul 2012 | 1:58 am It definitely doesn&apos;t seem that long but just over 2 years back, I had posted a review of Irvin&apos;s Seafood Place when they were in River Valley Road. Well, a lot has changed since then. They have moved to Upper Thompson Road, changed their name slightly, set up a lovely more upscale restaurant space, and revamped their website and even their menu. Steph from Irvin&apos;s invited TH and me for a meal so we headed down there last week for dinner. We got the most amazing welcome ever and TH was all &quot;wow! what did you do to get treated like this?&quot;. Hehe. We were greeted by a beautifully arranged buffet…

 Homemade Croutons and Perfect Sauteed Chicken Breasts 
 katie 11 Jul 2012 | 8:40 pm I am still trying to find that weeknight balance.  It pains me to say it, but I think it is somewhere between semi-homemade and ordering take-out.  Not to say there aren’t wonderful meals that can be made between your commute and bedtime stories.  For me it isn’t the cooking, over the years I have learned how to make great, from-scratch food quickly (hint: practice).  No, for me it is the clean-up. Take this delicious, from scratch Caesar salad.  It took a skillet, a baking sheet, the blender, and a salad bowl.  That’s just too many dishes to wash after dinner.…

 katie 9 Jul 2012 | 3:28 am If you are like me-and chances are, if you read food blogs you are at least a little bit like me-you probably have a stack of hand me down recipes somewhere in your house.  Passed on from friends or family, printed on the internet, torn or photocopied from magazines, these are the“some day”recipes.  The ones that you’ll get around to, yet the stack keeps growing.  My friend Donna gave me her recipe for this dish a year ago.  It is one of her favorites and she makes it frequently but it wasn’t until she brought me some of the finished product that I just had to… 
 Kale Salad with Cranberries, Pepitas, and Crystallized Ginger 
 katie 1 Jul 2012 | 5:26 pm Using fresh kale in place of typical salad lettuces is a pretty exciting concept in my world.  I am always looking for ways to include more good-for-you ingredients in my meals and sneaking it into a salad at lunch is especially convenient.  Kale is perfect for work lunch salads because you can dress it the day before and it doesn’t wilt.  I actually like to give it a day to marinate and soften just a bit.  If you live in a town that has a Central Market you may have tried this wonderful salad from their to go food station.  Theirs includes slivered almonds as well but the pepitas… 
 Grandma’s Roast Beef and Noodles 
 katie 10 Jun 2012 | 4:54 am I have never posted a pot roast recipe here because I have never been happy with any of the elaborate pot roast recipes I have tried since I started cooking for myself.  Why is pot roast so hard?  Because everyone (yes, me included) wants to fancy it up with wine and veggies or smother it in cream of mushroom soup.  Which is unfortunate because the very best pot roast is just slow braised beef that tastes like, well, beef. This is my Aunt’s pot roast with homemade noodles which was Grandma’s recipe before her and probably Great-Grandma’s before her.  The pot roast is…

 Su-Lin 10 Jul 2012 | 9:56 am A few weeks ago, Cathy the Gastronomer was in London for a short stop before her big trip to France with her husband and mother and we arranged to meet at Maltby Street for St John’s vanilla custard filled doughnuts. We also arranged to meet the next day for lunch at The Mall Tavern–it was a Sunday and I convinced them that they needed a proper roast lunch! It would be a first visit to this pub for all of us. We were seated in the bar area–every table available had been booked up. Our waitress was efficient but quite gruff while we were ordering. We refused to let this… 
 A Saturday Food Crawl around Tooting 
 Su-Lin 5 Jul 2012 | 3:52 pm About a month ago, I met Slow Food Kitchen, sloLondon and Table for One in Tooting to explore the neighbourhood. Little did I know that what was going to be a stroll and then lunch in a Sri Lankan restaurant was going to turn into a full blown food crawl. Stomachs, on your marks, get set…. go. With empty stomachs at 1pm and late arrivals, we early birds stared longingly at the Dosa n Chutny across from Tooting Broadway tube station. I’d heard very good things about the place from at least 3 other people and a decision was made to have“breakfast”there when everyone… 
 Ma Goa in Putney 
 Su-Lin 28 Jun 2012 | 4:31 pm Goan food! Yet another cuisine that I was keen to get my teeth into–this small west Indian state is known for its cuisine that’s heavily influenced by the Portuguese and a large number of Goan Catholics means that pork features heavily. Pork? Oh yes. I do love pork curry. I joined Mr Noodles, Rahul (our Goan friend!), Kay, and Wen and family one night to try the Goan food on offer at Ma Goa in Putney. While we were there first there at 7pm, the place soon became packed–bookings are essential. While we waited for everyone to arrive, a selection of most of the starters on… 
 Kuih Rose 
 Su-Lin 24 Jun 2012 | 2:44 am One of the kitchen tools my mother gave me was a brass flower with a handle, a mould used for frying beautiful flower shaped crunchy sweet biscuits usually made around Chinese New Year in Malaysia. The fried fritter goes by various names: kuih rose in Malay (rose cake, for the shape), beehive cookies (also the shape) and also kuih loyang (brass cake, named for the mould). Despite having this mould for a number of years, it was only a couple weekends ago that I put it to use. It was all down to my usual dislike for deep frying but I put aside that fear and set to work mixing together a very… 
 MEATmarket 
 Su-Lin 19 Jun 2012 | 11:17 am A lot has already been said about MEATmarket, the Covent Garden outpost of the Meatwagon chain, but I’ll toss in my two cents, keeping it brief. A couple of friends and I visited on a Friday night at about half past seven and I was surprised to see no queue whatsover. It took all of a few minutes to decide what to order between us, place our orders and then grab a table. The location above the Jubilee Market in Covent Garden made it all quite noisy with metal poles and tables clanging together down below us as the market was set up or taken down (we couldn’t tell which!).

 San Juan Celebration! 
 Gretchen Noelle 24 Jun 2012 | 7:00 am The entire town of Aucayacu is bustling during the week of San Juan. There are festivals, parades, car races, soccer games, pageants and contests. But the culmination of the events come on the day of San Juan, June 24th. Early in the morning, around 4am, there is a group of people who runs down to the river to jump in. They believe that the early morning swim will prevent gray hair. You cannot sleep through it since the group parades the streets beforehand beating a drum and calling out to all the neighbors to join them. Once everyone is truly awake just a few hours later, the entire town of… 
 Juanes Day Preparation 
 Gretchen Noelle 23 Jun 2012 | 8:56 am During the week I was in Aucayacu, the community celebrated “Juane Day” on June 24th. The day before was full of preparation in all of the homes in the neighborhood Primero de Mayo. I enjoyed visiting them all, taking pictures and asking questions about how they prepare their juanes. Juanes are likened to be the jungle way to prepare tamales–with rice instead of corn. Why are they called Juanes? It is said that June 24th is a day to celebrate of John the Baptist, Christ’s disciple who was beheaded. The traditional form of the Juanes is a form which eerily resembles a head. 
 Cream of Anything Soup Mix 
 Gretchen Noelle 10 May 2012 | 6:00 am Do you know how frustrating it is to have a list of recipes that you cannot make for lack of ingredients. Or, to be more specific, the lack of a very particular ingredient. How many crock pot meals have I passed up? How many times has Thanksgiving become complicated? How many times have I wanted to make a quick casserole, but can’t? Soup in a can is nothing I am fond of. Now. I admit, growing up, I ate my share of Campbell’s soup. My mom always had the Bean and Bacon and I would delight in a can of Cream of Mushroom. Or Potato. I wasn’t ever a Tomato or Chicken Noodle Girl.

I admit, part of me wanted to suggest the ceviche recipe that is mixed into the Mexican food recipes. But honestly, I don’t think I will ever really enjoy ceviche from any other country except for Peru. I looked through recipe after recipe wondering what my picks would be. There were several that jumped out at me immediately and some that I instantly turned the page. I narrowed it down to a few and then tried to think about what I would most enjoy eating. That was when I…

In fact, they’re so sub-specialized, they pretty much only sell tonkotsu ramen! Located in a corner ground floor shoplot near Tanjong Pagar MRT station, it is actually really easy to find: just...

 In the (cake) club 
 1 Jun 2012 | 9:36 pm Guest blogger Tamsin McCahill of Brighton Hobby Project on the rise and rise of the cake club – a home baking craze that’s sweeping the nation. Clutching a huge Tupperware box, I crept through a cobbled mews at dusk, searching for a top secret location. My heart was racing. I didn’t know who – or what – I’d find when I got there. No, I’m not a... [Please read the rest of this post on my website =) Thanks!] http://www.pigpigscorner.com/

 Tomato Love Is Here.... 
 The Food Hunter 12 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Where does my love for tomatoes stem from? Most likely my grandparents; who grew their own every summer. Not an easy task in their tiny cement backyard, but they did it and we always had fresh tomatoes on hand. My grandparents and their prized tomato plants To this day I still eat a lot of tomatoes and I&apos;m always looking for cool new ways to prepare them. So I am happy to join in on the Tomato Love Recipe Exchange, hosted by Gimme Some Oven&amp;Bake Your Day, sponsored this week by KitchenAid. If you love tomatoes at all you&apos;ll want to be sure to check out all the…

 Sweet Potato&amp;Spinach Hash 
 The Food Hunter 29 Jun 2012 | 12:30 pm Looking for an easy to make good for you side dish....here&apos;s one I love. It&apos;s a simple combination of two healthy ingredients kicked up a notch with a taste of pure maple syrup. According to a study done by the Center For Science In the Public Interest both sweet potatoes and spinach rank in the top 5 for nutrition of all vegetables. Sweet Potatoes actually ranks number 1 due to the fact that it has almost twice the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A, 42 percent of the recommendation for vitamin C, four times the RDA for beta carotene, and, when eaten with the skin, sweet potatoes have… 
 Thoroughly Modern Milkshake Party

 Cherry Vanilla Layer Cake, Another Birthday&amp;A Few Things I&apos;d Tell My Younger Self 
 The Food Hunter 22 Jun 2012 | 5:00 am A few years back, when I turned 37, my mom sent me this in an email: “37 years ago today an angel was born. She cried an awful lot but she was beautiful and she has grown up to be a wonderful daughter” With another birthday behind me this email got me thinking about how truly lucky I am and how much I am loved. Looking back on my life and knowing all that I know now there are a few things I wish I could tell my younger self: 1. Life is NOT going to be easy. There are going to be lots of ups and downs. Some days you are going to need more chocolate than others to get by. Don’t be afraid…

 What to Drink This Week: Pyrat Rum 
 Mike 11 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am Before I talk about this week’s beverage, we need to take a moment to discuss…THE PANTHEON. BOOM! Everyone has one:  that collection of the truly sacred drinks, the ones that transcend being your favorite and actually stray into a near-religious devotion.  They’re the bottles you have at easy disposal for yourself and that disappear into the back of your linen closet when company comes over; they’re the brands to whom you’ve attached such a personal attachment that if they appear on the menu of a restaurant, however previously awful your experience there, it… 
 Grilled Flatbread, 101 
 Tina 6 Jul 2012 | 4:18 am Like rings on a tree, I recall past years and seasons not by what I was doing at the time, but what I was eating.  If 2010 was the summer of kebabs and 2011 was the summer of canning, then 2012 will surely be remembered in our house as the summer of grilled bread. Perfect for the outdoors, rustic and homemade grilled flatbread is one of those deliciously easy yet sought after skills to keep in your culinary kit, filed under the“Smug Ways To Impress Your Guests”tab. We’ve been grilling up flatbread at least once a week this year, sometimes as an appetizer and… 
 Easy Mediterranean Bean Salad 
 Tina 3 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am Now that we’re officially into summer, the season of picnics, potlucks and long weekends spent with a cooler by the lake, it’s worth getting a few quick, easy, fuss-free recipes into rotation so that you can get out of the kitchen and into the sun. This is relevant even if, like me, you’re as pregnant as a Virginia ham right now and the air conditioning in your kitchen is the only thing keeping you (relatively) lucid. If that’s the case, I still suggest focusing on a few simple 10 minute recipes that can be whipped up in a snap, but be sure to keep some random herbs… 
 Pasta with Fiddlehead, Smoked Sausage and Caramelized Onion 
 Tina 29 Jun 2012 | 5:00 am Whether you think of Canada as a melting pot or a cultural mosaic, our ethnic and cultural diversity is absolutely indisputable. Perhaps that’s why people think of Canada as lacking our own culinary identity, which couldn’t be further from the truth.  Canada’s culinary heritage is rich and diverse, true, but wouldn’t you expect that from a country which spans from rocky mountains to red-earthed seasides, and arid prairies with rolling fields to arboreal forests? When I think of Canadian fare, I tend to focus on our indigenous ingredients, which are often very… 
 What to Drink This Week: Twisted Tea Hard Iced Tea 
 Mike 27 Jun 2012 | 3:00 am Around the time that I became an Awful Teenager, I saw those mammoth Arizona Iced Tea cans start to pop up in convenience stores.  They were festooned with all the greatest colors of the late 80s, unearthly pastel blues, sunshine yellows, God-only-knows-what pinks and the extremely attractive price point of less than a dollar. They were gigantic, they were cheap, and they weremore 90s than a pair of Zubaz pants.  You could pick up one of these things and nurse it for a really long time, which was ideal for the finances of the 13 year-olds of my era, unacquainted as we were with the harsh…

 Tuesday Farm Photos: The Misty Morning After 
 Farmgirl Susan 10 Jul 2012 | 9:07 am Sunrise in the hayfield You did it! Between Sunday and Monday we got a half inch of beautiful birthday rain. Thank you. It&apos;s definitely a start. Dare I ask for more? It isn&apos;t supposed to be quite as hot this week (&apos;only&apos;in the 90s), and my hunky farmguy Joe says when the mist comes up like it did last night, it&apos;s like getting another quarter inch of rain. There still isn&apos;t any hay to cut in the hayfield, and a lot of the grass out there has completely died, but we haven&apos;t completely given up hope yet. If we keep getting rain on a regular basis, there&apos;s a… 
 Monday Dose of Cute: How Do We Celebrate Birthdays on the Farm? 
 Farmgirl Susan 9 Jul 2012 | 11:10 am By doing as little as possible. You guys are the rain dancing/hoping/praying best. As I was finishing up yesterday&apos;s post, I heard a little thunder. Less than a half hour after I hit publish, it was raining. Best birthday present ever. Plus I didn&apos;t have to water the garden. We only ended up getting about 1/4 inch of rain, but it was still exciting, as you can see from the soggy beagle Bert blur below. He&apos;d just come in from his morning route through the wet grass and is doing the horizontal happy dance on his beloved Coolaroo (best pet purchase ever). Five more photos below. .

Just joining us? You&apos;ll find all the Friday Farm Fix posts here. Heading back from Donkeyland after Monday&apos;s surprise rain. Blast furnace hot, dry as a bone. Nothing has changed since last week, except the thermometer keeps climbing and the fields keep getting browner. Nobody around here has any grass left in their pastures. The only thing that&apos;s still green in our front field is the blasted cactus…

 An Easy Recipe for Old-Fashioned Blackberry Crisp (and Life in Small Town America) 
 Farmgirl Susan 4 Jul 2012 | 1:39 pm This simple crisp is a sweet treat for breakfast or dessert (recipe here). The wild blackberries are usually ripe about now, if there are any. Most years the bushes along the roadsides and in the fields are covered with showy white blossoms in spring, giving us the impression that soon the canes will be heavy with jewel-like fruit. But somewhere in between the flowers and the picking season the rain usually stops, and if any berries do form, they&apos;re often small and pungent and full of seeds. One year I went berry picking out past Donkeyland with baby Cary (who is doing fine by the way), and…

 Tiny Farmhouse Friday: Standing Your Ground Regarding Pig Mud Pits 
 22 Jun 2012 | 1:23 pm A few weeks ago, my brother asked me if we&apos;d be making mud pits for Prudence and Rebecca. My answer went something like this,&quot;Hell no. If it rains, fine, they can make a mud pit. But I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be making any mud pits for them.&quot;What I should have said, had I thought carefully about the question was,&quot;Welllllllll...it really depends. You know, on what Prudence wants.&quot;Because

 Beet, Goat Cheese, and Bacon Salad with Honey-Lime Dressing 
 7 Jun 2012 | 11:01 am Beets are growing in our garden as we speak. I&apos;d like it if, as I typed, they did a little real life time-lapse effect, and expanded quickly from seed to golden globe, ready for roasting. Alas, gardening requires patience. Our beet seeds were sown on the 14th of April, and my garden calendar alleges that they&apos;ll be ready for harvest this weekend, along with the Paris Market carrots. Judging 
 Israeli Cous Cous with Roasted Sweet Potato and Collard Greens 
 1 Jun 2012 | 10:31 am On Tuesdays and Thursdays each week, my local Whole Foods store is kind enough to provide me large trash bags full of their vegetable compost - well, they&apos;re actually providing it to my pigs, but the pigs haven&apos;t learned to drive just yet, and someone has to handle the transport. The loot is wildly popular with the swine, as indicated by their enthusiastic grunting at the rustle of the trash

 Coconut Dreams (raw, gluten-free, honey-sweetened) 
 Shannalee 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am When we go home, it’s not five minutes before I’m bounding up the stairs to my room, the room with mocha-colored walls that my dad let me pick the paint for, where the bookcase is still filled with my books and the windows overlook a backyard I’ve watched, year after year, turn from green to brown to white winter snow before my eyes. I plop down my bags and head back to the kitchen, a kitchen where the fridge holds unending options, from last night’s leftovers to fresh cherries and strawberries to kombucha. At night, Tim and I share the big wooden sleigh bed I’ve…

We’re walking through the grocery store, and Tim’s telling me about this idea he has for using up the case of blueberries in our cart (because apparently it’s an annual tradition).“It’d be like a cookie,”he’s saying,“but you wouldn’t bake it, and there’d be blueberries mixed inside. Then, we’ll dip them in chocolate!” I hear my mouth say something like OK even as I’m rounding…

We’ll be slower to respond this week (no Internet at the cabin!) but we’ll be back here as soon as we can.] Here’s the thing about Nashville: it’s not Chicago. I mean, I’ve liked Music City since the day I came but, besides Tim, there’s little about it that feels like home. It’s smaller and it’s…

 Roasted Cabbage Wedges + Blogger Ideas for Using up Your CSA Vegetables 
 Shannalee 26 Jun 2012 | 5:00 am I keep wanting to write that joining a CSA is like having a child but, I’m 99% sure the only thing that would do is prove I’m not a parent. And probably make all of you who are parents hate me. So joining a CSA is not like having a child. It’s just a responsibility—the kind where you have to be faithful to go get your pickups, at which point a bushel of freshly picked produce is placed in your hands, and then you’re sent home to care for it and do something with it; and then, you hear about the creative and nurturing things everyone else who is part of a CSA is doing with their…

 White on Rice Couple 9 Jul 2012 | 9:43 pm There are only a handful of things you come across in your life which change how you live everyday. An extraordinary person. Discovering a dream job. Having a baby or in our case, bringing home a puppy for the first time. Maybe a life altering moment which sends you in an unforeseen direction.Or maybe it was something less dramatic. Something you picked up as a hobby or started learning for any number of reasons, but you found yourself deeply drawn into it. It quietly changes you little by little, embedding itself into your life. You start thinking about it all of the time. In the shower,… 
 Curry Cauliflower Pickles&amp;Love of salty crunch 
 White on Rice Couple 3 Jul 2012 | 11:54 am I love me plenty of good pickles. Anyone else here in the pickle-loving camp? Please chime in because I’d love to know that there are other obsessive picklers out there. When I eat something off the grill, bbq or a sandwich, I crave a fresh and salty crunch. If the pickles have some extra spice, unique flair or flavor, then I’m double happy! Yes, admittedly I’m addicted to pickles and if you crack open a new jar of fresh homemade pickles, I’ll devour the whole jar in one sitting.This pickle recipe is long overdue and it’s dedicated to my pal Lori at Lemons and…

 Basil Poached Apricots a la Mode – A 6 year old romance

If a young child ever knew the feeling of love and obsession, it was me and a hidden apricot tree in Reno, Nevada back in the 70′s. Those memories of racing heart beats, sweaty palms and nervous butterflies-in-the-stomach feelings are still so clear to me after all these years.Almost every weekend, my parents would head to their friends house for weekly dinner parties. I don’t remember much of the hosts nor their nourishing dinner gatherings. Mom and Dad would always reminisce about how much they loved…

 Maui Coffee Farm Tour

Well, Maui is giving the Big Island a run for its cup o’ Kona. Maui has more than 50 coffee farms and over 500 acres in production. And, as I learned on my last trip, Maui’s coffee is like homegrown aloha in a cup.

 Strawberry and Mint Mojito (Made with Beer) 
 Jerry James Stone 9 Jul 2012 | 12:50 pm Looking for a fun twist on the classic mojito, well look no further! Unlike the last beer-inspired cocktail I made with Ashley V Routson--which was a mix of berries and bourbon--this one is a much more traditional concoction. But don&apos;t let that fool ya! Made with fresh strawberries, American blonde ale and agave nectar...this mojito is anything but ordinary. It&apos;s fresh, bright and bound to be a classic. But why blonde ale? As Ashley mentions in the video below, you can pretty much use beer in any cocktail recipe which calls for club soda. And a blonde ale is just bright enough to pair with a…

 Stephanie Rosenbaum 7 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am With the fourth of July falling on a Wednesday this year, the holiday&apos;s become a week-long vacation for everyone I know. Which, for me, as a footloose sort of person who&apos;s good with cats and plants, means lots of housesitting offers--so many, in fact, that I&apos;ve gotten kind of picky. Gorgeous view of downtown SF from Bernal Heights? I&apos;m there! Hot tub in the Oakland hills? Sure! Or chickens, just about anywhere. Right now, I&apos;m back in one of my favorite places, a comfortable house in Marin with a sprawling yard alongside a creek shaded by huge oak trees. In the kitchen, there&apos;s olive oil…

 Nori Rolls 
 Carolyn 11 Jul 2012 | 8:54 am These nori rolls combine some of the best characteristics of (1) sushi, (2) summer rolls, (3) burritos, and (4) MacGyver. They&apos;re savory as shit...ake, full of raw fresh vegetables, have guac in them (always a good thing), and help save lives without using a gun. They&apos;d be bikini-friendly, too, if I could stop shoving them into my mouth. Oh well, you can&apos;t have it all.

The first two are about food, and the second two made the cut on sheer awesomeness. 
 Books in Brief: Ripe by Cheryl Sternman Rule and Paulette Phlipot 
 Carolyn 30 Jun 2012 | 9:57 am Ripe is a cookbook full of liberated fruits and vegetables. &quot;Fall in love with us because we&apos;re smart, vibrant, and hilarious,&quot; they&apos;re not afraid to say. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve got antioxidants, but get over it already and have a little fun.&quot; Maybe I&apos;m a tad biased by the fact that author Cheryl Sternman Rule is one of my favorite food writers, but I can&apos;t really imagine a better premise for a produce cookbook. Nor, frankly, a better execution.

 5 Ways to Use Cashews Instead of Cream (and Not Want to Cry One Bit) 
 Carolyn 15 Jun 2012 | 4:11 am Years ago on this site I let you know that &quot;you won&apos;t find me noshing contentedly cashew cheese in this lifetime.&quot; Despite our leaning further away from animal products over time and my even having taken a raw foods class where I learned to make cashew cheese, that&apos;s still a true statement. Cashew cheese may be many things to many people, some of whom are no doubt more enlightened, better at inverted eagle pose, and less prone to bouts of moodiness and unexplained blogging hiatuses than I am. But though cashew cheese may be many things to many people, there&apos;s one thing that cashew cheese most…

 Baked Spelt Porridge with Vanilla, Huckleberries&amp;Maple Sugar 
 Matthew 10 Jul 2012 | 8:02 am Though it looks like one, this isn’t sweet enough to be a dessert.  Instead it’s an incredible breakfast that can be served hot or cold, with or without milk.  Baking it in the oven rather than stirring it on the stove gives it a denser texture and frees you from the stove. Drink Pairing:  Strong Cup of French Press Coffee Ingredients:                         Makes 6 Servings 1 cup Cracked Spelt Cereal 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter 2 ½ cups Whole Milk 1 cup Water 1 tsp Tahitian Vanilla Extract (could substitute Bourbon Vanilla Extract) 1/3 cup Maple Sugar 1 pinch of…

 Pansy Nectar Cocktail 
 Katie 6 Jul 2012 | 8:07 am The pansy nectar cocktail is a little bit sweet, a little bit fruity and very delicious. We made a pansy simple syrup by grinding the whole flower (the stem bases&amp;petals) with sugar to get the most of the pansies’wintergreen-mint flavor. Topping off this cocktail with a bit of prosecco (you’re free to use champagne or club soda if you prefer) adds a light effervescence, making this a great spring cocktail.

 Fava&amp;Fresh Chickpea Salad 
 Matthew 4 Jul 2012 | 8:05 am The mix of herbs, greens and fresh beans in this salad gives it a crisp, fresh flavor that’s like Spring distilled into a starter.

 A Rainy Sunday in Paris 
 21 Jun 2012 | 6:04 am It was a chilly, rainy Sunday in Paris and life would be slow. The ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport though, was a quick 30 minutes sans rush hour traffic which can be upwards of 2 hours during the week. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was told they were complet and there would be a wait. Thirty minutes turned to 1 hour, which turned to 2. So much for getting to sleep early. I had plans to meet friends Rick and Brenda for coffee and after 4 hours sleep, I rallied. Friend and colleague, Bettyann, joined us while we sipped the strong coffee and exchanged recent stories. As a flight… 
 Roman Layered Caprese Salad 
 15 May 2012 | 4:19 am If there could be a simply perfect Caprese Salad, this would be it. Fresh and delicate mozzarella sits inside slices of red, ripe tomato that tastes as if kissed by the Tuscan sun. Basil leaves pinched from a garden plant tucked randomly between the layers help catch the drizzling olive oil. Finally, sea salt and freshly ground pepper are waiting to coat each bite. The only thing missing is a crusty piece of focaccia to soak up every last bit of this concerto. Make sure to have some on hand. Wabi-sabi, I can hear a friend of mine saying looking at the natural simplicity.On my last trip to… 
 Rome and a Room with a View 
 12 May 2012 | 3:20 am My flight to Rome arrived late and I was tired. The ride to and from the hotel can be filled with one great view after another. Often, I nod off and wake to find another piece of history outside the van window. There are columns and ruins and statues, one right after another along the ride that can be an hour long.  It was 1:30 in the afternoon by the time we arrived at our hotel in the center of the city. I was already dreaming of the crisply made bed in my charming, but small room.A delicate chandelier hung over the bed and the tall shuttered window was ajar.

 The Wedding 
 14 Apr 2012 | 6:41 am The invitations were sent out, the family had arrived from the US, and now as the guests arrived the excitement was building. Being a parent of the bride, I joined in greeting guests into the traditional Korean village for the wedding ceremony. A representative from each side of the family sat at a table to accept wedding gifts. My son, Zac, manned our table with envelopes and a pen. It is customary to give money and as a gift and this is often how it is received. A pair of white cotton gloves were given to the parents to wear as a symbol of formality, somewhat similar to the American custom…

 THE DARING BAKERS&apos; JUNE 2012 CHALLENGE: Going Batty for the Jubilee 
 chef_d 26 Jun 2012 | 6:23 pm I was thrilled when I found out that we were going to make a Battenberg cake for this month. It looks really pretty, it was one of those cakes that made me think &quot;How did they do that?&quot; when I was not into baking yet. Also it was a very nice gesture because it is the Queen&apos;s Diamond Jubilee...not that I am in the UK, far from it...but my parents were in London when it was her Golden Jubilee 10 
 Homemade Marshmallows 
 chef_d 19 Jun 2012 | 5:39 pm I&apos;ve always been fascinated with marshmallows even when I was a kid...those unbelievably soft, mushy and oh so delicious cubes or balls of sugary goodness.

 the beauty of red, yellow and green bell peppers 
 18 Jun 2012 | 9:11 am In the spirit of Meatless Mondays why not explore the beauty of bell peppers. Bell Peppers, also known as sweet peppers, come in different shapes and the colors. The interesting thing about bell peppers is their lack of capsaicin, which is what gives spicy hot peppers their heat. The colors vary based on when the pepper is picked; the green color is the first stage of a pepper&apos;s life and yields the sharpest flavor. Red, yellow and orange peppers are picked a few days or weeks later and give way to a more mellow flavor.(source Wikipedia): Pepper seeds were later carried to Spain in 1493…

 A Couple of Expat Classics, In Brief 
 dan 12 Jul 2012 | 6:27 am Certain restaurants and bars in town, probably as in any major city, become expat hangouts. As to why? Often because they offer food or drink that reminds some faction of the expat community of“back home”, often because they actively encourage the community to come spend time and lucre. I try to include them here and there in my rotation of dining simply as an alternative to what else is out there. Here are a couple of brief looks at two that have been on the radar for awhile. First up, a mainstay of the British expat community–Gibraltar, or, as the sign on the door says,… 
 Lunch in the Serene Republic

To be saved for“slow news”days. On to the food stuffs of the day, a look at the first run through we’ve had of our Veneto regional lunch class–the cooking of the land of Venice, Verona and Treviso…. A couple of fagottini di radicchio–the first word not being at all homophobic, but meaning“bundle”(much as the English version of the word also… 
 Game On – Fantastic Worlds 
 dan 11 Jul 2012 | 6:25 am Oh, there were so many ways I could have gone after yesterday’s Lorem Ipsum piece. Could I have gone to Etaoin Shrdlu, another remnant phrase of typesetting days, specifically the Linotype machine? Certainly. But that’s just a foray into an older version of Qwerty, which we all know from typing on a modern keyboard. Of course that could have led me into alternate keyboards like Dvorak simplified, or ergonomic versions like Maltron and Kinesis. I thought about Cicero, the author of the semi-plagiarized text–I doubt other than those passages I’ve ever read anything by…

While there were many directions I could have gone from that page or the various other pages on the topic I pulled up, the most interesting one, and the one that caught my eye as it fulfilled the requirement of“things I don’t have a f*king clue about”(phrased a trifle differently in the video), was Lorem ipsum. Now, you know Lorem ipsum–you’ve seen it a zillion times. It’s a paragraph of text that shows up in brand new websites… 
 Independence Weekend 
 dan 9 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am Falling as it did between the U.S. and Argentine independence days, this weekend was a quiet one for us–whether or not there was any cause and effect, no idea, but it stood out between past weekends and upcoming ones as one with very few reservation requests. Didn’t stop us from having a whole lot of fun. Taking advantage of the now waning artichoke season once again, I decided on kicking the menu off with an artichoke heart and sun-dried tomato cheesecake–touch of lemon and quatre-epices (white pepper, ginger, clove, nutmeg)–served over an almond meal crust and…

 Chris Ann 7 Jul 2012 | 2:38 pm One of our favorite places in Maryland is Assateague Island Beach.  Assateague Island is a nationally protected 37 mile barrier island in Maryland.  Besides having a beautiful beach with lots of seashells, the island is home to a herd of wild ponies. It was the perfect place to spend our last day together after our LoveFeast Family Beach Week in Ocean City. The beach is perfect for a serene walk collecting shells. The waves and beach are great for boogie boarding. The occasional wild pony is part of the surroundings. Slowing down to look at shells, and enjoying a walk with a friend. Taking…

 Smashed Grilled Potato Recipe&amp;a LoveBomb 
 Kristin 27 Jun 2012 | 7:47 am No, that’s not a typo. It’s meant to say Smashed not Mashed. There are some meals where the culinary stars line up and ingredients meld together to deliver a feast that’s a gift to the giver as well as the recipient. This past weekend, Devon cooked up a meal that was too good to keep to ourselves. I haven’t LoveBombed in a while. Life has been too crazy. But, this weekend, I was reminded how important it is to take time out to share a meal and a moment with someone.

It included an article about a couple who own a restaurant called The Market Restaurant on Lobster Cove, on the water in Gloucester, Massachussetts.In the article, the authors include a recipe for a simple smoked fish stew. I could make that - easily - I thought. So I did:And it&apos;s great. I followed the recipe just about exactly - the only difference is that I only made 3/4 of the recipe, since I knew the full recipe would be too much. As it turns out, 3/4 of the recipe was also way too much. This would easily… 
 Ginger Mojitos 
 Kit Pollard 9 Jul 2012 | 5:55 am We&apos;re back in Baltimore now, after a great few days at Keuka Lake and...oh, what? You want to know what&apos;s in that Schlitz pitcher? Well, OK then. First, let&apos;s just look at how great that pitcher is. Alicia found it deep in a cabinetat the lake house and we had to use it for our fancy cocktail.As for the cocktail itself, I started with this Chowhound recipe for a pitcher full of ginger mojitos.I squeezed all the limes and made the simple syrup before arriving at the lake,so all I had to do there was mix together the base, rum and sparkling water.As it turned out, we thought the original recipe… 
 Holiday Week 
 Kit Pollard 3 Jul 2012 | 6:12 am Still sans power here in Baltimore, we are gearing up for our annual RV trek up to Keuka Lake. It&apos;s one of my favorite trips all year, thanks to things like this:I love the fourth of July. Something you may not know about me:I am super patriotic and super emotional about it (think: tears during the National Anthem), much to the amusement of others.It&apos;s also one of the most relaxing trips we take. With views like this,how could it be anything but relaxing?As usual, Cooper and I will be co-judging the annual Kelly/Baker July 4th throwdown,along with Alicia&apos;s Uncle Joe (previous years here and… 
 Berger Cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches 
 Kit Pollard 28 Jun 2012 | 5:19 am About a month ago, we reviewed Dempsey&apos;s Brew Pub in Camden Yards. Overall, we were impressed with the place - the food was good and everyone was friendly.The whole meal was good, but the best part came at the end, when our waitress told us about dessert. She listed a few options,but I stopped listening when she got to &quot;Berger cookie ice cream sandwich.&quot;They were exactly as advertised - two of the most perfect Berger cookies I&apos;d ever seen, with ice cream in between.Obviously, I had to make them at home. So I made them one day when a bunch of people were coming over.Everyone enjoyed them.

 How to Make Potato Salad: Cold Potato Salad with Pickled Beans, Smoked Salmon and Dill Dressing 
 11 Jul 2012 | 8:45 am This is one of my no recipes posts. I&apos;m just going to share the ingredients that make this Cold Potato Salad with Pickled Beans, Smoked Salmon and Dill Dressing and let you decide how much of each ingredient to put into your own bowl. I have faith you can do it ;) This salad was inspired by two media dinners I attended. At the first one, at Jackson 20, I received pickled beans as a going away 
 Dinner Party with McCormick Gourmet: Cooking from Tupelo Honey Cafe Cookbook 
 8 Jul 2012 | 7:04 pm Last month I received an email from McCormick asking if I&apos;d like to host a dinner party using some of their spices. I was up for the challenge. I received a set of spices, some tools of the trade and a gift card. I then had to come up with a theme for a party and make at least one appetizer, main course and a dessert. Not too hard, right? Well, it wasn&apos;t almost until the last minute that I 
 Best Breakfast Potatoes Ever: Visit to Woodberry Kitchen in Baltimore, MD for Brunch 
 6 Jul 2012 | 11:00 am It&apos;s been almost a week since I&apos;ve had the best breakfast potatoes. If you read the title of this post, you can easily figure out where I&apos;ve had the best breakfast potatoes ever: Woodberry Kitchen. I&apos;ve heard amazing things about Woodberry Kitchen, located in Baltimore, on Twitter and from my friends. So when my friend Cecilia decided to get a zip car for a day and asked me what we should do

 Slightly Healthier Muffins: Blueberry Peach Oatmeal Muffin Recipe 
 2 Jul 2012 | 9:01 am Today I&apos;m taking a short break from recapping my trip to Asheville (Part 1, Part 2) to share with you a recipe for slightly healthier muffins. These muffins are definitely not diet food, but they don&apos;t have a ton of fat or sugar in them. Also, they use almost the same amount of oats as they do flour. This is not the first time I&apos;m making this recipe. Almost two years ago I made Blueberry&amp;

 Steamed Fish with Lime, Garlic, and Chilies (Pla Nueng Ma-Nao ปลานึ่งมะนาว) En Papillote 
 11 Jul 2012 | 5:54 pm Here&apos;s another way to cook the classic Thai family restaurant favorite: Pla Nueng Ma-Nao (ปลานึ่งมะนาว). Cooking this dish en papillote (in a parchment bag) does not add anything to it in terms of taste; it does, however, make for a great presentation when you entertain and lend itself as a practical solution for the time when you have just a small piece of fish to cook for one person. Simply follow the recipe for steamed fish with lime, garlic, and chilies. Instead of placing the fish in a... .... 
 My Recommendations: Ten Thai Restaurant Dishes in Chicago 
 9 Jul 2012 | 8:15 am Please follow this link to Serious Eats Chicago to find out the subjective and idiosyncratic criteria I use when eating out at a Thai restaurant. There&apos;s so much more to say about the subject, and I didn&apos;t even begin to scratch the surface with what I&apos;ve said. Also, there are many more Thai restaurant dishes (in the US) which I&apos;d like to recommend to you. But I hope this will do for now. [For those who are curious, the photo above is the beef curry noodles from Rosded in Chicago. To make... .... 
 Dried Pepper-Butter Shrimp 
 7 Jul 2012 | 6:21 pm I&apos;ve just realized that there have been quite a few recipes and photos which I&apos;ve posted for those who follow me on Twitter and Facebook which my other readers who are not connected with me on those platforms have never seen. These don&apos;t even include the recipes which I&apos;ve developed for my weekly column on Serious Eats. So since I&apos;ll be traveling overseas for the next several weeks, I thought, for the next couple of weeks, I would post some of the things some of you have missed on here. But,... .... 
 Thai Fish Sauce Taste Test 
 2 Jul 2012 | 4:15 pm I have recently done a taste test on seven Thai brands of fish sauce that, according to a private poll, are the easiest to find in the United States. [Other brands exist in the market, of course, but we&apos;re going to focus on these Thai brands. Non-Thai brands are intentionally excluded from this test; I&apos;ll write about them in the sequel to this post.] And here&apos;s the result. First, a disclaimer: There are some standard criteria that are used to measure the quality of fish sauce. Good fish... ....

This fried noodle dish has no name. You can called it spicy Thai fried noodles with beef and broccoli, if that makes sense. I always call this &quot;noodles with no name&quot; just because it sounds like the American song, A Horse with No Name -- the song that constantly... ....

 Evaluating and Using Yixing pots 
 Jason 10 Jul 2012 | 2:31 pm Choosing an yixing teapot can be an intimidating task. There are many things to consider: - Am I paying a fair price? - How well will the pot &quot;season&quot; or develop with use? - How do I pair the right tea with the right pot? - Is the pot&apos;s design and construction sound and functional? 
 Schedule of Reviews 
 Jason 6 Jul 2012 | 6:26 am I was just looking at my review schedule. I have less than 10 openings left for scheduled reviews this year.

 Ice Cream Takes the Cake 
 7 Jul 2012 | 6:22 am I love ice cream - who doesn&apos;t? But sometimes a scoop just isn&apos;t enough. Here&apos;s where an ice cream cake comes into play; it&apos;s decadent (always a good pie quality), requires no baking (important in July), and makes a big impression on guests (an extra bonus). In other words, an ice cream cake is the perfect summer dessert!

 No Tahini Hummus - Loaded with Sesame Flavor 
 redkathy 8 Jul 2012 | 8:40 am Summertime is equated with eating fresh, cold, and light. Fresh vegetables, main dish salad ingredients, and in season fruits are always on hand. My meals look more like snacks in the summer. Hubby on the other hand, has to have his meat. With only two of us at home, I find it quite easy to prepare summertime meals that satisfy us both. Fire up the grill, char a piece of meat and he’s happy. In preparing for the last #SundaySuper I cooked several varieties of beans and roasted a few pounds of mini sweet peppers. These are both great salad ingredients but better still make for a… 
 Roasted Red Pepper&amp;White Bean Salad #SundaySupper 
 redkathy 30 Jun 2012 | 10:00 pm Mini sweet peppers are addicting. Not only are they sweet and delicious but colorful too! Roasting these mini sweet peppers has been on my recipe to do list for quite some time. With a fresh 2 lb. bag of Pero Family Farms Mini Sweet Peppers in the fridge, I knew this Sunday Supper Event, Fourth of July Fun, was the perfect opportunity to cross those roasted mini peppers off my recipe to do list. I equate celebrating holidays like July 4th with extreme food and fun; yep, this sweet pepper and white bean salad would be made from scratch. Taste buds in motion I was thinking how the old school… 
 Banana Nutella Snack Cake - Chilled Summer Cake 
 redkathy 24 Jun 2012 | 9:52 am Overripe bananas turn out the perfect banana snack cake but it is too darn hot for baking. What&apos;s a Florida cake lover to do? I found the answer in this banana cake recipe. This Nutella topped banana cake recipe starts with a cake mix and tastes most excellent when chilled. Using a cake mix reduces prep time, Nutella eliminates making a frosting, and the &quot;chill factor&quot; allows for baking after the sun has set! Banana Nutella Snack Cake Ingredients 1 Betty Crocker Super Moist yellow cake mix 1 cup cup mashed ripe bananas (2 - 3) 1/2 cup cup light sour cream 2 large eggs 1/4 cup cup… 
 Bacon Stuffed Jucy Lucy Burger | A Fathers Day #SundaySupper 
 redkathy 16 Jun 2012 | 10:00 pm Grilled meats are a favorite for my family, which is not surprising considering I’m the only woman in the house. It isn&apos;t that I don’t enjoy grilling or eating grilled foods, it’s about the need for meat. Do you know what it is like to be surrounded by carnivorous “meat and potato” men? My father is the worst kind of male carnivore, one who detests chicken! As a chicken fanatic, I consider it meat even though formally it’s poultry. One night while living with us, Dad abruptly blurted out, “Chicken for dinner, I’m sick of damn chicken. I want beef, a…

No more worries about the amount of food, family schedules, or who’s bring a friend home for dinner. “It’s just us honey and it’s sooo hot. I’ll whip up a few crazy delicious salads and serve up smorgasbord salad plates. It’ll be fun, what do think?” The response, a heartfelt smile and nod followed by, “Whatever you say dear.” Therefore, salad it…

 Passport to Pinot Noir: Russian River 
 Alana 22 May 2012 | 3:16 pm I don’t know. It’s the heartbreak grape. Difficult to vinify. For me, it’s a metaphor for the process of art.

And it doesn’t happen often. But, forsaking money, and with no [...]

 Hello, Monaco 
 10 Jul 2012 | 3:39 pm 8pm. Monte Carlo, Monaco. Le Louis XV by Alain Ducasse.One of those pinch me, how can this be real moments. The butter trolley, the bread trolley, the champagne trolley, the cheese trolley, the tea trolley, the dessert trolley. We need more of these opulent, over the top extravagant restaurants in the US. The type where there are no prices on menus for the ladies, and the type where your date is expected to accompany you to the bathroom, wait outside and walk you back to the table. In a world where everything is so casual, formality is a treat.Just a preview from dinner, more to come soon ^_^

He&apos;s already skeptical of all my Paris &quot;recommendations.&quot; Suggestions I gathered from American friends in Paris, Paris-based food blogs, and discussion boards like Chowhound.3.25€ for 125 grams.

 independence day {rustic lemon cake} 
 Jennifer Perillo 5 Jul 2012 | 4:16 am A big part of being in a healthy relationship is learning to say two things: 1) I&apos;m sorry and 2) I was wrong. They&apos;re all but five words when combined, but the inherent feelings of inadequacy that are intertwined with admitting them makes them difficult to utter. In a good relationship, where trust and love is both solid and reciprocated, there is no fear in saying them. But what about the solitary relationship we share with ourselves? There is no one to hug us when we admit them, or to make a joke and break the tension of the moment....

I remember the day I found it in a shop in Soho back in 1999 when I started my personal chef business. I put those plans in motion while still working my day job as a video producer—yes, I&apos;ve had a few careers in my short lifetime. While taking a stroll during my lunch break, hanging right there on the wall of a store who&apos;s name I can&apos;t recall but is now long gone, was a clock that read Time to Eat, the same name as my...

 Apple, Beet, and Goat Cheese Spread with Mint 
 9 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am  I like pickled beets. But I mentally associate them with salads.  I find I only eat them when I see them on a salad bar or buy them for my salads at home. I never see them as an ingredient in a dish. I even tried to Google recipes using pickled beets, only to get  recipes for pickled beets and salads. This month I was invited to play along with Kitchen Play’s  progressive dinner party using Aunt Nelly’s Pickled Beets. It’s a sponsored event where six bloggers are challenged to incorporate the same product  into their assigned course. I was assigned the appetizer!

So when he asked if I could make a cookies and cream cheesecake, I started looking for recipes. I couldn’t decide between a baked cheesecake, or this No-Bake Oreo Cheesecake.,  I hankered back and forth and then, when I  saw my friend Barbara’s adapted recipe Robin Eggs No Bake Cheesecake,  I knew which direction I was headed! These were fast and easy to make, no baking required, and produced a creamy delicious…

 Things to Consider When Buying Dinnerware 
 Edward 28 Jun 2012 | 1:51 am When selecting the accessories that will turn your house into a home, dinnerware design is, and always will be hugely important. Some people go to extreme lengths to ensure their dinnerware matches their decoration and vice versa and the truth is, these things really do matter! A good dinnerware set should last for many years, and the simple fact is that you’ll use your plates, bowls, cups and cutlery every day, so you why not invest your time ensuring you are happy with them? When shopping for a dinnerware set you should consider the following to ensure you get the best for your money… 
 Funk Up Your Kitchen With Cool Accessories 
 Edward 27 Jun 2012 | 7:45 am Being able to show off your home is appealing to a hell of a lot of people. Being able to add a little personality to a room makes it more fun to be in! However, the unfortunate truth is, a lot of us end up spending a whole lot of time in our kitchen. So how can we go about making those everyday kitchen chores a little more enjoyable? Thankfully, someone far more intelligent than me has already dedicated their life to creating practical and fun kitchen accessories; let’s take a look at some that offer both style and substance: 1) Magnetic shot glasses. These glasses have magnets on the… 
 British Foods to Try During the London Olympics 
 Edward 31 May 2012 | 4:16 am What is British food? The locals are proud to eat it, but perhaps a little reluctant to talk all that much about it. Sometimes characterised as bland and unadventurous, perhaps British food (like the English language the nation spawned) mainly suffered for being a kind of international default during its colonial period. Having retreated back into the British Isles and a handful of widely disputed rocks dotted around the world, British cuisine isn’t so obviously visible as Indian, Italian, Chinese or any other culture that has exported its ‘brand’ so widely. This summer belongs to the… 
 French leave on a luxury river cruise 
 Edward 15 May 2012 | 4:34 am Of course I should start with a full description of the ship itself. Cezanne is after all lavishly furnished and equipped, efficiently run and luxurious throughout. But before anything else I have to say that the cruise entitled Scenic Normandy&amp;Paris might well have been given the name Gourmet Delights. The dining experience was, in a word, stunning. Not that the cruise was just about good food.  The excursion programme was well thought out and included some memorable visits. A helpful staff provided a swift but discreet service and the large spacious lounge with deep sofas and… 
 Top 5 Fridge freezer models on the market 
 Edward 25 Apr 2012 | 3:39 am written by: sgitau19 Fridge freezers are very important appliances in each home. They provide fresh food storage facilities as well as frozen food storage facilities. The appliances work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to ensure that your food remains safe for consumption. With the many models of fridge freezers available in the market today, consumers should be very careful to ensure that they choose the best one that suits their needs. If it is for home use, you may need to consider the size of your family to know whether you need a small freezer, or a big one. If it is for business use, you…

 Everyone&apos;s a Little Italian: Interview with Rossella Rago and #Giveaway 
 7 Jul 2012 | 6:51 am  Milwaukee is known as the City of Festivals for good reason. In addition to the world&apos;s largest music festival, Summerfest, Milwaukee is also privileged to be the host of some of the world&apos;s best ethnic festivals. One of the tastiest just happens to be Festa Italiana, coming up on July 19-22 (stay tuned below for a chance to win tickets). Celebrating its 35th anniversary, Festa Italiana is the largest Italian event of its kind in America today. The festival, which started in 1976 for the purpose of reuniting an Italian community torn apart by urban renewal projects, was the… 
 Dad Food: Coffee Rubbed Ribeye with Chipotle Butter 
 4 Jul 2012 | 10:48 am  Lori’s dad is a purist when it comes to steak. He prefers his ribeyes seasoned plainly – just a bit of salt, pepper, and a dash of garlic—and grilled to a perfectly medium rare.  The method relies upon impeccably fresh, quality ingredients and a careful hand when grilling. And it yields a perfectly delicious result. So, while it’s true that good steaks do not need much in the way of embellishment, we’ve found that quality steaks are also every bit as delicious when they&apos;ve been gussied up a bit.  And so, yes -- we are fans of the simple…

 Indulge Your Readers: Indulgence Chocolate #Giveaway 
 29 Jun 2012 | 9:34 am  If a blogger writes a blog post in the forest, and no one is around to read it, does it make a sound? Don&apos;t laugh. It&apos;s a serious question. And it brings me to my final words of advice on blogging: Remember that you are never alone. Acknowledge your readers. Gratify them. Give them what they want (within reason). And make them feel special. Because they are special. They&apos;ve gotten you where you are -- wherever that might be. They&apos;ve read your words, re-created your recipes, and shared your news (both good and bad). They&apos;ve become friends, mentors, and your best critics. So, yeah. We&apos;ve… 
 Dare to Be Different: Howling Wolf Barbeque #Giveaway 
 25 Jun 2012 | 8:43 am Culture teaches us to blend in. In school we&apos;re taught to sit still, speak when spoken to, and mind our manners. We abide by moral codes, dress codes, and codes of conduct. When we venture outside of the norm, we reap the consequences of rebellion. When you blog, it&apos;s good to be different -- or, rather, to differentiate yourself. The world really only needs one Pioneer Woman (and mimicking her style isn&apos;t going to win you a book deal or a television show). And, as lovely as Smitten Kitchen is, no one would be very smitten if every blog was just another version of the same. So, here are…

Hey, GoodLife Etc. readers! I’m taking over the GoodLife Eats section today and filling in for Katie while she continues to unpack and organize in Colorado. It’s scorching hot here in my neck of the woods, so just the thought of turning on my oven makes me break out into heat-induced hives. However, there’s one minor issue – I operate a baking blog. Since I can’t leave my readers hangin’, I’ve been trying to come up with… 
 Summer Reading for Adults: 5 Recommendations from Janssen 
 Katie 27 Jun 2012 | 6:00 am Note From Katie: Please welcome guest author Janssen from Everyday Reading as she shares some of her favorite summer reading suggestions! We’ve been going to the pool a lot and I know I could use a new book to read poolside while the kids swim.  I haven’t read any of the books on this list and can’t wait to check them out just as soon as we get new library cards! Even if you aren’t in school yourself or have kids in school, summer just feels different, I think. And what better way to celebrate the warm weather and vacation season than with a couple of good books? 5… 
 Triple Berry Lemon Galette [Whole Foods Gift Card Giveaway] 
 Katie 26 Jun 2012 | 3:08 pm Spring and Summer have always been home to my most favorite fruits: berries! Raspberries are my favorite, but I’ll take blueberries or blackberries any day.  I love them for breakfast, snacks, desserts, even in salads at dinner. After getting settled in our new house the first thing I wanted to do was make dessert. I haven’t made dessert in months! The last time I had a piece of something sweet to eat after dinner was when my friend Tracy had us over for dinner in New Mexico and served Strawberry Rhubarb Pie for dessert the night before we moved. That is just too long in between… 
 Let Your Great Taste Shine [$150 val. Giveaway!] 
 Katie 22 Jun 2012 | 6:30 am How Do You Let Your Great Taste Shine? Big question, right? It’s one I’ve been thinking about all week. There are lots of answers and none right or wrong. This morning I finally decided that my answer comes down to Quality vs. Quantity. I’ve always been one to focus on a few things of high quality, even if that means spending more money or taking longer to get what I desire. I started thinking about this Quality vs. Quantity comparison and realized how many aspects of my life this mentality has seeped into. (Make sure you scroll to the end for the great giveaway!)

Well, it’s been 2 weeks since we“moved in”to our new house in Colorado (we arrived a few days before our stuff did) and I’m pretty pleased with myself that we’ve managed to unpack in a fraction of the time that it took us to pack: 6 weeks to pack, 2 weeks to unpack (save for a few boxes of books in the office that are waiting for a certain someone to anchor the bookcase to the wall). I haven’t done a move in 7 years, and we had a…

 Chocolate Coconut Pudding 
 10 Jul 2012 | 2:28 pm Until I began bakingwith the original Tuesdays With Dorie baking group, I&apos;d never made pudding from scratch. Box mixes are very easy and tasty enough. In the last few years, however, we TWD bakers have tackled homemade pudding on a couple of occasions: split level (vanilla) pudding, and real butterscotch pudding (not to mention flan, creme brulee, cup custard, pots de creme, and various bread puddings - all of these, plus a few non-Dorie offerings, can be found by clicking on my blog&apos;s pudding tag).Dorie has a specific method to her pudding recipes, not difficult by any means, but… 
 La Palette Strawberry Tart 
 8 Jul 2012 | 3:49 pm Several months ago, when I was in California, I came across some great strawberries. I snapped them up and immediately baked up Dorie Greenspan&apos;s La Palette&apos;s Strawberry Tart from Baking From My Home to Yours. The recipe has only three elements: tart crust, strawberry jam, and macerated fresh strawberries, and I knew that each element had to shine. The berries were amazing (so much so that I didn&apos;t even macerate), and I know that Dorie&apos;s tart crust is perfection. To match the quality of the first two elements, I splurged on some beautiful French strawberry… 
 Blueberry Sour Cream Ice Cream 
 3 Jul 2012 | 2:48 pm In much of the US in recent days the weather has been just a bit warm shall we say? I saw the forecast of the advancing heat wave, and prepared to hunker down: changed the filters in the air conditioning system, dug out shorts and tank tops, and closed the blinds against the strong afternoon sun.And I made ice cream.The Tuesdays With Dorie group choose Blueberry Sour Cream Ice Cream soon after I joined the group in 2008. I didn&apos;t have an ice cream maker at the time, so I took and excused absence and baked something different that week. But now that I&apos;m trying to finish every… 
 Double Crusted Blueberry Pie 
 26 Jun 2012 | 1:20 pm Here&apos;s a piece of life advice: the next time you make a pie, make the crust you need and then immediately make another batch of pie dough. You&apos;ve already got the recipe in front of you, the bowls and implements are already dirty, and you will not believe the virtuous feeling you will have when you slip the extra dough into the freezer, knowing that with a bit of work now you are saving yourself a lot of time later.And later? When you look in your freezer and there is a nice disk or two of pie crust, you know that you can have a pie in the oven in a matter of minutes. This week I… 
 Mixed Berry Cobbler 
 18 Jun 2012 | 9:49 pm  Berries are my favorite fruit group, and I revel in the plentiful, reasonably-priced fresh berries that are available in the summer months. Last year I had a huge stash of blueberries and blackberries in my fridge and realized that I wasn&apos;t going to be able to use them all before an out of town trip. I put them all in a 2 gallon zipper freezer bag and spread them out as much as my freezer allowed, and they froze beautifully. I figured that I could bake with them in the cold winter months when berries are sparse, imported from miles and miles away, and expensive. …

 And now, a word from the Blizz Prez’s grandpa 
 Blizz Prez 10 Jul 2012 | 4:43 am Gather ‘round, kiddies. I want to tell you about the good old days. When I was a kid, I did odd jobs. The odder the better. One day I earned ten cents mowing my neighbor’s sidewalk, so I headed straight for the candy store. I was there for two days, just trying to decide how to spend those precious nickels. I wasn’t lucky enough to have the NEW Chocolate Candy Shop Blizzard Treat, with its assorted mini chocolates (filled with hazelnut crème, fudge or caramel) blended with dark, decadent cocoa fudge and creamy vanilla soft serve. Three different chocolates in one treat! Such a thing… 
 BOOM! POW! WOW! 
 Blizz Prez 3 Jul 2012 | 4:47 am The Fourth of July is truly summer on display: boats on the lake, parades in the street and fire in the sky. And if you’re lucky, you’ve got an open DQ store just around the corner where you can get what I consider the quintessential taste of summertime: the Blizzard Treat. “Oh, sure,” you might think to yourself, “of course the Blizz Prez is gonna try to sweet talk me like that. After all, it’s an election year.” But this is no ordinary stump speech, friend. This is life. Cold, creamy, delicious life. Where would we be without DQtreatsThink of the children. Or, better yet,… 
 So close you can taste it 
 Blizz Prez 26 Jun 2012 | 3:30 am I’m psyched to say that this year you’ve been hands down, the hardest working group of fans a Blizz Prez could ever ask for. I’ve noticed your dedicated check-ins, your group stats, your facebook posts–heck, I’ve even seen you at DQ® locations–smart phone in one hand, OREO Blizzard® Treat in the other. So it’s with the love and respect of a Blizz Prez that I announce that we’re now over half-way to the OREO 100 Promo finishing line and I couldn’t be prouder. But that’s not to say I’m not nervous. There are only eight weeks left to register a team…

We have a lovely patio in the front of our house – perfect for entertaining, or impromptu gatherings.  Dilly® Bars, Buster Bars®, No Sugar Added Bars…and DQ Cakes and Blizzard® Cakes… any of these treats turn a regular gathering into a party.  I love the cakes and the Dilly Bars, personally, and am always surprised at how quickly the Buster Bars go when there is a choice.  When our kids were little and playing on ball teams, the DQ… 
 It’s finally here! 
 Blizz Prez 19 Jun 2012 | 3:30 am Tomorrow is the first day of summer. This may not mean much to you if, like me, you choose to start summertime a little early. Like, in March. For months now, I’ve been squeezing in bike rides, picnics and water balloon fights whenever possible. (The balloon battles were chilly but totally worth it.) And now it’s like the rest of the world has caught up to me! Welcome to summer, guys! Let’s celebrate by meeting at DQ for the quintessential summer Blizzard Treat, the one and only… uh… hmm. Some flavors are easily tied to a certain season, like the Butterfinger Blizzard Treat, which…

 Gingerbread House Videos 
 6 Jul 2012 | 5:01 pm In southern hemisphere places like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, some people like to celebrate &quot;Christmas in July,&quot; because December is their summertime, and no one wants to roast a turkey when it&apos;s 100 degrees outside. Instead they do it in July, which is their winter. So for all my southern hemisphere readers, and anyone else who might be feeling Christmasy, we have two new videos on the site that demonstrate how to make gingerbread houses. And for those of you suffering through the heat wave that&apos;s blanketing most of North America, maybe if you watch the videos and think about… 
 Quiz: Is it an Herb or a Spice? 
 6 Jul 2012 | 9:19 am Do you know the difference between a spice and an herb? Maybe intuitively you do, but then again, maybe not. Or, maybe you have the rule down cold—it&apos;s actually pretty simple. Either way, you might enjoy taking this quiz: Is it an Herb or a Spice? It&apos;ll present you with a culinary ingredient and you&apos;ll have to choose whether it&apos;s an herb, or a spice, or neither. Yes, there might be a trick question or two in there. Have fun! Here&apos;s some related info on spices and herbs: What is an Herb? What is a Spice? What is Garam Masala? What are Capers? What are Pimentos? What is Iodized Salt? 
 Suprême Sauce Recipe 
 28 Jun 2012 | 10:23 am The Suprême sauce is a finished sauce made by enriching a chicken veloutésauce with a little bit of butter and heavy cream. The Suprême is an ideal accompaniment for sautéed chicken. It&apos;s also the base from which classical sauces such as the Mushroom Sauce and the Aurora Sauce are built. Suprême sauce recipe. Photo©Eric Yeargan We say that the veloutéis not a &quot;finished sauce,&quot; but the Suprême is. So what does finished mean? In sauce making, finishing can simply mean seasoning with salt and pepper, or maybe adding a bit of butter or cream. In the… 
 What is Quinoa? 
 26 Jun 2012 | 2:03 am We eat a lot of quinoa at my house, and we also enjoy trying out various products made with quinoa, like quinoa pasta and quinoa flakes. So we bought some quinoa cookies last week, and on the back of the box I read this surprising statement: Quinoa salad recipe. Photo©Danilo Alfaro &quot;More precious than gold, this powerhouse grain has now been re-discovered by the world marketplace because of its delicious flavor and high nutritional value.&quot; Now, a pound of quinoa will set you back about five bucks, while the price of gold is currently $1,570 an ounce.

 Refining my kitchen design 
 Ed 11 Jul 2012 | 10:28 pm Do you ever change your mind? My problem is that every time I see another kitchen it gives me an idea for my current one. These drawings and scribblings were refinements I made with Chelsea Hing, my designer, to another option for my kitchen design. Basically it’s a minor variation on my current kitchen in that it moves the fridge from my free standing bench and puts it against the wall. The sink remains facing the outer wall and the stovetop moves to the central island. I guess it’s a layout that I’m familiar with and seems to be a great option. As Poppy who commented on my…

 Chin Chin’s $275 first birthday dinner with the awesome David Thompson was worth it 
 Ed 20 Jun 2012 | 1:30 am Richard Cornish talks to David Thompson. Ben Shewry sits at the bar. I had to think long and hard about attending this dinner. But the fooderati came and ate. $275 for a Thai meal. That’s 13 courses cooked by David Thompson and pretty much unlimited booze. I’ve never spent so much on what is a function meal but I’m glad I did sitting on the corner of the bar seeing David sweating over the woks and pestle and mortar rejecting dishes that weren’t good enough. Usually when you stuff 150 or so people in to a restaurant for a guest chef experience it isn’t quite up to…

I am in the process of upgrading Cooking In Stilettos and there’s a lot going on in the back end– right down to coding recipes, revising plugins and lots of techy stuff that I recently learned.  I can cross a… 
 Grilling In Stilettos: Grilled Ancho Tequila Chicken 
 Aly 10 Jul 2012 | 5:05 am You ever see a recipe photo and think“I REALLY need to make that!”and the thought just consumes you until you make the recipe? That is what I encountered after coming across the July issue of Cooking Light and their recipe for Grilled Chicken Thighs with Ancho Tequila Glaze. The photo just mocked me every time I passed it in the living room, in a store glaring at me from the newsstand and, eventually, when it was on my desk like“Aly – for the love of all things holy – MAKE. ME.”Last week, I broke out my new favorite grill pan and it was on. I do not need much… 
 Fab Friday – Holy Heatwave Edition 
 Aly 6 Jul 2012 | 6:05 am Like I said yesterday, it’s unbearably hot here in Philly so here are a few finds that might take your mind off the wall of humidity just waiting for you outside. (I’m just a barrel of sunshine, aren’t I?) Fab Friday–Holy Heatwave Edition 1. I absolutely adore these Spectator Leather Peep Toe Pumps from Ralph Lauren. They remind me of a pair of stilettos that I absolutely HAD to have from Steve Madden back in the day (and remember taking a tumble down some stairs with and breaking the heel).  Needless to say, these shoes are definitely timeless (and… 
 Roasted Tomato Corn and Black Bean Salad – A Perfect Summer Side Dish 
 Aly 5 Jul 2012 | 6:07 am This heatwave that has Philly (and much of the Northeast) wrapped up in its clutches is brutal – so much so that I am starting to wonder if I’m back living in the humid trenches of Orlando again. I walk out of the house and *boom* the humidity hits like a brick. Add to that the Sous Pug with his issues with the heat (he had heat exhaustion many moons ago) and if you ask him to leave his 70-degree abode, he will probably look at you like you are nuts, plop his butt down and demand watermelon as a penance for even THINKING that he should brave the heat. When the weather is like this, I… 
 Tried and True: Citrus Roasted Chicken 
 Aly 4 Jul 2012 | 8:55 pm One good thing about roasting your own chicken, you control the ingredients and flavors.  Have leftovers?  Well, this chicken works beautifully in lemon chicken noodle soup or a roasted chicken orzo.  I tend to roast a chicken over the weekend and the leftovers come in handy for busy weeknight suppers.  My favorite way to roast the chicken is to stuff it with loads of citrus, some garlic, an onion and viola!  Simple, right?  Sometimes I toss some onions, potatoes and carrots at the bottom of the pan as a type of“roasting rack”and add a bit of chicken stock halfway through…

 Los Angeles: The Not Quite Old School Burger at Nick&apos;s Cafe

 Video: McDonald&apos;s Chef Shows How to Make Big Mac Sauce 
 Robyn Lee 10 Jul 2012 | 1:00 pm From A Hamburger Today This recent video from McDonald&apos;s in Canada answers a customer&apos;s question asking what&apos;s in Big Mac sauce by showing how to make the sauce at home (along with the rest of the Big Mac), with help from McDonald&apos;s Executive Chef Dan Coudreaut. In the video Coudreaut specifies that he&apos;s not using the same exact ingredients they use at McDonald&apos;s, but similar ones you can get at your local grocery store. Here&apos;s his list: mayonnaise sweet pickle relish yellow mustard white wine vinegar garlic powder onion powder paprika To compare, these are the Big Mac sauce ingredients…

 &apos;Great Tortilla Soup&apos; From Rick Bayless: Quick&amp;Easy for Souper (Soup, Salad and Sammie) Sundays 
 8 Jul 2012 | 5:21 pm Much of the U.S. is having record heat waves this week so soup may not seem particularly appealing to many. Here, we have plugging along with the usual mid-80&apos;s during the day. 70&apos;s at night, a little humid but still a good temperature for a warm, slightly spicy soup like this &quot;Great Tortilla Soup&quot; by Rick Bayless. Tortilla Soup, especially when the delicious toppings are fully loaded into the bowl and the warm broth poured on top, is a great soup for any time of year.This one uses salsa and broth as its base, making it a snap to throw together. It&apos;s fun to play around a bit with the shape of… 
 Watermelon Mojitos (Mojito de Sandia): Salud! and Happy July 4th! 
 4 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am My favorite warm weather cocktail is the mojito. Done right, it is refreshing, lightly tangy, slightly sweet, crisp and oh-so cooling. The key to a great mojito is in the muddling--too little muddling and you have a flavorless mint salad in a glass but the right amount of muddling releases all of the flavor of the ingredients and turns it into something special.Although a simple, traditional lime-mint-rum mojito is my normal choice, it is fun to play with different flavors and ingredients such as this Watermelon Mojito or Mojito de Sandia from Rick Bayless. Add some blueberries and watermelon… 
 Creamy Artichoke-Lemon Soup: Hot or Cold for Souper (Soup, Salad&amp;Sammie) Sundays 
 1 Jul 2012 | 5:47 pm This was one of those standing in front of the fridge at 7:00 PM, needing a soup for this week but having no idea of what to make times. It was a long grubby Saturday working on a file clean out project for work--so it had to be quick and easy--I had no patience for more. There were potatoes that needed to be used and some cashew cream (the genius vegan or non-dairy answer to silky thick cream or sour cream) already made. Wanting something a little more special than a cold potato soup, I got out a can of artichoke hearts from the pantry and tossed it together with some onions. celery, lemon… 
 The Book Tour Stops Here: We Only Know So Much by Elizabeth Crane with Fresh Blueberry Crisps 
 29 Jun 2012 | 2:51 am You think your family has issues? The multigenerational Copeland family puts the dys in dysfunctional. There&apos;s Gordon, a man who cherishes (his own) knowledge but seems to be losing his memories, his wife Jean, shut off and withdrawn from the family and mourning the loss of her artist lover who took his own life. The kids are teenager Priscilla--&quot;an extreme brat&quot; and nine-year-old Otis, &quot;sweet&quot; but a bit strange. They reside in a large colonial house in a Midwestern college town along with Gordon&apos;s father Theodore, suffering from Parkinson&apos;s disease, and Theodore&apos;s mother Vivian, 98,… 
 Salsa Mac-n-Cheese (or in this case Cheeze): Easy, Creamy Vegan Pasta Goodness 
 26 Jun 2012 | 2:21 pm Rick Bayless&apos; Salsa Mac and Cheese is a easy way to change up a classic dish. I love macaroni and cheese but since cheese and dairy don&apos;t love me back and clog up my breathing, making and eating a batch of it isn&apos;t in my best interest. Thus the beauty of the vegan cheeze sauce--it has much of the taste and texture of a dairy-based cheese sauce but I don&apos;t find myself regretting it the next day. Plus it has much less fat than the original and no cholesterol--can&apos;t beat that. Since it&apos;s Potluck week at I Heart Cooking Clubs and I have been salivating over this mac-n-cheese mixed with salsa…

 The Side Dish: Daily Blender Video Adventures 
 Jennifer Heigl 29 Jun 2012 | 8:47 am Yep, you read that right. Daily Blender, live and on camera. Now that DB is a few years in – four to be exact – it seems I’ve had more people ask when I’m going to start doing interviews on camera. When they ask, a small part of my stomach starts to crunch and churn, like one’s middle half does when asked to give a speech to a room full of business associates, or throw the opening pitch of a Mariners game. Proud that someone would suggest it, yet full of nervous hesitation. By nature, as a writer, I like being behind the scenes, sitting at my desk (either quietly or with loud music… 
 Weather and Wins at the 2012 Northwest Spirits and Mixology Show 
 Jennifer Heigl 27 Jun 2012 | 9:00 am The weather was a little unstable during this past weekend’s Northwest Spirits and Mixology Show. Situated in a mountain valley in the drier, Eastern side of the state, Bend, Oregon, has a reputation of warm, sunny summers, but this year, the spirits event was a bit more of an adventure, winds whipping at the blue Roaring Lion canopies protecting vendor tables from sun or storm, gloomy skies greeting vendors and visitors as they arrived early Saturday morning making way to mid-afternoon sun. When the Bartender’s Brawl began late in the afternoon, there had been a few powerful gusts… 
 Quick Spin: Chef Patrick Warner 
 Jennifer Heigl 12 Jun 2012 | 10:00 am It’s a tiny space by most restaurant standards–at least in this town. A beautiful six-top hardwood bar prominently situated along the east wall, a handful of tables and chairs along the north and west walls. At capacity, the area probably seats forty comfortably, though a standing soiree could range from 50 to 100 guests. The sociable servers double as bartenders and sommeliers, the kitchen is a mere fraction of the dining space, and the pastry chef is confined to a four foot by three foot compact area situated between the bar and the line of fire. But Scratch, in Portland’s… 
 With Bowery Bagels, Madigan Brings A Little New York to Portland 
 Jennifer Heigl 7 Jun 2012 | 2:03 pm Michael Madigan crosses the street like a New Yorker. As we passed his KitchenCru–a culinary incubator designed for small food startups to create and build products–on the way to his Bowery Bagels shop opening next week, I couldn’t help but think Madigan has a reason to walk fast and not bother with petty things like crosswalks. KitchenCru, open for nearly a year and utilized by thirty-eight regular clients, has kept him plenty busy. But being obsessive about quality and even more fanatical about the creating the right New York bagel (he’s originally from Brooklyn) has… 
 The Side Dish: A Restaurant Without A Website… 
 Jennifer Heigl 6 Jun 2012 | 9:21 am …is like a fork without a knife.…a chef without a sous.…a mirepoix without carrots. It’s been a regular conversation lately, at least amongst the Portland food crowd, about how surprising it is to find that a new restaurant is without a website. In this day and age, it’s not only baffling, it’s inevitably hurting your business. Worse yet, an incomplete website, a list of hours not actually reflected on the premises, an abandoned Twitter account. Don’t get me wrong – I don’t need to be bombarded by an eager PR intern who fills my feed with photos and updates and…

 Chocolate Naive: A Q&amp;A;With Domantas Užpalis 
 clotilde 9 Jul 2012 | 10:30 am Today I bring you an interview with Domantas Užpalis, a bean-to-bar chocolate maker from Lithuania who contacted me a few months ago to tell me about his project, Chocolate Naive: he and his team roast, winnow, grind and temper their own chocolate in a manufacture based in the Lithuanian countryside. He offered to send samples of their new collection, which includes a 43% milk chocolate, a 68% Uganda chocolate with fleur de sel, a 71% Grenada chocolate, and a 63% cinnamon-orange chocolate. I received the bars, tasted them, and was truly impressed: this was excellent chocolate, complex and… 
 Pecan Carrot Cake 
 clotilde 25 Jun 2012 | 10:30 am There will be a special place in my baker&apos;s heart for the first project I undertook post-baby, and I take it as a fine omen that it is also an exceptionally good cake, one I have already baked again twice since then. Our son (it still feels surreal typing these words) is now six weeks old, he is thriving, and although the first weeks were challenging in ways I had been told about but couldn&apos;t truly penetrate until I experienced them firsthand, our little family is finding its rhythm and every day brings new reasons to feel lucky that we landed this particular charming baby. We have had… 
 The Bun and the Oven 
 clotilde 21 May 2012 | 8:45 am Maxence and I are extraordinarily happy to announce that we are now the proud parents of a little boy named Milan, born in Paris a week ago. Everything went smoothly, the three of us are doing splendidly, and so far Milan is proving to be a very sweet, easy baby: a good sleeper, a good eater, and an all-around adorable little person if you ask us. Still, things will likely be a bit more quiet around here as we get the rest we need, adjust to this new chapter of our lives, and I learn to type with just one hand. In the meantime, be well, eat well, and I&apos;ll talk to you soon!Continue reading… 
 Patte de Loup (Wolf&apos;s Paw Apple) 
 clotilde 8 May 2012 | 11:27 am Patte de loup -- literally, wolf&apos;s paw -- is the name of an heirloom variety of apple that is chiefly grown in the Northwest of France, and is mentioned in horticultural documents as early as the Middle Age. Small and oddly shapen, with a rugged, brownish yellow skin that often cracks and scars as if a wolf had clawed it, it is typically the kind of apple that did not stand a chance in the modern battle for glossy and perfectly calibrated specimens. And yet the patte de loup is very close to apple perfection in my book: sweet and tart, with a firm flesh that is juicy but not too crisp, it… 
 Scone Tops 
 clotilde 25 Apr 2012 | 10:30 am We were expecting friends for brunch on Saturday morning, and I decided to bake scones. Not the triangular wedges stuffed with various ingredients often sold in the US, but the classic, round, plain, British kind. For three years, almost to the day, I&apos;d been sitting on a recipe that my dear friend Chika had shared with me, and which she&apos;d drawn from Anton Edelmann&apos;s out-of-print book, Taking Tea at the Savoy. She had mentioned that this was her go-to scone recipe, and it was the one I intended to try, for a change from my usual yogurt scones. The dough was quick and easy to assemble -- a…

 Paris Booksigning: This Saturday, July 14th 
 David 12 Jul 2012 | 5:56 am I’m doing a little booksigning this Saturday at La Cuisine cooking school in Paris. It’s going to be an informal affair and if you’d like to come and get a book signed, this is your chance. There will be copies of Ready for Dessert, The Perfect Scoop, and The Sweet Life in Paris and I’ll be at the school, from 5:30 to 7:30pm, which is located at 80, quai de l’Hôtel de Ville. You can get a map, and more information, at the Facebook event page. Happy Bastille Day! 
 Tahini and Almond Cookies 
 David 9 Jul 2012 | 11:55 pm It was a treat to spend a tasty afternoon in Tel Aviv with Natalie Levin, of the blog Oogio.net, who is a passionate baker. Upon meeting, one of the first things Natalie did was hand over a bag of homemade treats, which included a sack of these Tahini and Almond Cookies. Although I didn’t dive in right away (to be polite), after we visited the outdoor market, when I got back to my hotel, I opened the bag and found myself in love with the crumbly, buttery texture and the slightly exotic taste of smooth tahini (sesame paste)–which I’d never had in a cookie. There was also a… 
 Israeli Breakfast 
 David 6 Jul 2012 | 10:27 am I’m not at my best in the morning. Actually, I’m not at my best until at least 2pm. (Although actually, some might argue it’s even a little later.) To me, breakfast is meant to be enjoyed in monk-like solitude. It’s a time where questions are prohibited and talking should be kept to an absolute minimum. Travel, of course, is fraught with all sorts of ways designed to thwart my precious few moments of quietude in the morning. There’s waking up in hotel rooms and stumbling toward the breakfast room, where unfamiliar people await, sometimes wanting to actually… 
 Israeli Salad 
 David 3 Jul 2012 | 10:07 pm When I met Maya Marom in Tel Aviv, she handed me a box of spices and flavorings, which meant that when I returned home, I could recreate many of the wonderful dishes that I enjoyed there. The best things I had in my travels were the salads loaded with fresh vegetables, which are served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and are especially welcome when the temperature climbs in the summertime. Maya was born in Arizona, but moved to Israel when she was three months old. She is a self-taught cook and baker, and has a gorgeous blog, Bazekalim as well as self-publishing her own food magazine. When… 
 The Hummus Factory 
 David 2 Jul 2012 | 8:09 am Almost all of the people I spoke with said they rarely make their own hummus, simply because the store-bought stuff was as good – if not better – than what they could make at home. (I guess it helps to think of it like peanut butter, where the homemade is very good, but store-bought will suffice.) People have very strong opinions about hummus, like they do about other things, in Israel. And if you mention a particular brand, or a place that makes it, you’re likely going to be told–with absolute certainty–that there’s another one, or place, that’s…

 Apricot Jam: A Homemade Paris Treat 
 Dorie Greenspan 11 Jul 2012 | 6:34 am  I’m a whimsical jammer, meaning I make jam whenever the whim strikes. I don’t plan for jamming, I don’t have special equipment or written-down formulas. I don’t have a jam philosophy and I’m pretty sure I don’t have a jam gene. What I do have is an inordinately grand sense of pride (bordering on shock and awe) when I put fruit in a pot and it becomes jam. For me, jam lives in the realm of the fabulous and I’m always astonished when I can conjure it into reality. The urge to make jam hit last week in what might be… 
 A Sweet Paris Trend: Cocoa Crumbs (and a recipe to play with) 
 Dorie Greenspan 28 Jun 2012 | 2:49 am Often in life and so often in food, it&apos;s the little things that count ... a lot, which is why I was so struck by the difference a generous sprinkle of crisp chocolate crumbs made. And I was struck twice in the same evening.Michael and I started our evening at Fish La Boissonerie, where the new chef is making light, beautiful and really, really delicious food. After so much good food, we decided to share a dessert: chocolate ice cream with warm cherries (&apos;tis the season here) and chocolate crumbs, lots of them covering the ice cream and the fruit. The chocolate and cherries… 
 DIY Proof Box: Father&apos;s Day is Almost Here 
 Dorie Greenspan 15 Jun 2012 | 8:28 am My husband made bread for years. And then he didn’t. The-didn’t period lasted a lot longer than the-did period and then, just recently, he began baking bread again…a lot…and seriously…and beautifully. And soon after he started baking again, he started accumulating breadmaking gear. Some beautiful, like the linen-lined rising baskets, and some not so beautiful, but extraordinarily useful, like his DIY proofing box. But let me back up a few decades. When we first got married, neither of us cooked and neither of us baked. 
 Pinterest, or why I won&apos;t be meeting my deadlines ... 
 Dorie Greenspan 29 May 2012 | 8:39 am I did my best to resist Pinterest. Truly. Like all of you, I&apos;ve got too much on my plate and I&apos;m always playing a type of triage game with time and projects. So did I need another attention-grabber? Nope. But am I loving Pinterest? Yup. In fact, even as I&apos;m writing, I&apos;m eating Jean-Georges&apos;s Kale Salad with Caesar Dressing, a recipe I found on Pinterest and one I&apos;ve been eating everyday since. (I bought a bushel of kale [only a slight exaggeration] and the recipe for the dressing makes lots.) Today&apos;s salad includes sunflower seeds and… 
 Scallops with Gingered Mango-Tomato Salsa: Dinner in a Flash 
 Dorie Greenspan 17 May 2012 | 5:43 am The only thing fuzzy about this dish is the picture. I was having such a good time with my friends that I didn&apos;t think of photographing anything until Patty said,&quot;This is so pretty, tell me everything you put in it.&quot;By that time, I&apos;d already dug into the dish and was well on my way to polishing it off. Sorry. Next time, I&apos;ll take a second more to document before I dig in.As with so much of the food I make, this was a spur-of-the-moment dish that was less recipe than idea, and more about playing around than following anything exactly. I bought the Maine sea…

 Alexander Lobrano 6 Jul 2012 | 6:14 pm   With the accelerating blurring of work and leisure wrought by Twitter, Facebook, email, text messaging and cellphones eroding the old-fashioned idea of what a vacation could and should be in the United States, there&apos;s something deeply admirable and profoundly charming about the way France defends the sanctity of the summer holiday. And if Paris doesn&apos;t wind down as visibly as it did twenty years ago when shops flaunted the fact that they were closing for a good long time by masking their windows with censorious kraft paper--you&apos;d only know that this was there is if you weren&apos;t… 
 SAINT JAMES CLUB--A Pricey but Pleasant Pastoral Soiree in Paris, B- 
 Alexander Lobrano 29 Jun 2012 | 8:04 am    &quot;No conversational subject warns the world that you&apos;re a bore faster than the weather,&quot; my perspicacious paternal grandmother once cautioned, and she was right, of course. So let me fleetingly mention that the weather in Paris this summer has been just awful, since you need this back story to understand why I enjoyed dinner in the gardens of the Saint James Club in the plummy 16th arrondissement so much the other night.    Urban dining al fresco, you see, is one of the grand Gallic pleasures of a Parisian summer. Not only is it the height of corny… 
 LES 110 de TAILLEVENT--An Expensive Hommage to Bacchus That&apos;s Just Not A Corker, C+

This just-opened brasserie de luxe has replaced Taillevent&apos;s first off-spring, L&apos;Angle du Faubourg, just around the corner from la maison Mere, and it was conceived with the specific vocation of pleasuring vinophiles by pouring some…

 Alexander Lobrano 12 Jun 2012 | 7:04 am Terrine de Campagne at Le Petit Chablisien  It&apos;s taken well over a decade, but the renovation of the Gare Saint Lazare, the busiest train station in France, has finally been completed, and despite the fact that the clear marching orders to the architect must have been to compress the public spaces in favor of rent-paying commercial ones, i.e., shops, overall, it&apos;s a success, especially since they cleaned and repaired the wonderful painted-on-glass portraits of all of the destinations the station originally served when it first opened in the main departures hall. With the station… 
 AU PETIT TONNEAU--Old-School Comfort Food at a Gaullist Redoubt in the 7th, B- 
 Alexander Lobrano 4 Jun 2012 | 3:05 am   Having lived there for many years, I observed that the 7th arrondissement is actually a mosaic of very different little neighborhoods. The chunk of the 7th between the boulevard Saint Germain and the Seine, for example, is aristocratic in tone but more worldly and cosmopolitan than the haughtier and most decidedly penny-pinching district bound by the rue du Bac, the boulevard Saint Germain, the rue de Sevres, and the boulevard des Invalides. Then on the other side of the Esplanade des Invalides, the 7th becomes livelier and almost friendly in the snug little neighborhood in and…

 A Break in Brittany; a five-day trip report. Under construction........ 
 John Talbott 12 Jul 2012 | 1:29 am Les Carmes in Rennes was open at Saturday lunch and was a more-or-less forced choice but it turned out to be a wonderful one. I expected it to be a small, dingy bistro but it was glistening and modern with a nice menu. The amuse gueule was a luscious cream of courgettes with smoked salmon bits; the bread was a hit. For firsts, Colette had a petit pois soup with shredded crab and I had the sautéed sardines with zucchini spaghetti – good stuff all. We both had a sort of fish cake composition of langoustine tails with a chickpea puree, carrots, leeks and onions. Terrific. The only…

 Pinxo, Left Bank letdown 
 Adrian 4 Jul 2012 | 1:52 am To review or not to review. A difficult choice sometimes. I enthusiastically, sometimes too much so, cover lots of places I like, and often, when invited to check out a new place that is not up to snuff or an old favorite that has, for whatever reason, morphed into something less desirable, I&apos;ll leave it out. Then there are times when I feel that the dining crowd at large and my virtual audience need to be informed.Last night (pre-Prescription Old Cuban) I happened into Alain Dutournier&apos;s new(ish) Left Bank Pinxo. This neighborhood, (although this has been changing recently) is pretty…

Until recently, when Mrs Inaki Aizpitarte, i.e. Delphine Zampetti took over a chevaline, or horse meat butcher (hence the tongue in chic , Chez Aline) , all yellow tiles and kitchy 70&apos;s deco in a more coming than up part of the eleventh. The tiny space is divided into the kitchen and four seater counter, where Ms. Zampetti works her magic, slicing up cold cuts, assembling sandwiches to an ever growing queue of local destination foodie hipsters coming…

 Two neighborly new places in the 10th 
 Adrian 10 May 2012 | 7:41 am There has been much talk of late of the hottest new tables in town, most particularly in the 9th, 10th and 11th arrondissements. Indeed, some of the best eating in town is to be had in places such as L&apos;Office, Septime and the like. But in my hood, which borders in the uncool edges of the Canal Saint Martin, near Stalingrad, once populated by denizens of crime, hookers and crack dealers, is although slowly gentrifying, still a pretty terrible place for good cooking. The rue du Faubourg Saint Martin, although with a few good butchers, cheese mongers, rotisseries and fish merchants…

 chrisos 2 Jul 2012 | 3:12 pm Par chrisosEn me relisant, c’est vrai que les« Cinq Bonnes raisons de ne pas manger au restaurant Laurent (75008) »sont un peu vaches, mais j’espère, justes quand même (c’est surtout contre les tarifs, le service et la clientèle que j’en ai redire). Toujours est-il que, via commentaires Facebook, Louise, de Raid-Pâtisseries me demande mon avis sur leurs palmiers (palmiers pour lesquels elle vient d’effectuer un Raid comparatif et dégustatif, auquel je n’ai, hélas, pas pu participer). Pas de souvenir de leurs palmiers lors de ce… 
 Cinq bonnes raisons de ne pas manger au restaurant Laurent (75008) 
 chrisos 16 Jun 2012 | 2:35 pm Par chrisosDans le but de maximiser l’impact des billets publiés sur ce blog, je teste un nouveau format, que j’espère simple et concis. Commençons aujourd’hui par le fameux restaurant Laurent, situé avenue Gabriel, à deux pas des Champs-Elysées. C’est en lisant cet article chez Morgon que m’est venue l’idée de revenir plus tôt que prévu de ma retraite momentanée. avant tout, le quartier n’est vraiment pas top, et étant donnée l’adresse, on se doute que c’est tout sauf une pépite bien cachée ensuite, c’est vraiment… 
 Pour bien vendre un appartement à Paris, évitez Alexandre Ferey du réseau Isambert 
 chrisos 15 Jun 2012 | 7:39 am Par chrisosCette histoire pénible et douloureuse s’est déroulée il y a bientôt un an. Elle n’a, certes, pas grand chose à faire sur ce blog, mais il me fallait bien un support, donc voilà. Grand deux pièces à vendre Les propriétaires de l’appartement que nous occupions (mes parents) avaient décidé de le mettre en vente, puisque nous déménagions (enfin !). Pour cela, ils l’avaient montré à quelques agences immobilières du quartier et décidèrent de confier un mandat à Alexandre Ferey, de l’agence immobilière Isambert, située rue du Bac.

Voici l’essentiel des résultats : près de cinq-cents participants, avec 3/5 d’hommes et 2/5 de femmes (un peu surprenant, quand on sait qu’il y a une sur-représentation du lectorat féminin chez Thierry Richard et, dans une moindre mesure, sur ce blog.

 Is Salt Good For Our Health, or Bad? 
 Cooking Up A Story 12 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Originally published on Cooking Up a StoryImagine Salt is on trial.The charges? Murder. Assault. It kills. It makes people sick.The evidence? Well, there’s the rub. If Salt were on trial, it would be easy for the prosecution to pile up mountains of evidence that “proves” salt is dangerous—and conversely, a mine of evidence the defense would argue “proves” salt is not only not dangerous, it’s actually good for us.The theory that salt is bad for us has roots in the 1970s, and was reinforced by dozens of studies in the years since then, including the 1988 Intersalt study of…

This isn’t simply someone’s hobby or particular passion, this is a serious entrepreneurial effort to produce a world-class finishing salt from the waters of the Oregon coast, and turn his start-up company, Jacobsen Salt, into a successful enterprise.A finishing salt is precisely as the name implies; it’s used directly on foods that have been cooked, or are otherwise ready to eat. Jacobsen describes his salt as a“flake”salt, that has“a very clean briny taste”with a…

 Crimini Mushroom Tart with Roasted Cherry Tomatoes 
 12 Jul 2012 | 2:41 am  A few days ago, Kris from Full Circle offered our family their farm-to-table delivery service. This evening right after yoga class, I received our first Harvest order and I couldn&apos;t wait to cook with these fresh ingredients. My husband Lulu harvested ripe tomatoes from our garden and it couldn&apos;t be a nicer coincidence to pair them with the crimini mushrooms and green onions that were in the Full Circle container. I cooked the onions and mushrooms in freshly-made beet juice and roasted the tomatoes in garlic and fresh thyme. I didn&apos;t have any pastry dough in the freezer so I improvised… 
 Beet Lasagna Recipe 
 11 Jul 2012 | 9:43 am If you&apos;ve been following the meals I&apos;ve been cooking for my family recently, you&apos;ve probably noticed the abundance of beets in the dishes. I try my best to make a wide variety of dishes, even though they all revolve around the same ingredient. So this recipe is made with --you guessed it-- beets and beet greens! I sautéed the greens with onions, fresh thyme, tomato paste and a bit of vegetable broth. The taste is very similar to collard greens. Of course, you could always replace the beet greens with collard greens or kale. To ensure the beet greens were well appreciated, I utilized… 
 Caviar Tower with Beet Carpaccio 
 10 Jul 2012 | 1:34 am I came up with this elegant starter for a dinner party we hosted. I knew I was going to have to spend a lot of time on the main course, so I opted for a dish that was quick and easy to assemble. It&apos;s made of four flavorful layers: crème fraîche flavored with beet green pesto, pumpkin seed-crusted Russian rye bread, grilled beet carpaccio and a luxurious caviar topping. I always make extra pesto that I store for later use. If you&apos;re storing frozen pesto cubes as I&apos;ve suggested in the past, this is a recipe that you can whip up very easily. I also used freshly picked beets from our… 
 Mediterranean Pinwheel Sandwich Recipe 
 9 Jul 2012 | 9:42 am These colorful pinwheel sandwiches are loaded with Mediterranean flavors. Fresh and roasted vegetables are brought together with hummus and pleasingly tart capers. The cabbage and carrots were also briefly pickled in lemon juice and a little sugar to add a little brightness without sacrificing their crunch. I made these pinwheel sandwiches a while back with the gals from California Lavash. I had a blast cooking with them and look forward to doing it again soon. Their pizza lavash is out of this world. These sandwiches are perfect for the summer and would look fabulous at any picnic,… 
 BBQ Beets: Coal-Cooked Beets 
 6 Jul 2012 | 7:34 am Here&apos;s another simple summer vegetable recipe using the barbecue grill. Whole unpeeled beets are placed over the coals of the barbecue grill and cooked until the skin is burnt. I let the beets cool to room temperature and seasoned them with a few fresh herbs, lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. The beets turned sugary sweet. Roasting them turned out to be a great way to showcase the results of Lulu’s hard labor to everyone during our Fourth of July barbecue.

 Connecticut Style Lobster Rolls 
 Paula 10 Jul 2012 | 7:53 am I have a confession to make. This is my first lobster roll ever. EVER. Before getting  started, I did a little research online googling and people are very passionate about lobstah rolls. There seems to be a lot of“discussion”about the“right”way to make one. Passionate fussing discussions. From what I gathered there is the Maine Lobster Roll that includes mayo and celery and then there is the Connecticut lobster roll which is butter based. Since I’m not a huge fan of mayo (GASP much to my family’s chagrin) I took the butter road. You’re not… 
 How to Grill Chicken Under a Brick 
 Paula 8 Jul 2012 | 7:30 pm Grilling is one of summer’s true pleasures. In my house that usually means I have the night off from cooking. It also means there are less dishes. While that may not seem super important, to someone that can’t stand doing dishes (you’re looking at her) it’s a big thing. When someone is grilling in the neighborhood you know it. The smells waft up and down the streets and make those that aren’t grilling wish they were (well unless they’re burning something and well that’s another story all together.)

 Kitchen Renovation: Counter Tops Are Coming!

So now you understand why it’s been a while since our last update. After the faboosh KitchenAid appliances were installed, we’ve spent our time finishing out the new cabinet addition (pictured above–which includes a gorgeous KitchenAid built in microwave convection wall oven and the custom cabinet we had to have fabricated to put her in) and shopping for counter tops.

 How to Roast a Leg of Lamb 
 Paula 20 Jun 2012 | 11:09 am I admit, I do love a nice roasted leg of lamb. Once that’s perfectly pink, juicy, tender and melts in your mouth like buttah. Swoon. I received  a sample of lamb from Superior Farms. One of which included this gorgeous leg of lamb. Roasting it was a given. It was to become Father’s Day Dinner. I have a secret for you. Come closer…roasting a leg of lamb is one of the easiest dinner’s you could possibly make. I wouldn’t kid you.

 July Garden Update: Weathering the Storms 
 Bitten Word 11 Jul 2012 | 6:02 am An Update on Our Backyard Garden We added a new banner to the blog this week, inspired by the sudden abundance of tomatoes. (If you&apos;re reading this via RSS or email, come check it out!) We wish we could say that we were inspired 100% by the tomatoes in our own garden, but sadly, that&apos;s not the case. We were on vacation last week, taking some time away from the city. Luckily for us, we happened to pick a week when D.C.&apos;s summer weather was at its craziest -- huge storms that resulted in power losses for millions of people in the area, coupled with oppressive heat in excess of 105 degrees. 
 Moroccan Carrot Salad with Spicy Lemon Dressing 
 Bitten Word 9 Jul 2012 | 5:55 am Food&amp;Wine (July 2012) There are a few reasons we love -- no, adore -- this carrot salad: First, it&apos;s absolutely delicious. The lemon dressing, tart and spiced by harissa (which we wrote about extensively last year), takes carrot salad (which, let&apos;s face it, can be a bit blah) and makes it into a side dish worth getting excited about. The raisins are sweet, the feta is salty. The whole package is an amazing combination. An amazing carrot salad -- we honestly didn&apos;t know it was possible.  That may be because this is also a recipe by Susan Feniger, a chef we fell for when she was on Top… 
 Chili-and-Cucumber Margarita 
 Bitten Word 2 Jul 2012 | 5:40 am Martha Stewart Living (June 2012) There&apos;s a Mexican place around the corner from our apartment. It actually serves authentic Oaxacan food -- think organic duck in a mole sauce or Oaxacan queso topped with fried grasshoppers. And there&apos;s something about the place that is oh so tempting every single time we walk by. (No, it&apos;s not the grasshoppers.) It&apos;s their margarita menu. Every day the place features a different flavored margarita, temptingly described on a chalk sign out front. Blackberry margaritas. Blood orange margaritas. Prickly pear margaritas....  Have we mentioned that we have to… 
 Chilled Sweet Corn Soup 
 Bitten Word 29 Jun 2012 | 6:28 am A Bitten Word Recipe  Sunday was Clay&apos;s birthday, and when we went to the Farmers Market that morning, there was a special treat: Fresh sweet corn made its first appearance of the year. Because really, who doesn&apos;t want corn for their birthday?  We were excited to see the corn, not only because we love to eat it, but also because we&apos;d been waiting to share this recipe with you. Months ago, we developed this recipe for Chilled Sweet Corn Soup for Spenser Magazine, an online food publication that had reached out to us. In the most recent issue, they ran a Q&amp;A with us that was accompanied… 
 What&apos;s New at Everyday Food 
 Bitten Word 27 Jun 2012 | 5:40 am More and more frequently, food magazines are creating tons of content that doesn&apos;t necessarily make it into the magazine itself. Perhaps it&apos;s a video series, a digital edition, or a feature on their website, but they&apos;re all the time introducing new content, new inspiration and delicious-looking food.   We&apos;re starting a periodic column in which we&apos;ll check in on one of the magazines we receive and take a look at what&apos;s new in print, on the Web, and in social media.

 Baigan Bharta with Chickpeas 
 Christina Falco Baldwin 2 Jul 2012 | 9:59 pm My craving for Indian food and combination of having a ton of eggplant in the house resulted in my first venture into Meatless Mondays. Prior to living with my now husband, I ate a lot more meatless dishes, but for some reason this boy thinks every meal should contain what I would call your &quot;normal protein&quot; a/k/a chicken, beef, fish, etc. I, on the other hand am happy with a giant bowl of greens and beans. So today started my quest to have a meatless meal at least once a week. My apologies in advance for no exact measurements in this dish, I made this at 9:00 p.m. 
 Baked Green Tomato Crab Stacks 
 Christina Falco Baldwin 7 Jun 2012 | 10:58 am Baked Green Tomato Crab Stacks One culinary ingredient I really have enjoyed since moving down South has been green tomatoes. Growing up all fried green tomatoes meant to me was a movie with Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates. We ate red tomatoes and we certainly did not fry them. Once I moved to New Orleans and attended my first Creole Tomato Festival in the Quarter and my best friend forced to me to try some fried green tomatoes, I was smitten. Over the past couple of years, whenever the local farmers at the market have them for sale, I buy them to experiment. This… 
 Nutella Bites - Gotta love easy desserts 
 Christina Falco Baldwin 30 May 2012 | 9:22 pm So as many of you probably know desserts really aren&apos;t my thing. I don&apos;t have much of sweet tooth unless I am PMSing and then all I really want is a piece of fruity pie. However, occasionally this girl does like chocolate and considering I married a sugar/dessert freak I have to come up with dessert ideas at times. I enjoy Nutella, which is that Italian chocolate-hazelnut spread which is generally found next to the peanut butter in the grocery store. I was inspired to make these Nutella bites after searching around on Pinterest for some recipes for Nutella other… 
 Seafood Stuffed Banana Peppers 
 Christina Falco Baldwin 21 May 2012 | 4:03 pm Big disclaimer before you read this recipe - it is not healthy. I have tried to make Stuffed Banana Peppers healthy and the results aren&apos;t quite as satisfying as the real thing. As many of you know my mantra with food is moderation, that being said this is a &quot;special occasion&quot; recipe. Stuffed Banana Peppers shows up on menus all over Buffalo, NY restaurants and its one of those foodie items that has stuck with me. I have made these many times stuffed with various of different types of cheesy goodness, but the other night I had an epiphany...seafood stuffing. … 
 Cheese and Chorizo Grits 
 Christina Falco Baldwin 18 Apr 2012 | 10:33 am I have been dying to try out this recipe (which was concocted in my head) of cheese, chorizo and grits. However such a dish always just seemed like way too much for just the two of us, so it worked out perfectly that the Rochester family was visiting to make this recipe. The chorizo adds some nice spice and flavor to the grits. This is a super easy side dish and would be great with anything grilled. Ingredients: 1/4 lb of chorizo cooked and chopped fine 6 scallions- chopped 2 cloves of garlic - chopped 1 tbsp. of butter 4 cups of water or chicken broth 1/4 cup of milk or more 1…

 Celeste 4 Jul 2012 | 8:42 am We just can&apos;t get enough blueberries around here lately! We&apos;ve bought huge buckets of them at the farmer&apos;s market the past two times we&apos;ve been, so I&apos;ve had to come up with different ways to use the perfect little berries full of blue summer deliciousness.I know, I know...sounds like such a terrible predicament. ;-)I saw a photo of a Blueberry Buckle while perusing blueberry recipes, and it made me stop in my tracks. It sounded like perfection - A rich, moist cake batter packed full of so many blueberries that there&apos;s probably more berry than actual cake, with a streusel…

 Curt 10 Jul 2012 | 8:45 pm It’s been quite a summer already. Busy is an understatement! One of the happenings for Livefire was that the Cincinnati Enquirer called me to do a grilling feature in the food section of the newspaper. Not only did Polly come out to talk to me while I grilled some stuff, but I ended up on the front page of the food section AND even had a photo of me on the front page of the paper!

I don’t really do anything to celebrate my birthday, and I didn’t want a cake as I only eat that kind of stuff now and then anymore. We were in Cincinnati, though, and I thought maybe one little cupcake would be ok. I had heard about a little cupcake bakery in the Oakley area, so I thought we could stop by and get one cupcake. So we drive up to…

 Ice Cream Week: Roasted Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream {Naptime Everyday} 
 Kelsey 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am While we were in Cooperstown for the Fourth my daughter attended her first ever ice cream social. It is held every year at the Presbyterian Church and features a feast of grilled hot dogs, strawberry shortcake, and an ice cream sundae bar that stretches for miles. It just about blew her kiddie mind. She had a tough time choosing her ice cream but she landed on strawberry shortcake with a side of butter pecan ice cream. Random, for sure, but she loved every last morsel. The moment we got home she begged to make a fresh batch of ice cream. Her request was strawberry shortcake ice cream–…

Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams cookbook / 3. OXO ice cream scoop /… 
 Frozen Mudslide Pies from Shaina Olmanson’s Desserts in Jars {Tales from the Trenches} 
 Kelsey 5 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am Last week a copy of my friend Shaina’s new book, Desserts in Jars: 50 Sweet Treats that Shine (Harvard Common Press), arrived. I first met Shaina through blogging together at Babble’s The Family Kitchen and have come to love her personal blog, Food for My Family. Her new book instantly drew me in since, as you might remember, I’ve baked a few desserts in jars myself. In fact, baking food in jars is becoming something of a trend and I am so excited someone finally wrote a whole book on the subject. Shaina is an extremely skilled photographer and each page in her new book… 
 Simple Strawberry Lemon Cream Tart {Naptime Everyday}

I am so grateful to all of my friends for their help during the book tour. They’ve been nothing short of amazing, always pitching in watch my daughter at odd times whenever a last minute radio spot or television appearance comes up, bringing home school forms when I am not there to pick them up. Two weeks ago I was on Martha Stewart Radio and my awesome neighbor, Sarah, took my daughter for the morning while I whizzed into the…

 a peek inside Third Man Records 
 ArtandLemons 8 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm I have a soft spot for analog recordings of all sorts. Records, photographs, movies, recipes, the list goes on. On our recent trip through Nashville we stopped by Third Man Records (run by kick ass guitarist and musical genius Jack White most noted for his bands The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, The Dead Weather), and confirmed that White shares our nostalgia for film and vinyl. White founded Third Man Records in 2001 in Detroit, Michigan and moved the operation to Nashville in 2009. Inside the black painted building with yellow, red, blue, and purple garage doors on 7th Avenue South,… 
 here, we go (summer rolls with peanut dipping sauce) 
 ArtandLemons 5 Jul 2012 | 10:21 am I meant to tell you about these summer rolls and their accompanying peanut sauce before I left for Memphis. You know how it goes, a thousand and one things to finish before you throw everything into the car and go. A summer road trip mix that won’t quit. A cat who tends to wander off. Homemade snacks that disappear before we make it out the door. A boy who I can’t stop missing though I haven’t even left. The missing wide angle lens I won’t use the entire trip but need to find anyway despite the fact it’s noon and we need to drive at least seven hours to make it… 
 after Memphis 
 ArtandLemons 3 Jul 2012 | 12:32 pm We’re back from our Memphis road trip and now that I’m sitting still in one place, I’m overwhelmed by everything I saw and felt along the way. Over the course of ten days, we drove 2,600 plus miles, crossed 10 state lines, and looked back at the roots of American music (gospel, country, blues, soul, rock, rockabilly) in the south. There were barbecue stops at Tony Gore’s Smoky Mountain BBQ&amp;Grill (Sevierville), Jack’s Bar-B-Que (Nashville), and Blues City Cafe. David sampled plates of ribs while I ate all the sides (coleslaw, iceberg salads, french fries and… 
 summer road trip (and Memphis mix) 
 ArtandLemons 23 Jun 2012 | 9:46 am Hi. Summer’s finally here and I couldn’t be happier. The Mister and I are minutes away from hopping in the car for a road trip to Memphis for lots of Blues, barbecue, and hot hot Tennessee days. (Sorry, Butte. You’ll have to wait a little longer.) I feel like it’s the last day of school right before the bell rang and we were free. Mrs. K handed out report cards before we sailed into summer like a handful of water balloons suspended in an endless summer breeze. I climbed on my red banana seat bike, stashed my book bag in the wicker basket fixed to the silver speckled… 
 through the cloud slip, strawberries 
 ArtandLemons 19 Jun 2012 | 12:27 pm Yesterday, Luke and I drove to North Hadley to pick strawberries. We left the house later than I hoped and by the time we parked next to the strawberry field, it was a little before 1 p.m., a.k.a. nap time. Naps remain an important fixture in our daily routine since Luke gets up around 5:30 a.m. regardless of when he goes to bed. At four, he can be explosive and sweet in a single breath. We were out for adventure so I ignored the motherly pull in my stomach. Stay in the car and drive him around until he fell asleep, my mom voice said. Who was I kidding? This was our first time strawberry…

 Grilled Chicken and Pineapple Quesadillas 
 Amy 12 Jul 2012 | 6:33 am Up until recently, I’ve never been very eager to buy fresh pineapple. Not because I don’t like it, but because it’s sort of a pain to deal with. (Very similar to my feelings about mangoes, until OXO created the splitter for that.) They’ve come to the rescue again with their new and incredibly effective Pineapple Slicer. And since testing it out, I’ve gone searching for reasons to use more of this tropical yellow fruit. Paul’s so happy. (...)Continue reading Grilled Chicken and Pineapple Quesadillas Join me on FaceBook. Follow my boards on Pinterest.

This entire month I’m celebrating grilled food. And OXO is doing it with me! Thanks to them, I had a chance to try out some of their newest products, perfect for the summer season. And every single one of them was awesome. OF COURSE.

 Pasta with Cherry Tomatoes, Jalapeños, and Parmesan 
 Amy 5 Jul 2012 | 6:49 am I love it when my garden really comes into its own–the plants are sturdy enough where the wind or rain won’t destroy them, the herbs are plentiful and plucking a few leaves won’t stunt their growth, and my snap peas and cherry tomatoes are in such massive quantity, I’m not worried about Haley plopping them into her mouth off the vine, rendering me unable to make this pasta dish. (...)Continue reading Pasta with Cherry Tomatoes, Jalapeños, and Parmesan Join me on FaceBook.

Personally, I prefer his shots of butterflies and dragonflies, but he is nothing if not an equal opportunity wildlife-picture-taker. He enjoys it all. And would probably spend a good amount of time checking out my garden, which has been invaded by these suckers. I, however, am not amused. (...)Continue reading A Day In The Life Join me on FaceBook.

 Preserve Summer&apos;s Most Coveted Fruit With Strawberry Jam 
 Anna Monette Roberts 12 Jul 2012 | 5:30 am Strawberry jam is one of those must-make recipes that every home cook should know. What better way to preserve Summer&apos;s most coveted berry than by making a jam? Perhaps a classic pairing suits your fancy. Spread the jam over toast, pour it over brie cheese, or make a mean PB and J. Fruit jams also taste great in a turkey sandwich or in grilled cheese sandwiches. Alternatively, try it in a jam cocktail or whip a few tablespoons in cream cheese or a batch of fresh buttercream frosting. Maybe you enjoy it solo, sneaking a secretive spoonful each time you pass the fridge. I won&apos;t tell! Either…

 Prevent Stovetop Scorching With a Heat Diffuser 
 Anna Monette Roberts 11 Jul 2012 | 3:10 pm If you&apos;ve got a powerful gas stove like mine, you&apos;ll know it&apos;s virtually impossible to set the flame to low; all too often I&apos;ll turn the nob, only to watch the flame flicker and burn out before I can settle on the right amount of heat. If you&apos;re the owner of a gas-lit stove and frequently encounter the same issue, I&apos;ve got a solution for you. It&apos;s called a heat diffuser. Often used in commercial kitchens, this flat, metal stovetop tool distributes heat evenly and automatically lowers the flame setting. This comes in particularly handy when cooking heat-sensitive items like rice and caramel,…

 Savoury strawberry risotto in Sweden 
 Caitlin 10 Jul 2012 | 4:01 pm Sweden in summer is the land of strawberries and I have been eating my fair share since arriving in Stockholm last weekend.

Our summers are famously unhot, and even in our nicest times of year it&apos;s rarely warm enough in the evening to sit out without some kind of heater to keep the goose pimples at bay. That&apos;s one of the reasons why when we had the opportunity to attend one of the Outstanding in the Field dinners in Sunol, about an hour to the southeast, we gleefully accepted. The other reason is that the tickets had been provided to us by Full Circle, a... Read more on Hedonia ...

 Crispy Pork Cutlets with Creamy Jalapeno Green Onion Gravy – Say Auf Wiedersehen to the 3-Pan Breading Station! 
 8 Jul 2012 | 10:00 pm This is what happens when you have two food wishes in your head at the same time. I’ve wanted to do a schnitzel video für immer, but thanks to another recent food wish, I was also craving biscuits with cream gravy. So, I sort of did both, and it worked out well. Very well. The crispy pork cutlet part of the presentation is very simple and straightforward, but it did afford the opportunity to share my new breading system. With all the time you’ll save, you can hit the gym to burn off this less than light, but extremely satisfying meal. I’ve never been a big fan of the 3-pan breading… 
 Veracruz-Style Red Snapper – A New Take on a Very Old Classic 
 5 Jul 2012 | 11:10 pm Fish “Veracruz” was the first “authentic” Mexican recipe I ever ate. I had it 30 years ago at the Casa Del Sol in Saranac Lake, NY, where I worked while enrolled in culinary school. I remember trying and loving it, and being very surprised that “this” was actually Mexican food. Besides…olives on fish? That was some crazy stuff. Up to that point, the only “Mexican” food I’d ever had was crispy cafeteria tacos made by completely non-Mexican lunch ladies. So, this kind of thing was very exciting for me. I’ve forgotten the exact recipe after all these years of…

First of all, I’d like to apologize to Warrant for calling their song “Cherry Pie” the worst in rock history…I totally forgot about the abomination that is Jefferson Starship’s “We Build This City.” At least Warrant’s song had pie(s) in it. This delicious and super easy cherry pie features a crunchy, streusel-like crust, which as I joke about in the video, makes the best ice cream topping ever. It&apos;s such a natural pairing that I&apos;m not sure it should even be served if there&apos;s no vanilla ice…

 Song of the Day: Grizzly Bear “Sleeping Ute” 
 Sarah Sellers 6 Jul 2012 | 3:03 pm Ahhh the boys are back. Grizzly Bear recently released the first track off their follow-up to  the 2009 critically acclaimed album, Veckatimest. The currently untitled record is set for a September 18th release on Warp Records, followed by an international tour. In typical Grizzly Bear style the track meshes together hard hitting drum beats, Daniel Rossen’s signature guitar playing, and the always dynamic vocals that lace perfectly in-between the multiple layers of music. I can’t wait for the new album. Now if they’ll just add a Dallas date to their tour I’ll be set!

Like all“master dieters”will say, instead of fighting the craving I decided to give in and opt for a guilt free, summery pasta to quench my carb craving. I adapted the recipe from Cooking Light’s Orecchiette with Peas, Shrimp, and Buttermilk-Herb Dressing with just a few minor changes. It wouldn’t be dinner in my house if we…

As a result, Lebanese food is very familiar to Brazilians and specialities like sfiha (a term that covers both manaqish and fatayer) and kibbe have become part of the national culinary repertoire. And of course there are Lebanese restaurants galore. Some are good and some not so.

 anissa 2 Jul 2012 | 4:21 am I think it was after I watched City of God that I decided I had to visit a favela. Except that it is not quite what you do as a lone female traveler. Nor even as a lone male traveler. As luck would have it, I was again invited this year by lovely Luiz Camargo to attend Paladar Cozinha do Brazil. Luiz had invited me to this wonderful event back in 2009 and I wrote about it. However, back then there was no visit to a favela on the schedule. This year though there was and we went with the inspirational David Hertz of Gastromotiva who trains young disadvantaged people to acquire culinary… 
 a foot in the grave party 
 anissa 21 Jun 2012 | 11:19 pm I always thought I would be dead by the time I was 35. Then I reached that age and thought that I wouldn’t make it past 50. As I approached my 50th year in perfect health, I decided that if I wasn’t going to be buried in a cemetery, I might just as well have a birthday picnic in it except that I never got round to organising it. It took another decade for me to make it happen, almost. It was going to be in Bunhill Fields where Blake, Defoe and Bunyan are buried. A perfect place for a foot in the grave party. I got the necessary permission (there is a garden right by the cemetery)… 
 shawarma at home 
 anissa 19 Jun 2012 | 2:44 am The best shawarma I have ever had was at Siddiq in Damascus. Unlike most other shawarma places, they grill theirs over charcoal. Also their marinade is exceptional. Sadly, it’s unlikely I will be going back to Damascus any time soon. And even when I do, who knows if Siddiq will still be there. So, if I feel like having shawarma these days I make my own. Obviously not the way they make it at Siddiq or even elsewhere–ie. by layering the meat onto a large skewer which is then put to rotate in front of a vertical grill–but the way my Lebanese butcher in London taught me: by… 

 
 Always Order Dessert 
 
 Chilled Fresh Pea Soup with Crab&amp;Guacamole Salad 
 Alejandra Ramos 9 Jul 2012 | 10:00 am I&apos;ve never really been a huge fan of chilled soups. I can&apos;t stand gazpacho, which always surprises people for some reason (it always just tastes like salsa to me!), and I prefer my vichyssoise hot.Which is why it was weird that I ordered a chilled pea soup as my starter at dinner at the North Fork Table&amp;Inn last week.I had read a lot of amazing things about North Fork Table&amp;Inn, and when Eugene arranged a little last-minute escape to the North Fork for the 4th of July, it was at the top of my list of places I wanted to try. We went there for dinner on Monday night, and it was my… 
 Eating in Bed 
 Alejandra Ramos 8 Jul 2012 | 9:14 am Confession time: Do you ever eat in bed? During the weekdays, I admit to eating at least one meal a day in bed. If Eugene is working late or out with friends, that number sometimes jumps to two.It&apos;s a habit I developed in college, I think. My freshman year there wasn&apos;t a dining table or sofa in my dorm room so I ate my homemade meals sitting on my bed. When I moved into my first apartment in DC after getting back from Italy, I would regularly just eat on my bed rather than sit at the dining table alone. The pattern continued, and I&apos;ve never really thought much of it.Perhaps it&apos;s just a… 
 Inspired Living: Chilled Vinho Verde for Summer Sipping 
 Alejandra Ramos 7 Jul 2012 | 1:52 pm From about late March through early October, I always make sure to keep a couple bottles of Vinho Verde in my fridge. Vinho Verde or &quot;Green Wine,&quot; is a young, crisp Portuguese wine with fairly low alcohol content. The green is really a reference to the young age of the wine (usually about 1 year or younger), but I&apos;ve found that some of the wines actually do have a very very slight green tint to them. As I was putting my groceries away yesterday, I figured I should share this gem with you guys, because it&apos;s such a great casual wine. A &quot;porch pounder,&quot; if you will. I love it because it&apos;s… 
 Kitchen Beauty: DIY Lemongrass Sugar Scrub 
 Alejandra Ramos 5 Jul 2012 | 9:59 am A few weeks ago, I bought a brand new jar of a lemongrass sugar scrub that I really loved. It was made by a small company with all natural ingredients, and smelled absolutely amazing. It was a little on the pricey side, but given that it was a small business, I was happy to support it.I got the jar home, drew myself a bath, got in, and proceeded to spill the entire contents of the jar into the tub! Whoosh! Just like that, my entire $14 scrub--which I&apos;d meant to stretch out for a couple months--was gone.During that incredibly fragrant bath, I decided that I would simply have to make my own DIY…

 Read&amp;Build – Grow, Caterpillar, Grow! 
 Joyful Abode 11 Jul 2012 | 6:07 am We got the chance to review this LEGO DUPLO Read&amp;Build set this week, and what a fun toy it is! It’s designed to help children engage with books by building with the DUPLO blocks as they go through the story. This deeper level of engagement with the story will theoretically help the kids learn to read. I was excited about reviewing this because Anneliese already LOVES books, but her patience with blocks wears thin relatively quickly. So I hoped it would help her engage more with the building/bricks aspect. I love that the packaging was EASY TO OPEN. I saw the plastic box and thought I… 
 Feelings About Pregnancy 
 Joyful Abode 9 Jul 2012 | 6:47 am I simultaneously feel “finished” having kids and want 10 more. A big factor there is pregnancy. I’m not a fan. Once it’s over and the birth/breastfeeding/happy/love/bonding hormones are flowing, pregnancy seems like a distant memory. It feels like this new baby was always part of the family and my life, and it’s impossible to imagine any alternate reality. But during pregnancy? It’s long. And for me, not the most awesome (other than a few blissfully perfect weeks in the second trimester). You know how when you have a cold and you’re congested and your nose is all raw and your… 
 Summertime 
 Joyful Abode 9 Jul 2012 | 5:01 am I’m starting a little project…but I think I’m doing it technically wrong. Do you recognize what this is? Also?? It’s crazy hot here now…like crazy hot. What are your favorite hot-weather meals and snacks? I’ve been eating a lot of salads and grilling on my new George Foreman grill (I even put my coffee maker in a cabinet so the GF could have a permanent spot on the counter). 
 Beat the Heat: 10 Ways to Keep Your Newborn Cool 
 Joyful Abode 6 Jul 2012 | 6:06 am Newborns don’t have the best thermostats. Many of them – like my skinny guy – lack “insulation,” and their surface area, when compared to their insides, is much greater than our adult ones. They can quickly become overheated, and if you can’t reverse the symptoms quickly, you’ll need to get medical attention for your baby. This is no joke, especially if you live somewhere like I do, where summer days often see temperatures of 100 degrees and beyond. Anneliese was born at the end of July, and I remember some SCARY car trips. Even though I lived about 5 minutes from Target, if I… 
 Lemon Pepper Potato Chips–Dehydrator Recipe 
 Joyful Abode 5 Jul 2012 | 8:37 am I recently tried out an idea I had had floating around in my head for a LONG time… a way to make homemade potato chips in the style of Baked Lay’s or Pringles. With the help of my awesome immersion blender and my amazing dehydrator with the non-stick sheets, I did it. And it worked WONDERFULLY. So now I’m trying out flavor ideas, and posting the successes for you! I’ll add links to the flavor combos at the bottom of the original Homemade Baked Lay’s Recipe post, so you can check back there for other new ones as they go up! Lemon is one of my favorite flavors in the world. Lemon…

 Fresh Herb Dip with Hellmann’s® 
 The Local Cook 12 Jul 2012 | 3:27 am About this time of year, my herbs start to grow like crazy. So when Hellmann’s® invited me to try out their new Hellmann’s® Mayonnaise Dressing with Olive Oil, I knew right way that an herb dip was in order! Of course it’s best if you can make your own mayo, but I have not had much success in the past–it always tastes too oily. So I was unsure about trying store-bought mayo with“more olive oil”in it. The original Easy Vegetable Diprecipe they sent me was very simple–1 package Knorr® Vegetable recipe mix, 1/2 cup Hellmann’s® Mayonnaise,…

 My Dream Backyard Party Makeover #KmartOutdoor #CBias

That doesn’t work for larger projects, though, such as dreaming up a backyard makeover. Using the online #KmartOutdoor Living catalog and some fun online content collection tools, I was able to shop from my seat (not on my feet) and put together my wish list. Right now, we do most of our outdoor entertaining in the front yard, mostly because we open up our garage and use it for cover while the boys are brewing beer in the driveway.

 Janice 10 Jul 2012 | 7:26 am  Should we eat roadkill? In theory, it’s an excellent exercise in ethics, environmentalism, and self-reliance. Why leave it to rot when you can take it home and cook it for dinner? According to PETA, roadkill is a better choice [...] 
 Fast Food Chains Push Soda for Breakfast 
 Janice 9 Jul 2012 | 1:29 pm  The vaguely mimosa-like Mountain Dew A.M. Some rules really aren’t made to be broken. Like the one about eating a healthy breakfast. It’s not like it’s one of the Geneva Conventions, but this is important stuff none the less. [...] 
 A Priest, a Rabbi, and a Monk Walk Into a Burger Joint. 
 Janice 2 Jul 2012 | 6:17 am No joke, the trio was there to remove a curse. Holy water was sprinkled, the four corners received a Buddhist blessing, and a mezuzah was installed in the doorway. The new tenant, New York Burger Company, wasn’t taking any chances; [...]

 Ohio Village: 1862 in 2012 
 Rachel 12 Jul 2012 | 4:28 am One of my favorite childhood memories is going to the Ohio Village. I remember visiting the hot, smoky blacksmith’s shop, smelling the rich tanned skins in the leather shop, and playing with wooden hoops and stilts. When the Ohio Village reopened this summer to Ohio History Center guests after many years of being a special-events-only destination, I eagerly took Lil. My friend Kate (don’t miss her blog about foraging and simple living) and her son came along with us. The Village represents a small town several miles from the‘big city’of Columbus in the year 1862. 
 Vintage Canning Images Part 1 
 Rachel 11 Jul 2012 | 6:17 am My grandmother gifted my mother her small collection of vintage canning booklets kept in perfect condition.

 Peach Old Fashioned {Cocktail Recipe} 
 Rachel 10 Jul 2012 | 4:32 am A gifted bottle of Michter’s bourbon plus the first peaches of the season equalled a lovely cocktail a few weeks ago. Alas with the derecho and heat wave, I took to drinking the bourbon straight up for awhile. Now I’m back to share this cocktail recipe with you. A traditional Old Fashioned includes a muddled orange slice. For the summer season, I substitute a peeled peach. How do you peel a peach? If the fruit is ripe, the peel should remove from the flesh with a gentle tug of your bare hands. I like to make Old Fashioneds because they are simple to put together: line up the… 
 Summertime and the Living Ain’t Easy 
 Rachel 9 Jul 2012 | 6:11 pm Sometimes urban living isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. For us, the past six weeks have been nothing but trouble. June started with Columbia Gas digging in our treeyard (site of Lil’s garden) to run a new gas line. We were the lucky house on the block to receive the connection joint that required a hole six feet wide and four feet deep. Workers tried to be kind to our garden but split a four-year-old peach tree in two and trampled flowers and herbs. Because it’s their right of way, we knew we were taking a risk when planting there but watching our beautiful garden…

We are going to try to make this a monthly feature, so send us feedback with questions or suggestions on what we should photograph next!Avo-Tuna Cerviche 2011 Spinwave PhotoToday&apos;s post focuses on the attention-sucking feature I like to call &quot;black holes&quot;.

The air is alive with a slight chill, but the sun warms where it&apos;s beams have haphazardly landed. Photo ©2011. Renaissance Culinaire. All Rights Res.

Factoring in lack of sleep, deadlines and financial woes can make for one un-happy, sleep deprived camper. If you watch television or read magazines you are sure to have seen the segments devoted to &apos;spa rejuvenation&apos;, whether or not it is geared for females, the theme seems to be pampering yourself. Popular media likes to flaunt this term, as it is conducive to the high-end, trendy &quot;jet setter&quot; lifestyle most average people dream… 
 Suffering From An Irrational Fear of Cooking?

It is the aversion to cooking, in a kitchen, anything besides microwave burritos or jarred spaghetti. Photo Courtesy of gregpphoto © All Rights Reserved. People who have CPD have an irrational fear that they can&apos;t use culinary techniques to crank out a fabulous tasting meal.

 Kettles Vietnamese Restaurant | Santa Rosa 
 biteclub 11 Jul 2012 | 10:29 pm The owners of Boathouse sushi have opened Kettles, a Vietnamese restaurant, near Coddingtown Mall. The menu runs several pages, with familiar items like pho, bun (rice noodles) and banh mi (Vietnamese Sandwiches), but it’s worth straying a bit off the beaten path and tucking into some less known items including lime marinated beef carpaccio served in a cocktail glass; a Vietnamese crepe that’s sweet and savory, filled with shrimp and bean sprouts; iced coffee, served in a drip-pour glass with sweetened condensed milk and exotic fruit sodas with banana, strawberry or raspberry. 
 Kettles Vietnamese Bistro opens 
 biteclub 9 Jul 2012 | 3:45 pm Kettles Vietnamese Bistro has opened in Santa Rosa. A sister restaurant to the two Boathouse Sushi locations (Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa), the restaurant features Banh Mi, Pho, Clay Pot Chicken, Vietnamese Crepes and other Vietnamese specialties.

 Cooking with Thas 
 
 Gobi Manchurian – Indo Chinese Veggie Dish 
 Thas 11 Jul 2012 | 8:15 pm My all time favorite Indo-Chinese veggie dish…Hope everyone had a good day. I took a day off from writing the thesis, thinking about research and all those things which has been bothering me lately. Whenever I get a day off or during weekends or during holidays, one of the activities I enjoy is to sleep till I feel like. I love to sleep in the morning and to be active at night. Now, I know one more person who’s following my footsteps, my adorable niece. So, this morning, even though I slept till noon, I did wake up early to make a quick breakfast for my hubby. After he’s… 
 Broccoli Lentil Soup in Coconut milk 
 Thas 10 Jul 2012 | 3:35 pm A healthy soup, for any day…Soup and Summer don’t get along well, really? For me, any day, any season I am up for soups. Many times, it’s the easy preparation that encourages me to make soups. Anything and everything can be literally added while making soups, so if I want to empty my refrigerator or pantry, I scream soup. One huge bowl of soup along with baked pita bread or parmesan garlic croutons has never failed to fill up my stomach. This is a very healthy soup made with lentils and broccoli. To make it rich and creamy I added coconut milk, it’s absolutely dairy… 
 Eggplant in Almond sauce 
 Thas 8 Jul 2012 | 2:10 pm Eggplants, so happy in almond sauce…I adore Indian eggplants, Japanese eggplants, Thai eggplants, Chinese eggplants, Korean eggplants, American eggplants, white eggplants, alright the bottom line I just love eggplants. I’ve gone crazy for almost all eggplant dishes, whether it’s eggplant rice, eggplant roast, grilled eggplant or stuffed eggplants. This morning, I went for my weekend grocery shopping. I piled up my cart with fresh veggies, grains, chicken and some cosmetic stuffs too This time I didn’t even look at the garden center as I cannot afford any more plants. 
 Roasted Herb Potatoes 
 Thas 7 Jul 2012 | 2:27 pm This is my favorite way of making potatoes, aromatic and roasted to perfection…Can I say this is the hottest Summer I’ve experienced in the past 6 years? It’s so so so hot. But I love how I can go out wearing flip flops, ride my bike, roaming around not wrapped up, grilling, dine on the patio etc etc. I just adore the city I am living in, in Summer we have so many events like sun fest, food fest, rib fest, music fest etc going on in downtown and got 2 beautiful beaches as well. We often go to all the events and enjoy the live music till late night. Wherever I’ve… 
 Popcorn Chicken 
 Thas 3 Jul 2012 | 6:31 pm I swear, you just can’t stop snacking on these…After a long weekend, this morning I felt so enthusiastic about going to work. However, my enthusiasm didn’t last too long. I felt unbelievably sick as soon as I reached my office, my sinus started acting so crazy making me dizzy and more dizzy. It was one heck of a day for me. To begin with, Summer is not for me, absolutely not for me. On the other hand, I feel great during freezing cold winter. I’ve been a victim of sinusitis since I was in junior school. Having lived in a tropical place, it was very hard for me as hot… 

 
 A Sweet Spoonful 
 
 And Now We Rest 
 megang 2 Jul 2012 | 12:25 pm I’m writing this post to you today on the porch of my mom’s lakefront cabin in upstate, New York. In the past few years, this spot has come to mean summer to me. Sure, I’ve made many wonderful summer memories that dated far before my mom started coming here, but these days I feel like summer really starts on the porch here. Time slows. The daily itinerary involves morning coffee, porch-reading, dock-reading, and discussion of what to do for dinner. That’s basically it. Sometimes this is punctuated by a swim or a run or a soft-serve ice cream cone. Or a long walk down… 
 A Real Doozy 
 megang 21 Jun 2012 | 11:15 am This picture was taken in a moment of minor delirium–setting out what would be only 1/4 of Tuesday’s necessary shipping and getting a moment of sunny fresh air. I believe this was day 4 of granola baking, little sleep, and major shipping logistics the likes of which I’ve never had to orchestrate. There was a lot of USPS googling, some Pay Pal live-chatting, a bit of pacing around our living room, and a few‘get yourself together’pep talks from Sam. I wanted to write a special breakfast post for you this week but it’s just not going to happen. So I thought… 
 Cause to Celebrate 
 megang 11 Jun 2012 | 1:46 pm I’ve tried to write this post a number of times over the past three weeks and failed. I’ve learned that when you get to be a certain age and you tell people you have big news to share, they assume you’re pregnant. You assure them that’s not it. Engaged! Nope, that’s not it either. We’re not getting a puppy and we’re also not buying a house. Or a new car. But I am staying up late at night, pacing a lot, alphabetizing our spice cabinet, and cleaning odd nooks and crannies to try and really acquaint myself with the task at hand: I’m writing a… 
 Doing Mornings 
 megang 31 May 2012 | 10:05 am There are moments when I’m truly happy we don’t have cable. This week, a time that finds us amidst the Facebook fiasco, is one of them. Even without TV, I feel like I can’t escape news of the IPO, stock prices, shareholder reactions, and future projections. But in last Sunday’s paper I read something that caught my attention. Mark Zuckerberg’s now wife, Priscilla Chan, made a request of him before moving in together: 100 minutes of alone time each week. And a vacation each year. My first reaction was one of mild shock: only 100 minutes?! I turned to Sam and told… 
 A Time Out 
 megang 17 May 2012 | 9:51 am It’s all I can do not to just drop everything and turn this into a gardening blog. Maybe a gardening blog with cookies, and cocktails? I jest. But in all seriousness, thank you all so much for your generous comments and advice about planting and gardening. I wish I had you in my back pocket at all times, but you’ve given me a lot to work with and much inspiration. In fact, today’s recipe is made with fresh herbs from the backyard! It’s been unusually warm in Seattle this week, so everything’s growing like crazy and quite thirsty. I learned a valuable lesson: if…

 Grilled Quail with Savory Cherry-Zinfandel Compote and Kohlrabi, Fennel, and Bing Cherry Salad 
 lisa is cooking 11 Jul 2012 | 7:47 am Can we talk cherries? I go a little bonkers for them every year. Last year, it was Cherry Lambic Crisps and White Chocolate-Cherry Ice Cream and Cherry Sorbet Sandwiches. The year before, I couldn&apos;t get enough of Pickled Cherries. So, when Whole Foods asked if I&apos;d like to help celebrate Cherry Fest by coming in for more fresh, lovely cherries and planning a special menu around them, it was an invitation to a kid into the proverbial candy store. Cherry Fest is taking place at all Austin Whole... This is just a summary. Visit my site for the complete post with photos and links. 
 Chocolate-Bananagasm Muffins 
 lisa is cooking 8 Jul 2012 | 9:00 am It is a catchy recipe title, and chocolate and banana in the same place always gets my attention anyway. So, it was a given that I’d try this. I shared a few of these muffins with some friends, told them what they’re called, and asked them to let me know if they were indeed bananagasmic. Everyone agreed that they were. Although, one friend felt it was more appropriate to wait until no males were in the room to admit it. Her reputation is safe. I won’t tell. The recipe comes from the new book...

 Very Green Avocado-Tahini Dip 
 lisa is cooking 4 Jul 2012 | 6:40 am This week is all about red, white, and blue for the Fourth of July, but why not add some green? A few days ago, I mentioned how much I’m enjoying the new book Wild About Greens, and this is another recipe from its pages. Here, the greens are arugula leaves which bring even more green color to a dip made with avocado. And, this very green dip just happens to be great for a summer party. I didn’t set a timer when I served it, but I can tell you that from the moment the bowl of dip appeared until... This is just a summary. Visit my site for the complete post with photos and links. 
 Slow Roasted Salmon with Cherry Tomatoes and Farro

I’ve read a lot about salmon fishing and the sustainability standards that protect future populations of wild salmon, and I’ll include a list of a few of those books below. What I’ve learned is that one of the best things consumers can do is to support fisheries that operate sustainably. I get excited for the start of wild salmon season and to see the first-of-the-season salmon at... This is just a summary. Visit my site for the complete post with photos and links.

I first heard of Humphry Slocombe when I read Mission Street Food since their ice cream was served for dessert when MSF moved from the taco truck into the first restaurant.

 The Best, Simple Recipe for a Spicy and Smoky Salsa 
 Melody Fury 7 Jul 2012 | 5:00 pm For once, I don’t have much to say.  This post is little more than a recipe for my best salsa recipe.  It’s so utterly simple that it’d be silly not to make it–right now. My spicy and smoky salsa made with ingredients you already have at home The key to this salsa is charring the tomatoes, jalapenos, and garlic to smoky blackness.  Blackening the ingredients intensifies the earthiness and umami.  Once that’s done, it’s just a matter of whizzing it up and balancing the flavours with some brown sugar, lime juice, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Using 4… 
 Klondike Rose Potato and Brussel Sprout Hash with Rib Eye Steak and Sous Vide Egg Recipe 
 Melody Fury 28 Jun 2012 | 7:46 am Do people still follow the Atkin’s diet? Or South Beach? Now, I don’t judge.  I like the idea of cutting refined carbohydrates out of my diet but in reality, it’s a sheer impossibility. Tell me, what can’t the potato do?  Many of my favourite foods and guilty pleasures are made from this starchy tuber.  Tater tots, poutine, croquetas de bacalao, the list is longer than my arm. Having said that, my sedentary lifestyle can’t support reckless potato consumption so I do pick and choose when and how much I eat.  Most importantly, quality over quantity is the key. 
 Cocktail Writing and Photography: Weather Up in Austin TX and a Suffering Bastard Recipe 
 Melody Fury 26 Jun 2012 | 7:29 am Y’all weren’t joking around when you warned me how HOT Austin gets.  Naturally, there’s no better way to cool off than with a few icy and refreshing cocktails. Recently, the new kid on the block in East Austin is Weather Up.  You may recognize that name from Kathryn Weatherup’s two other cocktail establishments in NYC.  Some way some how, Austin charmed her enough to open her first bar outside of New York here. Needless to say, I was thrilled to make my first stop in to check out the space and sample her acclaimed drinks.  What impressed me most right off the bat… 
 Exquisite Tofu Tasting Menu at 空ノ庭 豆腐料理 in Tokyo, Japan 
 Melody Fury 22 Jun 2012 | 6:55 am Tofu, the delicate and versatile product made from soy beans and water, is not highly regarded in North American cuisine.  I consider it tragically misunderstood. I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard people gag at tofu.  But for a person to say“I don’t like tofu”is as sweeping as saying“I don’t like cheese”or“I don’t like bread”.  In North America, tofu is marketed as a one dimensional health food that comes in various firmness.  It has a reputation of being a bland protein supplement for non-meat eaters.… 
 Desserts Galore at Takano Fruit Parlour in Tokyo, Japan 
 Melody Fury 8 Jun 2012 | 9:09 am I’ve never been a chocolate fan.  If you slid a slice of black forest cake or a propped a stack of brownies in front of me, I might take a bite or two.  I will, however, unabashedly face-plant into any dessert made with fresh, seasonal fruit.  Add whipped cream or a fluffy mousse and I’m all yours. Takano in Tokyo is the ultimate mecca for fruity dessert lovers. You may have seen the ridiculously pristine fruit wrapped in glamorous packaging that sells for an arm and a leg.  Chances are, you were looking at Takano’s prized produce.

 Mango Rum Trifle with Coconut Custard 
 Kate 2 Jul 2012 | 8:30 pm One of the true joys of summer is the dinner picnic. Gather some friends, a blanket, a bottle of wine, and someplace to spread your spread. Ideally grass will be involved, and enough live music to add to the ambience without inhibiting conversation. Bread and cheese is always a classic dinner picnic meal, but really, what’s the fun in that? I can spend a week planning a good dinner picnic. Nothing that needs to hold to a certain temperature, or is too fragile to be packaged. My husband always tells me to keep it simple, but I suspect his idea of simple and mine aren’t exactly the…

His needs are fairly uncomplicated. Usually a variation of feed me change me hold me. It’s more that we are still working on the concept of delayed gratification (and you know, nighttime) and if he doesn’t get his needs met pretty much instantly, he gets mad. Really mad. And when he starts crying, I get frantic. I pretty much lose all ability to function until he has stopped crying ( which he does… 
 My latest baking project 
 Kate 29 May 2012 | 7:49 pm I’ve been working on quite a baking project. It took months of effort, and the result weighed in at a whopping seven pounds, nine ounces.

So far, much to his big sister’s disappointment, he doesn’t do much, but Boy is a champion eater, which pleases his mama.

 From my Garden: Loquats, and a Loquat Crumble Recipe 
 Kate 24 May 2012 | 8:15 am I will admit the traffic sucks.  And the home prices are insane.  And yes, we have earthquakes.  And fires.  And floods.  But I can’t escape the feeling that living in Southern California is like having won the lottery.   With the fruits and flowers, the birds and the animals–I do believe that it’s not too far from living in the Garden of Eden.  And this month’s bounty has been loquats. If you don’t have a backyard tree, you may never have had a loquat.  They’re a fruit that’s related to the quince and the apple (both of which we’ve…

 Pedro and Dayana Schambon’s Chicken Coop – A Guest Post 
 Danielle 5 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am I know I promised you a recipe“soon”, but between the previous post and now, life has gotten in the way, in the form of photography (where I taught) and yoga (where I was student) workshops that left me with just enough time and energy to meet deadlines and clients’needs. I am happy though, to introduce you to the work of my friend, Pauline Stevens, based in Austin, TX. I met Pauline at Photomuse last November and became a big fan of her work. She has an eye for capturing the essence of a person or place that gives you pause and entices you to linger. Given our shared… 
 Seattle, Inspired 
 Danielle 21 Jun 2012 | 4:05 pm I was in Seattle to photograph BlogHer Food a few weeks ago, and decided to arrive a few days before the conference to catch up with dear friends and the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. It was exactly what I needed. The weather was as grey and rainy as you’d expect for the region, but perhaps it’s because I get more than my fair share of sunshine in California that I found the landscape of pine and fir trees a refreshing sight from golden, sun-drenched fields. The other part I loved was being able to walk everywhere. To the coffeeshop. To the bus stop. To lunch. Oh, the simple… 
 The Soundtrack of Our Life – A Collaboration 
 Danielle 14 May 2012 | 4:00 am Late last year, Kasey at Turntable Kitchen approached me to create a couple of images to accompany a personal essay reflecting on music, food and dinner parties in the Turntable Kitchen household. It took me two seconds to say yes, and so it was that we found ourselves at their cozy apartment on a February evening breaking bread over a platter of cold cuts and cheese, before tucking into a fabulous Moroccan-inspired chickpea stew. All set against a backdrop of chilled out tunes curated by TTK’s resident DJ (hi Matt!). It was certainly one of the best ways to spend a stormy San Francisco… 
 A Day At Hodo Soy Beanery 
 Danielle 29 Mar 2012 | 11:32 am A few months ago, Spenser magazine approached me to photograph a story about the craft behind the tofu at Hodo Soy Beanery. Knowing nothing about the whole process, and always game for a new challenge, I jumped at the opportunity. Julie Wolfson and I spent a morning at the beanery before hopping across the bay to sample an array of tofu dishes at The Slanted Door. You can read the full story in the latest issue of the magazine (which also features work from fellow bloggers Rick and Asha) and, if you really really like it, purchase a printed copy for posterity! After that visit, Minh invited… 
 Pea Ricotta Spread 
 Danielle 21 Mar 2012 | 12:42 pm You know you’re a foodie when you drive on a wet highway and all of a sudden you feel the car“microplaning”. ~Pim I read this on Facebook last week while the Bay Area was soaked in much-needed rain, and it tickled me so much that I had to share it with M on our way to dinner. After politely letting me giggle it out, he looked at me pityingly and said, “Sorry honey, but that’s SO GEEKY.” Ouch. After recovering from the sting of the failed joke, I got to thinking about his remark and our attitudes towards geekiness in general. Why do we react sheepishly, even…

I signed up for it a while back and never really pinned anything as of late (when all of my friends started pinning things and got me all“pinspired”to do the same). Seeing all of the interior/home pins make me want to revamp my living space but three excuses I have: 1) lack of $$$, 2) I know we’re going to move out after our lease is up, and 3) I do not possess enough time in the world to truly do an overhaul.

 The Farmers’ Market Challenge: It’s On! 
 Lisa Johnson 9 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Our&quot;grocery store&quot;for the next two weeks. We love the farmers’market.  It’s an amazing community where neighbors and farmers come together to share their love of fresh food.  We love taking our son and picking out dinner and are always making“nom nom nom”noises at what we bring home and eat. We still hit the grocery store at least once a week to pick up other supplies.  I’m not sure my son can live without Annie’s Organic Mac&amp;Cheese.  Yes, we know it’s not the healthiest thing, but he loves it and it’s a fast fix if we’re in a rush.

 All Ears for the 4th of July! 
 Mike Gioscia 3 Jul 2012 | 12:04 pm Hello? Hello? These ears can&apos;t hear me! The corn is being picked here in Massachusetts, so it must be popping where you are as well. Corn-on-the-cob is a BBQ tradition, but buying it at the right place is key. You want it local. You want it fresh. I don’t care what the price is. Stop by the local farmstand and fill up a bag! Sure, it may be cheap and piled high at the mega-market, but it was most likely picked days ago, sat around, got trucked to you, sat again some more, and only THEN put on display. 10 cents an ear? Tastes like it. Thanks, I’ll pass. Corn from the south should be…

What You Need: 6 medium cucumbers 1 large red bell pepper 1 small onion 1 bottle of white balsamic vinegar (or any clear vinegar) 2 tablespoons sugar  (I use raw) black pepper to taste water What You Do: This recipe can be prepared a lot faster if you have a mandoline or food processor that slices thinly.

We love the spicy flavor of Indian food, and when we saw these taco like snacks, we bought a box right away! The wraps are made of rice a rice crepe - and rice make a great wrapper for the filling of  spicy potatoes and onions.  The filling was fantastic! It had just enough spice so you know you are eating Indian food, but not too much that you cannot taste anything, at least that is what we thought. The Masala Dosa come with a package of coconut curry, which was wonderful and a little sweet from the coconut and…

This Semi-sparking German/Italian wine is very Prosecco’esk. This German made blend of two Italian grapes has a dry Granny Smith flavor that is very refreshing. This wine pairs nicely with Trader Joe’s Coconut Shrimp as well as Trader Joe’s Indian dishes.  (Can you tell what we had for dinner tonight?) I know many of you are…

 Delaina&amp;Kris 9 Feb 2012 | 5:46 pm Wine Moment with Delaina Hello Fellow Trader Joe’s Fans It has been awhile so I thought I better give you another wine review. We were in our local Trader Joe’s buying splurges for the Super Bowl; and being a sucker for Zinfandels and things placed on end caps I could not resist tying this “new-to-me” Zin. The Zinfandel is out of Sonoma County bottled by The County Fair Wines, titled The One Man Band 2010 and it is zin-fully delicious. Best part it was priced at $8.99. The most dominate flavor to me was the blackberry but the vanilla rounds out the finish very nicely. There is also a…

 Delaina&amp;Kris 30 Jan 2012 | 6:07 pm Ok so we enjoy watching the Super Bowl…a bit. I love the super funny commercials and also the excuse to get together with friends. Also there is the big game too, right? What I really like, to be honest, are all the fun snacks, appetizers and dips that are associated with watching the big game. I usually make items that I would not normally make (can you say nachos?) or have fantastic snacks and other food around that we don’t usually buy (ice cream). This year, we are going to try a more healthy rout to the Super Bowl. Not completely over the top, but we are going to forgo some of the…

 Bitches on Vacay: Beauty&amp;Essex Brunch in NYC 
 Cori Sue 10 Jul 2012 | 7:13 am While I’m a loyal Washingtonian, it is hard to deny that the New York City food—and brunch—scene blows the District out of the water. The sheer quantity of restaurants makes it impossible for Washington to keep up. And then, there are some restaurants, like Beauty and Essex, that hit the mark so perfectly, blending a chic ambiance, gorgeous décor, impeccable service and out-of-this-world cuisine, I wonder why I don’t visit the City more often. Located on Essex Street on the Lower East Side, Beauty and Essex masquerades as a vintage pawn shop. You arrive into an old, dusty, broken…

The ceiling creeps upwards because the building has settled into its center over the past century. CENTURY. That’s amazing, people. I lament that I can never have crown molding, but I smile because it’s charming and historical. So when the Howard Theatre blew open its doors after a $29 million…

 How To Really Cook Country Ribs On A Gas Grill 
 Thom Zehrfeld 27 Jun 2012 | 8:26 am How To Cook Country Ribs First, Country Ribs (Country-Style Pork Ribs) are not really ribs at all! Golly Gee, Holy Jumpin&apos; Up and Down, is that right? Yes! And, they are huge, boneless and meatier than the real pork ribs (baby-backs). Now, this is not a grilling lesson.  It is a way of cooking the Country Ribs on a gas grill, which retains the moisture in the meat, coming away with something that tastes great, and something that nobody would guess that you did on a gas grill. How does that grab you? If all you ever did in the past was to grill weiners and… 
 Beef Loin Tenderloin Steak Filet Mignon 
 Thom Zehrfeld 3 May 2012 | 1:31 pm ﻿﻿ Beef Loin Tenderloin Steak Filet Mignon Beef Loin Tenderloin Steak or Filet Mignon is a prime cut of meat. It comes from the back rib cage of the beef ...is very tender and usually can be cut with a fork. When prepared on a BBQ grill, and served up, it can go down the hatch very smoothly.  &apos;Tis not very cheap, but it&apos;s a lot cheaper than going to a restaurant and paying them to cook it for you. Preparation before grilling is almost nil. You can add a little Rub or spice but it&apos;s not a neccessity. Fire up the barbie and take the meat out of the fridge and… 
 Pork Loin With Mustard 
 Thom Zehrfeld 29 Apr 2012 | 7:57 am Pork Loin With Mustard If you are going to eat meat and want to get towards a little healthier, barbecuing/cooking a a pork loin roast may be the answer. All and all they are a pretty lean cut of meat. Usually, we purchase our pork loins at Costco. They are huge so we cut them in thirds, barbecue one and freeze the other two. Above I am using a gas grill to cook the loin. Also, I am using a water pan and grill between the flame and the pork. This is a form of self-basting and helps immensely to add moisture and tenderness to the pork, or any other kind of meat. It&apos;s a form of… 
 Little Italy Seasoning 
 Thom Zehrfeld 12 Apr 2012 | 12:35 pm One of the best seasonings since &quot;sliced bread&quot; is Chef Paul Prudhomme&apos;s &quot;Little Italy Seasoning&quot; Blend. I am always looking for new types of seasoning, especially in my meat sauce for pastas. Yes, it&apos;s super for a pasta sauce but how about using it as a Rub for meat, poultry, pork, seafood? The answer is, &quot;outstanding&quot;! And, there are other uses: Popcorn, French Fries, Salads, Eggs, Stews. Are you starting to get the picture? It adds a little heat to things, but not overbearing. The cost is not overbearing either...two 16oz cannisters for $23.74...it will last for… 
 Russian Dressing As A Marinade 
 Thom Zehrfeld 10 Apr 2012 | 8:49 am Chicken And Russian Dressing A favorite way to fix a whole chicken is using Russian Dressing as a marinade. The only brand I know about is Wishbone. Whether you fix this on the BBQ, or in the oven it just turns out &quot;marvelous-like&quot;! Russian Dressing has all the ingredients that make for a super marinade. Personnally, I barbecue all year around. I have two grills and both are under cover, so it&apos;s no sweat to get out there. But, if you can&apos;t barbecue things, the next best thing is a clay pot or a Dutch Oven. The whole idea is to keep the chicken as moist as you can and a…

 Capirotada: a Mexican Lenten Dish

Yes, this concoction sounds really weird, but it is an explosion of flavors in your mouth. According to some books, this recipe is a long-lost relative to one served in the Middle Ages. Even thought I prefer to think that a very savvy woman seeing the approach of lent decided to make a good use of what she has leftover in the kitchen before the fasting days of Lent, and then Capirotada was created. Just picture her looking at the dry pieces of bread. Wondering what to do to make…

 7 Feb 2012 | 5:30 pm These are my own version of a very popular antojito in my hometown. It is a mix between a “Taco Mañanero” and a “Chachetada”. Let me explain it: Taco mañanero is a taco usually sold in the early morning hours when most people is rushing to go to work and didn’t have time for breakfast at home. They will stop at a taco stand and buy these mouthwatering tacos and eat them along the way to work, eat them at their workplace or standing in the street next to the vendor. The “Cachetada” means “slap or slapping”. Yes, like when you slap someone in the face. Why are they called…

 Skillet Cookie Recipe 
 Robyn 10 Jul 2012 | 9:01 pm  One of my favorite desserts to make while we are camping is a great big skillet cookie. They are so easy to prepare and always make a much welcomed dessert. I first started making my skillet cookies while camping when Little Buddy was four years old. We were on a trip to Walt Disney World for his birthday and all he wanted for a birthday cake was“the biggest chocolate chip cookie ever.”While my skillet cookie most likely wasn’t the biggest chocolate chip cookie ever, it definitely was the largest one my four year old baby boy had ever laid eyes upon.

 Shrimp Boil Recipe 
 Robyn 3 Jul 2012 | 7:53 am  There’s just something about a shrimp boil that seems to bring everyone together. I’m not sure if it’s the way that it is served, all tossed together in the pot or poured out over a large picnic table covered with newspapers or butcher paper. Either way, it’s a definite warm-weather favorite for us. When we go camping, especially near the coast, we love to pick up fresh shrimp from a local fish market and plan out the meal. It’s one that everyone seems to always love. (...)Read the rest of Shrimp Boil Recipe © Robyn for Cooking | Add a Pinch | Robyn… 
 Pots de Creme Recipe 
 Robyn 2 Jul 2012 | 5:01 am  There is just something about Pots de Creme that makes my mouth water every single time I decide I’m going to make them. Rich, creamy, decadent and so simple to make that it seems like I forgot something when I pop them in the refrigerator! Now, I have to tell you the truth, this is a dessert that I never heard either of my Grandmother’s or even my Mama talking about making as I was growing up. Of course we had chocolate custards and puddings that were very, very similar, but definitely not called pots de creme (pronounced poh duh KREHMwith a little flair). I made these a… 
 Skillet Steaks with Gorgonzola Herbed Butter Recipe 
 Robyn 28 Jun 2012 | 9:42 pm  A big juicy steak just doesn’t get much better than when it is cooked in a hot cast iron skillet. Even though I’ve talked about the perfect steak before, a skillet steak will absolutely knock your socks off. Hearing the sizzle when a steak hits the hot skillet is music to my ears. I know my steaks are getting a good sear, forming a delicious crust if you will, and keeping all that juicy goodness right inside. The process to cook a skillet steak is really not that difficult at all. You just need a heavy, large cast iron skillet that is well-seasoned and cleaned, your steaks,…

 Lentil and Grilled Vegetable Tacos 
 Sonja 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am We love the latest taco craze in restaurants, bars and food trucks—because we can’t get enough of them either!  Whether they’re totally authentic or ideas with creative flair, we love finding new and interesting filling combinations. Since we eat mainly meatless at home, it’s sometimes a challenge thinking of vegetarian taco ideas that are both flavorful and satisfying. This time, we decided to combine our favorite standard lentil tacos recipe with another one of our favorites—grilled vegetables!  The result was a delicious combination that had just the… 
 Pickled Red Onions 
 Sonja 12 Jul 2012 | 3:30 am Who said pickles had to involve a lot of effort? These pickled red onions take about 5 minutes to prepare, and only require 1 hour of waiting time. The result is an incredibly delicious condiment that’s perfect for topping tacos, sandwiches, and salads. We made these as part of our lentil and grilled vegetable tacos, but the sky is the limit when it comes to uses for these babies!  We plan to try to remember to have a jar in the fridge throughout the summer–but they go fast!  We’ll probably have to start doubling this recipe. Other Pickles…Quick Refrigerator Dill… 
 Homemade Corn Tortillas 
 Sonja 11 Jul 2012 | 6:49 pm Tacos seem to be quite the in-thing right now, gracing the menus at upscale restaurants and food trucks alike. We love the versatility of tacos, and coming up with interesting filling ideas. They’re fun to serve for a crowd, since you can make a variety of options for all tastes and diet options. But before you can think about filling, you need a tortilla!  We’ve been hard at work attempting the corn tortilla and have had help and inspiration from several sources (this post from Happyolks, a trial run in person with Erin from Naturally Ella, and Bon Appetit). Though you’ll…

 Taco Night + Giveaway! 
 Sonja 9 Jul 2012 | 3:30 am Maintaining a food blog is hard work. It takes a lot of planning, time, energy, and a lot (LOT!) of failures. But, we wouldn’t trade it for the world! Not only has it helped us to pursue our passion of learning about food, cooking, and photography, it has connected us to some seriously amazing people. If you follow many food blogs, you probably know about Annie from Annie’s Eats. She has a gorgeous food blog that I drooled over for years before I knew anything about the face behind the name. A friend of mine from my home state of Minnesota recommended her blog, but had no idea…

 Big Daddy IPA 
 5 Jul 2012 | 10:39 pm Good carbonation. Toasty and semi-sweet with fruit hints. Robust bitter finish. Reminds me of Sam Adams Noble Pils for some reason. A great craft beer from the great craft hub of San Francisco. Permalink | Leave a comment  » 
 You had me at Box Art. 
 26 Jun 2012 | 8:10 pm I seriously cannot remember what this tasted like (other than myself and DJ enjoyed it) but DAMN that is THE BEST art I&apos;ve ever seen done on a beer. Ever. That alone was enough for it to garner my recommendations.If you can still find Ruthless Rye out there, go help yourself to some immediately. Permalink | Leave a comment  » 
 Infinium. 
 22 Jun 2012 | 8:24 pm See the full gallery on Posterous Light to medium bodied, confusing taste complexity (goes from light to sweet to bitter), VERY high alcohol by volume (10.30% per serving), and a carbonation comparable to champagne and soarkling wines.In short, very weird and one of a kind. But you&apos;ll love it.Just like my brother-in-law Sean. ;)(Who actually bought this limited edition brew for our mutual enjoyment.) :P Permalink | Leave a comment  » 
 One says DIABLO. The other says GAGO. 
 6 Jun 2012 | 5:13 pm I haven&apos;t opened either of them and have no idea what they taste like. I only bought them because the flavor text is cool and I was charmed. A victim of my own marketing preferences!! See the full gallery on Posterous Permalink | Leave a comment  »

This was invented on a whim, was fast to make and bursting with fresh flavor. I have called it a salsa as thats basically what it is but instead of cilantro I used basil.Ingredients:a handful of fresh basil leaves2 cloves of chopped garlic1/4 of a red onion chopped3 tomatoes choppedsalt to tastea little fresh lime juice2 fillets of sole (I keep in freezer for a quick meal)Method:add the ingredients minus the fish to a blender and chopthen add the fish to a pan…

I hope one day to visit Chile and have tea and cake with my friend Gloria ;-) Rebecca from the lovely blog Chow&amp;Chatter invited me to make a guest post, I accepted withpleasure I love Rebecca blog, love her recipes, her travels and pics... 
 My Gardening Journey 
 5 Jul 2012 | 8:41 pm I have always admired folks who gardened and loved my sweet neighbors who would give me produce from their gardens when I lived in Elkin. Even as a child I enjoyed eating broad beans and tomatoes from my Granddad&apos;s garden. I think recently following blogs and chatting with folks on the facebook page and twitter I finally got the confidence to give gardening a go. I am happy to say its really not that hard and its so rewarding to watch things grow and teach my wee daughter how we get our food. She happily planted the vegetables and enjoys eating them as a dietitian I can proudly say it works,… 
 Grilled Zucchini and Feta Salad 
 3 Jul 2012 | 8:34 pm This is a lovely and simple salad, perfect for summer, with all the fresh zucchini my wee garden is producing. Also with the 4th of July here in America great salad&apos;s are perfect for cook outs. I used an electric grill but an outside one would work really well or even a cast iron skillet.Ingredients:make two small salad platesone zucchini thinly sliced into strips I used a mandolin10 cherry tomatoes a handful of feta cheesea drizzle of olive oila drizzle of balsamic vinegar a pinch of salt and pepperMethod:grill the zucchini with little salt and pepper and olive oil for about 2-3… 
 Rhubarb and Strawberry Granita 
 1 Jul 2012 | 11:03 am I have to say I adore the chow and chatter facebook page and the sweet folks on there, I started talking about rhubarb and recipe ideas and I decided there was no excuse for never cooking it. My Dad grows it in his garden and I remember nibbling on it dipped in sugar as a kid with my Mum making rhubarb crumble with custard (a crisp in the US). I wanted to do something different and with the weather being so warm I thought of an Italian style granita. It was easy to make and a fun summer treat. Its also healthy being a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Calcium,…

 Debi 24 May 2012 | 11:55 am Pin itIf you read my last post, or follow me on twitter, you know I was in Louisville, Kentucky last week visiting the GE Monogram Experience Center with a great group of food bloggers from around the country. Some of those bloggers were people I felt like I already knew from all of our interactions through social media and had been dying to meet IRL…This is Coryanne Ettiene of Housewife Bliss And then there were some of those bloggers I did not know at all before this trip and now feel like we’ve been friends forever…My new partner in crime, Sarah of 20SomethingCupcakes.

I got to go and hang out with some of my favorite bloggers from all over the country.

 Elizabeth 2 Jul 2012 | 5:51 pm  So, just a little note before I get to the recipe. Three Years. Yup, it’s my blogiversary. Did I bake a ridiculous cake? No. Did I throw a blogger party and invite all my food blogger friends? No. Did I instead make these cookie balls, completely forget about the anniversary date and go on like nothing happened until I went to write this post. Likely. BUT…I am going to instead celebrate by getting in my car with my three besties (kid FREE!) and driving 700 miles to stay in the prairie sunshine while visiting one of the biggest rodeos on EARTH. Yes, I’ll be on the…

The sound of my crying in the last half hour of my very last tattoo session for my food/photography sleeve (or so I thought…) The photo above is from Thursday evening, as I completed what I thought would be my very last session on this epic sleeve (you like the heirloom tomatoes??). At the end, my artist (Emily Shoichet) and I decided a little colour (almost the same as the shirt I’m wearing in the pic above) around the outer edges will do wonders for the overall look.

 Meal Planning and Dorset Cereal Giveaway! 
 Elizabeth 22 Jun 2012 | 2:08 pm I lot of people who follow me on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter see most of the things I eat in any given day. I tend to talk about that a lot, as 1. I’m obsessed with food and 2. I’m obsessed with the quality of food that goes into my body. Also I like to take pictures of food, but I think I’m one of about 11,897,456 people who do that…But I often get asked what my planning is like. As I have said in a couple of other posts, I eat based on macro nutrients and calories. I eat 20% fat, 40% carbohydrates and 40% protein. I try to maintain about1900-2000 calories a day…

Like I’ve been saying in previous posts, it’s a lot harder for me in the last few months to get my poop in a group to actually design a recipe, test it, photograph it and write a post to go with it.

 Healthy Eating: Cannellini-Veggie Burgers 
 Victoria 12 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am I have a pretty big news flash to share with y&apos;all. I&apos;m making a bigger effort to cook healthier food. With that said, don&apos;t expect this to turn into a diet blog EVER, as I will still be sharing comfort foods and delicious baked yummies that I will simply never stop producing or eating (in moderation, always). I am trying to lead a healthier lifestyle and I&apos;m hoping to have more healthy options on my blog in the future.

 Dim Sum at Jade Asian Restaurant (Flushing, Queens NY) 
 Victoria 9 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Steamed Char Siu Bao (BBQ Pork Bun) Literally, dim sum means to &quot;touch the heart&quot; or &quot;order to your heart&apos;s content.&quot; When someone suggests, &quot;let&apos;s go to dim sum,&quot; I simply don&apos;t say no. It&apos;s always a yes answer. Always. Also, it is always synonymous with tea. A pot of tea usually hits your table even before you select your first tray of dim sum (and you know how much I love tea!). To really experience a traditional dim sum cart service, you need to absorb yourself into a Chinatown environment. Dim sum does have a growing popularity in Chinese restaurants outside of concentrated areas,…

Missing the islands, it&apos;s the closest I can get to the experience right now... allowing the flavors to transport be back to paradise. The funny thing about the Caribbean is that although so many of the islands may seem alike in many ways (gorgeous beaches, rum-based cocktails, sunny weather year-round), their cuisines can actually differ greatly based on who colonized them years ago.

 S&apos;MAC: Sarita&apos;s Macaroni and Cheese NYC 
 Victoria 2 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Sarita&apos;s Macaroni and Cheese, better known as S&apos;MAC, is a small eatery in Manhattan&apos;s East Village. As you&apos;d expect, it features one thing: macaroni and cheese. I&apos;d imagine the mantra behind this restaurant is as follows... &quot;if you&apos;re good at something, stick with it.&quot; Also, &quot;people love macaroni and cheese.&quot; Thus this spot is as popular as you&apos;d imagine. With limited seating, the dining area can fill up quickly. Luckily, there is a small take-out shop next door so you can get your mac and cheese on the go and eat it nearby. I consider myself to be a pretty amazing mac and cheese maker. I can…

These cupcakes came together very organically, and were completely unplanned (meaning you can easily make them last minute and for no reason just like I did!). My sister had some very ripe bananas and asked me if I wanted to make something with them before they went to waste. Of course I did! I always do :) She had also just purchased a jar of Nutella, so these cupcakes were a natural vehicle for all those amazing and complimentary flavors. Seriously, bananas and Nutella go together like ice cream…

When I saw Joyce&apos;s beautiful rolls I decided right then that I had to try to adapt the recipe to my new bread machine!

 Erbe Matte Hits Its Inevitable End 
 11 Jul 2012 | 3:30 pm Louis Kim In retrospect, a restaurant offering both Korean and Italian food should have probably been a warning sign, like taquerias that trumpet burgers on their awnings or fried chicken joints that hold a secondary degree in lo mein. But we&apos;re game for almost anything and maybe the 90210 address managed to evade our jade. Still, from the first bite, it was pretty clear Erbe Matte was muddled, nailing neither Korean not Italian, something the restaurant must have realized later on, when it shifted its focus to a more straight-forward Italian approach. Today, Eater reports the inevitable:…

 Simple Stir Fried Red Potatoes and&quot;Lunch&quot; 
 17 Jun 2012 | 7:10 pm We had one permanent sabji wala (vegetable and fruit seller) who would make rounds every other day and bring fresh produce from his garden. He had this huge basket made out of bamboo which he would carry on his head and would make rounds around the neighborhood. Mummy would select things that interested her most out of that basket and that would decide what we will be eating for the next couple days until the sabji wala comes back again. We knew what to expect in that basket depending on the season. He would bring lots of dark green and crunchy cucumbers in summer along with some juicy yellow… 
 Sweet and Savory Orange Cumin Shortbread Cookies 
 7 Jun 2012 | 10:45 pm Papa worked for the government so we lived in a small government quarter as kids. It had one bedroom. Well, two, but one of them was Papa&apos;s office and it was filled with files and more files. We were never allowed to enter his office and back then we never understood why. But now that I have a curious little butterfly of my own who has the ability of turning the whole house upside down in seconds, I know exactly why he did that. Next to his office was a veranda which was our dining cum entertainment room and attached to that was mummy&apos;s tiny kitchen. The size of that room was exactly what the… 
 One Fine Day And Some Roasted Carrots&amp;Spring Onions With Chaat Masala 
 1 May 2012 | 1:04 pm Today I have way more photos to share with you than I have words. Photos from one fine day under the sun with some dear friends close by, the little one&apos;s soft chubby palm wrapped around my finger and a camera held in the other hand. It was a nice change to walk by people grabbing their coffee mugs rushing to work while me pausing after every two minutes taking pictures or following the little one running after pigeons. After a long time I finally got a much needed break from a hectic schedule. A few of us friends (Rose, Vijitha and Kankana) planned to drop whatever we were busy doing and… 
 Methi Murgh 
 23 Apr 2012 | 12:02 am Through out the warmer part of the year, everyday after school he would have us help him out in the garden. Papa would work hard and set up a kitchen garden, by the house every year. Would work up the soil, go buy some new seeds and plants, pull out the older seeds saved from last year and sow them neatly under the soil. Tomatoes big and small, lauki (botte gaurd), squashes of several variety, onion, potatoes, karela (bitter gourd), eggplants and many more. He would have me and my brother help him out, water the plants, pick weeds and make sure Polley, our pet dog doesn&apos;t make that garden her… 
 Indian Simmer Loves- The Spice Spoon 
 20 Apr 2012 | 1:02 am Its been quite an experience this past few months. Life couldn&apos;t be crazier (or so do I think!) with the day packed with a never ending list of &quot;things&quot; needed to be done. Trying to juggle work, family and my sanity together. I do not say that I am doing a good job with it or have reached the goal, but I am getting there. Hopefully life will get back to normal soon and I will get to do things that I haven&apos;t been able to do in months, like sleeping or sitting and wondering what to do next? And I could not thank you enough for your support and my friends who always have my back. One such dear…

 Musical Pairings: Peaking Lights – Lucifer 
 Matthew 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am The latest full length, Lucifer, by Bay Area-inhabiting married duo Indra Dunis and Aaron Coyes (a.k.a. Peaking Lights) is a study of contrasts. On the one hand the album is simple, repetitive and straight forward. Songs are propelled by dub-like songs drenched in echo and reverb and built upon prominent bass lines and drumming. Lyrics, grooves, and melodies are stretched out and often repeated at length. Yet, on the other hand it is also the sort of complex album that unfurls slowly over time revealing depth and shifting melodies. There is always more to each track than can be revealed on a… 
 Quinoa Sushi, A Return 
 Kasey 12 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am Talk about a switching of gears. Like all vacations, short or long, mine came to an abrupt end following a luscious Sunday roast enjoyed in East London—my last stop before SFO. I have a terrible habit of counting down to the end of vacation, much like I do in anticipation of it. Four days before our trip was to come to a close, I had already begun to sing my sad song. Everything good seemed behind me, and I was already nostalgic for the shores of Scopello, the castle in Erice, and the streets of Siracusa. Even Palermo, which at first felt dirty and unkempt, made me swoon over its… 
 TK010: Ghost Loft – Seconds / Morning 7″ 
 Matthew 11 Jul 2012 | 10:04 am Maybe it’s the summer weather, but we’ve been feeling slow, relaxed jams recently. So it’s no surprise that we’ve quickly fallen in love with the chilled out and sexy vibes of Los Angeles-based producer Danny Choi who records music under the name Ghost Loft. And let me tell you, these jams were lifesavers in Sicily. The sun was swelteringly hot and the air bone dry as we wandered small baroque towns and waded in the Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian, and Ionian Seas. In climates like that, this pair of grooves are like crisp and cooling sea breezes welcomingly wafting in to chill things… 
 Single Serving: Roane Namuh&amp;Reva DeVito (+ Häagen-Dazs 50 Summer Moments) 
 Matthew 10 Jul 2012 | 9:29 am We’re selective about the folks we align ourselves with here at TK. And, frankly, we don’t typically align ourselves with established brands. We prefer to champion our favorite small producers. That’s not going to change. However, once in awhile a more established brand approaches us with a cool partnership opportunity that we can support. That was the case with the Häagen-Dazs 50 Summer Moments program. Basically, Häagen-Dazs has asked me to act as their music curator for a program collecting my favorite summer moments shared by others, and also to share a few of my… 
 Artist Guest Post {Exray’s} featuring Mwahaha 
 Exrays 6 Jul 2012 | 4:00 am I love albums that slowly burrow a place in your heart. Those slow-growing albums that beckon you to just kick it with them again and again. Once you’ve given them room to blossom, you’re hooked. Anyways, that describes my relationship with many of my favorite albums. My favorite slow-burner this year? Definitely Exray’s Trust A Robot. If you haven’t spent a few lazy afternoons with this album, then you are doing yourself a disservice. Jon Bernson of Exray’s has been kind enough to share his favorite new music discovery of the year. Along the way he shares some…

 the cherry manifesto 
 Kate 11 Jul 2012 | 7:09 am I went a bit crazy over cherries recently. After discovering them at a local market for $2.98 a pound one week, I splurged and bought nearly 18 pounds worth of them. Then barely two weeks after that, the same market had them for $1.97 a pound and I bought about 8 more pounds. I know. Whoa, girl. And it begs the question….. just what did I DO with all those cherries??? Besides gleefully stuff them in my mouth. Which I did a lot of, mind you. They are so crisp and perfect and juicy. I could hardly help myself and I’m pretty sure my veins ran thick with deep, dark cherry juice for a… 
 millet&amp;chickpea salad 
 Kate 8 Jul 2012 | 7:38 pm Summer kind of smacked us around this past week in Minnesota. We’re a state that lives for Summer, for beach time and hours spent outdoors engaging in just about any activity that means we escape our houses and enjoy the weather, but then there are those Summer days that are so hot, so thickly humid and uncomfortable that we have no choice but to stay home, avoid the triple digits outdoors and attempt to entertain ourselves while the sun tries to burn holes in our roof. I’ve experienced some hot Summers in my lifetime; 1988 was a blistering hot Summer that saw temperature records… 
 cauliflower two ways 
 Kate 5 Jul 2012 | 6:40 am Cauliflower is so endlessly versatile, and to think up until a few years ago, I’d only eaten it raw or boiled. Boiled? Ugh. Steamed is a much better, albeit bland, option, but if you allow it to go too far in the steamer, it’s lack of inspiration becomes legendary. The epiphany, thankfully,  was the pan of deeply roasted cauliflower that changed my mind about the stark white florets forever. I’ve tried it mashed like potatoes, and also pureed smooth with parmesan for a creamless alfredo sauce. But time and again, I placed a pan loaded with it in to a hot oven and devoured… 
 the pastabilities are endless ( and a giveaway ) 
 Kate 28 Jun 2012 | 5:37 pm In moving past the continual consumption of meat with our meals, it brings to light an entirely new way of going out to eat, as I’m left wondering how up to date any restaurant will be with their meatless options. There are those places that soar, offering a wealth of meat-free entrees that dazzle, while others places rely on pasta dishes as their sole vegetarian fare. Pasta isn’t bad, mind you. I do enjoy it. But these days, having just a pasta dish or two with vegetables as your meatless menu offering is pretty unimaginative for a restaurant. But that being said, pasta has… 
 raw pea salad with jicama, cucumber&amp;mint 
 Kate 27 Jun 2012 | 7:13 am I’ve never liked peas. Never. But again, as always, I’d been exposed only to frozen cooked peas, often overdone and alarming in their color and consistency. Even the smell made me want to gag. But then again, up until just last year, I’d never had peas fresh, raw and straight from the shell. I popped this raw pea in to my mouth in a moment of bravery and bit down. It was, obviously, a revelation, and the continuation of these eye-opening food experiences as an adult has been nothing short of wondrous, proving that it is never, ever to late to learn about new foods. Still,… 

 
 A Culinary Journey With Chef Dennis 
 
 Tomato Ricotta Pizza and My Precious…..sigh 
 Chef D 8 Jul 2012 | 8:08 pm After 11 days of scorching sweltering heat our current heat wave has finally ended, and not a moment to soon!  Saturday our temp peaked at 101, two degrees short of the record set in 2010, but with the heat index it felt like 108.   Do we really need the heat index?  It’s bad enough that they torture us with the wind chill factor in the winter time, but now they have to tell us how hot it actually feels…….really?  Can’t we leave well enough alone and just say it was 101?   Do we really need to factor in humidity, and what ever else they add in to let us know its… 
 S’mores Cookies with Amy’s Cooking Adventures 
 Chef D 6 Jul 2012 | 5:05 am Summer is definitely upon us and we’re in the middle of a pretty good heat wave, and looking at the weather map of the US, we’re certainly not the only ones suffering from this heat wave.    With the dog days of summer still weeks away, all we can do is try to stay as cool as possible, and out of the direct sunlight!   I’have to  wonder how this heat is going to effect our summer crop of fruits and vegetables, let’s hope not to badly.   The last thing we need is a produce shortage that drives the prices up even more….sigh But it’s Friday, the end of… 
 Very Cherry and Blueberry Cheesecake Gelato’s for National Ice Cream Month! 
 Chef D 3 Jul 2012 | 7:19 pm In the Summertime when the weather is high you can jump right up and touch the sky, when the weather is high you got gelato, got gelato on your mind!   For those of you old enough to remember Mungo Jerry, the original line was got women, got women on your mind.  But as the years go by and as hot as it’s been, gelato is going to have to do……sigh   (They say that everything changes with time, and I’m beginning to understand why 90%  of my mother’s conversations revolve around food) If you saw my last post and my Cherry Almond Cake, I mentioned I had another… 
 Cherry Almond Cake 
 Chef D 1 Jul 2012 | 8:32 pm What do you do when life hands you cherries, I mean we know what to do when it hands us lemons, but no one ever mentioned cherries….sigh You see the problem all started because Lisa loves cherries, but they seem to be out a little late this year, or the peaches are in a little early,  I’m not sure which of those statements are actually true, but the end result was that  I had two pounds of cherries that needed to be used.   So after thinking long and hard I’ve come up with the answer to the (new) age old question of what to do when life hands you… 
 Jam Session Parfait with a little lunch 
 Chef D 29 Jun 2012 | 5:11 am Summertime and the living is easy (I hope you imagined me singing to you)…..sigh I can always tell when summer has really set in for me, because I have no clue what day it is,  of course if I really think about it, I can usually get within a day or two, but when you wake up every morning with no place you have to go or anything you have to do, time has a way of just slipping by……..I could get use to this! But the old chef still has a few more years to go before retirement.  Right now the plan is for Lisa to take her early retirement in two years, but  it looks like…

 Y Mucho Mas, Part 1: More Mexico City Adventures for a Rather Warbly Wendesday 
 11 Jul 2012 | 11:24 am Believe it or not, Poppa Trix and I actually do more than eat on our trips.  We sightsee. We wander around. We walk - a lot. We go to museums and historical sites. Sometimes we even sleep! Here we are at Teotihuacan, a pre-hispanic city 30 miles outside of Mexico City. Climbing the narrow, uneven steps to the tops of the pyramids was an exercise in overcoming fear and vertigo, but we did it, and so naturally we wanted to take few moments to savor our accomplishment and contemplate the incredible view from the top: Click here to read the rest of this post »

 Chilled Three Pepper Soup with Yogurt, Lime, Cilantro,&amp;Tortilla Strips for the 5 Star Makeover Chilled Soup Challenge 
 27 Jun 2012 | 7:56 am I cannot tell a lie: I was not thrilled when I found out the theme of this month&apos;s Five Star Makeover Challenge, hosted as ever by the lovely and talented Natasha of Five Star Foodie and Lazaro of Lazaro Cooks!. Chilled soups. If you&apos;ll pardon the expresion, I have never really warmed to them. Oh, they&apos;re fine for a few bites. But I always think that with just a few tweaks, even the best of them would be better as something else. Fruity chilled soup? That would make a lovely smoothie. Gazpacho? Great as a Bloody Mary base. Cold vegetable soup? Just right for a dip or sauce. Click…

 Rare Tea Republic Tea Tasting at the Summer Fancy Food Show 
 22 Jun 2012 | 11:10 am I know the usual protocol after not posting on one&apos;s blog for a couple of weeks is to apologize profusely, make obsequious pronouncements as to one&apos;s unworthiness, and swear to never, ever stay away so long again. Well, the truth is: 1.) I am not so egotistical as to suppose that you have been pining away for me, 2.) I can&apos;t promise never to do it again, and 3.) I am not sorry. Don&apos;t take that the wrong way - I have simply been having too much fun to feel regret. Case in point: The Summer Fancy Foods Show in DC. Unlike the previous year, when I went solo, this year Poppa…

 Pasta-Free Summer Lasagna 
 Megan 27 Jun 2012 | 1:34 pm There are days when I have grand plans about what I’m going to make for dinner. Usually in the morning or the night before, I come up with an idea and spend some time thinking about how good it will be. Then I go about my day, cleaning up, trying to keep the plants in my raised beds alive, running to the store, pickling things, and everything else that comes along with being a homeowner and mom. Dinnertime creeps up, and all too frequently I have exhausted myself already, and the thought of heading back into the kitchen just makes me slump farther into the sofa cushions. After a little… 
 Bulk Tomatoes and Me (and You) 
 Megan 22 Jun 2012 | 6:00 am I spent the second weekend in June arm-deep in tomatoes, getting more lycopene externally than most people probably need, standing for six hour stretches, and forgetting to eat. All for you, dear reader, so I could bring you this post. OK, not really all for you, because I’m not sharing my spoils with you lot, who just read and lurk and don’t even comment. Sniff. It’s OK. I have my jars of tomatoes to keep me company. After all, I did make my husband carry home 40 pounds of tomatoes to start with. (Technically I only made him carry them to the car from the farmers’… 
 Peach Raspberry Pie 
 Megan 20 Jun 2012 | 8:00 am It would seem that despite going to a baking immersion for three days I still have trouble with pie crust. Lesson noted for self, that when presented the chance to do empanadas or pie, you do pie, despite living in Texas and having empanadas being applicable to your diet. I had trouble with my crust because I’m still paranoid about adding too much water, so I don’t add enough, and then my crust falls to bits as I’m trying to roll it out. I know it just comes down to making more pie, right? The pie I made was almost exactly the one from Eating Well, so I’m not going to… 
 Grilled Peaches and Salami 
 Megan 18 Jun 2012 | 6:00 am A couple months ago I was fortunate to be invited to a dinner at the Carillon, the restaurant in the AT&amp;T Conference Center at the University of Texas. If you’ve never been there, you probably don’t understand that despite its location, this is one of the best restaurants in town, with a very talented (and I have to say it, adorable) head chef and an equally creative pastry chef. These two would be the ones preparing our dinner, of course, but the twist? Every course featured a variety of salumi, starting with a watermelon and mâche salad and ending with almond cake.

 Heather @girlichef.com 9 Jul 2012 | 3:48 pm So this month, we introduced a new feature for our monthly BYOB posts. Not much has changed, we still want to encourage and promote all sorts of home bread baking, but we introduced an optional feature, as well. What is it...what is it...you ask!?!? (You were totally wondering, right?) Well, for those of you who don&apos;t know, we are picking one blog each month as the BYOB - Featured Bread Blog. This bread doesn&apos;t necessarily have to be only about bread. Although it can be. We just want to choose a blog to feature that has a pretty good bread catalogue.

 Heather @girlichef.com 7 Jul 2012 | 11:00 pm If you&apos;ve got kids in the elementary to junior high range at home, you&apos;ve probably heard of Spaghetti Tacos ala iCarly. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve seen that episode, at least in part, close to 50 times. The kids, probably more. When Nickelodeon gets on an iCarly kick, they run the episodes over and over for days and days. There was a time when the kids used to ask me to make Spaghetti Tacos. And I didn&apos;t have anything against them, I just never really got around to making them. Which is kind of rude of me, seeing as how we&apos;ve probably had both tacos and spaghetti in their…

 Easy, Edible Minion Cupcake Toppers 
 marye 11 Jul 2012 | 11:34 am I have three kids with July birthdays in the first two weeks so parties are usually planned as one large event. This year we missed Matthew because he is in Korea, happily ensconced in adulthood. He turned 20 today, actually. Sigh. So hard to believe. Kyrie’s birthday is on the first and Nick’s is on the third so having a party that both will enjoy is imperative. Since Despicable Me is a favorite move AND since I had pinned some adorable Minion cupcakes on Pinterest the only thing left to decide was the flavor. Like that was a hard decision. Chocolate rules here. Recipe, including… 
 Is There Life without Olives? 
 marye 10 Jul 2012 | 2:51 pm I don’t think so. I love olives of every size, shape, and color. When I was little (and I bet you did this, too!) I would push the pitted black olives on my fingers. Sadly, I have to admit that I have, on occasion, done the same thing…as an adult…in public…without having sipped any wine at all. I’m fun like that. When I was growing up we had olives in the house at all times. Black olives were part of every holiday meal and green olives were plunged into at least one martini almost every night. I think I have already told you what happened to those olives when…

 marye 2 Jul 2012 | 3:44 pm From Memorial Day to Labor Day summer has a lot of entertaining opportunities. Independence Day is probably my personal favorite when it comes to entertaining. Memorial Day sort of kicks off summer vacation, Labor Day tells it goodbye, but the 4th of July is just there, being all glitzy and fun. As I said in the last post, Fourth of July celebrations were a summer tradition when I was growing up. It was an amazing time of parades, carnivals, fireworks, and more food than anyone could eat. I remember loving sitting in the velvet black night and watching the exploding colors light up the sky. 
 Berry and White Chocolate Mousse Parfaits in Mason Jars 
 marye 29 Jun 2012 | 9:58 am One of the best things about summer to me is the impromptu picnics. Or even planned picnics, for that matter. When I was growing up my parents had a Fourth of July party every year. The planned it for months in advance and it always had a theme. The one I remember most was the Christmas in July party they did. Dad strung Christmas lights (remember the 1960′s big colored lights with the foil reflectors?) all through the landscaping around the deck of the pool.There was some sort of evergreen in one of the corners and he and mom hung Christmas decorations all over it, and put a star at…

 CORNED BEEF and CABBAGE RECIPES: St. Patrick&apos;s Day Irish Boiled Dinner, Food Network Videos 
 Donna Diegel 16 Mar 2012 | 8:58 pm Wondering what the Irish eat for St. Patrick&apos;s Day? My favorite recipes are for Irish Soda Bread, Bailey&apos;s Irish Cream Cheesecake and Corned Beef and Cabbage. But anyone that wants to be Irish for the day is either buying corned beef brisket, making it, ordering it, and eventually eating corned beef and cabbage on March 17th! The grocery stores usually have corned beef brisket on sale around St Patrick&apos;s Day, and along with potatoes, cabbage, onions and carrots, it makes a real cheap meal. I use the pressure cooker for my corned beef and cabbage dinner because it&apos;s quick and...

I had to take some time out to write a cookbook for Penguin Publishing—an Idiot&apos;s Guide at that! (Yes, I know. It was a shamelss plug!)

 White Beans Salad with Strawberries 
 Dutchess 4 Jul 2012 | 12:11 am Summer time  means Salad time, amongst other things, I know! And who doesn’t love salads, have you already tried the recipe for a salad with peaches??? You can find it here, it’s absolutely delicious. And actually just as good is this one. The strawberries in this salad shout  SUMMER and that’s good! Now all we need is a bit more warmer weather over here and we’re fine. Did you know that a strawberry is not just a strawberry. There are so many varieties, more than you think, but what’s important is to pick the most sweet and delicious smelling ones for this salad. And then the… 
 Steak Tartare 
 Dutchess 28 Jun 2012 | 1:16 am A classic recipe but I never made it before, until a few weeks ago. How easy and delicious this is! That is if you like meat, but I think you do… but it’s not healthy (or even dangerous) for everybody because it contains raw meat and a raw egg yolk. Think about that before you decide to try it. At this moment a lot is happening in The Dutchess’ kitchen, good and bad but that’s life. Too bad it also makes me beg for more hours in a day so I can make and post new recipes! If you ever find a way to multiply the good old 24/7 please inform me and I will be thankful  for the rest of my… 
 Spaghetti with Caciotta Cheese 
 Dutchess 15 Jun 2012 | 2:05 am There’s a new cheese in my kitchen and it’s called Caciotta Cheese and it’s an Italian style cheese. The official name is  Caciotta d’Urbino D.O.P. and the one I bought was made in Italy, Tuscany. It’s a semi-soft cheese, made of sheep and cow milk (usually 70/30%). The taste is mild (young cheese) and gets more tangy when you buy an aged version. And it melts beautifully when you add it to warm pasta for example. And that’s what we want, creamy, tasty melted cheese with pasta! A few weeks ago I was talking with my friend Yanna (go check out her facebook… 
 Vitello Tonnato 
 Dutchess 7 Jun 2012 | 2:13 am Today I’m going to give you one of my favorite Summer recipes: Vitello Tonnato. Or, in English, veal with a tuna sauce. It’s a dish you can serve as an appetizer, an entrée and also as a main dish. It’s an Italian dish, and it’s eaten cold. This recipe calls for thin slices of veal and that means I didn’t prepare the veal myself but bought slices of veal roulade. You can buy this at the deli shop and it’s much easier than doing it yourself. But one day I’ll make it myself and I will post it of course. Today we’re going for convenience and lazy, if that’s okay with you? Even… 
 Smoked Duck and Mushrooms Salad 
 Dutchess 4 Jun 2012 | 4:13 am How about a salad with smoked duck?? Let me tell you it was soooo delicious! And it looks pretty too, if I may say so myself… This recipe I made when it was warm weather,“salad-weather”so to say. And would you believe me when I say that we now have a max of 50F today??? It’s true, and it doesn’t me a happy Dutchess!! But, one day it will be warmer again, I have faith! You can prepare everything in advance, if that’s easier for you. Some points of attention: - I like the mushrooms a bit warm, but that’s personal - Instead of bacon (I still had some…

 Corn Salad with Caramelized Onions, Bacon, and Cilantro 
 Amanda 5 Jul 2012 | 4:35 pm This corn salad is a perfect summer party side dish. First, it can sit out for a while. It’s served room temperature and there’s nothing that needs to stay hot or cold (like mayonnaise or dairy). Second, you can make a big batch that people can serve themselves from, instead of something like a roll where people might grab too many. It was a fairly easy dish to make, it takes a bit of time since you have to shuck the corn and then later cut the corn off the cob. But it really pays off. Plus you can make the ingredients in segments, whenever throughout the day. Maybe start off with… 
 Cooking with Beer (now with 50 recipes!) 
 Amanda 28 Jun 2012 | 4:10 am Ah beer. A college student’s best friend. If you haven’t noticed, we’re beer fans in our house. It may be that we’re college students who are fortunate to not only live so close to the Sierra Nevada Brewery, but also have some of the cheapest drink specials around. We can get pitchers of Sierra Nevada for $5. Hah! It’s one of the reasons I love Chico. I also love cooking with beer. However, I ran into a few problems with bitterness. After that I decided to look up some tips and share them with you, my lovely readers. Plus 50 recipes to give you inspiration! Wheat… 
 Eggs Poached in Marinara 
 Amanda 26 Jun 2012 | 10:46 am Ah breakfast, my favorite meal of the day. Lately I’ve been trying to work on my diet. I’ve been trying to cut carbs as much as possible, but I’ll never be able to let go of them. Just trying to eat less of them. Sometimes breakfast is hard because I want toast or a burrito. I’ve seen eggs poached in marinara out on the internet and I thought this would be a good, filling way to enjoy a runny egg without toast. We just happened to have some extra marinara open. If you have homemade marinara that would make this above and beyond good or you could make it specifically… 
 June Full Moon on the Kings 
 Amanda 10 Jun 2012 | 2:32 pm Well it was the June full moon on Monday so Matt and I headed out to the Kings River for some moonlight rafting. We had an interesting group of some of my family, some of Matt’s family, and a few of Matt’s friends. We brought our large raft, two inflatable kayaks, our rafting gear, our camping gear, food and beer for five days, and this was the result. And of course there’s Riken! Ready for her first camping trip! We were extremely lucky to snag a camp spot that we did. It’s right next to the river feature called“Forever Eddy,”because the river runs into… 
 Mini Nutella Cupcakes 
 Amanda 24 May 2012 | 1:44 pm I picked up two mini muffin tins at a local consignment store and I was dying to make something in miniature form! I’m not much of a baker, so I was delighted at how easy these nutella cupcakes were! In reality, these are more like mini muffins, not as sweet as a normal cupcake. Which worked out for us since Matt doesn’t like overly sweet treats (nor do I), but we both love nutella! The first time I made these, I had a problem where I was trying to mix the nutella in the batter. All you’re really trying to do is get the ribbons of nutella throughout the batter.

 Brazilian chicken with coconut milk 
 Cyndi L 6 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am I don&apos;t remember exactly why this recipe first caught my eye, but I&apos;m really glad it did. My guess is that I must have been looking specifically for ideas that used Brazilian flavors and ingredients, because I don&apos;t often just browse around on All Recipes. Maybe I should! The recipe is at the link; the changes I made were to use boneless and skinless chicken thighs and to serve it as almost more of a stew. Yup, that&apos;s a bowl in the shot above, because we wanted to slurp up all the tasty sauce! 
 Happy 4th of July!!

 Skinny guacamole 
 Cyndi L 2 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Honestly, I didn&apos;t really like this very much, but Mike thought it was just fine. I&apos;m not a big fan of zucchini, but I LOVE avocados (I eat about two per week, scooped right out of the &apos;shell&apos;), so I think my main objection was the dilution of the avocado-y goodness. If you need to cut calories, or you really like zucchini, I would definitely recommend it. Skinny Guacamole

 Around the World in 80 Plates: Buenos Aires, Argentina 
 Hannah (BitterSweet) 9 Jul 2012 | 7:58 am These past few weeks of constant culinary travel really did wear me out, so I can only imagine how the chefs actually making the trek must feel! After a much needed one week intermission, we’re back on the road again, pounding the pavement in search of new edible inspiration. Today, our path brings us to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Buenos Aires, alive with bright colors and lively music through all hours of the day, immediately brings to mind tango dances and beautiful beaches, but desserts? Not so much. Luckily, there does seem to be a universal craving just beneath the surface, and… 
 A Frozen Fourth of July 
 Hannah (BitterSweet) 29 Jun 2012 | 6:59 am Our Independence Day, the most patriotic of national holidays here in the US, typically fails to stir up much enthusiasm from me. The backyard barbecues are a welcome excuse to grill some easy entrees and catch up with old friends, but that could happen on any summer day, too. Plus, that red, white, and blue color scheme is a bit uninspiring…Most of the time. Inexplicably and without warning, it just hit me the right way this time around. Without plans or any party to attend, I still couldn’t resist the bait- I went all out to make a festive fourth of July dessert. In fact, now I… 
 Shredding the Competition 
 Hannah (BitterSweet) 27 Jun 2012 | 8:05 am For all the progress made in creating better tasting, readily available, and even more affordable vegan cheeses, it’s surprising that one company still has a near monopoly on the meltable“cheese”market. The greatest test of any cheesy substitute, it’s a true feat of food engineering that not many achieve with flying colors. Happily, that doesn’t mean that all the other players are out of the game- Far from it, as evidenced by Galaxy Foods‘latest bold entry to the arena, Vegan Shreds. Proclaiming that it“Melts and Stretches”right on the… 
 Around the World in 80 Plates: Hong Kong, China 
 Hannah (BitterSweet) 25 Jun 2012 | 8:08 am Every culture can lay claim to many edible innovations, and would like to believe themselves to be the original“foodies,”but that title should arguably be handed over to people of Hong Kong, China. No where else in the world do more inhabitants share this collective obsession with such a fervor. More than just a melting pot of outside influences, but a true stew of culinary concepts, the cuisine is a well-seasoned mixture of both Asian and Western flavors, each component blending harmoniously into the mix while still retaining its original integrity. In such a diverse cauldron… 
 Peachy Keen

Warm but dry days transformed overnight into no holds barred heat and humidity, filling the house with agonizingly sweltering air at all hours of the day, no relief in sight. Stop the suffering and just take it outside! Chances are that a shady patch will be not only more tolerable temperature wise, but have the added bonus of a fresh breeze wafting by. This is where compact, easily carried desserts come in handy, and exactly why I share a…

 ISO: 500 calories or less lunches 
 Andi 20 Jun 2012 | 11:45 am Do you have recipes for 500 calories or less meals, entrees or packed lunches on your blog or have run across a source that does? If so, please let me know! I’ve been challenged to eat 1500 calories or less a day and so I’m the search for new recipes that are 500 calories or less. The second challenge is finding ones that work well as packed lunches in the summer, meaning I’d prefer to not have to use the microwave. From the library, I picked up Martha Stewart’s Everyday Food Light, which has recipes of 500 calories or less and marked a few to try before I need to…

I had never heard of cookie butter, so I set out looking through the website and learned: • Biscoff Spread is made with Original Lotus Biscoff Cookies. • The main ingredient is Biscoff–made with over 57% Biscoff cookies. • It has a creamy and smooth structure with consistency of peanut butter. • Contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. • It is free of nuts! • Biscoff Spread is Vegan. I never knew Biscoff made anything beyond…

 Andi 5 Jun 2012 | 11:45 am It’s Emmy from Vegan Diva Blog and I’m excited to be doing another guest post for Lunch It Punch It. Today, I’m sharing my tried and true recipe for Quinoa Tabouli. There are about a million recipes for Tabouli and probably just as many spelling variations too. I used to love getting Tabouli from my favorite Middle Eastern restaurants but it is traditionally made with bulgur. If you have wheat sensitivities, quinoa is a great alternative to bulgur in Tabouli. This salad is nutritious, tasty, and easy to make. What else could you ask for? Oh, you want something that makes a perfect…

 Mary Helen 9 Jul 2012 | 12:23 pm Four years ago, Scott and I decided to buy a house. We were living in a small, 800 square foot apartment in Danbury, CT, unmarried, and lightyears away from having kids. Our sights were set mostly according to our budget, which was very small in Fairfield County terms. Had the real estate market not gone bananas, we wouldn&apos;t have been able to entertain any notions of buying a house at all. But between the flood of short sales and the new homebuyer&apos;s tax credit, we were finally in the game. We spent months searching the surrounding towns and cities,…

 Things to Eat in Singapore: Fish Ball Noodles and Hainanese Chicken Rice 
 Dawn Xiana Moon 27 Jun 2012 | 9:44 pm Ah, Singapore. Food capital of the world. (I really believe this.) We started this series while I was in Singapore gorging myself on local (primarily hawker) food, and so far we&apos;ve covered duck rice, popiah, Ipoh hor fun, and fish head curry. To continue, here are a couple more dishes that fill my dreams when I&apos;m back home in Chicago: Fish Ball Noodles Western meatballs are made by shaping ground meat. In Asia, meatballs are made by pounding, not grinding. The end result? Chinese meatballs have a smooth texture wholly unlike their American cousins. It&apos;s common in Singapore to find this style…

 Seasonal Cherry and Almond Traybake 
 Ren 8 Jul 2012 | 3:49 am I love English cherries and I have just started to see some becoming available. I also have a fail-safe recipe for a traybake, given to me by my mother, which is so adaptable that it’s the only traybake recipe you’ll ever need. This recipe uses a glass of very mild oil, such as vegetable oil or a light olive oil instead of butter, which keeps the bake really moist and lots of eggs. It also just keeps on getting better each day and keeps well for up to five days, though I guarantee it won’t last that long. More... 
 Flavourful ‘One Pot’ Cooking with Marco Pierre White 
 Ren 4 Jul 2012 | 8:19 am Whenever I go along to a cookery class or a food event I go with the intention of learning something. In most cases, the tutor or teacher has acquired a certain level of knowledge and is keen to pass it on. In the case of my recent masterclass for food bloggers and writers with Marco Pierre White, we had the added benefit of being shown three recipes by a British chef, who by the age of 33 had been awarded three Michelin stars. That’s quite something and it was certainly a privilege to be invited into Marco’s kitchen More...

Marco has been working with Knorr UK for some time time and wholeheartedly advocates the use of stock cubes or stock pots for home cooking.

However, I had been meaning to try a recipe from Nigella Express for some time called‘Nectarine and Blueberry Galette’and so a packet was bought and earmarked. The disappointment was that my nectarines were not yet at their best and so were quite tart. Too tart for a tart, even. They would have required so much sugar that they would have made the pastry look much less calorific in comparison. But, I did have some British strawberries that were More...

 Ivy Larson 9 Jul 2012 | 3:13 am Casseroles are a groovy thing. You spend 5 minutes or so mixing a bunch of ingredients together in a bowl, then you pop the whole concoction in the oven and in about 30 minutes Voila! Dinner is done. As far as I am concerned a casserole ranks right up there with the most genius of [...] 
 The Truth About Cholesterol and a Heart Healthy Diet 
 Andrew Larson MD, FACS, FASMBS 2 Jul 2012 | 3:48 am   Let’s face it: the subject of cholesterol is a bit confusing. When you consider that over 13 million Americans take drugs to control their cholesterol and yet 50% of people with normal cholesterol still have heart attacks, it starts to make you wonder what the truth about cholesterol really is. (1) The Cholesterol [...]

 Don&apos;t Ban My Beverage! 
 James Kiester 27 Jun 2012 | 4:13 pm -Back in 2008, New York City&apos;s restaurants were barred from using most frying oils containing trans fats, and had to eliminate the trans fats from all of their foods by July of that year. In a similar vein, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is proposing to ban the sale of sugary soda and other sweetened drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces by restaurants, movie theaters, street vendors and stadium concession stands. Before you shrug and say, &quot;Well, that&apos;s New York, not my town,&quot; you should know that, inspired by NYC Mayor Bloomberg, Cambridge Massachusetts&apos; mayor is… 
 The Rock, Wood Fired Pizza&amp;Spirits: A Review 
 James Kiester 31 May 2012 | 1:30 pm -Note:I didn&apos;t learn, until I began writing this review, that The Rock, Wood Fired Pizza&amp;Spirits is part of a chain occupying Canada, Colorado, Washington, and Oregon.  However, while I don&apos;t typically review chain restaurants, there are only 2 The Rock, Wood Fired Pizza&amp;Spirits in all of Oregon, so I figure it&apos;s not as if I&apos;m reviewing the local Red Robin or Olive Garden.-Review:Near the east edge of Hillsboro, Oregon, smack in the center of blocks of middle to upper income high-density housing, there sits an outdoor mall known as The Streets of Tanasbourne.

 Combat Cancer By Eating Healthy - A Guest Post By Jillian 
 James Kiester 23 May 2012 | 3:28 pm -Those who know me, or who have read this blog for any length of time, know that I&apos;m a pleasure eater.  As such, I&apos;ll never be a health food extremist; I enjoy my red meat, bacon, cheese, eggs, and pate way too much to expunge them from my diet.  That being said I&apos;m 42 years old, and I recognize the need to eat sensibly, and even proactively, in order to maintain good health. A diet which includes salads, citrus, oil rich fish, and fiber is not only important to maintain, but can also be delicious.Believing this as I do, when Complementary Medicine Advocate,… 
 To Tip Or Not To Tip: That Is The Question 
 James Kiester 14 May 2012 | 5:00 pm -Whether &apos;tis nobler in the mind to suffer the lags and cold food of outrageous service, or to tip those only who have performed their duties well, and by doing so reward the deserving?OK, flowery Shakespearean dialects aside, the question, of whether to tip, is one which I&apos;ve devoted quite a bit of time to. Honestly, I&apos;m not a very fiscally liquid person. Thus, I don&apos;t throw my money around willy nilly.  That being said, I recognize the fact that waiting tables is a very arduous job.A server may wait on as many as ten tables per hour for eight hours. If each… 
 Richi&apos;s Tacos Truck: A Review 
 James Kiester 27 Apr 2012 | 3:49 pm -Food bloggers, including this one, have a habit of writing about what&apos;s new in the food world.  We love reviewing the newest restaurant, or giving our take on the latest culinary fad. However, we too often ignore what&apos;s been dangled under our our noses for years, or even decades.Since I began using public transportation in the early 90s, long before food trucks were &quot;the in thing,&quot; I remember seeing Richi&apos;s Tacos truck parked one hundred, or so, feet from Beaverton&apos;s Transit Center (public bus and train hub).Bustling commuters board and deboard, buses servicing over a…

 Photo of the Week: Chocolate Tacos at TBEX in Keystone, CO 
 Erin De Santiago 5 Jul 2012 | 2:20 pm During the recent TBEX (Travel Bloggers Exchange conference) in Keystone, Colorado, the opening night party featured the most impressive chocolate pastry display by chef Ned Archibald of Keystone Resorts. There were a number of other fascinating creations, but I have to say the tacos were definitely my favorite (probably my subconscious craving for good Mexican food).

 New Ice Monster Shaved Ice Opens in Taipei, Taiwan 
 Brett Domue + 11 Jun 2012 | 1:24 pm A couple of weeks ago, we heard the bad news that Yongkang 15, the mango shaved ice establishment that replaced the venerable Ice Monster on Yongkang Street in 2010, had closed it’s doors.  This was quite a shock, especially considering that Taiwan was in the middle of mango season, the best time to visit for a mango shaved ice. It turns out, the news isn’t quite as bad as it appeared! While heading out to On Tap for some fish and chips the other night with some coworkers, I was surprised to see a huge line of people waiting for something on Section 4, Zhongxiao East Road, just… 
 Festival Dei Birrai Eretici – Craft Beer Festival in Bologna, Italy 
 Brett Domue + 21 May 2012 | 10:35 am When I think about Italy, usually great food and wine are the first things that come into my mind.  However, being the inquisitive soul that I am, I wanted to find out if there is good craft beer as well. Last week, Erin and I were in Bologna, Italy for the BlogVille project, sharing an apartment with a great group of travel bloggers from the US (Oregon), Australia, and Venezuela.  Up until one of the last nights, my search for beer had not been very thorough. I do have to admit that I got caught up in the tradition of enjoying some of the wines of Emilia Romagna with our meals, and… 
 Photo of the Week: Tagliatelle Pasta in Bologna, Italy 
 Erin De Santiago 20 May 2012 | 9:55 am Without a doubt, one of the“must try”specialties of the Bologna region is traditional Tagliatelle pasta with Bolognese sauce. I have a much deeper respect for fresh pasta making and the skill that goes into creating something that looks so simple after visiting Bologna and taking a pasta making course. Tagliatelle are 7-8mm wide and the key to purchasing this pasta is the nest. After preparation, Tagliatelle should be stored in a fresh environment and made into“nests”which allow the air to go through them. On the market street in Bologna, countless stores offer…

 Guess Where I Am? 
 The Vamp 9 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am If all has gone according to plan, I am currently in Maine, land of lobsters, blueberries and beautiful rocky coastal beaches. I understand that the state also offers opportunities for whale and puffin watching, but I think I&apos;ll put a pin in those two activities. Instead, perhaps, I&apos;ll choose to ruin my manicure by going on a clam digging expedition on the shoreline. Then again, I do like my manicure and it would be nice to help the local economy by supporting Maine&apos;s clam digging professionals. Hmmm... Well, we&apos;ll see what happens on the clam front, but I can assure you that lobster and… 
 Summer of Ceviche 
 The Vamp 7 Jul 2012 | 2:59 pm On scorching days, my fancy usually turns to oysters, ice-cold, lightly briny beauties splashed with tart shallot mignonette. This summer, oysters have been had, but a new seafood favorite has emerged as well -- ceviche. Just a few weeks ago, I reveled in a bowl of Ecuadorian Shrimp Ceviche at Sunset Park&apos;s El Tesoro Ecuatoriano. Unlike any rendition I&apos;d had before, this irresistible ceviche featured tender shrimp floating in a tomato-lime chilled soup, topped with a shower of fresh popcorn and fruity hot sauce. I was enthralled. Two bites in, and I was officially hooked on ceviche -- and I… 
 Revisiting Sunset Park&apos;s Little Latin America 
 The Vamp 22 Jun 2012 | 7:40 am What&apos;s the point of enjoying the glories of an ethnic neighborhood&apos;s culinary options if you don&apos;t have friends in tow? Intrepid eaters only apply. So, when considering a day of nibbling Latin American-style in Sunset Park, I grabbed a group of fine foodie pals -- including Max, who just happens to be the editor of Serious Eats New York. Here&apos;s his report: &quot;A Sunset Park Food Crawl: Beyond the Taco&quot; And, FYI, he may have been particularly enthralled by the non-taco options on our tour, but I was taken by the wee tasty tacos at Taqueria El Maguey, pictured above. Small, but exploding with… 
 A Pok Pok On Your House! 
 The Vamp 19 Jun 2012 | 6:07 pm I wasn&apos;t expecting it, but Pok Pok NY lived up to the hype. Mind you, I didn&apos;t endure the de rigeur two hour wait to get a table. A VIP connection whittled it down to a half-hour. Unfair? Yes. But, that sort of magic only works once and now -- dammit -- I want to go back and I&apos;ll have to give up two hours of my life to do so. Still, I have to say that the food was spectacular. Rustic, flavorful and nothing like your typical neighborhood Thai joint, even if your go-to Thai joint is Sripraphai. As any devoted New York City foodie knows, Pok Pok NY is a spin-off of the legendary Northern Thai… 
 Windy City Ramble - Part 4 
 The Vamp 11 Jun 2012 | 5:23 pm I know what you&apos;re thinking: Where&apos;s the Windy City glam? Hot dogs, ham sandwiches and crawfish aside, where is the culinary spectacle?!? First off, let me say that Hot Doug&apos;s Chicago-Style Dog, Butcher&amp;Larder&apos;s Homemade Ham Sandwich and Blue Bayou&apos;s Crawfish Boil were spectacles unto themselves -- albeit sans gourmet finery. I may have skipped out on the city&apos;s molecular gastronomy glitz and showmanship, but I got plenty of elegant eats, including White Sturgeon Caviar with Blini, Creme Fraiche, Chopped Egg, Red Onion and Capers. As pictured above, this grand nosh was had at Pops for…

 Umami Burger – Costa Mesa 
 DanGarion 7 Jul 2012 | 10:39 am I’d heard the praises of Umami Burger for a couple of years now, but since they were in Los Angeles I never had the chance to try them, until now. Umami Burger has been going through an expansion and with their expansion they recently opened up in Costa Mesa at The Camp. What I can tell you is Umami Burger is a burger experience you have to try yourself because it’s just so damn good.So here is what we ordered.Umami Burger, Tempura Onion Rings $3The Tempura Onions were pretty big and held up well for tempura, I think there was something about malt on the menu about them but… 
 Interesting Sous Vide Project On Kickstarter

A simple sous vide device that attaches to your pot and will do the work of keeping the temperature right and keeping the water moving as it cooks your food.If you have never backed a Kickstarter project before it’s actually pretty neat. You are investing in the process of getting the item, service, etc. to market and… 
 Tacos Jalisco 
 DanGarion 20 Jun 2012 | 12:56 pm A couple weeks back Mrs. DanGarion gave in and let me have Mexican food for dinner so we walked over to our local Tacos Jalisco in Orange and had some good food. I didn’t get a picture of her chicken chimichunga but let’s just say I think it had it’s own zip code. I on the other hand decided to try out one of their newest specials on their menu, Comalada.Comalada is carne asada and chorizo, served with cactus, beans, a huge chunk of Mexican cheese, salsa, and tortillas. I’m unsure if this is the official Jalisco dish or not, I’m hoping one of my fellow food…

As I waited for my food I talked with two of the guys that seem to be running the show to find out a little about their smoked meats. We talked about the difficulty in finding good quality beef ribs in Southern California that match the quality and quantity of meat you get on ribs in Texas as well as the lack of full shoulder cuts of pork at grocery stores here. They primarily use pecan, hickory, and apple wood sourced from friends and others that they know in…

TITLE: A Girl and Her Pig: Recipes and Stories AUTHOR: April Bloomfield PUBLISHER: Ecco CUISINE: Meat Featured Ingredient: Pork Belly Pork belly is a boneless cut of fatty meat derived from the belly of a pig. Pork belly is popular in Asian cuisine, and forms a part of many traditional European dishes such as the Alsatian Choucroute garnie, the Swiss Berner Platte, and the German Schlachtplatte.

 Grilling and Butter. A Perfect Combination. 
 CBM 10 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am  Some things are just made to go together. I’m going to come right out and say it. Right at the beginning of this post. Just so there can be no confusion. I am not a fan of butter on my grilled food. So much so, that I shun the Ruth’s Chris Steak House chain because I can’t come to grips with the butter they top their steaks with. No, it’s not a phobia. It’s just a preference. I’ve always believed that if something is seasoned properly and cooked just right, there would be no reason to throw an extra glob of fat onto it just to make it palatable. But, something happened this…

 Banana Split Ice Cream Cake 
 Michelle 11 Jul 2012 | 9:01 pm You had to have an inkling as to what was up my sleeve this week when I added both strawberry and pineapple ice cream toppings to my collection of hot fudge and salted caramel, right? During the summer, strawberry + hot fudge + pineapple can only equal one thing–banana splits! This cake is no ordinary banana split…it’s a banana split on some serious, serious steroids. It’s a sky-high ice cream“cake”that starts with an Oreo crust, is topped with sliced bananas, strawberry ice cream, strawberry sundae topping, chocolate ice cream, hot fudge sauce,… 
 Homemade Pineapple Ice Cream Topping

After sharing my favorite ice cream recipes, then a strawberry ice cream topping, I’m rolling out a fabulous homemade pineapple topping. Pineapple isn’t one of the most common sundae toppings (at least, not in my little corner of the world, a.k.a.“the bubble”), but everyone knows that pineapple topping is an absolute must when it comes to making a killer banana split. I have seen some store-bought versions in the store before, but unfortunately, just as in the case with the strawberry toppings, corn syrup and high…

Ever since getting my ice cream maker in late 2008, I have been addicted to trying new flavors and am constantly finding new favorites. I honestly feel like I could make a different flavor every week and (1) never run out of new flavors to try; and (2) never get tired of eating freshly churned homemade ice cream! Since I’ve been actively making ice cream for almost four years now, many of my favorite flavors have found their way to the… 
 Salted Espresso Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies 
 Michelle 5 Jul 2012 | 9:20 pm Many of you know that my quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie ended years ago when I discovered the Thick and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe. It’s the ultimate when it comes to chocolate chip cookies and as far as I’m concerned, no other cookie can hold a candle to it. Not long after I settled on that recipe I found my favorite chewy oatmeal-raisin cookie. I’ve thought multiple times about some different variations on that oatmeal cookie, but hadn’t gotten down to it until now. One of my Chief Culinary Consultant’s favorite cookies is an…

 Le Souk: Moroccan Flair in Hong Kong 
 Ambra Meda 12 Jul 2012 | 6:00 am While in Hong Kong, Italian born Ambra Meda makes the decision to eat Moroccan food cooked by a Nepalese chef. It doesn’t get more international than that. By Ambra Meda While we stroll up and down Elgin Street, the heart of Soho in Hong Kong, a little mist whitens the air, cocooning the groups of people gathered outside the clubs in an enthralling atmosphere. Suddenly a sound barges in. Shouts are coming from the opposite sidewalk: an Asian Elvis Priesley is playing guitar with a funny character who sings along his notes.“Come on over”, he screams as he meets our gaze. 
 Buffalo Chicken Meatballs with Blue Cheese Polenta 
 Amber Massey 11 Jul 2012 | 1:00 pm Amber Massey with a creatively healthy play on the taste of buffalo wings. By Amber Massey This is my healthy play on the taste of buffalo wings, and oh how good they are.  I recollect on the last time I ate buffalo wings- the boneless kind, because even if it is delictable for my tastebuds- It is still chicken, and chicken on the bone is even worse than regular chicken.  I have no real reason for my demise of chicken (for the most part.. because, after all- if it is on Chocolate Broccoli, I have in fact eaten it.) I am in fact a sucker for a good meatball.  Even the classic grape… 
 Chocolate Roll with Raspberries 
 Tamara Novakoviç 11 Jul 2012 | 12:00 pm Rolls are one of those simple cakes that can look fancy and serve as coffee cake on any given day or as a fancy dessert. By Tamara Novacoviç Rolls, or as we call them in Croatia–“roulade”–are one of those simple cakes that can look fancy and serve as coffee cake on any given day or as a fancy dessert. They consist of light and“airy”rolled sponge and filling of your own choice. This sponge is basically made of only eggs, flour and sugar. Sometimes leavening agent is added and cocoa for chocolate ones.  It’s important to beat eggs with sugar… 
 Fruit Chaat – A Popular North Indian Street Food

By Dassana Amit Fruit Chaat is a popular street food of North India and Pakistan. Here the fruits are tossed with some spice powders and the result is a bowl of fresh fruits with a hint of spice and tang. They are quite different from your regular fruit salad. Also, along with fruits, tubers like sweet potatoes and regular potatoes are also added to the fruit chaat. The spice powders that are mainly used are: chaat masala powder roasted cumin powder red chili… 
 Kid Friendly Pesto with Sunflower Seeds 
 Erin Taylor 11 Jul 2012 | 10:00 am An easy, kid-friendly pesto recipe that replaces nuts with sunflower seeds to avoid allergy concerns. By Erin Taylor–Photo by Michal Bazak via Flickr Basil loves a hot day. Give it lots of sun and a little bit of water, and it will often reward you with high productivity. Not so with middle schoolers. I’m just close enough to being thirteen to remember that everything seemed hard, especially heat. I also remember that my favorite activity at camp was called “free-play,” a glorious hour during which we got to choose what we wanted to do. My friends and I usually chose to make…

 Momo Mania in Queens: The Meat and Heat Edition 
 Tina Corrado 2 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am The steamed beef momo from the Potala Fresh Food street cart in Jackson Heights, Queens. Photo by Tina Corrado. It was a sweltering evening in late June, and our mission was to eat our way through all 16 momo joints in the “Himalayan Heights” section of Jackson Heights and Woodside, Queens. Outfitted with loose-fitting clothing, a bandanna and an empty belly, I was prepared to get momo-fied. Our guide, veteran food blogger Jeff Orlick, handed us a hand-drawn map of the area (it’s a keeper) and nudged us along from one tiny storefront to another. With a spray bottle in one hand, Jeff… 
 Newtown: Hummus Worth Trekking to Try 
 Kit Dillon 27 Jun 2012 | 2:00 am The sabich hummus plate with an order of extra falafel at Newtown in East Williamsburg. Photo by Kit Dillon. In a city that fetishizes hidden and authentic food, Newtown is a true gem. This modest, all-vegetarian Mediterranean restaurant elevates hummus from a simple side dish to a specialty that’s worth trekking to East Williamsburg to try. Maybe it’s a sign of the times (and the neighborhood) that I was first taken here by a friend while helping to convert the top floor of a warehouse into a live-and-work art studio. It’s hard not to sense the fixed-gear encroachment of greater… 
 Exploring the Vegan Food of Korea’s Buddhist Monks

New Yorkers know kimchi, table-side barbecue and other mainstays of Korean cuisine, but few are familiar with the vegan cooking traditions long nurtured in Korean Buddhist temples. At the Taste of Korean Temple Food on June 12, the healthy vegan fare eaten by Korean Buddhist monks was the focus of a night of food and education hosted by the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Cultural Service New York. Korean monks eat only the minimum amount of food required to keep their…

At the seventh annual Taste of LIC in early June, Queens’ culinary creativity and diversity were again on display. More than 50 Long Island City– and Astoria-based restaurants and food businesses took part in the annual event, which benefits The Chocolate Factory, a local theater. Astoria’s Pachanga Patterson was on hand, serving up mildly spicy pork shoulder tacos with ancho chilis, garlic and onion served on fresh tortillas from Queens’ own Tortilleria Nixtamal.

 Flushing’s Ganesh Temple Canteen: Food Worthy of Worship 
 Chitra Agrawal 1 Jun 2012 | 2:00 am The facade of the Ganesh Temple in Flushing, Queens, illuminated at night. Photo by Chitra Agrawal. You may not think of an Indian temple as a dining destination, but the no-frills canteen in the basement of the Ganesh Temple in Flushing, Queens, will make you think again. Growing up in a Hindu household, I had my fill of temple food, but this canteen puts most of that to shame. What’s more, you don’t have to spend much to sample widely from the menu here. The canteen specializes in South Indian cuisine—particularly dishes from the state of Tamil Nadu. On weekdays, you’ll get your…

My guide to this DIY ribbon backdrop is a perfect example of how to make something simple, elegant and fun. What’s more simple and cheap than streamer and ribbon? They’re perfect to use for parties and weddings. I made mine for a bridal shower and I loved it so much that I kept it up for a week. The bride liked it so much that she asked me to box it up for her and she ended up using it as a back drop for the DJ stand at her wedding. I love how stunning this project turned out. It saved me a… 
 Banana Peanut Butter Oatmeal Smoothie

All you do is put all 5 ingredients into a blender and purée. It honestly takes less than 5 minutes and you will have a great start to your day. This smoothie is one that I crave and when I make it, I triple it and pour into batches to freeze. I pull it out in the morning and let it thaw on my way to work; It keeps me full and alert for much of the day. Sometimes, I even pour a glass for dinner if I just want something light, but filling.

But not just any party. She’s throwing her son, Deklan, a party for his 2nd birthday, and I am super excited about it. As a surprise for him, I made these cute, little, jungle inspired cupcakes to match the theme of his bedroom. I like to show my friends how special their families are to me by making cupcakes myself, instead of buying generic ones from the store. They were quick and easy to make.

 Petite French Cakes with an Orange Crème 
 admin 22 Jun 2012 | 9:29 am Note: There is a print link embedded within this post, please visit this post to print it. As I have mentioned before in my Chicken a l’Orange recipe, I am blessed to have spent some time abroad. Paris was one of my favorite food destination spots, behind Puerto Rico. However, I think if Jason and I decided to take a romantic trip back to France, it would now over rank our PR foodie travels. Now, I only say this because I have a different appreciation for food, then I did when I was 19. One of my favorite little treats in Paris were little madeleines. They were soft and spongy, with just… 
 Chicken in a Mushroom Mustard Hollandaise Sauce 
 admin 13 Jun 2012 | 5:18 am Note: There is a print link embedded within this post, please visit this post to print it. Summertime in the kitchen is all about light, bright flavors that won’t weigh you down. The last thing you want is a heavy meal sitting in your tummy on a super-hot summer night. My mushroom mustard sauce is vinegar based and thinner than a traditional sauce, similar to a french hollandaise sauce. This short recipe will get you in and out of the kitchen just in time for you to change into your swimsuit and take a dip in the pool before the sun sets. Enjoy! Ingredients: 2 boneless, skinless chicken…

 Stupidly Easy Desserts with 5 Ingredients or Less 
 Katie 11 Jul 2012 | 8:00 am After preparing a big meal, the last thing that comes to mind of a tuckered out chef is dessert. It’s easy for the cherry on top of a fantastically healthy meal to fall to the end of the to-do list. But there are so many ways you can make easy desserts look fancy and delicious, many of which you can find on Fave Healthy Recipes. One of the healthiest options is obviously fruit and all it takes is a trip to the grocery store, a knife and a cutting board. They say people eat with their eyes first, then their mouths. Having a big bowl of fruit offers a rainbow of colors and flavors too.

 Rachel 9 Jul 2012 | 5:37 am I want to say one thing right off the bat: I am so excited about this week’s giveaway.  As an office worker who spends her 9-5 in a cubicle and brings her work to lunch daily, the new LunchBlox containers from Rubbermaid are like a godsend.  They’ve designed boxes specifically for sandwiches, salads and entrees (for me that would be dinner leftovers!), so no matter what you’re bringing for lunch, you have the perfect container to transport it in!  Check them out: But wait, I haven’t even gotten to the best part yet.  Sure these containers are great because…

Being so versatile, sandwiches are great for breakfast, lunch or dinner but it’s not always easy with a gluten sensitivity.

 Summer Cooking: How to Beat the Heat 
 Rachel 7 Jul 2012 | 6:05 am So it’s summer and the last thing anyone wants to be thinking about is turning on the oven. Sweating over a 400 degree box full of hot air in an already sweltering kitchen?  No thank you. I used to think that the only way to keep cool in the kitchen during the hot summer months was to put on my bathing suit and cook with a fan blasting directly on me.  But over the years I’ve realized that there are plenty of ways to beat the heat but still enjoy some delicious summer-ready meals.  So for those of you who don’t want to subsist on only ice cream during this summer of…

This cake represents the Superman Fortress of Solitude using White Chocolate that covers a carrot cake. The Superman logo was made from fondant and gum paste with red disco dust. I like the striking contrast of the Superman logo with the white Fortress of Solitude. 
 Magnificent Robin Hood Cake 
 Between the Pages 11 Jul 2012 | 11:00 am Share This Magnificent Robin Hood Cake was made by Gio&apos;s Cakes. The Disney Robin Hood figure looks like he just stepped out of the Disney “Robin Hood” Movie. “Robin Hood” is one of my favorite Disney movies. The wood-grain of the cake board goes nicely with the cake. I like the way the quiver of arrows is on the ground beside the bag of gold. The arrow through the wanted poster of Robin Hood on the tree is a nice touch.

But at the same time I feel like we&apos;ve always been together, and I really couldn&apos;t imagine my life without my sweetie. We are seriously so blessed.

 Where have I been?? 
 Laura 10 Jul 2012 | 5:30 am So there hasn&apos;t been much activity on the blog lately. I blame that on a few things: 1. Summer - something about the weather makes me just want to relax, have fun, read, and spend time with people. Hence, no time sitting at the computer! 2. Long days, short evenings - it stays lighter later, so I think it&apos;s still &quot;day time&quot; at 7 pm. It&apos;s usually already 9:30 by the time I actually start being productive with my evening. 3. Oh yeah, we&apos;re MOVING in the next couple weeks! Official moving day is next Saturday, but we will start bringing stuff over starting this weekend. Eeek! It is seriously…

We had absolutely no plans going into the weekend, so we were able to spontaneously join friends at the pool on Saturday afternoon, where I discovered that 105 degrees is the exact perfect temperature for optimal pool relaxation. We also joined them for dinner downtown that night. It was so nice to not have a schedule and just…

 Oysters and Love in St Lucia

He proposed on our first day there, during the sunset by our private plunge pool that overlooked the Caribbean Sea. (No oysters involved, but he did splendidly with the ring!) So since then, I have been a little more pre-occupied with life outside of work and slurping bivalves. In fact, this post will be an oddball exception to my usual oyster-obsessed entries. It’s going to talk a little bit about my oyster discovery in St Lucia but mostly just about the trip. The next post will definitely be all about oysters though, so…

So it should provide you with some context as to how rare this 5-species sampler is by learning that this is the FIRST time that I’ve ever come across this offering. The fab five (see…

 Creamy Coleslaw with Bacon and Blue Cheese 
 Nicole 4 Jul 2012 | 2:32 pm Several years ago, while finishing college in Eugene and living with my then new (but now ex) in-laws, I ran across a recipe online for a coleslaw with bacon and blue cheese.  The finished salad was decorated with cherry tomatoes and called Red, White, and Blue Slaw Salad.  I loved the idea of coleslaw with bacon and blue cheese and it turned out to work very well with my standard sweet, tart, and creamy coleslaw dressing.  The salad was a huge hit with the family, who took to calling the salad Nicoleslaw and requested it whenever we’d barbecue.(...)Continue reading Creamy Coleslaw… 
 Homemade Hot Dog Buns 
 Nicole 15 Jun 2012 | 11:43 am Yesterday I had a craving for grilled hot dogs.  It doesn’t happen often, but when a craving for a childhood treat comes on, sometimes it’s very difficult to shake.  So, yesterday afternoon I decided we would grill hot dogs for dinner.  The problem was that I didn’t want to eat store-bought buns.  I don’t eat bread as often as I used to and if I was going to splurge and eat a hot dog bun (or two), I wanted them to be good ones.  The obvious choice was to make some from scratch, but I only had a few hours and most of the bread I make at home takes much longer than… 
 My Dad’s Garden 
 Nicole 18 May 2012 | 2:08 pm One of the many things I love about being back in central California is that I’m near my family again.  My grandparents are only 30 minutes away and it’s just an hour’s drive to see my Dad, who lives in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada near a tiny little mountain town called North Fork.  I’m currently in an apartment without much outdoor space to call my own, so this year I’m trying to get up to my Dad’s house as much as possible to help out in his huge, beautiful garden.  (...)Continue reading My Dad’s Garden © Pinch My Salt, 2012. | Permalink:… 
 Strawberry Bruschetta with Balsamic Vinegar and Basil 
 Nicole 15 May 2012 | 9:46 am While living in Sicily, my diet revolved around a few main staples during the warmer months: tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, and bread.  I never grew tired of simple dishes like Insalata Caprese and Bruschetta al Pomodoro and I don’t think I ever will.  Each year, as the weather warms up, I start looking forward to tomato season, knowing it will bring plates of layered tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and trays of toasted bread topped with chopped tomato to my table once again.(...)Continue reading Strawberry Bruschetta with Balsamic Vinegar and Basil © Pinch My Salt, 2012. |…

 Indian Tacos!!! 
 Hilah 10 Jul 2012 | 12:24 pm Indian tacos AKA Navajo tacos are like tacos but made with Indian frybread (AKA Navajo frybread) in place of the tortilla. They are drop-dead delicious. (And pretty much drop-dead unhealthy due to the frying and the, uh…all the frying.) They were invented in the 1860s by the Navajo after their“relocation”by the US government.“Relocation”seems like a nice word for it, but it was not nice. They were forced at gunpoint to walk 450 miles to an overcrowded internment camp. Rations of wheat flour, powdered milk, and lard were supplied. Indian Frybread was the… 
 Quinoa Salad 
 Hilah 5 Jul 2012 | 10:15 am I love grain salads. They are the perfect solution to my inherent laziness–the laziness I fight so hard against but sometimes, like all better foes, it wins and I find myself sprawled out across the room, legs on the couch, face on the floor, watching“Video Chan 5″flashing continuously on the TV screen, and Daisy eating an empty peanut butter jar at my side. I’d command her to bring me my phone so I could call for pizza, but it wouldn’t work. Eventually, I’d die from my inability to conquer laziness and get up to eat, drink, or even pee. Daisy would… 
 Key Lime Pie 
 Hilah 3 Jul 2012 | 10:16 am Alright, I’mma be honest with you: I never did like key lime pie much. Back when I was a kiddo, I mean. It was too tart, too bitter, to lime-y. But (fortunately?) these past many years of drinking whiskey, chewing up entire raw ghost peppers, and siphoning gasoline (I kid. Mostly.) have left my tastebuds slightly dulled, though that’s not to say stupid, and perhaps that’s for the better. While I suspect that my tolerance for spice is and always has been fundamental, born into my DNA, my tolerance for bitter and sour–like most people’s–has been… 
 Watermelon Salad 
 Hilah 28 Jun 2012 | 9:55 am I started a post literally almost ONE YEAR ago that I never got around to finishing. Well, I finally did. Like, just a minute ago. Jeez. What a lazy ass. It’s all my fave-o-rave watermelon drink recipes. Interestingly, they all could easily involve alcohol. Not this one, though. This watermelon salad don’t even need no alcohol in it! It’s so tasty and refreshing. Boy! Talk about a palate-cleanser after all those barbecued beans and ribs bones you been gnawing on at the Fourth of July barbecue! It’s just delicious! (Between you and me, though, you totally could sneak… 
 My New Favorite Watermelon Recipes 
 Hilah 27 Jun 2012 | 7:29 am (NOTE: I started this post literally a year ago and it got lost in the shuffle, but now it’s finished! Jeez! Take forever! Also, please note that my photography has improved considerably since a year ago. I hope so, anyway.) Watermelon! It’s rad! It’s also in season and super-duper tasty right now. But how do you know which one is the super-duper tastiest??? It’s easy! The ripe one. But how can you tell when a watermelon is ripe??? Also easy! I’ll tell you! Pick up a good-looking watermelon, a dark green one that’s fairly evenly shaped, except for a…

 The Taste of Simplicity : : Homemade Ricotta 
 Aldy @ Al Dente Gourmet 5 Jul 2012 | 5:13 am Bruschettas with Fresh Homemade Ricotta Cheese Homemade Ricotta... The first time I made it, I loved it. Yes, as I was telling you before, I finally got the courage to make Ricotta from scratch. And since I learned the simplicity {yet delectable} of the process, I could not stop making it! The thought of making Ricotta at home came months ago, after I browsed one of the issues of the Donna Hay magazine where I found a delightful looking ricotta recipe. I knew I had to try it. And the more I thought about it the more I wanted to try my hand at it. So! I fell in love with this artisan version…

So we took advantage of this public holiday and decided to go to Puhoi Village. A picturesque beautiful place, that I&apos;ve been wanting to visit for a while. Since one of my favorite brands of cheese is made in Puhoi. Despite cool weather, the atmosphere of the village was warm and welcoming and there were children playing around and locals and visitors enjoying at the coffee houses.It&apos;s been so inspiring and interesting to see this small town,friendly,quite,colonial and rural at the same time--…

 Caramel sauce like a punch in the mouth 
 Courtney 5 Jul 2012 | 4:49 pm I used to be an optimist. Then I got punched in the mouth and all that changed. It was grade school. I had three text books tucked under my arm and I was walking down the hall to 6th period. Enter a toothy, female redhead with sharp, splintery eyes. A Goliath to my then 5-foot tall body. A freakish, oafish, pale giant who interrupted my carefree stride with a pointer finger to my chest.“I heard what you said about my friend,”she said, edging closer to my face. Sensing danger, my heart thumped through the sides of my head.“Who is your friend?”I asked. 
 30 things I know by 30 
 Courtney 29 May 2012 | 2:57 am To celebrate the big 3-0, I thought I’d take a page out of Joy the Baker’s book. I thought I’d tell you some of what I know. Half of these lessons I’ve learned by doing the complete opposite. The other half I’m still learning. 30 things I know Humor makes up for a multitude of sins. The absolute most difficult times in life can be countered by potty jokes. I don’t know why they work, they just do. If a problem arises and you don’t know what to do, take a bath. If you haven’t figured it out by the time your hands shrivel, it’s probably out of your…

 Breaking cornmeal bread 
 Courtney 30 Apr 2012 | 6:30 am In 1995 my mother learned she had stage four breast cancer. The doctors tracked her white blood cells on a whiteboard while they pumped chemicals into her body. She promised me, wrapped in her white gown, shrunken from a liquid diet, that she would come home to make dinner again. In the mean time, I learned how to do laundry, how to make eggs and how to sleep on a hospital floor. Today, more than 15 years later, we’re breaking bread. The doctors sent her home the day before Christmas. We hoped she was well enough to celebrate the holiday. She wasn’t. 24 hours later, sitting in the… 
 Lazy Shrimp and Grits 
 Courtney 27 Apr 2012 | 4:21 am Quick is the game these days. If you’re not quick you get left behind, mentally and physically. This is the case in business––and it’s also the case in every restaurant kitchen I’ve ever worked in or observed. Slow movements burn the souffle. Slow cooks get their asses handed to them. There is indescribable reward in toughing it out in a kitchen under these conditions––a place where your pride lives or dies on your ability to think on your feet. But all I seem to want to write about this morning is taking it slow. At home, cooking is slow. There is time for wine…

There is just something so wonderful about waking up to the warmth of sunshine on your face. It always leaves me feeling energized and ready to start the day. The fist thing I do after waking up is open all the windows in the house. Well, all except Joanie and Chachi’s windows. I love feeling the summer breeze flow through the flat. Outside I hear people bustling about. The sounds of children running by, playing and laughing can be heard throughout the day. At midday I poked my… 
 Sunday Snapshots: Yogurt Pastry Dough 
 Spicie Foodie 7 Jul 2012 | 8:40 pm This Sunday I would like to share some snapshots of my pastry dough experiment. Enjoy! When the weather turns hot I crave light meals. Feeling hot, sweaty and eating a heavy meal on a summer day is torture to me. To avoid the heaviness of a meat meal we eat a lot of vegan and vegetarian meals, like the one in these photos. The few times I turn the oven on during summer months is usually to bake something quick like a tart or galette. Of course summer is not complete without several batches of roasted tomatoes. Last year I shared my recipe for roasted tomatoes. I am still shocked at how…

It happened to me late last night. I thought it was Wednesday but in fact it was Thursday. Where did the week go? Between everyday life activities, feeling under the weather, and work on a special project, Friday just snuck up on me. I usually have a new recipe to share with you on Fridays. Not this Friday, I am unprepared. As I sit here in front of my computer all I can think of is how hot it is. The ice cold glass of water to my side has me…

 Chicken Tender Wrap

Ah Hah!  Pretty Smart eh…. So I bought some chicken tenders and made them like I would any ordinary fried… 
 Celebrate with some burger madness 
 yummy 3 Jul 2012 | 11:18 am Burgers are such an all American classic dish that are always made during the summer…well really anytime of the year, we sure love to use our outdoors grill.  For me, I think it stems back to being a child and us always having a bbq with all the trimmings like hamburgers, hot dogs, all kinds of sides and of course lots and lots of fireworks. Now we all know that the Fourth of July is tomorrow and I don’t know about you guys but I absolutely LOVE making insanely big  juicy burgers topped with melted cheese, crunchy bacon, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and ketchup!  Simple and yet oh… 
 Keys to Making the Perfect Burgers 
 yummy 2 Jul 2012 | 4:11 am The keys to making the perfect hamburger is really simple.  You really need to first get some really pretty, (for some of you pretty wouldn’t describe meat…but you know when meat just has a pretty look to it), well I always like to go for ground beef with a 80%-20% fat to lean ratio.  Some like to combine ground chuck with ground sirloin, the only problem I find with sticking to only ground sirloin is that your burger will tend to become drier faster and we all know nothing is better than a really really juicy burger.  I always like to use ground chuck when I make my burgers.

 Cinnamon Roll Cake 
 yummy 26 Jun 2012 | 5:10 am Cinnamon rolls to me just scream comfort.  Freshly baked, sinful, fluffy cinnamon goodness is the perfect way to start any day, especially one where the weather is just nasty outside and rain is coming down like cats and dogs.  That’s what it has been like here in Orlando.  Just ugly weather but definitely a great baking day.  Now I knew I wanted cinnamon rolls but didn’t want to actually make them, due to the amount of time it takes…you know I was feeling lazy.  That’s when I remember I bookmarked a cinnamon roll cake recipe which would be done in half the time…

 Happy Fourth! 
 hungrysofia 4 Jul 2012 | 1:28 pm I went for a run this morning when I decided to go left to the Brooklyn Promenade instead of my usual route over the bridge.  Because of the day, I stopped to take a few pictures of the Statue of Liberty but couldn’t get close enough with my iPhone.  Heading into Brooklyn Heights, I found this Lady Liberty in tree grate and loved her Patti Smith slouch as she holds up the torch–a little tarnished perhaps but very much who she is.  Have a happy fourth of July wherever you find yourselves! 
 Helado Tostado El Carmelo 
 hungrysofia 26 Jun 2012 | 7:49 am It’s been coming for awhile, but instagrams are now everywhere.  Nostalgia for the present makes sense in the summer and that seems to be the app for it.  While I love the effects, there’s something unearned about tapping an icon and adding a 1977 filter  to a 2012 happening.  As someone who already has a seventies-circa filter coloring their earliest memories, it can be disorienting, erasing the line between then and now. A few weeks ago, I tried to take the actual Kodak instamatic pictures–snuck out of old family albums, rescued from dorm room bulletin boards, and… 
 Alfajor de Coco 
 hungrysofia 15 Jun 2012 | 11:36 am In case you missed it, I posted this recipe for alfajor de coco on Devour the Blog and wanted to share it here.  Normally, having something this sweet on hand is dangerous–sneaking slivers on every trip to through the kitchen until it’s gone sooner than I’d like (or would ever admit to).  In this case, the tart just got better with each passing hour so I had extra motivation to keep walking until I could properly indulge. 
 Catching Up in June 
 hungrysofia 12 Jun 2012 | 6:17 pm I was reorganizing my kitchen a few weeks ago when I came across the Portuguese weather cock I’d picked up in Soho at Kiosk.  It’s lived on my kitchen shelves for a couple of years, and was supposed to change colors with the weather but stayed a resolute, all-clear blue.  I assumed it was one-season rooster but a move to the window ledge has brought it to life.  Each day I check  its feathers to confirm what I can see for myself in shades of aqua, pink, and purple.  I absolutely love it. One piece that would have made this rooster go rosy was the Julia Moskin article about… 
 Filloas 
 hungrysofia 5 Jun 2012 | 8:13 am I’ve had it flagged for a long time but it wasn’t until this weekend that I finally made a batch of Galician filloas.  Served year around in northern Spain, they are most popular during early winter’s carnival season.  Similar to crêpes, they’re made from with the usual suspects–flour, eggs, milk–but can also be blended with stock and cooked off with bacon fat or lard instead of butter.  The thin batter is poured onto a hot skillet (or a stone), flipped and filled or sprinkled with sugar and served as dessert.  Hovering somewhere between sweet and… 

 
 Noodle Fever 
 
 Slow-Cooked Beans and Greens 
 kt 30 Jun 2012 | 12:38 pm Despite a two-year stint as a vegan in high school, I could never really be a vegetarian. For one thing, sushi. For another, spicy beef noodles. But mostly, even though I&apos;ll happily eat several meatless meals a week, I often just don&apos;t feel that full after eating a vegetarian meal. And my meat-loving husband feels that way times ten. That said, we live in San Francisco, and we love having people over, so it&apos;s good to have some vegetarian-friendly dishes in one&apos;s repertoire. I&apos;ve long loved the idea of a simple beans and greens dish, but my versions always came out tasting a lot like &quot;health… 
 Crunchy, Creamy Big Salad 
 kt 29 Feb 2012 | 11:49 am My husband, who likes neither steak nor potatoes, loves salad. He also hates watching sports and loves going dancing. Yes, we sort of live in opposite land over here and it&apos;s pretty great. What&apos;s not so great is that with the closure of Ti Couz, there&apos;s no place near our house where we can get a big heaping bowlful of salad. You can&apos;t go 20 feet without hitting a giant salad place in the Marina, but we live in the Mission, land of taquerias, incredible Italian restaurants, oh and this little spot. Anyway, it&apos;s hardly like making a giant salad is a chore, particularly in these days of… 
 Carnitas Bahn Mi 
 kt 28 Oct 2011 | 2:59 pm It would seem my julienne mandoline is my chattiest kitchen gadget, because in addition to urging me to make green mango salad, the other day it pretty much demanded that I make banh mi from some leftover carnitas. It&apos;s going to ask for some bibimbap one of these days, just you wait. Carnitas is super simple to make—you won&apos;t find a better explanation than Homesick Texan&apos;s—and leaves you with oodles of tender yet crispy flavorful pork. The first night, I served it with tortillas and black beans, and rice, and loads of spicy green salsa. Immediately afterwards, I started dreaming about… 
 Green Mango Salad 
 kt 21 Sep 2011 | 9:26 pm Some days I will spend the better part of an hour looking through cookbooks and dying for inspiration to strike. I mean, I love me some food porn, but there is something about reading recipe after recipe that sucks all of the fun out of cooking. On good days, things come together a lot more spontaneously. Last weekend I noticed that Trader Joe&apos;s is now selling green mango, a treat I normally have to trek all the way to the East Bay to source. My mom had literally just given me a little Korean gadget that I was dying to try out. And to top things off, there was a Vietnamese pork loaf… 
 Black Quinoa Salad with Cucumber and Corn 
 kt 14 Jun 2011 | 8:59 am Continuing in the quick and easy salad vein, this was a little something I literally threw together fifteen minutes before dinnertime to prevent my husband from running out to get takeout from the truly awful Due Drop In. We tried this place once, because our neighborhood, while long on the regional Italian and taquerias, is a bit lacking in terms of healthy food options. It was a mistake, but somehow one my husband refuses to acknowledge. He loves leafy greens so much, that he&apos;d settle for undercooked, underseasoned chard and dried out rotisserie chicken (hey, even Safeway manages to turn…

 DK 8 Jul 2012 | 6:52 pm Email Print Share Tweet Stumble I have always had problems with drinking enough water. So much so that I have suffered from water retention for so many years. I am almost recovering now…well I believe I do (or as my better half quips“At least you now know you have a problem! That’s half the battle won”). I never used to feel thirsty and for long did not know the difference between thirst and hunger. It all started from the phobia of using public restrooms. But given that I spent a majority of time outside, can you see why the good habit of drinking water slowly… 
 “Garden” Burgers 
 DK 3 Jul 2012 | 3:54 pm Email Print Share Tweet Stumble Every Indian (that I know of) who makes an advent to the US, turns first to Subway, making it one of their favorite hangouts. Except for–Yours truly, of course!. I dunno whats it about sub/burgers, but every single time that I have tried, (with all humanly possible permutations and combinations) has ended up with me puking it all out later. Till date, I have this aversion to the subs and burgers I have eaten outside with no clues whatsoever to what my issue is. No restaurant, no eatery, no subway–anywhere (at least in the places where we have… 
 Fresh Cranberry Beans and Tomato Stew 
 DK 28 Jun 2012 | 3:36 pm Email Print Share Tweet Stumble I am among the rare female population who don’t enjoy shopping. Shopping for the“good stuff”anyways–like clothes, makeup, shoes, accessories etc. My so called self maintenance–in the way the current“society”of  women define the word–is nonexistent. I lack the patience and the ability to indulge myself that way. Now now waittaminute–If you are imagining  a  cave woman look alike–err…trust me, I am not there…yet! At least those who have seen me will vouch for that. I am sorry… 
 Aam Ka Panna (Spiced Green Mango Juice) 
 DK 26 Jun 2012 | 2:25 pm Email Print Share Tweet Stumble Its amusing for me in this place, at times, to hear people complain of heat (oh wow! its so hot today!) knowing that many Indians ( including my parents) who would quip something like“Thank God, there is a little sun out. I wish there was some more so that I can remove at least one of my 5 layers!”. What’s even more amusing is, I cannot take the heat given that I come from one of the hottest places in India. I was at my crabbiest best during the summer months back home and I actually believed that, that was my personality!  Advent to cooler… 
 Summer Quinoa Omelet 
 DK 22 Jun 2012 | 3:21 pm Email Print Share Tweet Stumble You know how some wives cook meat inspite of being strict vegetarians growing up, for their non vegetarian husbands? And then there are husbands who become meat lovers for their wives sakes. And then there are couples who both become non vegetarians (hey! its just chicken…not really non veggie you know) and keep it hush hush from parents back home. Well, my story is not that fancy–err…its not even a story. But I like to exaggerate it a bit, to unreasonable heights even, just for the sakes of a“Oh-I-am-such-a-good-wife”argument.

 Simple braised duck 
 jeroxie 11 Jul 2012 | 3:25 pm I have no idea what to call this dish. What I had in mind when I started this dish was different when it was finally cooked. I wanted to make char siew duck and made reference my my previous pig cheek char siew recipe. It turned out delicious but tasted nothing like char siew. So I was stuck at the name of this dish.

 Spring pesto soup recipe, from Apron Strings 
 Lydia (The Perfect Pantry) 10 Jul 2012 | 9:08 pm Yes, it&apos;s summer. I get that, but try telling my herb garden that I wanted to make Apron Strings&apos;Spring pesto soup a few weeks ago. In the Spring. No matter; my basil finally has burst into fragrance, the farmers&apos;market offers just-picked baby spinach, and the recipe feels just right for right now. If local asparagus aren&apos;t available, zucchini might be a fine substitute. This gluten-free pesto soup can be vegan, too, if you omit the optional parmesan cheese topping. 
 Fiery vegan red bean chili recipe, from Jeanette&apos;s Healthy Living 
 Lydia (The Perfect Pantry) 8 Jul 2012 | 9:28 pm Don&apos;t be afraid of the name of this fiery red bean chili recipe from Jeanette&apos;s Healthy Living. Jeanette calls it fiery because harissa turns the sweet potato, bean and farro the deep red color of fire; you can adjust the amount of harissa you use to make the chili more or less spicy. Perfect for Meatless Monday, this vegan chili recipe will teach you how to cook with farro, a wonderful pantry item that makes a hearty substitute for barley or brown rice. 
 Seven soups every Saturday: sweet bell pepper soup recipes 
 Lydia (The Perfect Pantry) 6 Jul 2012 | 9:12 pm When sweet bell peppers arrive at the farmers&apos;market, buy as many as you can carry in your basket. Trust me: even if you&apos;ve never done it before, you are going to want to make soup. Most often I eat bell peppers raw, in salads, or grilled on skewers, but I also like to make batches of roasted red (or yellow or orange or green) peppers and store them in olive oil in the refrigerator. Then the roasted peppers, or raw ones, transform into the sweetest, smoothest, all-purpose soup base, less acidic than tomatoes and every bit as versatile.

 Taco Bell’s Beefy Nacho Burrito 
 lee 15 Jun 2012 | 8:27 am I’ve been waiting to eat the Beefy Nacho Burrito for way too long it seems. Just as it was announced an supposed to begin, I was poised to eat it on day 1 and much to my despair, it wasn’t available. Today, I got my chance. Taco bell has been promoting this as an integration with the MLB, with commercials showing a fan in the stands catching a homerun barehanded with a Beefy Nacho Burrito in the other hand. Video below if you’d like to watch something unrealistic. But back to the burrito. It contained taco bell beef, nacho cheese sauce, sour cream, and“queso”…

 Simply Homemade – Strawberry Ice Cream 
 Cristina 9 Jun 2012 | 8:04 pm What I really liked about the ingredients for this homemade strawberry ice cream was that there were no eggs involved. No eggs equated to not having to precook a custard. I’m not opposed or averse to ice creams that require cooking preparation. However, what drew me to this recipe over the other two that I had long contemplated were the amount and sometimes insane quantity of eggs called for in what would seem like should be simplicity in a strawberry frosty treat.

Then, early last summer, facing a surplus of kitchen talent and the serendipitous availability of his biggest Portland building crush, Dolich opened his unique version of a tavern in an off the-beaten-path Northwest Portland nook, brought in molecular gastronomy-leaning PK sous chef Will Preisch as executive chef, and the Bent Brick was born.

 Villa Marie, St Tropez 
 Bon Vivant 9 Jul 2012 | 8:08 am Emyr Thomas visited the Cote d’Azur in the South of France, starting his journey at the Villa Marie outside St Tropez. Plenty has been written about St Tropez over the years – a place where fame and money collide that has remained on the ‘It’ scene since it was popularised in the 1950s. St Tropez can be rather manic in the peak of summer, therefore being 10 minutes away by car, on the way to the famous Pampelonne beaches, is a welcome retreat.  Villa Marie is close enough to indulge in all of St Tropez’s glory but far enough removed in its serene surroundings to encourage…

 Ligurian Pesto with Spaghetti 
 mykitchenmoovement 23 Jun 2012 | 7:47 pm  I thought I knew how to make pesto. It’s supposed to be simple and humble preparation, making it one of the more pleasurable dishes to both cook and eat. Using a food processor, I used to throw basil leaves, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese and as Jamie Oliver would say,“whazz it”, all the while drizzling extra virgin olive oil. That’s what I thought was pesto. How romantic of me. And then I read about Ligurian pesto in Bon Appetit. It changed everything. 
 Brisket files 3: Smoked Brisket Sandwich with Pimento Cheese and Barbecue Sauce 
 mykitchenmoovement 23 Jun 2012 | 4:22 pm Let me clear up a couple of things right off the bat. I do enjoy a good slab of brisket, but I don’t eat it that often, despite this being the third recipe in a row featuring the chesty cut of beef. I am also not obsessed with sandwiches even though there is an inordinate amount of‘sandwich-type’recipes on this blog. And lastly, I too never had sexual relations with that woman. But, to the subject at hand, if you love brisket, specifically barbecued brisket, and you love pimento cheese, then this recipe should hit a sweet spot for you. The inspiration for this creation is… 
 Brisket Files 2: Homemade Pastrami 
 mykitchenmoovement 30 May 2012 | 9:39 am There’s a scene in the motion picture Castaway where Tom Hanks tries desperately to start a fire on his remote isle. For what seems like hours, he struggles to generate enough friction from the spinning stick into gasping flames. But he does so and moments later we watch Hanks transform the tiny spark into a raging bonfire. When he proudly beat his chest and screamed into the sky,“I made fire”, I knew exactly how he felt. It was the day I made pastrami at home. 
 Braised Brisket with Bourbon-Peach Glaze

His fame comes via Top Chef, where he was unjustly eliminated from the competition partly based on a Texas-style barbeque brisket that he pre-sliced before service. This is obviously a no-no in the barbecue world and he paid for it by losing the challenge. Personally, I thought he would go far. He… 
 Skillet-Fried Chicken 
 mykitchenmoovement 26 Feb 2012 | 4:50 pm The last time I made fried chicken, I told myself it was THE last time ever. I followed Thomas Keller’s recipe, and aside from the mess and clean-up, it just wasn’t worth it. I know others will testify to its greatness, but for various reasons, could not agree. Now THIS fried chicken recipe, courtesy of Bon Appétit, is the best fried chicken ever! It is tasty, crunchy and juicy all the same. And because it is skillet-fried, you use far less oil. It is the only fried chicken recipe I’ll ever need.

 Guide to Italian Regional Cuisine (Part 1 of 3: Northern Italy) 
 Marla Gulley Roncaglia 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am All photos by Marla Gulley Roncaglia It’s easy to paint a broad-brush stroke across all of Italy when describing, arguably, one of the most popular cuisines in the world. However, you might just miss the mosaic of subtleties that comprise Italy’s fabulous patchwork of regional dishes, heavily influenced by locale, necessity, and intricate history. It is a fair statement to say that the 20 regions that comprise Italy could be considered a loosely stitched patchwork of nation states, as Italians often see themselves through their regional identity first and as Italians after.

 Memories of muhammara 
 Sally 18 Jun 2012 | 10:09 pm We stumbled out into the old city as the sun was lowering, the narrow streets were thronging with people all intent on visiting the souk on a Friday night–its busiest evening. Power cables, like vines in the jungle, drooped in twisted arcs above our heads; apart from these and the electric light it [...]

 Fish Taco Salad (Minus the Taco) 
 Sam 12 Jul 2012 | 2:00 am This week I’ve been reading Cheryl Strayed’s‘Wild’, her captivating story of solo-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. I’ve long been interested in the travel memoir, and particularly drawn the arduous–usually foolish–journey across a thousand miles of trail, or flatland, or through the desert, the bush, or up Mt. Everest. Jon Krakauer’s‘Into the Wild‘tempted me to hitchhike into the wilderness of Alaska (until I got further into the book), and for a brief moment (really brief) Rory Stewart had me contemplating trekking across… 
 Dansk Købenstyle at Crate&amp;Barrel 
 Sam 7 Jul 2012 | 10:10 am (via) Holy Scandinavian Design, Batman! I was shopping around at Crate&amp;Barrel and noticed that the re-issue of Dansk Købenstyle are in stock! Købenstyle originally came out in 1956, created by the prolific Danish industrial designer Jens Quistgaard – for Dansk, an American company founded by Ted Nierenberg – and quickly became one of the most iconic cookware designs of the time. Known for it’s bright, cheerful colors, and innovative design (the lid flips over to become a trivet), it’s not surprising how popular this line became. Since Crate&amp;Barrel doesn’t… 
 Nom Nom Paleo’s “Emergency Protein” 
 Sam 18 Jun 2012 | 2:00 am Last month I realized that I had spent nearly three months without doing any real exercise…at all. It happened slowly, crept up on me. First, my three mile walks to work stopped, then my 45 minute long lunch walk was traded for a meal at my desk. My weekend outdoor sojourns with my beloved RadioLab (the best!) ceased to happen. The gym? What gym. Weights? No. I had turned into a sedentary blob. As I stopped moving, I started getting more and more tired, which of course made it so that I had no more energy to move…or read.. or write. It’s a vicious cycle. I thrive on… 
 Bowls of Warm White Food 
 Sam 10 May 2012 | 1:35 pm Today marks the end of my week working from home at my kitchen table. It’s been good here, and I’ve really enjoyed drinking tea all day, sitting alone quietly, and pausing to make myself restorative lunches. This was a bowl of creamy goodness after a long morning of things not going quite right. At the bottom is a sea of cauliflower“mashed potatoes”, topped with a few fried eggs, some salt, and a pinch of bourbon smoked paprika that really brought everything together. The cauliflower mash is my favorite re-discovery, via Nom Nom Paleo. I used to make this quite often…

Also, if  you hand the camera over to anyone at all, you should watch carefully that they don’t adjust the settings resulting in all your colors being off. I’m learning! – Sam To say I’m an adventurous eater is an understatement – I’ll likely consume whatever you put down in front of me,… 

 
 Christine&apos;s Recipes: Easy Chinese Recipes 
 
 Cranberry Walnut Muffins 
 Christine Ho 8 Jul 2012 | 11:28 pm Dried cranberries can be a healthy snack on its own. They can help improve our digestion and lower cholesterol levels, providing with different vitamins. I like its tartness that will enrich a dessert or snack with more depth of flavours. As for making these wonderful and versatile snacks, humble muffins, adding a handful of dried cranberry nearly turns the ordinary muffins into a delicacy treat. Who can resist these little cuties?

 My Cookbook Easy Recipes Released 
 Christine Ho 19 Jun 2012 | 6:53 pm Finally, my cookbook is officially released ! I’ve been feeling over the moon for the past two days. Right at the moment when I received my editor’s email telling me that all the printing job of my cookbook was finished, I almost yelled out, “Done!” I couldn’t express how I feel relieved and excited in words. My cookbook, titled 《簡易食譜──精選．易學．經典》Easy Recipes－A Selection of Simple Classics, will hit the shelves in Hong Kong bookshops in a few days. Since I got the book deal and secured the contract with my publisher, I started working days and nights,… 
 Pan Fried Scallops with XO Sauce 
 Christine Ho 18 Jun 2012 | 5:19 am My family loves the umami flavour in scallops. When the scallops are stir fried with XO sauce, the whole dish is enriched with a kick of hot, producing more in-depth, sophisticated flavours that will surely make every taste bud dance. Best of all, pan-frying scallops is very simple and quick, suitable for matching with a wide variety of vegetables. I like the vegetables are just cooked, still crunchy in texture. So the whole dish is completely balanced both in texture and flavours. Oh, one more side note, I have to make a bigger portion next time when I make this dish again. The whole dish… 
 Roast Pork Belly with Apple Puree and Cider Vinegar Vinaigrette 
 Christine Ho 1 Jun 2012 | 6:29 am Although I missed the first few episodes of MasterChef Australia, season 4, as I travelled back to my home town, Hong Kong, I’m glad that I could catch up nearly all of them right now. I’ve been itching to try many of the dishes created during the show, as they all were tested by the judges, thus I have confidence in trying at home. Needless to say, I’d pick the simple and delicious ones without doubt. After watching Audra Morrice, one of the contestants, made a roast pork belly dish, an idea came up in my mind instantly. Why not combining my roast pork belly with her inviting… 
 Braised Chicken Wings with Black Fungus (Chinese Homey Dish) 
 Christine Ho 19 May 2012 | 12:32 am This is a very traditional Chinese dish. Every Chinese family will have their own version of how to make this dish. It’s so simple and humble that only use the most ordinary ingredients in your fridge. My daughter is a big fan of chicken wings and seems that she can’t have enough every time I cook chicken wings. Surprisingly, when I served this dish, my daughter picked the cloud ears first. Those little healthy black fungi seemed to be more tempting than wings. The reason is simple. The texture of cloud ears is soft and smooth, absorbed all the flavours of chickens and sauce. It turned to…

 Katie 10 Jul 2012 | 1:46 pm Join me Saturday July 14 for the last Aperi-Gelato before summer hiatus! This time around we’ll be doing things a bit differently. Though the savory gelato pairings were a hit, on Saturday we’ll be serving four different types of zabaione with a dessert wine. The festivities kick off at 6pm. Parla Food will be representing until 8, but the Aperi-Gelato will go on until midnight. A euro from each purchase goes to support the local food charity Il Pane a Chi Serve.

 At Hedone in London, Save Room for the Bread 
 Katie 9 Jul 2012 | 4:58 am “Don’t fill up on bread!”was a common warning at my childhood dinner table. When I was growing up I had a natural affinity for carbs (which has not let up with age) and I would routinely down half a loaf of Italian bread at dinner. The bread on our table was simple and straightforward. But as I grew up, I acquired a palate for the finer things in life. So it’s no wonder that when I encounter an exquisite and complex loaf I can’t help but worship it. On Friday at Hedone, chef Mikael Jonsson proudly offered up slices of his fragrant, acidic sourdough, which is… 
 A Visit to the Nuovo Mercato di Testaccio 
 Katie 8 Jul 2012 | 3:58 pm Last week, the Nuovo Mercato di Testaccio opened between Via Galvani and Via Alessandro Volta. The hideous building, which was designed by Marco Rietti, seems to be a hit. According to the Mayor of Rome’s blog, it is“one of the most beautiful markets in Rome”. While I couldn’t disagree more, I must say that the fact the building’s energy is almost completely supplied by rooftop solar panels is quite impressive. Not so exciting is the huge push to drive to the market (270 parking spaces are located beneath the market and I saw lots of shoppers parking on the… 
 In London’s Picadilly, Zédel’s Bar Américain Stuns 
 Katie 7 Jul 2012 | 3:44 pm Compared to Rome, London’s food and beverage scene moves a mile and minute. No matter how many hours a day I dedicate to the task, I constantly fail to keep up with all the new openings and judging what’s great. And what’s great vs what’s crap from a press release isn’t foolproof. That’s where interviewing chefs comes in handy. Last week I was in London working on a forthcoming food piece for the NYT and the conversation turned to recent worthwhile openings. Lots of names were bandied about, including that of Zédel, the newest endeavor of Christopher…

 In Our Grandmothers&apos; Kitchens 
 
 A Dinner Invitation 
 tinkyweisblat 6 Jul 2012 | 1:00 am My Neighbors Trina and Jerry in their Kitchen When I was growing up, my father frequently sat down at the dinner table here in rural Massachusetts, looked at some gourmet concoction prepared by my mother or a neighbor, smiled, and murmured, “Simple country food.” He meant his words ironically. Parts of our meals often came from far away. And the cooks had frequently spent quite a lot of time preparing them. Nevertheless, the words “simple country food” also contained a core of truth. At its best, food in the country is prepared by people who appreciate that simple flavors can be the… 
 Crispy Kale 
 tinkyweisblat 29 Jun 2012 | 1:00 am I find this recipe very useful. I know kale is REALLY good for me, and I find it frequently in my farm share at this time of year. To tell you the truth, however, I have a little trouble forcing myself to eat much of it. It’s just a bit too bitter, a bit too … kale-y. Roasting it with olive oil and salt (I love salt) tones down the flavor a bit and makes it fun to eat. The recipe (or a variant of it) was given to me several years ago by Margaret Fitzpatrick. Margaret lives in my hometown of Hawley, Massachusetts, and has owned a number of restaurants in our area over the years. Margaret…

 Filling Protein Pancakes 
 Ann 20 Jun 2012 | 8:23 pm I’m a snacker.  A terrible, terrible snacker.  If I eat breakfast at 8:00 in the morning I’m ready for a snack at 9:30.  It’s difficult to stop myself from snacking if my stomach thinks it’s starving and needs to eat now.  So, here’s a little TMI for you: a few months ago I changed my bc pill and it has upped my appetite a tad and also increased my water retention and within a week I gained five pounds!  Luckily- that was it, and it’s not too terrible and I think most of it is actually water weight, but it still stinks that all my clothes are slightly… 
 My Favorite Green Smoothie 
 Ann 29 Mar 2012 | 8:19 pm I bought a VitaMix a year and a half ago at Costco–I was so excited I made a million green smoothies and choked them all down.  Okay, some weren’t that bad- but they weren’t that good either.  I bought different brands of green powder stuff full of goodies to add to the nutrition in my smoothies, but I still didn’t like them that much.  By the way, if you’re interested, the best of the green stuff is Amazing Grass.  I gave it a good few months and gave up on it except for adding spinach to whatever smoothie.  And lately I’ve just been buying the…

 Good Karma Flax Milk Review 
 Ann 20 Feb 2012 | 12:04 pm I must be doing something right if I got some Good Karma Flax Milk sent to my house.  Hee hee.  I love trying different milks.  Personally, I’m not much of a cow’s milk drinker except I like half and half in my coffee.  I only put milk in cereals but when a recipe calls for milk I prefer experimenting with other products.  I have an 18 month old who hates milk and I’ve tried almond milk and coconut milk to see if she’d go there…nope.  So when I got the flax milk, I was excited that she may drink this instead all the while getting tons of Omega 3′s. 
 Elf On The Shelf Mom Guilt 
 Ann 15 Dec 2011 | 8:14 pm Yesterday a few of my Facebook friends all posted this one blog post.  It’s awesome!  If you’re a mom or a dad of a 2 year old plus- you’re going to know what The Elf on the Shelf is.  Before you read any more, you have to read this post from People I Want to Punch in the Throat.  Hilarious.  She so eloquently puts exactly what we’re thinking and yet makes it funny.  Since her blog name is so long, I’ll dub her Punch.  Punch should be a commenter on“I love the 80s”or 90s…First off–I do not have an Elf on the Shelf for my…

 Golden Vegetable Curry 
 Jennifer 11 Jul 2012 | 9:00 pm This Golden Vegetable Curry is my favourite winter comfort food, and I’ve been meaning to share it with you for a while since if appears on our dinner menu once a week. As much as I like trying new and interesting dishes on a regular basis when I find a favourite I become a bit obsessed and cook it over and over again. Especially since, in the depths of winter, this curries golden colour reminds me of the summer sunshine I’m missing. Packed full of vegetables, hidden beneath a golden blanket, it’s warming and nutritious. It’s also versatile too. You can really use… 
 Strawberry Ricciarelli 
 Jennifer 8 Jul 2012 | 4:28 pm I’m loving strawberry season at the moment. Last week I picked up 1 kilogram of delicious strawberries from one of the strawberry farms near us, and they are absolutely amazing. They are so sweet, plump and juicy that we have been eating au naturale. In fact we’re loving strawberry season so much we’re heading to the strawberry farm today to take my fiance’s two sons strawberry picking. So no doubt we’ll be coming home with a mountain of strawberries, so you’ll probably be seeing a few more strawberry recipes over coming weeks. Today we’re kicking…

Add the wonderful flavors that come from grilling the onions and the bread [...]

 Strawberry Cosmopolitan with ginger liqueur and rhubarb bitters

They’re usually small and imbued with a dense crimson color through their core–and they’re tiny bombshells of flavor. No wonder children and adults alike get addicted to the fetching berries.

 It&apos;s Play Time for the Little Ones this August: Kids Week Returns to the West End 
 Bookatable Blog 5 Jul 2012 | 5:46 am The age-old quandary of how to entertain the kids during the school holidays is set to return in the coming weeks. With London being a little more active than usual this summer, the pressure to embrace the city’s culture is all the more fierce in 2012. Set up by the Society of London Theatre in 1998, Kids Week is a London-based initiative designed to give children a taste of the magic and vibrancy of the theatre, but at a fraction of the cost that a family trip to the West End would usually demand. Now in its 15th year, an impressive 38 West End shows offer kids the chance to attend the… 
 Tramshed: Chicken Vs Steak in Shoreditch 
 Bookatable Blog 4 Jul 2012 | 6:47 am Tramshed, Shoreditch. Photo©Jason Lowe The cult of the no choice menu is upon us with a furious vengeance. Well, just two choices anyway. Mark Hix has pushed this growing London trend to the &apos;nth degree&apos; by using just one beef supplier and one chicken farm. Hardcore. Choice is so 1995 dahhling. Mark Hix&apos;s latest offering is housed in the cavernous Grade II-listed Tramshed building in Shoreditch, with Head Chef Darren Lock pulling the strings. Choose between steak that has been aged in a Himalayan Salt chamber, or chicken. Yes, really. The first Himalayan Salt chamber in Europe, the…

Never has this misconception been further from the truth than now. Having recently undergone a significant refurbishment project and a revision of the menu, Tuttons reopened in June.

 Dreamy German Chocolate Bars 
 Jamie 18 Jun 2012 | 11:19 pm Oh sweet blog, I’m sorry for neglecting you.  I’ve been meaning to post this recipe for over a month now.  I’ve already made it a second time before blogging it.  Yep, it’s that good. The search for“German Chocolate Bars”occurred the weekend before Mother’s Day.  I inherited a love for the chocolate + coconut + pecan trifecta from my mom so I knew how much she’d love these heavenly treats. I was right!  Apparently the best Mother’s Day gifts are edible . Did I mention how EASY these are to throw together?  Not only are they mom… 
 Sausage, Spinach and Cheese Stuffed Portabellos 
 Jamie 3 Jun 2012 | 9:26 pm I discovered this recipe when Matt decided to take on the South Beach Diet.  In addition to grabbing recipes from the meal plan in the book, I did some research online and came across Kalyn’s Kitchen, a site that focuses on South Beach-friendly foods.  To my surprise some of these recipes are REALLY good! And the bonus is that they are low in carbs. I’ve made these stuffed portabello mushrooms a few times and they don’t disappoint.  These are meant to be cooked on a BBQ, but since we don’t have one a grill pan worked just fine. Sausage, Spinach and Cheese Stuffed… 
 Simple Roasted Beets 
 Jamie 18 May 2012 | 10:15 pm In my experience, beets are a pretty polarizing vegetable.  I’ve heard a lot of“I LOVE beets”and plenty of“beets are so disgusting,”but not too many“oh yeah, I like beets, they’re cool.”I fall into the former category; however, my admiration for this earthy root is a newfound one.  I used to be kind of afraid of them…probably because I had never tried one.  One bite of a perfectly roasted beet nestled between some goat cheese and arugula officially did me in.  I’m still a relative newbie when it comes to beets, so I had…

 Jam making with Vivien Lloyd 
 Qin Xie 10 Jul 2012 | 5:05 am I’ve had a lot of jam in my life, as I’m sure more people have. On toast, on crumpets, in porridge, in doughnuts, with scones, with tea – the options are really endless. And I can happily extol the virtues of a good jam too – setness, colour, flavour, texture etc. But the making of jams was always so mysterious to me. I never really took the time to figure it out or read into it. I go to Fortnum&amp;Mason‘s Marmalade Breakfast and always marvel at the results. It involved fruit, sugar, heat and then it just magically comes together into a set form. And it always…

 Qin Xie 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am Recipe from jam making with Vivien Lloyd. This jam can be made from fresh or frozen black currants. Add 10% more black currants if they are frozen.

 Thirty Six by Nigel Mendham, Dukes Hotel, Review 
 Qin Xie 2 Jul 2012 | 3:29 am Dukes Hotel, St. James’s Place, London SW1A 1NY www.dukeshotel.com/foodanddrink-thirtysix.php A tasting menu, when it appears alongside an à la carte, should be a chef’s best work. A showcase of his best skills if you will. A distillation of a chef’s cuisine which visitors who have travelled should opt for, especially if they’re not familiar with the chef. At least that was what I was looking for when I opted for the tasting menu at Thirty Six by Nigel Mendham. Unfortunately what I found on the plates in front of me were, at times, disappointing.

The Bug I caught the two-wheeled bug on a trip to my cousins’ place outside of Omaha, Nebraska. They let me ride their dirt bike all over their 15-acre playground known as home. I was 11. When my aunt returned me to my parents, of course, I wanted a dirt bike. They said no. I needled the want into an ATV, like alllll my friends had whose families lived on ranches. They actually nibbled on that. My mother took me, sister in tow, to the Honda dealership down the hill to check out these machines my mother was… 
 California Coleslaw - A Recipe Swap 
 Christianna Reinhardt 1 Jul 2012 | 3:45 pm If I take the stereotype of southern California to its crazytown end, Californians don&apos;t &quot;do&quot; coleslaw. We strip the recipe down to its elements, replace the elements with fancy ingredients with some provenance, and then construct a plate that&apos;s appealing on the table. If one can leave the snootiness aside, it&apos;s actually a great method, because it&apos;s less work, and this type of dish construction tends to hold up better on the table. My take on &quot;coleslaw&quot; was not unique to Southern Californian cuisine. I stripped this recipe down to three ingredients; California endive, goat cheese, and mango… 
 Caprese Salad with Basil and Mint - A Recipe Swap 
 Christianna Reinhardt 3 Jun 2012 | 1:48 pm  It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan. --Eleanor Roosevelt Not blogging is as much of a challenge for me as blogging. These past few months, outside of work, sleep and gym have been options. I&apos;ve only just started to feel the vibe of my new neighborhood, Venice, where I&apos;ve lived for six months.

 Christianna Reinhardt 1 Apr 2012 | 4:05 pm Welcome to another Recipe Swap! As a kid, did you ever swing so high on the playground swings that you felt you might fly out of your seat or come jolting down from the thrill of it all? Wasn&apos;t that the point of swinging? All cylinders of my life kicked in last month, and I am making decisions about whether to sleep or return emails. That&apos;s native territory for me, but the kitchen is usually my refuge. It is my place where time slows down, where methods and thoughts become deliberate. Not so, this month. Our swap this month was an amusing recipe called Ham Snails. I loved the idea of rolling…

 Should The Health Of Your Business Be Visible To Employees? 
 wthompson 26 Jun 2012 | 8:57 am The quick answer…YES, why not! There is this theory that employees think the owner of any business is a Ferrari-driving spend-crazy manic. It is all Crystal champagne and Tiffany’s, right? Wrong! If your employees think in such a way, perhaps it is time to change their perception! We’ve had the opportunity to listen in on a few presentations about just this topic. During an operator panel, one business owner stated that she shares her monthly P&amp;L with each employee. She highlights cost of sale, cost of goods sold, labor expenses, adjustments, and more…Her point…

 An Inventory Management System can Cut Food Cost, Reduce Theft and Earn Greater Profit Margins 
 rmcrorie 12 Jun 2012 | 9:40 am It’s easy, and unfortunately, common for restaurants to lose money through poor inventory management practices. Beginners are particularly exposed to this cash drain, since they often do not have their financial control systems secured. But even the most well-managed, established restaurants have ongoing challenges in this area. Consider the challenges of dealing with food. First, your inventory is not like a plate of french fries at a bar counter. Most of it is highly perishable. Your ingredients have a limited shelf life, much of it less than a week, some as short as just a day or two.

 wthompson 22 May 2012 | 8:11 am At a recent conference, one of our customers raised a hand to ask a question…Shouldn’t your company be called OneToManage? Needless to say we were struck by the comment. His point: you can do it all from my.whentomanage.com. Naturally, we think so…However, we’re a little more humble than that.

 How to Cook Fresh Spinach in the Microwave 
 Hannah 10 Jul 2012 | 6:50 am I love to write about vegetables everyone hates. I’ve been getting latest favorite, spinach, nearly every week. Spinach has a reputation for being very healthy, and  contains large amounts of iron and calcium. Unfortunately, spinach also contains oxalate, which prevents you from absorbing much of those minerals. The good news is that spinach also contains plenty of folate, also known as folic acid or Vitamin B9. Lack of folate during pregnancy is associated with risk of the baby developing spina bifida. Like all green vegetables, spinach tastes best when you eat it as soon as you get… 
 Is Eating Local a “Green” Thing to Do? 
 Hannah 19 Jun 2012 | 9:08 am I’ve started listening to podcasts, especially when I’m cooking. One of my favorites is Freakonomics, where economists and others debunk common assumptions that affect the way we make decisions. This intriguing episode, You Are What You Eat 2, asked whether eating food grown locally will help the environment. Santa Barbara is in the top one percent of agriculture producing counties in the United States. So you would think that it could survive quite well on local produce alone. However, when a mudslide blocked the roads and railroads, the grocery stores shelves emptied out. Farmers who… 
 Guide to Cooking Whole Grains with Printable Chart 
 Hannah 6 Jun 2012 | 8:50 pm My Complete Guide to Cooking Dry Beans from Scratch remains one of the most popular posts, so  I wrote up this companion piece for whole grains. Since most of use use white rice from time to time, I included it. Guide to Cooking Whole Grains Note: Cooking times are approximate and depend on the age and size of the grains. Spread dry grains on a plate to inspect for insects or stones. Soak or rinse as indicated (grains in the upper half of the chart). Use a large pot as grains boil over. Pot on gas or electric stovetop: Toast grains in two teaspoons of oil, if desired. Add water or stock.

 Spicy Green Schug with Chili Peppers and Coriander 
 Hannah 10 May 2012 | 1:44 am When my 20-year-old son noticed the basket of hot green chili peppers, he asked whether I would consider making some schug. Schug is a Yemenite condiment, known for being extremely fiery. After taking a quick look at some internet recipes, I realized I needed some fresh coriander, otherwise known as cilantro. I had an errand near the shuk, so I picked up two small bunches and went to work. My son donned gloves and removed the seeds and membranes from the peppers. I let the food processor peel the garlic, added the other ingredients and we were done. Unfortunately it wasn’t as spicy as…

 Aly 10 Jul 2012 | 5:05 am You ever see a recipe photo and think“I REALLY need to make that!”and the thought just consumes you until you make the recipe? That is what I encountered after coming across the July issue of Cooking Light and their recipe for Grilled Chicken Thighs with Ancho Tequila Glaze. The photo just mocked me every time I passed it in the living room, in a store glaring at me from the newsstand and, eventually, when it was on my desk like“Aly – for the love of all things holy – MAKE. ME.”Last week, I broke out my new favorite grill pan and it was on. I do not need much… 
 Fab Friday – Holy Heatwave Edition 
 Aly 6 Jul 2012 | 6:05 am Like I said yesterday, it’s unbearably hot here in Philly so here are a few finds that might take your mind off the wall of humidity just waiting for you outside. (I’m just a barrel of sunshine, aren’t I?) Fab Friday–Holy Heatwave Edition 1. I absolutely adore these Spectator Leather Peep Toe Pumps from Ralph Lauren. They remind me of a pair of stilettos that I absolutely HAD to have from Steve Madden back in the day (and remember taking a tumble down some stairs with and breaking the heel).  Needless to say, these shoes are definitely timeless (and… 
 Roasted Tomato Corn and Black Bean Salad – A Perfect Summer Side Dish 
 Aly 5 Jul 2012 | 6:07 am This heatwave that has Philly (and much of the Northeast) wrapped up in its clutches is brutal – so much so that I am starting to wonder if I’m back living in the humid trenches of Orlando again. I walk out of the house and *boom* the humidity hits like a brick. Add to that the Sous Pug with his issues with the heat (he had heat exhaustion many moons ago) and if you ask him to leave his 70-degree abode, he will probably look at you like you are nuts, plop his butt down and demand watermelon as a penance for even THINKING that he should brave the heat. When the weather is like this, I… 
 Tried and True: Citrus Roasted Chicken 
 Aly 4 Jul 2012 | 8:55 pm One good thing about roasting your own chicken, you control the ingredients and flavors.  Have leftovers?  Well, this chicken works beautifully in lemon chicken noodle soup or a roasted chicken orzo.  I tend to roast a chicken over the weekend and the leftovers come in handy for busy weeknight suppers.  My favorite way to roast the chicken is to stuff it with loads of citrus, some garlic, an onion and viola!  Simple, right?  Sometimes I toss some onions, potatoes and carrots at the bottom of the pan as a type of“roasting rack”and add a bit of chicken stock halfway through…

 3 Truths of Menu Planning: It Doesn’t Take As Long As You Think 
 Rachael 12 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am In the last few weeks, I’ve heard from a few people asking me about menu planning–how to do it, why should they do it, and what some of the benefits are. In general, I think a lot of people don’t menu plan, because they get hung up on the idea of menu planning before even trying it out. They think it will take a ton of energy, time, and just another thing to add to their laundry list of things to get done each week. Over the next week, I’m going to share a little mini-series with you on the idea of squashing the misconceptions about menu planning. If this is… 
 Summer Has Officially Arrived 
 Rachael 10 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am When the summer finally decides to show up, boy, does it show up! Some years, it comes with a sneak peek of great weather near the end of May. Other years, like this one, it stays relatively cold, damp, and rainy until about July 5th. I’m always hesitant to start pulling out my sun dresses or shorts until around the the second week of July. That’s exactly how our summer has started. And with that, just about every person in the Seattle area, has started in on their summertime plans and are out and about. I’m no different. The past weekend, my husband and I spent more time in… 
 Six Keys To A Flavorful&amp;Healthy Whole Grain Salad 
 Rachael 5 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am The other day, I shared a bit about the diversity of whole grains, about what they are, and different ways you can use them, including as an anchor for many main or side dishes. One of the greatest things that have been coming out of my kitchen lately are a slew of whole grain salads. I have been enjoying whole grain salads for quite some time now, but after my discussion of trying new recipes, I decided to dive right in with a few recipes from the June edition of Bon Appetit magazine. Of course, I couldn’t leave well enough alone with either of the two recipes, and ended up switching… 
 The Diversity of Whole Grains 
 Rachael 3 Jul 2012 | 3:00 am During a conversation with a friend a few weeks ago, I got to talking about what I was learning at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition about whole grains. The conversation was mainly around the idea that there are so many grain options that eating rice, pasta, and bread was only just one tiny little sliver into the huge world of diversity of whole grains. To my surprise, she mentioned that her doctor had encouraged her to eat more whole grains, but less wheat, and she was really perplexed by what that meant. She thought that all whole grains were whole wheat. And I thought to myself… 
 9 Tips For Making It Through The Buffet Line Without Stretch Pants 
 Rachael 28 Jun 2012 | 3:00 am If you’re on the newsletter list, you’ll know that I spent a few days in Las Vegas a few weeks ago celebrating my birthday. While I had so much fun, one thing that I realized caught me off guard was the amount of food that was offered. When you hear the word“buffet,”you might think“woohoo! I can eat all I want!”And while that might be true, if you do eat all you want, you might not be able to fit back into your pants for your flight back home. Before I left, I came up with these nine tips to keep myself grounded in reality when I was hitting up the…

 Policy Point Wednesday - Early Intervention and BMI 
 Michele Hays 11 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am We all know how effective early intervention - that is, providing services at or before children reach preschool age - can be for things like success later in school. A recent Australian study suggests that a program of early intervention can provide some protection from the risks of lifestyle-related disease. This particular study used careful controls to reduce the effect of bias in the result: participants were first screened and then sorted into a control and an intervention group. The researchers were blinded to whether participants recieved intervention or not. The control participants,… 
 The Food Desert Project: American as Applesauce-Oatmeal Pie 
 Michele Hays 4 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am Anybody who has perused this blog knows of my love of all things pie: be it mathematical, handheld, double-crusted, custard...if it&apos;s pie or pi or pahh, it&apos;s beloved in our kitchen. Of course, pie is not health food, even on a good day: and this pie isn&apos;t either. I did, however, try some new techniques on this one, mostly for convenience&apos;s sake - they make it just a smidge better than some sugar-custard pies. Applesauce pies, a kind of custard pie, are common in the Amish communities of the Midwest, and Oatmeal pie is a common downmarket adaptation of southern nut pies like… 
 Sundays with Sparky: Campfire Pizza Bar 
 Michele Hays 1 Jul 2012 | 7:00 am What does it say about me that when I overschedule my life, I post more blog posts than I&apos;m supposed to? Well, anyway, last week in your special bonus Sundays with Sparky, I told you about Magic Banana Boats and (also pretty magical) Choripan. Our other dinner was actually something we do at home nearly every week for our traditional Friday Streaming Movie Night dinner, but it works just as well campside, with a free nighttime firefly show. At home, where we have access to all kinds of delicious ethnic breads, I usually pick up the tastiest-and chewiest-looking… 
 Policy Point Wednesday: A Word About Soda Sizes and Freedom of Choice 
 Michele Hays 27 Jun 2012 | 7:00 am News of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s Large Soda Ban is all over food advocacy sites. After failing to remove sodas from SNAP-eligible purchases, New York City&apos;s health department decided to address inflated portion size in single-serving takeout sodas. Thoughts on this policy are mixed. In The Lunch Tray, author Bettina Elias Siegel, who agrees soda sizes are too large, writes that &quot;forbidding people outright to buy the size of soda they desire strikes me as quite paternalistic and intrusive&quot; and may cause soda drinkers to refill sodas out of resentment. The Daily… 
 Sundays with Sparky: Magic Banana Boats and Fireside Choripan 
 Michele Hays 24 Jun 2012 | 7:00 am (Looks like a mess. Eats like a dream...) The sad truth: although we go camping every year, Sparky hates it. He&apos;s a luxury-hotel kind of a kid, sadly saddled with our family&apos;s state-park-campground budget. Sparky&apos;s Dad and I, on the other hand, love being outdoors and cooking on a wood fire we built ourselves. We&apos;ve learned to compromise by camping near a County Fair or other stuff Sparky likes to do, so he tolerates the open air, sunshine, and nature hikes (well, he does love the chipmunks and bats and other critters we see) until we get to the zoo or water park or whatever we…

 Confit Duck 
 admin 2 Jul 2012 | 3:29 am I think it’s high time I put a recipe for duck up here. This bird is rich in taste, tender in texture and a deep red colour; winning attributes I’m sure you’ll agree. At work we have made duck confit, pan fried breast (cooked pink and moist), terrine and rillettes. I also made some duck ham at home which was delicious. Duck’s versatility speaks for itself; there are a myriad different ways to prepare it. The best thing about it though is the thick layer of insulating fat under it’s skin which keeps the animal warm in freezing cold weather. For chefs this is the… 
 Coq au Vin 
 admin 7 May 2012 | 3:17 pm I’ve been meaning to make a coq au vin for a while now. It’s a rustic French classic that is hard to beat as a crowd pleaser; a perfect marriage of ingredients that seem destined to accompany one another. Who could fail to adore this? Although these days it’s usually made with chicken (as I did), a traditional coq au vin is made with a mature cockerel. The meat from such a bird will be dark and rich in flavour compared to a young hen, but correspondingly tough as a result, meaning that it needs to be braised gently for a long time to make it tender. So I was looking forward to some… 
 Shepherd’s Pie 
 admin 16 Apr 2012 | 10:24 am Here’s another home-cooking classic to add to the collection. It seems pretty appropriate that shepherd’s pie was a staple dish for us, at home on a sheep farm in rural Northumberland. I think this dish was traditionally made with left over meat from a roast dinner, but my Mum usually made it with our own lamb or mutton mince, which was a bit fattier than shop-bought mince and stronger in flavour; it was always really rich and filling. I’ve adapted the recipe here; instead of mince I’m using neck and slowly braising it on the bone. It’s a method of cooking that I… 
 Steak Pie 
 admin 26 Mar 2012 | 4:36 am My sister gave me a set of traditional enamel pie tins for my birthday, and as I was planning to do some classic home-made dishes I felt obliged to test them out. The mechanics of making a pie can be so simple; just make a stew, top with pastry or mashed potato and bake. A British institution; shepherd’s pie, steak and kidney pie, fish pie, cottage pie, pork pie…all are established classics. Steak and ale pie has always been a favourite of mine, a steaming hearty beef and ale stew topped with buttery puff pastry. Usually a dark, strong flavoured ale would be used for this, but I… 
 Macaroni Cheese 
 admin 6 Mar 2012 | 4:00 pm Macaroni cheese is a classic home-made dish for me. It was a firm favourite for us three at home especially for Rob who would devour mountains of it with lashings of tomato ketchup. We were so particular about the consistency of the sauce, being adamant that it had to be“nice and sloppy”. These days I like it a little thicker but still loose enough to be gooey and tempting, and with a nice golden gratin to give contrast in texture. One thing my parents did was to put slices of tomato on the top among the cheese. As a big fan of tomatoes, I would highly advise this. It gives a…

 Almond Cookie Bar 
 Ann@Anncoo Journal 6 Jun 2012 | 6:00 pm This is the Almond Cookie Bar that I made last weekend. I scribbled down the recipe on a memo pad many years ago, put it in my folder and had completely forgotten from where did I get this recipe. If anyone of you know the link of this recipe please let me know. This Almond Cookie Bar is really worth trying and addictive as it&apos;s very crispy and fragrant with every bite that makes me reaching out for more. Definitely a keeper! I should have doubled the recipe so that I can have more to share with my family and friends. Read more » 
 Pancakes without Baking Powder 
 Ann@Anncoo Journal 3 Jun 2012 | 6:00 pm I tried this quick and easy Pancakes without Baking Powder yesterday. This recipe was adapted from Angel of Cook.Bake.Love posted on her blog last week, thanks for sharing :)  The pancakes are light but not fluffy as expected because no baking powder is used and I definitely prefer this healthy version. Pancakes are great for morning breakfast and delicious with butter and maple syrup. Your kids will also love adding fresh fruits, blueberry filling or chocolate sauce and a dollop of vanilla ice cream over the pancakes.    To avoid the sweetness of adding maple syrup or ice cream, I only… 
 Apple Soft Pound Cake 
 Ann@Anncoo Journal 30 May 2012 | 6:00 pm Baked this simple apple pound cake with freshly grated lemon zest thus giving a subtle aromatic flavour. The apple crisp with lemon juice in the cake also had a lovely light effect that hits the taste buds. As I can&apos;t wait to taste this soft cake immediately I cut it straight away just after cooling down and you can see from the picture the cake looks crumbly and seems like falling apart. So please remember to chill the cake first to get a perfect cut with a serrated knife. Read more »

 How to Slow Cook Prime Rib 
 Véronique 11 Jul 2012 | 10:54 am Low-temp cooking is very popular nowadays. It has the advantage to yield a very pleasant flavor because the meat is soft and tender. It also has the benefit of allowing to“forget”the dish in the oven, making it much better. With low temperature, the meat is never dry or overcooked, time is always right! How to cook a prime [...]

 Peach Melba 
 ashmita 7 Jul 2012 | 5:37 am With peaches finally being in season and readily available at every other fruit vendor, how am I to just ignore their glorious existence? How do I just walk by and not indulge in that peachy whiff? How do I not mentally squeal at the gorgeous colour and think of the million things I can make of this fruit? Walking away? Boss, that is absolutely unpossible. If you think it IS possible, then I’m sorry but I don’t think we can be friends but I guess we can kinda sorta be friends, maybe. As always, I refer to the Kitchen Goddess who inspired it all. Nigella Lawson’s Peach… 
 Mango Smoothie 
 ashmita 15 Jun 2012 | 9:02 am As expected, we’ve been let down by the MET department. Monsoon was supposed to arrive in Mumbai by the 1st week of June, which it did, for about one day. But then we suddenly plunged back into sticky annoying heat. Its been 2 weeks since. At this point of time, I’m praying my best for these overcast skies to linger long enough to successfully bring the onset of monsoon. But up until then, I shall brave the heat and humidity with the mangoes on my side. Mango season. It ain’t over till it rains. So making the better of a humid situation, I blitzed up a Mango Smoothie to help… 
 How to Cut a Mango 
 ashmita 6 Jun 2012 | 5:20 am We start off by appreciating the mango, in all its glory. Once you think you’ve appreciated the mango enough, slice of the top. And create two parallel cuts as such. The aim is to ensure that both cuts are on either side of the seed. Slice it through completely. Don’t you hate it when the mango juices spill out like that? Whatay waste of magnificence. *clicks tongue* Now, we take the fleshy mango bit and cut it parallel to its length and then perpendicular. So that it forms a grid. The distance between each cut should be according to the size of mango bits you want. Larger… 
 How to Chop a Tomato 
 ashmita 6 Jun 2012 | 5:11 am Slice the tomato into two halves along its length. Lay down each half, and slice off the top bit. Slice it along its length again. While slicing, make sure you are holding the tomato gently. If you apply too much pressure on it, all the juices will squirt out making the whole process a bit messier. Turn the half through 90 degrees, and slice it again. Therefore making the cuts perpendicular to your original slices. I’m pleased to inform you, that you have just chopped a tomato.  
 How to Chop a Cucumber 
 ashmita 6 Jun 2012 | 5:05 am Once a cucumber has been peeled, cut it down to smaller cylindrical segments. Taking a small segment, cut it into halves along its length. Lay down each half, and slice along its length. Now, turn this slices by 90 degrees and slice the segments perpendicular to the original cuts. And there you have it, chopped cucumber.

To our well traveled readers, do you ever wonder why food is only polarizing in the western world? There is no stigma ascribed to those who“live to eat”by those who“eat to live”outside of North America or much of Western Europe. In Eastern Europe and Asia, food is built into the culture. In North America, if you’re a food blogger, you…

 A Monday Dinner with Toronto’s Group of 7 Chefs Demonstrated What is Canadian Food

Many people feel the way they spend the first day of the new year affects how the year will turn out. Birthday guys and gals are always encouraged to spend their birthdays wisely, so as to set an example for the rest of the year. Why should Monday languish in obscurity? It is the beginning of a new week. Many Mondays ago, in May, chef/owners Steve Mitton and Paddy Whelan hosted Toronto’s Group of 7 Chefs at Murray Street Kitchen Wine…

We had so many queries about that teapot after our book came out that we contacted the tea maker and ordered a quantity of these [...]

 How to Make Shrimp Étouffée 
 Jeff Young 2 Jul 2012 | 5:25 pm Shrimp Étouffée: Quick, easy, and oh so delicious! Étouffée means“smothered.”“Smothered in what?”you may ask. Well, typically, smothered in onions, bell peppers and celery. But I’m not too keen on celery, so I tend to leave it out…even though those three do form the“holy trinity”of south Louisiana cooking. I propose we ditch the celery and replace it with garlic. But that’s just my humble opinion. As long as you practice that wonderful French culinary concept of mis en place (everything in its place), then this recipe will not… 
 Summer Salads: A Healthy and Delicious Way to Stay Cool This Summer 
 Jeff Young 30 Jun 2012 | 2:48 pm Summer Salads! It’s HOT! I think it was 103 yesterday! In the summer we definitely do not want to turn on the oven, if at all possible. Some folks like to grill outside instead of using the oven. You can certainly do that. But, guess what…It’s even HOTTER out there by the grill! So, what to do? How about fresh, cool, delicious salads for supper on these hot summer evenings? I love fresh veggies! There’s nothing like fresh summer tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuces! On this episode I talk about a FREE eCookbook that contains a“family secret”recipe of one of our… 
 Barbecued Shrimp: A Classic New Orleans Recipe 
 Jeff Young 14 Jun 2012 | 4:41 pm Barbecued Shrimp Wonderful, deliciously-delicious shrimp. I love shrimp. There’s nothing like those little buggers. Yes, crawfish are good. But I can’t get fresh crawfish year-round. Shrimp, on the other hand…Absolutely. And this is a classic New Orleans recipe. You gotta try it. What’s in a name? I have no idea why they are called Barbecued (BBQ) Shrimp, because they are not really barbecued. They’re baked in the oven at 350. But“Barbecued Shrimp”is the name this recipe is stuck with. If you go to any restaurant in New Orleans (or anywhere in…

 Do not adjust your set.. relish is meant to be this green 
 Vijay Rajendran 11 Jul 2012 | 5:50 pm I&apos;m normally a fan of New York style hot dogs.. onions, mustard, saurkraut, etc. But this was a fun discovery! I tried the &quot;Wrigley Park&quot; dog from Moishe&apos;s Pippic Chicago Deli on Hayes Street , here in San Francisco. Look at that freakishly green relish and those peppers and pickles! Truly, I have found an authentic Windy City hot dog in the City by the Bay!The matzo ball soup from this deli is also very good. A perfect soup for SF summers with our cold evenings! The owner is a real gentlemen who takes great care of his customers. Interestingly, Joe, the owner isn&apos;t from… 
 Argentine Odyssey:&quot;¡Hola Chicos!&quot;

We found a charming and quaint restaurant called Tia Elvira that had an odd collection of bric-a-brac and collectibles like old prisoners shackles, guns and souvenirs from Australia and America. Looking around the room we saw many patrons digging into large spiny bodies of king crab, which… 
 Argentine Odyssey: Gustavo the Gaucho 
 Vijay Rajendran 26 Jun 2012 | 6:02 pm Taking a break from eating and hiking in Argentina, I wanted to go horseback riding. I had been looking forward to this for much of the trip. Since I was eight, I’ve imagined going to Argentina and seeing what the life of a gaucho was like. It all started with Goofy in Disney’s 1940s animated show about Latin America called “Saludos Amigos.” We were met at Casa Los Sauces by Gustavo, a man who truly looks like the horsey type in chaps, boots and the curious addition of an orange beret. We were taken by van to his house, rustic place with a newly-caught hare hanging… 
 Azalina’s Malaysian and Off the Grid 
 Vijay Rajendran 22 Jun 2012 | 9:47 am I’ve been going to Food Trucks across San Francisco for about a year now. I had known good and mediocre food trucks in DC, but the game is more serious here. The range is astonishing. They are diverse with food from French to Filipino and with many fusion as well as traditional offerings; not to mention beer and cocktail vendors. Because of my frequent visits to Truck Stop SF near 1st and Market and Hayes Valley Proxy, I figured I wasn’t missing anything at Off the Grid. I was wrong.I bumped into Azalina Eusope, the inspiring entrepreneur behind Azalina’s Malaysian. I knew her…

 Your Friday French Fundamentals: Cordon Bleu 
 Aurelie 29 Jun 2012 | 2:05 am Cor·don bleu [kôr&apos;dôN blœ&apos;] The mix-up: Sometimes thought to originate from the eponymous culinary arts institution. Actual meaning: In French culinary tradition, the Cordon bleu or Blue Ribbon was the highest order of chivalry under the Bourbon kings, and has since come to denote exceptional talent, particularly for cooks. Food for thought: Cordon bleu also refers to a breaded chicken dish, which, despite its name, was likely developed in the United States. Have you come across some unruly French words?

 Your Friday French Fundamentals: Joie de Vivre 
 Aurelie 8 Jun 2012 | 4:05 am joie de vi·vre [ʒwa də vivrə] The mix-up: Often used to express a carefree exuberance, implying excess.

Food for thought: What better way to celebrate life than to gather around good food? Have you come across some unruly French words?

Know the jargon When you see the term demonstration-style to describe a cooking class, expect to sit back and watch the instructor prepare dishes. With this type of culinary entertainment, your interaction will typically be limited to sampling the food that was prepared for you. A reference to hands-on/in kitchen training suggests that you will learn cooking techniques that you can replicate back home. If you go as a… 
 Your Friday French Fundamentals: La Mise en Place 
 Aurelie 1 Jun 2012 | 3:05 am mi·se en pla·ce [miːz ɒ plas] The mix-up: Often dismissed as fancy French terminology that should be reserved to a professional kitchen. Actual meaning: Preparing all the ingredients necessary for a dish before combining and/or cooking them. Food for thought: With practice, la mise en place allows for a smoother cooking experience as well as reduced clean-up. Have you come across some unruly French words?

 Lee 26 Jun 2012 | 9:38 am I lost it with coeliac disease yesterday. Totally lost it. See, my OH is currently having a holiday without me and though it was ultimately my choice not to go (free spirit, can&apos;t bear to stay at other people homes, need my own space to do as I please!)

 Lee 20 Jun 2012 | 7:58 am I was just thinking back to the magical day that me and my lovely spent at the Harry Potter Studio Tour and had so much fun. I didn&apos;t eat anything while we were there as I think I ate before we left for our afternoon booking after gluten free research had been done and it wasn&apos;t very conclusive. By the time we left the tour I was a bit hungry but would have been ok until I got home. Nothing 
 Warning: Pessimistic Coeliac Mood 
 Lee 18 Jun 2012 | 10:44 am So this is my second chicken stock attempt. It Smells Lovely Problem is, I thought that by refrigerating it the fat would easily be skimmed off. I thought wrong. Look at this vile, disgusting mess. Eww That&apos;s what I&apos;ve managed to get off the top of the stock so far but it still has a huge amount of oil in it. So much that I dare not taste test it due to my fat intolerance. I fear that 
 I&apos;ll Be Honest, It Was A Disaster 
 Lee 14 Jun 2012 | 7:29 am After 14 hours in the slow cooker I assumed that the chicken stock would have been packed full of flavour. I was wrong. After successfully removing all the fat and being able to taste, it was a watery mess that lacked everything. I failed. I know where I went wrong because my old fashioned Chicken Casserole has bags of flavour with no use of any pre-bought stock, I needed to add vegetables for

 Boston’s Best Mac and Cheese 
 Rachel Leah Blumenthal 26 Jun 2012 | 2:30 am I know, I know. Macaroni and cheese is hardly an ideal summer food.  But with the rain pouring down and the temperatures remaining relatively cool for most of this week, it seems like a good time for comfort food.  Let’s take a look at some of Boston’s best mac and cheese dishes.

 Austin’s Best Desserts 
 Rachel Leah Blumenthal 14 Jun 2012 | 2:30 am At some point during elementary school, an adult who probably wanted to pull a long-lasting prank on all of our parents told my class about the“dessert shelf,”the mythical portion of our stomachs that lets us always have room for dessert, no matter how full we feel.  The idea of the dessert shelf seems to persist into adulthood for many people; it’s just so hard to resist a sweet treat at the end of a meal.  A look at our Austin ratings reveals some pretty fantastic dessert options around town!

 FoodPair 28 Jun 2012 | 4:59 pm Making perfect hard boiled eggs is trickier than you might think. While undercooking typically isn&apos;t an issue, overcooking is much more common and leads to a dry, blue yolk and a tough, rubbery white. Yuck. Here&apos;s a simple foolproof method that will produce perfect hard boiled eggs everytime.This method can be used to make up to a dozen eggs.InstructionsPlace eggs in a large pot and cover with an inch of cold water. It&apos;s important that there&apos;s enough room for the eggs to be arranged in a single layer. On high heat, bring the water to a boil. Once the water… 
 All Calories Aren&apos;t Created Equal 
 FoodPair 27 Jun 2012 | 6:33 pm Yesterday, New York Times food writer Mark Bittman published a compelling commentary titled &quot;Which Diet Works?&quot;. In it, the notion that all calories are created equal is challenged. &quot;Big food&quot; would have you believe that your body treats 100 calories of Cheetohs is the same as 100 calories of spinach. When consumed, highly processed carbohydrates cause dramatic spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels.

 Why You Should Ditch Store Bought Olive Oil 
 FoodPair 25 Jun 2012 | 3:59 pm Over the last several years, olive oil has found its way into the mainstream. Once an ingredient mostly associated with Mediterranean cooking, this healthy and tasty ingredient is now a staple in many kitchens.Rich in Omega-3 fatty acids and anti-oxidants, consumption of olive oil is linked with a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. But we&apos;re not here to sell you on the health benefits of olive oil. In fact, we&apos;re going to try to get you to stop buying olive oil -- the kind you find on the shelves at a typical supermarket. If you&apos;re buying your olive oil…

 Cheese Steak Pizza 
 Mom 20 Jun 2012 | 1:00 pm Pizza Muffins I made &quot;one heck of a pizza&quot; last night or so my husband said. I had some leftover steak from a couple of days ago and I didn&apos;t want it to go to waste. Well, the husband doesn&apos;t really love pizza, yet the girls and I do, so I thought - &quot;Why not make a cheese steak pizza for him?&quot; Apparently, it was a good idea because the husband absolutely loved it! Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture, but I hope you love it too! Here&apos;s the recipe - Cheese Steak Pizza 1 pizza crust 1/4 cup hot pepper sauce 2 cups leftover steak, sliced thin 1 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese, shredded Preheat… 
 New Refrigerator and What Mom&apos;s Been Up To... 
 Mom 19 Jun 2012 | 6:21 pm Woohoo! My refrigerator finally kicked the hay! I got a new fridge over the weekend and I&apos;m in love. Okay...not so much in love with the price, but I adore the product! Check it out - Isn&apos;t it beautiful? Now, it&apos;s time to stock her up - I moved all the food from my old fridge into this one and it seems empty... This baby is HUGE! Through no fault but my own, I&apos;ve been kind of lax-a-daisy about couponing and stocking up lately. Springtime always seems to do that to me. I start daydreaming of the slow, lazy days of summer and lose my mojo. But get back to it, I must! Especially, now… 
 Pineapple Upside Down Cake with a Twist 
 Mom 4 May 2012 | 5:37 am Have you ever had Pineapple Upside Down Cake? I haven&apos;t, well, at least I hadn&apos;t until I made this recipe. I was a little surprised at how simple it was to make and how few ingredients were involved. But being me, I couldn&apos;t leave the recipe alone - no, I had to play with it and instead ended up with Pineapple Upside Down Cake with a Twist -- a delicious, play on an old-fashioned recipe.

Indulge yourself on the run with Apple Hand Pies instead of making a traditional pie. Hand Pies are simple to put together and taste just as good as the classic dessert. Here&apos;s the recipe - Apple Hand Pies 2 apples 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1/8 cup water 2 refrigerated pie crusts, unbaked Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

As a foodie myself, I thought it would be fun to compile a list of all the &quot;new&quot; kitchen appliances, utensils, cookware and bakeware that I would love to receive for Mother&apos;s Day.

 Guide to Italian Regional Cuisine (Part 1 of 3: Northern Italy) 
 Marla Gulley Roncaglia 10 Jul 2012 | 5:00 am All photos by Marla Gulley Roncaglia It’s easy to paint a broad-brush stroke across all of Italy when describing, arguably, one of the most popular cuisines in the world. However, you might just miss the mosaic of subtleties that comprise Italy’s fabulous patchwork of regional dishes, heavily influenced by locale, necessity, and intricate history. It is a fair statement to say that the 20 regions that comprise Italy could be considered a loosely stitched patchwork of nation states, as Italians often see themselves through their regional identity first and as Italians after.

 Boudin and Cracklins in Cajun Country

Cooked fresh every morning in corner stores, bags of crunchy, golden, greasy nuggets tempt the senses. Once inside, the battle is only half over. There’s no denying yourself a link or two of fresh ground pork meat mixed with rice and seasoning and stuffed into a casing, better known as boudin. These two items make up a true Cajun breakfast.

Read below for the news highlights! Austrian artist Klaus Pichler has released a new series entitled “One Third” to expose the public to the worldwide waste issue. The title, which took inspiration from a 2011 U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization report, reflects the statistic that a third of all food products—or 1.3 billion tons of food—are wasted worldwide. The food industry creates an approximate 30% of the world’s annual carbon emissions,…

After all, her tweet about Toulouse Petit in Seattle and their delicious Pork Cheek Hash caught my eye. We then met over Corned Beef Hash at Hi Spot Cafe and hatched a plot for an epic hashcapade photo session–voilà! Andrea and Brent Moore&apos;s lovely kitchen. So where to tackle a marathon session featuring 6 different hashes? Why the lovely kitchen of my dear friends, Andrea and Brent Moore. I’ve been known to commandeer their kitchen to…

Pulled Pork Hash - a graduation hashcapade! First of all, my Mom’s house in Wyoming has fluorescent lights, which cast an odd pall on all my food shots. Seriously, this photo shoot *did not* take place in a gulag or other desolate place of imprisonment! That said, all these ingredients… 
 Posh Hashes at Gracies 
 Clark Haass 9 May 2012 | 11:20 pm Sounds like a tongue twister, posh hashes. Hmmm, rather like trying to pronounce“possesses”after too many mimosas! Or, for students of history, the way Winston Churchill pronounced the letter“s”as“sh”, to compensate for his lisp. (Don’t even try to pronounce Posh Salmon Hashes.) Where is this going? I’m not sure, but I do know that our crew experienced a hashcapade to remember at Gracie’s!

 Eat your greens! – Vegetarian veggie recipes 
 Jenny Sangler 11 Jul 2012 | 10:44 pm Mother was right, it’s important to eat your greens! Take the Southern staple, collard greens, for example, this leafy green vegetable packs a nutritious, low calorie punch, containing high levels of vitamin C, soluble fiber, sulphorafane and other cancer fighting substances. Many southern food recipes combine collard greens with meat, but that doesn’t mean vegetarians can’t get a little creative when it comes to cooking greens. One of the easiest ways to add flavor to collard greens,when preparing as a side dish, is to sauté them with crushed garlic in a little olive oil and finish… 
 Haven’t Tried Quinoa yet? You Should! 
 Jenny Sangler 10 Jul 2012 | 11:00 pm I’ve been having a lot of fun reading the Savvy Vegetarian website since I discovered it a few months ago. It’s a great source of nutritional information, vegetarian news and even some really good recipes. They’ve got a great post on there right now about how and why to cook quinoa and I wanted to share it with you. Quinoa has more protein per serving than any other grain and since we vegetarians are always on the lookout for good sources of protein, that makes quinoa a very valuable addition to our diets. Luckily, it happens to taste great and be really versatile, too. 
 3 Shocking Facts About Commercial Salad Dressings 
 Jenny Sangler 9 Jul 2012 | 11:52 pm I always did love salad, even before I became a vegetarian. But now, I eat salad at almost every meal. I don’t know a single vegetarian that doesn’t rely on salads in their weekly diet. That’s why this article at Organic Gardening got my attention quick. I try to be careful about what I put on my salads. I’m watching my weight, so I do my best not to load it up with too much dressing, but I do usually use a bottled dressing for most salads. This article may change that quite a bit. According to  author and former food industry exec Bruce Bradley, bottled dressing… 
 Flame Retardant Chemicals in Peanut Butter. Now what? 
 Jenny Sangler 8 Jul 2012 | 9:17 pm As you know, I do a lot of research (and posting) about what is really in our food, especially foods that we vegetarians typically eat pretty often. I’ve been switching out almond butter for peanut butter lately because of the fat content, since I’m getting older and am more concerned about heart health. I’m also having more trouble maintaining my weight as I age. However, I know a lot of vegetarians rely on peanut butter for the fats, protein and just the enjoyment of the taste. So, I was a little concerned when I saw an article on Prevention.com today that says there is… 
 What’s The Real Deal On Probiotics? 
 Jenny Sangler 5 Jul 2012 | 10:16 pm We’ve all seen the commercials and the shelves full of products containing probiotics. Like me, you probably know enough to know that probiotic products are supposed to help your digestive health. But what are they, really, and do they really work? I got this article from Rodale this morning and it does a great job of laying out the truth about these increasingly popular products. I had no idea the market was so huge. Probiotics bring in $30 billion dollars a year in sales. Are you being taken for an expensive ride, though? Gregor Reid, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at…

 Plump Curried Shrimp over Garlicky Spinach Recipe 
 jesslovestocook 10 Jul 2012 | 9:00 am This is a great dish for those who are wary of curry but since shrimp scampi is very familiar it’ll help you get over the first hump of trying it!  You could use any curry powder you like in this, but I opted for garam masala to give the flavors a real punch.  Indian cooking is famous for its spices. While sometimes they might be too hot for your taste buds or have potent flavor, Indian spices have several potential health benefits which make it worthwhile to include them on your dinner menu.

 Italian Roasted Vegetables over Sun Dried Tomato and Basil Quinoa Pilaf 
 jesslovestocook 4 Jul 2012 | 10:09 am This is a delicious and easy meal that you can put together in no time!  The best part is you’ll most likely have a lot of these ingredients already in your kitchen.  Feel free to add or sub any of the vegetables for your families favorites, it’s so low calorie that you can’t go wrong! You can find sun dried tomatoes at most Trader Joes or Whole Foods Markets.  We like to get the ones that are dried, the ones that come in a jar have a higher calorie and fat count because they sit in oil.

 Patriotic Summer Salsa 
 jesslovestocook 2 Jul 2012 | 9:35 pm The festive Blueberry, Strawberry and Jicama Salsa is the perfect addition to your 4th of July BBQ! Not only is it pretty, but it is full of flavor and quick to make. Your taste buds will love the combination of sweet berries and crunchy jicama. This fruity salsa has a high vitamin C content, therefore it has very powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities.  There is a little bit of heat from the jalapeño, but if you like a mild salsa, feel free to leave it out or use half the amount. Serve with store bought blue corn tortilla chips or you can make your own baked tortilla chips. 
 Vegan Spiced Chick Peas with Sauteed Spinach 
 jesslovestocook 29 Jun 2012 | 9:00 am Whether you call it a chickpea or a garbanzo bean, there’s no question that chickpeas are a healthy addition to any diet. Chickpeas are naturally low in fat, high in dietary fiber and rich in vitamins and minerals. Eating chickpeas regularly can help you manage your weight, boost intestinal health and reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Fiber-rich foods like chickpeas help promote a healthy intestine. The fiber in chickpeas lessens the strain on your intestine, reducing the risk of painful diverticulitis disease and constipation, Harvard University reports. A…

 Pesto Pizza 
 Stephen 9 Jul 2012 | 2:06 pm The other day I realized that I rarely see pesto pizza listed on the menu of a restaurant. Think about it–when was the last time you saw it readily available and not just as an occasional special? Probably not for a while. Did you even know pesto pizza existed? Yes it does! In my mind, pesto pizza is also healthier than other pizza varieties (although I don’t really have any nutritional data to back that statement haha). Since I think it’s pretty darn tasty, I decided it was about time to share this recipe with you guys! There are only 4 simple ingredients: crust, pesto,… 
 Moroccan Spiced Grilled Chicken 
 Stephen 5 Jul 2012 | 9:10 am Let’s face it, half the time grilled chicken is boring. Since I’ve never been one for bland flavors, I usually don’t grill chicken unless I use a marinade. It just makes sure the meat stays moist and flavorful. Although it’s such a simple step, don’t leave it out because you get majorly awesome results with marinades. To begin, let’s just say I was in a Marrakesh mood when I came up with this recipe. I had been daydreaming about memories of trips to Morocco, all the vibrant colors, and mouthwatering smells. Since a plane ticket is out of my budget, I needed… 
 Guacamole 
 Stephen 3 Jul 2012 | 9:14 am When I was little, my parents told me I didn’t like guacamole. They said it was gross and I should always ask restaurants to take it off my plate. Needless to say, I lost many years despising good ol’guac when I had never actually tried the stuff. Flash forward to high school. I was at a party and finally had my first guacamole experience. The flavor was so good that it created a major mental shift. I started to think–why did I never try it before? How do I make this? What else am I missing out on?! Now…I have no idea why my parents tried to train me to hate… 
 Random Video: Truvia Commericals 
 Stephen 20 Jun 2012 | 2:58 pm I absolutely love those annoying Truvia commercials with jingles that drive most people insane! Not only are the visuals crisp and clear, the song is completely catchy! Whenever it popped on the TV, I found myself singing along (sometimes out loud haha). Not going to lie…I even looked forward to potentially seeing the commercial! What can I say? I’m weird. I like the fact that it’s campy and annoying! It’s still fun! The products also seems pretty neat–a“healthy”all-natural sweetener. Although I’ve never tried Truvia, the company definitely does a great… 
 Father’s Day Mac n’ Cheese 
 Stephen 18 Jun 2012 | 10:26 am My family likes to eat. A lot. One of the things we can never seem to get enough of is cheese. More specifically, we can’t get enough of melted cheese! At any one time, we probably have at least 5 types waiting to be devoured. This proved to be true yesterday when my dad talked about mac n’ cheese to my mom for a good hour. When they got home, my mom mentioned that maybe it would be a good idea to make him some for lunch. Since it was Father’s Day, I figured a lunchtime treat would be a great way to kick off a day.  I kept the recipe simple, but to kick it up a notch I cooked it in…

 4 Facebook Updates You Need to Be Aware Of 
 admin 20 Jun 2012 | 11:56 am During the past few weeks Facebook has been all over the news. First we saw the company go public and the stock perform with a thud. Then we get to see Mark Zuckerberg getting married and parading around on his honeymoon. The impact that either of these stories will have on your business…probably around zero. With any big media push, the prime time to roll out new changes seems to be when no one is looking.  With both of these stories taking precedence in the headlines, Facebook has quietly made changes to the functionality of Pages.  While changes can be negative, in this case the…
