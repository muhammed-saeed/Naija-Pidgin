 Flag Close Post a comment Can teens really learn valuable life lessons from a fast food job? Absolutely! Despite the qualms many people have against working at a fast food joint, teens can learn quite a bit about the real world and people from flipping burgers.
~Team Work

One of the most valuable traits in the workplace is team work. At a fast food restaurant, team work is extremely important. A cashier is expected to give the correct order to the people cooking, but the cashier depends on them giving the correct food back to them. Team work teaches them to be responsible and dependable. These traits will stay with them for life.

~People Skills

What better place to learn people skills than in fast food? A teen will be dealing with a large number of customers day in and day out. Not every one will be kind and respectful. Teens will learn how to deal with people in a mature, respectful way. They will be more comfortable dealing with people over time. Providing great customer service is highly prized in the work place. In addition to customer service, teens make lasting friendships with co-workers, other working teens, and customers.

~Multi-Tasking&amp;Decision Making

In today&apos;s work place, being able to multi-task can make all the difference in moving up in a company. Teens in a fast food environment must be able to handle money, talk to customers, cook food, clean, and various other tasks all at once. Teens that learn how to multi-task early on will do better in high school, college, and the rest of the life.

With multi-tasking, comes the ability to make quick decisions. Decision making is an extremely important skill for teens to learn. Teens must learn to make decisions by themselves. Learning how to make the right decisions quickly is a skill that will benefit them for life.

~Money

Working in a fast food restaurant teaches a teen to handle and mange money. They learn valuable math skills by quickly counting change. Teens learn the importance of a dollar as they work hard to buy the things they want and need. Money skills are extremely important for a teen to learn as early as possible.

~Responsibility

A fast food job teaches a teen to be responsible. Teens learn that no one is going to take up for you. You must be responsible for your own actions. Coming in late or shirking their duties will not be tolerated. Responsible teens turn into responsible adults.

This seemingly simplistic job teaches teens numerous life lessons. Fast food jobs may not seem like much to many adults, but to a teen the experience is invaluable.

Excuse me but your article is a lie.
Now more than ever fast food restaurants are trying to train as less and fast as they can their employees. the book Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser, clearly explain that Fast Food Chains avoid to teach their employees skills; By doing so they can replace a worker easy.
P.D. Sorry for any grammar mistake.

Nicely described article about learning from a fast food job and I would like to share a site which has almost every job related to Food Services. http://www.foodservicescrossing.com is a good source of jobs because it only shows you jobs from employer websites and every other job board and the site has more jobs than any other website. You can also find food service job search, food service job description, gordon food service employment, food service worker job description, food staff employment agencies opportunities at http://www.foodservicescrossing.com. You can also track down jobs which are often not advertised, only at http://www.foodservicescrossing.com.
