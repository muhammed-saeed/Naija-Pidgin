( More ) Planning and organizing differentiated activities for the inclusive classroom is a challenge for any teacher, whether novice or experienced.&quot;Differentiating Instruction With Centers in the Inclusive Classroom&quot;helps primary teachers create exciting and motivating classroom centers that are perfect for learners of all ability levels. The easy-to-set-up centers in this book teach children social skills and also help them practice important academic skills. Each center is designed to be adapted to prekindergarten through second grade inclusion classrooms. Themes covered in the centers include archaeology, camping, farms and farm supply, amusement parks, offices, a travel agency, and many more. The book also describes inexpensive approaches to preparing and storing centers from year to year and provides assessment and observation forms for teacher use. ( Less ) 1,447 Reads Info and Rating
