 and gentlemen, just a reminder to be aware, I saw on the news where someone stole a purse from a woman&apos;s car as she was pumping gas, please lock your car even if you are right there, don&apos;t walk around in fear, just be watchful....thats all....carry on. 

 Going out for the day, but I will be on alert! lol

The same thing happened to a friend. I always lock it. A man asked me one time if he could use my cell phone. I said no and he got angry, luckily he left. I stopped going to that station. It is scary.

Nooooo! Hit the automatic lock and put keys in your pocket immediately, don&apos;t lay them down.I do leave the drivers door open, but there is no room for anyone to get between me and the car, but even so I will be even more alert now.

At the grocery store, take your handbag with you when you&apos;re returning your cart to the cart station. Don&apos;t leave your handbag on the car seat with the door unlocked.

I was at a station a while back and a man came up to me and started talking about my windshield needed repaired, made me wonder if he was trying to distract me, I did not appreciate it at all. He was legit, but it still bothered me.

When I pull up I have the same routine....observe surroundings, grab car keys, cell phone and rfid sleeve that contain debit card, exit car and lock the door. Place car keys in front pocket, place cell phone in back pocket, swipe debit card and place back in rfid sleeve and place in front pocket. Pump gas. My purse stays in the car and is not visible from outside. Get receipt from machine. When done retreive keys and cell phone from pockets but wait until in the car to retrieve rfid sleeve that goes back into purse.

I&apos;m probably a yenta for doing this, but I always warn women when I see their pocketbooks wide open on the cart with their wallet, shopping list and coupons on top. I&apos;ve always been thanked (I do expect someone to tell me to mind my own business one day but I don&apos;t care).

It&apos;s even worse when women put their pocketbooks on the FLOOR of the stall in the ladies room. Ugh and eewwwwwww. Anyone can grab that bag and be long gone before the victim has a chance to pull up her pants.

I&apos;ve gone to the public bathroom with my pocketbook hanging around my neck like a feedbag if there isn&apos;t a safe hook or a shelf in there. It&apos;s a strain on my neck and awfully uncomfortable but it beats having my bag stolen!

Be careful ladies, there is more crime out there these days than ever before. Money is tight and thieves will get it any way they can.

I get my gas at the station across the street from where I live. I always use a cross-body bag, so when I pull into the space to fill up, I turn the engine off and put my keys in my coat pocket, put my bag across my body, get out of the car and lock it. Usually park close enough to the pump to where there isn&apos;t much space between the car and the pump. When I&apos;m finished filling up the car, immediately go in and pay, then leave.

When I go to the grocery store, park and turn engine off, put keys in coat pocket, put my bag across my body, get my shopping bags out of the back seat, lock up the car and go in to the store.....get on my riding cart. When finished shopping get in line, and when the bagger is putting my groceries in my bags, I inform them I will need help out to the car. I ride the cart out and the bagger follows me. I unlock the car, he puts my bags on the back seat, and while he is doing that I get into my car, and when he is finished I lock the doors immediately, then leave. The bagger is there with me the whole time because he rides the cart back into the store.

And when I go to any of the stores, like Kohl&apos;s, I park in handicaped and do the same thing I do when I go into the grocery store or to the gas station. So, I feel pretty safe when I do go out.

Yes, I am very cautious....but do try to act normal when I&apos;m out.....think if you act scared, you call more attention to yourself being that way.

Also, when I&apos;m grocery shopping in my riding cart, I keep my cross-body bag on me at all times. It is never in the cart.

Hi Fluffy

How are you doing? Are you getting ready for the holidays?

Have not been on the boards very much. My RA started acting up again in my right hand. There was no way for me to type, tried with left hand but had a hard time doing that. The RA dr put me back on the meds again and it has starting to help me again. Enough about me.

Yes it is scary going out shopping these days, you have to be aware all of the time.

Well wish you and all others that post here a very Happy and Safe Holiday season.

God Bless

Well hello stranger.....so sorry your RA has been giving you so much trouble. Have been thinking lately about a lot of folks that I have posted with that aren&apos;t here that much any more.....you were one of them. Are you still using the Tylenol Creme? I use it quite frequently on my legs and lower spine area. Thank goodness it does give me some relief. What was the reason for the doctor taking you off the RA meds? Just curious....

Have done some shopping already, but not finished yet. Want to run to Dillard&apos;s and Kohl&apos;s for a few things, then I have to get wrapping paper, and some of those padded envelopes to mail some gifts out. Those padded envelopes do seem to work well for certain items. And, they don&apos;t weigh a lot. And, will be putting up some decorations this weekend....not many though.

Am so glad you have gotten a chance to post. Please don&apos;t stay away so long next time. More later. Take care sweetie.

Yes I still use the creme but the swelling got so bad it was not helping. He had been cutting me back on meds for awhile,to see how things would go, well we know now, so he started me back again. Hopefully they will not get as bad as before.

The grow ups we do not exchange presents. We get for the kids. The 5 older grandchildren are getting money, that way they can get what they want. I got my 18 month old granddaughter 3 pairs of pjs with feet in,that is something she needed. We get together on Christmas eve and have a nice dinner and give the kids their gifts. Then Christmas morning I go out for breakfast with my oldest daughter and husband, and his Mom for brunch. We have done this for years.

It was good talking to you!

God Bless

magic6.....Do hope that you will be getting that much needed relief in your hands. Especially now that you know you need to be taking the meds. Guess the winter weather you get up your way doesn&apos;t help either. And maybe you caught it in time now.

Sounds like you have your Christmas plans all worked out with your family. Those get togethers always make for happy memories. Enjoy everyone and have a most blessed Christmas and Happy New Year.

Yes, it was nice talking with you again too. Take care dear one.

A few months ago, I was in the waiting room for a dr appt. I put my purse down on the chair, had my book in my hand, as I was sitting down the receptionist called me back over to ask me a question....I went back - carrying my book, leaving my purse...an older lady came in, waited for me to get back to my seat.

She scolded me for leaving my purse - she said you took your book, you should have taken your purse too, anyone could have taken it and run, said it happened to her and it was an awful mess.

Of course I agreed with her...I always take my purse, the thing was I had my book and subconsciously knew I was holding something that normally would have been my purse. That happen you anyone else?

She taught me a lesson. I remember her everytime a situation like that comes up - always grab my purse.

Kind of the same thing, when I wear a crossbody bag in the car, I feel like I have my seatbelt on,lol........but she was right, I take my purse with me even in a fast food restaurant to get a drink refill or anything I need, sometimes I feel silly, but I get over it,lol.
