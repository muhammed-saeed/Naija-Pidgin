 Pest Control for Food Establishments


New York boasts of some of the fanciest, costliest and most prestigious restaurants in the United States. Aside from that, it also has amazing hotdog stands, burger areas, fast foods, cafes and all other kinds of food establishments you could ever think of. Imagine the food that you can eat here: from American, Caribbean, Mediterranean, Asian, mixed cultural to experimental, you ask for it, New York has it. This is one of the most populous mega cities in the US and essentially one of the most visited in the world.

 
Fast Food Stall
 
You can certainly expect a wide range of food options for your needs. However, some naughty critters, uninvited guests are also present in New York food venues. They are unapologetic, uncompromising, they have a massive taste for ANYTHING and they are present in the most unexpected of places.


We often see comedy movies where heroes and villains would make diversions on a restaurant by letting flies, cockroaches and rats come in. In places where food is served pests are a no-no. Only in movies can you find a rat that can cook ratatouille. Only in movies can you see an enchanted princess teach city pests to clean a messy room. Pests in real life are not your kind of guests in a restaurant. A five star hotel with sanitation and pest control issues can simply get condemned. Pests are cruel things in a restauranteur&apos;s life. The most common pests are rats, cockroaches, flies, ants and other insects that thrive on heat, on food, on organic matter. They will be there because just like your exclusive customers, they love to eat.


There is a strict sanitation and cleanliness rule for restaurants and food establishments that they have to comply with by law. If well executed, the restaurants and fast food chains are assured to be clean. Cleanliness is not only on the customer&apos;s side. Inspectors check the tiniest cracks where ants and cockroaches can enter. They will check if the food storage is efficient. They will see if your meat stocks are clean as well. From utensils to the workstations, everything needs to be perfect. It is food we are talking about and if the area where you make the food is dirty, you are assured that insects and nasty critters can thrive there. If you do not take care of your wet trash, imagine the kinds of organisms that can thrive in those areas.
 
Food Establishment
 

Cooks, chefs, waiters, and cleaning aids are all responsible in maintaining sanitation in the kitchen and in the whole restaurant. Aside from these people, pest control experts also need to do routine checkups. That is part of the investment. Since the quality of the food is your commodity, you need to ensure that pests will not thrive in your kitchen. If your seats are cushioned with soft foam and fibers, and if you have a carpeted floor, bed bugs should always be checked. They may not be able to bite there but you need to, make sure that your customers are not coming in and going out with these critters.


New York pest control experts handle commercial and residential checkups and remedies. Sometimes a restaurant cannot help it but to have one or two cockroaches. That is why there is a need to maintain the whole restaurant from inside and out. If the restaurant is inside a hotel, there are bigger stakes at hand. The pest control specialists need to make sure that the area inside and outside of the restaurant is free from pests, since they could thrive across the hotel. They may not be in the kitchen, but they could be in the mini kitchen of a hotel room and one pest in a hotel can spell disaster to the entire premise.


For restaurants and other food establishments, there is so much at stake when there are pests. First, you do not follow the building codes on sanitation and risk being fined. Second, your reputation gets tarnished. Third, any food that came from your area might be subject to diseases. The next is the food ingredients. It is a massive piling up of costs, and a lot of other problems for the legality of the business. There is no exaggeration, restaurateurs, hotel managers and food establishment owners all have their hands full just with reminding their teams to always work in a clean space and never to leave the area dirty.

 
Fast Food
 
Every now and then, there will be inspections. You can also hire your pest control experts to check your area to ensure that everything is clean on your side. Effective pest control for food establishments is done by means of taking active effort every day to start the work clean, and end the work clean. Any piles of dirt or garbage cannot be left behind near the restaurant. They need to be taken to the right areas to ensure that rats and cockroaches will not thrive near the restaurant. Being lazy with clean up will cause possible infestation. For pest control experts, they often work with isolated bug cases because sometimes there may be open areas where pests can enter.


Pests are naturally living in the environment just as we are living in this world. We cannot eradicate them all in our area. If the conditions are perfect for pests to thrive in a certain area, they will try to get there. Setting up a restaurant is not just a matter of cooking in a kitchen and peeling and stirring. There is a sanitary process involved in it. That is why many popular restaurants in New York have very little issues with pests. Smaller food establishments however, may not have the same level of discipline as with the established restaurants so they need to be more aware of the risks of having pests in their area. It is nasty for an unwary customer to find flies and cockroaches and worse, maggots to be busy buzzing on your food.


It is as essential for food establishments to make food storage unit’s pest free. In restaurants, most of the time, they have special containment units for their spices, and other food stuff. Most of the time, to maintain freshness, they only get meats and vegetables as well as fruits and fish the day they need them so you are assured that these ingredients are sanitary and are not rotting in a containment unit for days. For those in food areas that are cramped like hotdog stands and burger areas, there is a necessity to use secure containment units to lock their food and ensure that no insect can enter them. There is always a risk. You cannot deny that.

 
Food Store
 

Even in a less stressful state of New Jersey, their restaurants follow strict sanitation rules. In all establishments from dessert bars to cake places to specialty food stores, there is a need to follow the same level of pest control concept for their items. A clean, sanitary and healthy space that is secure from the pests from outside is more attractive to people than to pests. You would not want to buy food in a place where tons of food stuff and garbage are all nestled nearby. Food is a very sensitive commodity and with the existence of new diseases and conditions that could come from food, there is always a concern and a pressure for the food service industry to ensure that their products are safe from foreign contaminants and pests in particular.


Pesky pests like cockroaches can live in even the worst spaces and conditions. That means you have to have a very critical eye for all the spaces from bathrooms to kitchen sinks and even the potted plants in your main hall. Rats have very flexible bodies and can sneak into the tiniest holes. So having pest control experts examining your restaurant or food center will be beneficial to ensure that no rodents can enter, or take advantage of any small holes or cracks from outside.


Being with food and organic matter is a really big responsibility. That is why training the crew and the management of proper sanitation procedures is extremely important. Even using chemicals can be very dangerous since food can acquire vapors and liquids that can contaminate the area. That is why if there is an infestation, the pest control experts are your best bets for safe eradication of vexations. New York has one of the biggest pest issues in the US but it still can carry great restaurants, clean eating spaces and amazing food for visitors from all over the world.


That means they follow sanitation rules, make sure they have routine checkups and have effective mitigation procedures. It is not only with good food that they exist but because they make sure that their services are sparkling clean. We have all seen viral videos of kitchen conditions in some nasty fast food chains and it is horrible. Reprimands and legal actions are done for these crooked ways. When you work with food, remember that sanitation is always a primary concern to prevent the dangers of contacting diseases to other people and worse, losing your restaurant just because of pests.


 East West Foods in Darlington closed By Jim Entwistle

 
Food Establishment
 

AN infestation of German cockroaches has closed down a food wholesaler which supplies restaurants and shops across the region. Darlington Borough Council moved swiftly to close East West Foods in Gladstone Street, Darlington, and Surma Food Store, in the same street, after the invasive insects were discovered. 
Yesterday, as work was well under way to contain the infestation, experts confirmed thousands of the cockroaches had been found in the premises. The council has already alerted other local authorities about the situation, as the business supplies restaurants and shops across the region and in Bradford.


German cockroaches breed quickly, are difficult to eradicate and can carry any disease with which they come into contact. Barry Pearson, environmental health manager at the council, said: “These cockroaches get into places that can’t be effectively cleaned, and will carry bacteria from places that food normally wouldn’t be in contact with, such as drains, sewers and toilets.” He said that all nearby food shops and restaurants had been warned of the situation, but there is no evidence to suggest the infestation had spread. Officials are now racing to identify all possible outlets that have dealt with the store, to contain any possible spread.

 
East West Food
 

A spokeswoman for the council said: “We are talking to neighbouring businesses and other local authorities that may have businesses supplied by East West Foods.“The business will remain closed until we are sure the infestation has been controlled.” Mr. Pearson said the business could reopen within two weeks. He said the premises were found by inspectors to be clean, and his belief was that the insects had arrived with a delivery. A spokeswoman for Stockton Borough Council said yesterday: “Within the past 24 hours, we have written to the borough’s 22 Asian cuisine restaurants and takeaways to warn them that their goods could be contaminated if they were purchased from this Darlington store.


“Environmental health officers inspected outlets on Wednesday night to lay cockroach traps, and have asked proprietors for a list of all their suppliers. “The public’s health is our priority, and the council will take whatever action is appropriate to ensure they are not at risk.” No one at East West Foods was available for comment.

 Restaurant Managers and Pest Control Responsibilities 


We found an article from Pest Control Technology, By Larry Pinto and Sandra Kraft.
This article discusses how managers of restaurants deal with pests, their views on pest control and the steps they should take to secure the establishment and to keep it free of pests and vermin.


“It’s a fact. Pest control firms and restaurant managers don’t look at pest control the same way. We focus on procedures for eliminating and preventing pests. Restaurant managers view pest control as a problem and a cost of doing business.” 
What they don’t understand is that if a restaurant has a vermin/pest infestation, they WILL lose customers. Once a customer sees cockroaches or rats for example in a restaurant they will leave on the spot and probably never return. Customers will realize the restaurant is un-sanitary and will be grossed out to ever go back, and rest assured that they will tell their friends and co-workers about the whole


 Here they list a few effective ways to ensure a restaurant manager’s cooperation point out examples in his own facility where poor sanitation and lack of maintenance is causing pest problems. 


Here are five common examples


1) Drosophila in rotting food. Show a manager how a few pieces of rotten tomato left on the floor have bred all the &quot;fruit flies&quot; flitting around a food prep table. Or show him the hundreds of wiggling larvae living in the fermenting crud that can build up under a beer dispenser that isn’t adequately cleaned every night.

 
Rotting Food
 

2) Crud under equipment. The next time you’re in a fast food restaurant, move the cash register stand next to the drive-through window and collect the junk underneath. Use a spatula to scrape the most stubborn crud — old French fries, ketchup packets, spilled food, coins, etc. Label the bag, noting where and when it was collected, and present it to the manager. It’s hard to ignore such evidence.


3) Roaches in equipment. Dirty dishes left overnight in dishwashers, combined with food debris in nooks and crannies of the machinery, are a sure bet for roach trouble, and a major focus of re-infestation in restaurants and commercial kitchens. Explain to your customer that high temperatures, extreme humidity and detergents break down pesticides in a matter of hours, even minutes. The only way to eliminate roaches in dishwashing equipment is to eliminate their food supply by running the last load of dishes and cleaning food debris from the equipment every evening.


4) Rats around Dumpsters. Show the manager rat droppings, burrows and any other signs of rodents around the outside of the facility. Point out the food scraps and debris attracting rats, which will soon set up residence nearby, just waiting to be seen by customers. Explain even the best bait can’t compete with the gourmet scraps served up by his garbage.


 Structural problems. Show restaurant managers firsthand that structural problems are causing or contributing to pest problems and making your job more difficult. Examples include: 



 The missing door sweep on the compactor room inviting in any passing mice. Broken screens beckoning to flies, wasps and bees. Broken tiles and crumbly grout providing hiding places and escape for cockroaches and other crawling pests. Holes in concrete blocks providing access to voids that act as rodent runways from floor to floor. 



Some companies hesitate to report sanitation and structural problems to restaurant managers. They’re afraid the manager will consider their comments criticism and resent it. Rarely, is that the case, however. After all, it’s far better that you report the problems to the restaurant manager rather than allowing him to hear it from his customers, or worse yet, the health department.”
Don’t forget the pallets that you have, or the pallets that come in to your establishment
This is crucial also as some may not realize that there could be pests and vermin on the pallet they bring into their establishment. This article describes why it is important not to overlook the pallets and skids that come into your restaurant.

 
Wooden Pallet
 

“In food storage areas of restaurants, grocery stores, food warehouses and even pet stores, the inconspicuous pallet is often an overlooked source of pest problems in a pest management program. Yet pest infestations in these areas often can be traced to the pallets themselves.


Wooden pallets are difficult to clean and their rough texture hides food particles and pests, especially tiny stored product insects. If the pallets are not kept dry, the damp wood can develop fungus, which can lead to a buildup of other pests such as psocids. Pallets that are rotated in from outside storage areas also can harbor insects or rodents, causing additional pest problems.
More food warehouses are using plastic pallets today, but they’re considerably more expensive than wooden pallets, so their use is not as widespread as traditional wooden pallets. Reinforced corrugated cardboard pallets are also used, but they deteriorate in damp conditions.


Pallets must be on a regular inspection and rotation program to prevent moisture accumulation, as well as pest and food spillage buildup. Pallets that enter the facility from outside sources should be inspected and cleaned immediately. All pallets should be numbered so they can be tracked through a rotation that includes inspection, cleaning and treatment. When not in use, extra pallets should be stored inside and off the floor.


Infested pallets should be broken down (outside) and cleaned by vacuuming or forced air. Wooden pallets are often treated for pests by fumigation or by heat treatment. Pallets also can receive a crack and crevice treatment with an insecticide labeled for that use, or they can be treated by spraying or dipping them in a labeled borate (disodium octaborate tetrahydrate) solution.”
