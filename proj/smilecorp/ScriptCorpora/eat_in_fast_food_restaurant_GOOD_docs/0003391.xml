I love my Sonic. I go there nearly 7 days a week. Everyonee is so nice. The owner, Mrs. Merle Kelley and her son Douglas, are very good employers. They are extremely nice to their customers. I have withdrawals when we are on vacation or my Sonic is closed. I miss the 2 guys in the car that did the commercials. They were great. I also miss the jalopeno strips you did serve. Please bring them back. Sonic has the best sweet tea in all of Alabama. - posted

All the employees at store 4167 are very nice and courtious and are very prompt with their orders. The food is fair for a fast food restrautant but I do believe their could be some improvement on the valu menu. - posted
