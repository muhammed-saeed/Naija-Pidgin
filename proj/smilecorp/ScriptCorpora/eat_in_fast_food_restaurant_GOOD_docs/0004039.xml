 Flag Close Post a comment If you love great burgers like I do, here are 3 good places that will be sure to satisfy your craving if you are in my hometown, Charlotte, NC. I have been living in Charlotte all of my life and out of all the burger places here, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, 5 Guys Burgers and Fries, and Pile Em Up Bob&apos;s are among my favorites.
 Red Robin is a chain restaurant that is not limited to Charlotte. We just had the pleasure of having them move here just a few years back and I hope they are here to stay. We have 3 locations in the city. One is located near Northlake Mall, the next in South park, and the last one in the University area, that&apos;s the one I visit the most. Their restaurant has a festive feel from pulling in the parking lot to walking through the front door so if you have children, they will love it. The menu is full of different items to choose from, so if you have a person in your party that doesn&apos;t like burgers, no worries, as they will have plenty of items to choose from. Platters of Cod fish, Fried Shrimp, Chicken and Pasta dishes are on the menu as well but how someone could go to Red Robin and get anything besides a big, juicy burger, beats me! My favorite burger there is the &quot;Banzai Burger&quot;, it is topped with a sweet teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo if you like. All burgers are made to order and come with an endless supply of steak fries cooked in canola oil. They have all kinds of burgers to suit everyone&apos;s needs, so take a look at their menu at www.redrobin.com .

My second favorite is a small secret but well liked place located off Statesville Ave., between I-85 and LaSalle St. in Charlotte called Pile Em Up Bob&apos;s . Here you can only carry-out your order because there is no drive-thru, no chairs or call in number but it so worth the wait. When you drive up to the little brick building, you may wonder if it is really a restaurant but when the door opens and you get a sniff of the food, you&apos;ll know for sure. They fix your order just like the name says and pile your food up. It&apos;s a sure bet that you will not be able to close your to go box becaue it will be so full of food! Each order is always enough for 2 meals and the price cannot be beat! They have big, juicy, greasy, delicious burgers right off the grill! I suggest you have them cut it in half for you. All burgers are always seasoned, made from hand and will have plenty of whatever topping you choose. Pile Em Up also serves a variety of things. I like to get the seafood platters and share it with someone as it will come with at least 5 pieces of fish and tons of shrimp. Most meals come with fries and you order your drink separately. Bob takes pride in feeding the people of his community on a short budget and you can never go wrong here.

Another burger joint I can&apos;t seem to stay away from is 5 Guy&apos;s Burgers and Fries . I love them because of there concept of simple and high quality burger and fries. There menu is easy and limited to burgers or hotdogs, fries, drinks and choose your topping. Its that simple, see for yourself at www.fiveguys.com ! When I first walked into 5 Guy&apos;s, I couldn&apos;t believe how limited there menu was but when I tasted my food, I understood everything. The natural cut fries are to die for and they give you a bag full. Some people put vinegar on them and say its great but I haven&apos;t gotten around to trying them that way yet. The burgers are 100% real ground beef, never frozen and you can taste the difference. It&apos;s a simple restaurant concept, a couple of wooden chairs, tables and a drink station. The kitchen is open for everyone to see and when you place your order you can watch them make it for you. I do however limit myself from going here frequently. The prices are somewhat high for a simple burger place. They don&apos;t have combo deals and you could easily pay in the $10 range for burger, fries and a drink.

There are a couple other places that should get an honorable mention also. Chili&apos;s BigMouth burgers will definitely send a craving your way from time to time and Cook Out Burgers will hit the spot after a late night out with friends. With double drive-thru windows, your burger will be quick and always hot.

So whenever your in Charlotte, keep these places in mind when you want a great burger to satisfy your big, juicy burger cravings.
