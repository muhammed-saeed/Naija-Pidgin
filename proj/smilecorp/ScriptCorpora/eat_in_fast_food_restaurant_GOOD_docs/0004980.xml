STORYLINE

Four cows bound for the slaughterhouse made a dash for freedom on Friday in a suburb of Toronto, after the truck carrying them overturned on a nearby highway.

The four escaped cows ran wild through a residential neighbourhood in Mississagua, Ontario , as police officers and local residents tried to steer them back toward the cattle transportation van.

 Police managed to get two cows into the van, while the two others, frightened by police presence, began running around the neighbourhood.

The thing of it is we don&apos;t want to spook them, said Dave Woodford of the Ontario Provincial Police .

Because when they take off, you&apos;re not going to catch them and you have to let them calm down a bit, he explained.

Residents of the area said they were initially alarmed by the heavy police presence in their area.

What made me nervous was the OPP ( Ontario Provincial Police ) cars had blocked us in and one was standing at my neighbours across the street with a shotgun, a local resident told Canadian broadcaster CTV.

At first I&apos;m thinking maybe there&apos;s a criminal or something, you know. That&apos;s the first thing you think, you don&apos;t think cows, she explained.

After a four hour chase through the neighbourhood, officers determined that the two cows were becoming a threat to public safety after it charged a policeman and knocked down an area resident trying to assist police .

All of a sudden someone moved a bit too quickly, spooked them and they, both of them, went crazy and one of them threw one of the farmers up against one of the fences, Woodford said.

 Police then made the choice to shoot down the steer, firing nearly thirty bullets into the animal before it finally went down.

Shortly after, the fourth cow was caught and placed into the van along with the two others.

The three surviving cows were eventually transported to the slaughterhouse.

 Script LEAD: Yesterday a wild police pursuit in southern California started as a case of road rage...two feuding motorists pulled into a bank parking lot. One of them had a gun...the law stepped in...and the chase began. The man who led police on the wild chase has been identified as Young Chol Pak. Police say they can&apos;t believe no one was seriously hurt, or even killed in the chase . Jay Jackson reports. SCRIPT: Another desperate chase from the south freeways. The driver of this Acura is the latest to end up behind bars.(SOT)32-year old Young Chol Pak? has a lot of explaining to do. Police say he&apos;s the man who led them on a wild 2 hour chase , that snaked through San Bernadino, Los Angeles, and Riverside County.(SOT)That call came from a teller inside this San Bernadino bank, who saw Pock with the gun and another man arguing. Police believe Pak followed a motorist from the freeway, to settle a road rage dispute. But shortly after police arrived, Pak sped off, briefly dragging one officer with him. Then he spotted, barrelling down the 215, at speeds upward of 120-miles per hour. CHP was called in to help at that point. He then criss-crossed the 91, doubling back, then jumping on the ten eastbound. He ended up Montclair, where in dramatic fashion, highway patrol officers rams into Pak&apos;s car, forcing into a median strip. Pak jumps out, runs into a backyard, that&apos;s when a civilian tackles him, moments later a highway patrol officer moves in, kicking Pak twice, neighbors watched it all.(SOT)(SOT)(SUGGESTED TAG) Pak faces numerous felony charges, including assault with deadly weapons, brandishing a fire-arm and resisting arrest. The officer that was dragged was not seriously injured.

 Description Police chased a shoplifting suspect, who they thought was alone in the car, through two communities. Police say the suspect weaved dangerously through traffic at high speeds, ran red lights and stop signs and at one point nearly hit officers. Ontario police say officers spotted the green car Monday evening, moments after Wal-Mart security notified them of a shoplifter.Dash camera video shows the car passing through a red light at an intersection in front of a police car, in which officers immediately turn on their lights and siren and give chase .Trying to get away from police , the driver, identified as 24-year-old Chiquita Toddie of Mansfield, is seen speeding around other cars, crossing the center line. As the car nears the intersection, the driver makes a sudden left turn in front of another vehicle at a traffic light, and then continues to speed away.Mansfield Police Chief Rodney Smith says the officer decided to call off the chase a short time later.The officers made the right decision, Chief Smith tells Fox 8 News, adding that at the time they did not have information that anyone other than Toddie was in the car.Although they were not still chasing the suspect, Chief Smith says the officers watched her turn into a residential street and followed from a distance. Video from the cruisers camera shows the car they were following stopped in a cul-de-sac.As the officers exited their car to try and confront the driver, their camera shows Toddie gunning the car, just missing one of the officers as she again speeds past them and continues into Mansfield. Police in Mansfield had been radioed the description of the car and the driver, which they were successful stopping and then got their biggest surprise.In the car, strapped in a baby carrier, was a 9-month-old child. According to police reports, Toddie was supposed to be babysitting.Investigators say Toddie faces multiple charges. She was being held Monday in the Richland County jail. Police have involved Children Services in the investigation. The child was reportedly returned to the parents unharmed.Chief Smith says they were informed in the initial call from store security that the suspect had a child, but in relaying the description of the car and the suspect to the officers the dispatcher did not tell them about the baby.He tells Fox 8 News it might have increased the urgency of the decision making, but under the circumstances things would probably not have changed much.The officers did what they were supposed to do, he says, referring to their decision to call off the pursuit.

 Description A DETROIT AREA MAN WHO WAS KILLED IN A SHOOT-OUT WITH POLICE WAS HEAVILY ARMED AND WEARING A BULLETPROOF VEST WHEN HE OPENED FIRE ON THE OFFICERS. THE SUSPECT, 29-YEAR-OLD DONTI JAMAL HENRY WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH FINGERPRINT RECORDS. THE COUNTY CORONER SAID TWO BULLETS HIT HENRY, ONE IN THE JAW AND THE OTHER FATAL SHOT IN THE NECK. AUTHORITIES SAID HENRY USED BOGUS DOCUMENTS TO TRY TO OBTAIN AN OHIO DRIVER&apos;S LICENSE AT A STATE LICENSE BUREAU IN BOWLING GREEN, THEN FLED POLICE WHO RESPONDED AND LED LED STATE TROOPERS AND SHERIFF&apos;S DEPUTIES ON A 40 MILE CHASE ON SOUTHBOUND I-75. WHEN STATE TROOPERS CORNERED HENRY, HE JUMPED OUT OF A MINIVAN WITH A GUN IN EACH HAND AND OPENED FIRE ON THE OFFICERS. THREE TROOPERS AND A SHERIFF&apos;S DEPUTY RETURNED FIRE DURING A SHOOTOUT THAT LASTED 34 SECONDS. HENRY SHOT AND WOUNDED TWO OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL TROOPERS AND A CANADIAN WOMAN SUFFERED A SUPERFICIAL GUNSHOT WOUND AFTER THE GUNMAN JUMPED INTO HER SUV AS HER HUSBAND WAS FILLING IT WITH GASOLINE. A COUNTY SHERIFF SAID IT WAS VERY LIKELY THAT ONE OF THE DEPUTIES, GREG PANNING, FIRED THE SHOT THAT KILLED HENRY. THE SHERIFF SAID DEPUTY PANNING WAS AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD ABOUT 80 FEET AWAY, WITH A CLEAR SHOT AT HENRY, WHO WAS INSIDE THE DRIVER&apos;S SIDE OF THE COUPLE&apos;S SUV. I LOOK AT MY DEPUTY AS A HERO BECAUSE HE MOST LIKELY SAVED THOSE TWO TROOPERS&apos; LIVES SAID THE COUNTY SHERIFF. AUTHORTIES ESTIMATED THAT OFFICERS FIRED 50 SHOTS AT HENRY. THE DRIVER&apos;S SIDE DOOR OF THE COUPLE&apos;S SUV WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS. THE COUPLE FROM LONDON, ONTARIO HAVE SINCE RESUMED A TRIP TO FLORIDA IN A REPLACEMENT CAR PROVIDED BY HANCOCK COUNTY. IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE TROOPERS KNEW AT FIRST THAT THE WOMAN WAS IN THE VEHICLE WITH THE GUNMAN, BUT THAT A TROOPER YELLED TO OTHER OFFICERS AFTER SEEING HER. IT WAS A MIRACLE SHE DIDN&apos;T GET SHOT OR KILLED. ANOTHER TROOPER FROM FINDLAY POST WAS SHOT IN THE RIGHT FOREARM AND UNDERWENT SURGERY. ANOTHER TROOPER, OF THE WALBRIDGE POST WAS SHOT IN THE RIGHT HAND AND TREATED FOR A SUPERFICIAL WOUND. a FEW OTHER TROOPERS HAD OTHER INJURIES. INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY HENRY FLED FROM OFFICERS AND FIRED AT THEM. BESIDES A .223 RIFLE AND A FOREIGN HANDGUN, THE GUNMAN HAD A THIRD WEAPON, ANOTHER HANDGUN IN THE VEHICLE AND WAS CARRING AMMUNITION. AT THE BOWLING GREEN LICENSE BUREAU, HENRY PRESENTED A GERORIA BIRTH CERTIFICATE THAT EMPLOYEES BELIEVED WAS FAKE. WHEN HENRY BECAME AGGITATED, THE EMPLOYEES CALLED CITY POLICE . DURING A SCUFFED, HENRY PULLED A GUN OUT OF HIS WAISTBAND AND FIRED A SHOT IN THE AIR. HE FLED THE OFFICE IN A MINIVAN WITH A MICHIGAN PLATE, DROPPED OFF A WOMAN NEAR THE INTERSTATE ENTRANCE , THEN DROVE ON THE EXPRESSWAY AT SPEEDS OVER 100 MPH. A SHORT TIME LATER, POLICE ARRESTED THE WOMAN, BARBARA JEAN CLARK, 27, OF SOUTHFIELD MICHIGAN, WHO WAS WALKING ALONG I-75. SHE WAS CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT THEFT, A THIRD DEGREE FELONY AND REMAINED IN JAIL OVERNIGHT. INVESTIGATORS DISCOVERED THAT THE WOMEN, MS. CLARK WHO IS SOMEWHAT COOPERATIVE IS PREGNANT. HE SAID IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER HENRY IS THE FATHER. MS. CLARK WAS CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT THEFT, BECAUSE HENRY USED FAKE DOCUMENTS TO TRY TO GET THE IDENTIFICATION CARD. DURING THE ENSUING CHASE , HENRY RAN OVER THREE SETS OF STOP STICKS PLACED ON THE HIGHWAY. THE FINAL SET, PUNCTURED AT LEAST ONE OF THE VEHICLES TIRES, FORCING HIM TO EXIT I-75. AUTHORITIES SAID HENRY HAD A LONG RECORD OF DRUG AND TRAFFIC RELATED OFFENSES. HE WAS IMPRISONED FROM DECEMBER 2003 TO JANUARY 2004 FOR A DRUG DELIVERY OFFENSE IN WAYNE COUNTY, MICHIGAN AND WAS WAS AWAITING SENTENCING ON A CONVICTION FOR A SIMILAR OFFENSE.
