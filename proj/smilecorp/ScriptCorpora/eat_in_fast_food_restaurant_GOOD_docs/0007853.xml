McDonald&apos;s off menu items 
McDonalds has been in the fast food game so long that most of their classic burgers are household terms. Every American knows what a Big Mac is and what Ronald McDonald looks like. What most Americans don’t know is that McDonald’s has plenty of off menu non-classic items that are nonetheless available for purchase and can be quite delicious.

 Biscuits and Gravy (during breakfast hours)
This item used to be on the menu but was taken off in the mid 80’s from most McDonalds locations but can still be ordered.

 Grilled Cheese 
A simple hamburger bun with nothing but melted cheese in the middle. A Sesame seed bun will cost you extra.

 Big Mac with Quarter Pounder patties 
No cool name but definitely a cool sandwich. Recently, the classic Big Macs have become more and more bun and less and less beef. This burger definitely puts the meat back in the Big Mac. In Alaska, this sandwhich is on the menu as a McKinley Mac.

 The All-American 
A normal sized hamburger with nothing but pickles and ketchup.

 The Big MacChicken 
A Big Mac with McChicken patties instead of the bun. This will definitely get both your fingers and your blood a little greasy.

 The Poor-Man’s Big Mac 
Order a double cheeseburger with Mac-sauce and lettuce. Ask for diced onions on the side and lettuce on your burger, both are free at McDonalds. For only a dollar all you miss out on is the Big Mac’s sesame seed bun.

 Fries with Big Mac Sauce
 Just ask the cashier for a side of Mac-sauce. It is delicious for dipping fries. Some even enjoy dipping their McNuggets.

Next time I will remember to do so.

mac sauce is the most expensive sauce mcdonalds has thats why they charge you, it sucks i kow, BUT it is plety cheaper if u buy A MCDUOUBLE! a big mac has one peice of cheese, so does a mcdouble, add mac sauce and its still a lot cheaper, and if u wanna go further say you want it on a quarter bun that way it has a sesame seed bun order like this.

a mcdouble on a quarter bun add mac sauce and lettuce. the only thing they should charge you for is the macsauce, other then that it IS a big mac (minus the middle bun) make sure to ask for no mustard or ketchup or it wont taste the same!

they may be dairy cows but i bet you if i gave u a steak for a diary and a beef cow/ steer you couldn&apos;t tell me which was which and on top of the if it days of old age it will die on the farm and cant be used so any way your wrong.... twice plus on top of that as food standers sit beside by the fda no sick, cripple, dieing cows or even a cow with so much as a open sore aka a CUT can not and will not be used in beef for human use but it my be used in dog food so unless your micky d&apos;s has kibles and bits on the dollar menu then not your not eating that at all, further more son u just got school what now?

A McDonald&apos;s in Sugarcreek, OH (in the heart of Amish country) sells a &quot;Swiss Burger&quot; (a hamburger with Swiss cheese.) This is probably the only McDonald&apos;s in the country that has this menu item. Whether this McDonald&apos;s still offers it, I don&apos;t know offhand, mainly due to the introduction of the Mushroom Swiss Angus Third Pounder.

Here in Florida, they call the McChicken patty stuffed between a McDouble the McMiracle. Cuz uh, its a miracle if you make it out the parking lot alive after consuming one. Thats funny though, people calling it a McGangbang or a McDizzle. XD
