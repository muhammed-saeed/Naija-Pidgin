 Registered User Join Date Nov 2001 Location midwest Posts 660 We ordered from them last Christmas and had a major mess. Some stuff arrived in Feb. We also received someone else&apos;s order and then 2 of some of the same things and had a hard time getting the credit once it was sent back.
I ordered again this year and tried to do it from home so it wouldn&apos;t be with so many other orders....they said they will only allow businesses to order and my order was cancelled.
As for the shipping, some seemed reasonable and some were outlandish. I must say in the three years prior to last year, we had no problems at all. Reply With Quote 09-03-2002,  10:10 AM #6 banananutmuffin

 1/2007 Join Date Apr 2001 Location Just nrth of the Mason-Dixon Line! Posts 4,695 I like to order from LTD because stuff is so cheap, but...

Shipping is always super slow. Expect to wait a couple of months. I&apos;d like to order for X-mas, but I&apos;m worried that things won&apos;t make it in time.

They ship everything separately, or they have so far for me. I think once I got two things at a time. So while shipping is fairly reasonable, they don&apos;t combine shipping for different items. Which means bigger cost in the end. Reply With Quote 09-03-2002,  11:07 AM #7 hdcquest

Has much of the same at LTD and the same prices. You can order online, with a credit card. Reply With Quote 09-03-2002,  11:22 AM #8 peanuttodd

 1/2007 Join Date May 2001 Location Oak Grove, MO Posts 809 They have always charged shipping for each item individually. You save on shipping if you order 3 or more of an item. I have never felt that shipping was expensive. The only reason they ship alot of things separately, is because they are not in stock at the same time. Recently, I have been receiving much of my stuff all together. Of course, just because they ship them together doesn&apos;t mean they don&apos;t charge shipping for each item. The only reason it could take awhile to get an item is if it is backordered. You can check the status of online orders to see what is going to be shipped and what is backordered. I have an at-home business, so I used that to start getting their catalogs.

I have recently received a catalog from lakeside, but it looked like a few of the items that they had that I did order for LTD were about $2 higher.

Just my 2 cents worth. Reply With Quote 09-03-2002,  12:03 PM #9 karenc001

 Registered User Join Date Feb 2002 Location North Texas Posts 2,203 I get LTD Commodities and ABC Distributors catalogs and they are virtually identical. The covers are different and the pages are in different order, but that&apos;s it! Does anyone know if they are the same company? Are there any more that are identical as well? I wonder if we pick one closer to our homes if the shipping would cheaper??? Wishful thinking! Reply With Quote
