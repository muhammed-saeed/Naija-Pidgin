Brittany Williams (21) was shot and killed by a sniper in the drive-through lane of a fast-food restaurant
 Filed Under: Shot Published: Feb 10, 2008 @ 11:34 PM 

Brittany Williams (21) 
 Date: Jan 20, 2008
 Cause of Death: Murder
 Location: Omaha, Nebraska
 URL:  go to their myspace Guidance counselor Diane Pfeiffer had the same thought at North High School as Mel Clancy did in the office at the University of Nebraska at Omaha where he works with first-generation college students.

&quot;That couldn&apos;t be our Brittany.&quot;

But it was. The Brittany Williams who was slain by a sniper Sunday night in the drive-through lane of a fast-food restaurant was the same Brittany who had impressed high school and college advisers with her drive, and who had brightened their lives with her infectious smile.

&quot;It&apos;s so unfortunate for a person who is so young and such an important person in her community and to her family,&quot; Pfeiffer said Tuesday. &quot;It&apos;s just so unfair.&quot;

Clancy fielded calls Tuesday from people who still were in disbelief.

&quot;Was that Brittany who was killed?&quot; the callers asked. &quot;Was that our Brittany?&quot;

&quot;I had to tell them, yes, it was,&quot; Clancy said.

Williams&apos; life, future and promise were ripped away from her and those she loved by a sniper&apos;s bullet. Williams, 21, was killed about 8:40 p.m. as she sat in her car outside the Kentucky Fried Chicken/Long John Silver&apos;s restaurant at 7601 N. 30th St. Omaha police say Kyle J. Bormann, 19, used a high-powered rifle to shoot Williams from about 100 yards away.

Williams, a junior at UNO, died at the scene.

Bormann was charged Tuesday in Douglas County Court with first-degree murder and use of a weapon to commit a felony in connection with the shooting.

&quot;It appears to be a premeditated event, and the evidence reflects that,&quot; said Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine, who filed the charges. &quot;But it appears to be random in nature, even though it was an intentional killing. We don&apos;t know the motive or motivation behind it.&quot;

The Bormann family issued a statement Tuesday evening extending condolences to Williams&apos; relatives and friends.

&quot;We do not understand why this happened, as we are still trying to figure it out for ourselves,&quot; the statement said. &quot;We understand that there are absolutely no words that can change what happened in this tragic event and would like Brittany&apos;s family to know that they are in our thoughts and prayers every hour of every day.&quot;

Kleine said Bormann shot Williams with a Winchester .243-caliber bolt-action rifle that had a Bushnell scope. Kleine said it&apos;s his understanding that the rifle was Bormann&apos;s.

Rifle owners are not required to register their weapons with law enforcement, Kleine said.

Shortly after Sunday&apos;s homicide, Omaha police said, they recovered a rifle after Bormann threw the weapon to the ground when he bailed out of his vehicle and tried to run from police.

The rifle still contained one round inside the chamber and three more rounds inside the magazine, Kleine said Tuesday. Kleine said Bormann also had another four rounds in his possession.

Williams&apos; friends said they had never heard Bormann&apos;s name before police named him as the alleged killer. Like police, the friends said they knew of no connection between the two people.

The killing took a young woman who already had become an asset to the community, and promised to become more so, those who knew her said.

When her grandmother Celeste Williams speaks of Brittany&apos;s death, she uses words like &quot;senseless&quot; and &quot;unbelievable.&quot;

But when she thinks of her life, only wonderful things come to mind.

&quot;Being her grandmother was just a joy,&quot; Celeste Williams said. &quot;I&apos;m going to miss her, but I&apos;m just glad that I was here to see her turn 21, almost 22, to see the person that she was and had become.&quot;

From the time Brittany was a small child, her desire to care for others was evident.

She never went anywhere without her plastic nurse&apos;s kit.

&quot;She was always doctoring on me,&quot; Celeste Williams said.

As Brittany grew older, her mother started to take in foster children. Celeste worried it would be hard for Brittany - she had been an only child for most of her life - but she adjusted.

&quot;She was just a big sister to everybody,&quot; Celeste Williams said. &quot;To share her things and do things with them and take them places. She was just a giving person.&quot;

In recent years, Brittany Williams had her hands full, juggling school and work. But she made time to see her grandmother. For that, Celeste Williams is grateful.

&quot;I just love her. Wherever her spirit is now, I know she&apos;s gonna be at the top of the line.&quot;

Williams graduated from North High School after attending Northwest High through 11th grade. She had attended Belvedere Elementary School, and then Holy Name Catholic School for seventh and eighth grade.

She was a Goodrich Program scholar at UNO, where she was in a pre-nursing program. She was preparing to move to the University of Nebraska Medical Center to continue her studies.

Williams lived in Omaha with her mother and stepfather, Sumalia and Joel Gunter. She had three brothers and two sisters.

Guidance counselor Pfeiffer helped Williams earn her Goodrich scholarship but noted that it was Williams&apos; initiative and hard work that made it happen.

&quot;I got to know her very well because she made frequent trips to my offices, looking for scholarships, applying for colleges,&quot; Pfeiffer said. &quot;She was very motivated. She mostly talked about her goals, and just moving in that direction - toward a very good, four-year, academic school.&quot;

Williams was going somewhere in life. She knew it. And she wanted other people to know it, too.

Williams was going somewhere in life. She knew it. And she wanted other people to know it, too.

&quot;She knew she wanted to go places and do things,&quot; said Clancy, who knew her well through the Project Achieve program he directs at UNO.

&quot;She worked her tail off,&quot; successfully balancing work with classes, Clancy said.

Williams volunteered for several community projects, including UNO&apos;s seven days of service during spring break. A participant herself in Project Achieve, a program for first-generation, low-income students, she was giving back by advising younger students in the program.

She was a strong positive role model for those students, Clancy said.

&quot;This young lady had success written all over her,&quot; Clancy said. &quot;She wanted to do things the right way.&quot;

Funeral services are planned for 10 a.m. Monday at Salem Baptist Church, 3131 Lake St. Visitation will be 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday at Thomas Funeral Home,3920 N. 24th St., where a wake will be at 7 p.m. Sunday.
