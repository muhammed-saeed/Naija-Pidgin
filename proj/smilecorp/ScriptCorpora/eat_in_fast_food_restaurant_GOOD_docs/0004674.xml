Pico Rivera aims to limit fast-food spots

PICO RIVERA - The city has laid out a plan to ban new fast-food restaurant locations in much of the northern part of the city.
With a temporary moratorium in the northern part of the city set to expire in May, the Planning Commission at its March 19 meeting will consider a law that would outlaw new fast food locations on all of Beverly Boulevard and on Rosemead Boulevard north of Whittier Boulevard.
The moratorium was first enacted in May 2010, and it has been extended several times.
The northern part of the city has 3.5 fast-food restaurants for every sit-down restaurant, according to the city.
Other parts of the city have a ratio of about 1.7 to one, according to the city.
The city is made up of two communities that combined in the 1950s: Pico in the north and Rivera in the south.
Rivera historically has been more affluent.
The idea for the ban was proposed by former Councilwoman Barbara Rapisarda, who lost her council seat in November.
She argued that the childhood obesity epidemic was caused in part by the prevalence of what she said was too much fatty, cheap food in the north.
&quot;It&apos;s something that should have been dealt with a long time ago,&quot; Rapisarda said. &quot;I&apos;m happy they are continuing a program I started. They stepped forward and made a change.&quot;
Spokesman Daniel Conway of the California Restaurant Association said there&apos;s really nothing that shows more sit-down restaurants Advertisement will come if fast-food restaurants are banned.
&quot;When you take the stick approach rather than the carrot approach, you send the message to the other restaurants that they could be next,&quot; he said.
The proposed ban won&apos;t be an outright ban. Old restaurants are grandfathered in, and a new restaurant can open at the same location within six months of the closing of the former business.
Conway doesn&apos;t know if there&apos;s much of a connection between obesity and fast-food restaurants.
&quot;Combatting childhood obesity will take a much more comprehensive and holistic kind of approach,&quot; he said. &quot;You see policymakers look for these silver bullet solutions. I don&apos;t think it is quite that simple. I wish it were.&quot;
