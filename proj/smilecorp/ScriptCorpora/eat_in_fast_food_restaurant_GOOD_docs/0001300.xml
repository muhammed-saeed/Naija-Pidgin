 MONTEREY PARK (CBS) — Authorities say Monterey Park police fatally shot a man Monday who broke windows at a fast-food restaurant, then swung a 3-foot-long metal bar as he approached officers.

The gunfire erupted about 9:30 a.m. in the 1200 block of Cesar Chavez Avenue, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The sheriff’s department is investigating the shooting.

Officers were investigating a report of a man “breaking out windows” at a Carl’s Jr. restaurant, sheriff’s Sgt. Pauline Panis said. 
Responding officers saw customers coming out of the restaurant, along with a man holding a 3-foot-long metal bar, Panis said.

The officers ordered the man to drop the bar but he refused, Panis said, and at least one officer used a stun gun to try to subdue him.

The man came “in close proximity” to officers and swung the bar twice she said. At least one officer opened fire, wounding the suspect.

The suspect died of his injuries.

Authorities withheld the name of the man, who was 20-30 years of age, pending notification of his relatives, coroner’s Chief Craig Harvey said. Share this View Comments More Activity Facebook Activity What&apos;s this? Add to Timeline - What&apos;s This Click &quot;Add to Timeline&quot; to publish

 icecream 
Maybe now he knows not to swing metal poles at the police !
 Angel Martinez 
i just passed through there to enroll in elac and get some lunch.. Carls jr is a mess the streets are blocked off camera’s everywhere and police all over..SAD..young
 Alpha Kenny Juan 
I agree; it’s very sad that Carl’s Jr. will have to replace their windows. I’m sure the glass was perfectly good before a crazy guy attacked the defenseless windowpanes with a pipe. Poor windows. I hope the panes didn’t feel any pain.
 Ron Aguilar 
did you all ever stop and think that a window could be replaced but a life can never be. stop, use your brains before you make insensitive remarks. the guy had problems, but did not deserve to lose his life over broken windows. it just goes to show what some of you value other than life. shame on you .
 Tony F. 
@Ron Aguliar, perhaps you should re-read the article. The suspect was shot after being tased and NOT dropping his weapon (pipe). He was not killed over broken windows. Nice spin though……..
 Gene Rodmy 
He deserved to lose his life because of suicide by cop. I feel sorry for the business owners, people around inconvenienced by traffic, and most of all the police who will be swamped with paperwork due to the shooting of the POS. On the plus, So Cal is better for the removal of this evil and useless individual.
 Art 
Still Sad and maybe He was a good person having a really bad Day.

There but for the Grace Of“The man Upstairs”go I or any of Us
 Alpha Kenny Juan 
Art, I’m 40 years old, and I’ve had some really bad days in my life, but so far I haven’t resorted to picking up a pipe, smashing out the windows of a restaurant, and then threatening police officers. I’m sure it’s a great way to blow off some steam, but…I’ll stick to going hiking, having sex, or drinking a potent margarita.
 Doug 
Don’t ask us gringos for help to put him away. Put your hand back in your pocket.
 Art 
You r right Juan, but it is still Sad. He needed to vent in better ways We will probably never know what was going on with Him
 Roger Thornhill 
Another lame KCBS headline. So he was breaking windows and the police shot him? Oh, wait a minute, he attacked the officers. I guess that wasn’t a significant fact to put in the headline.
 anonymous 
yeah this inccident was captured on video and posted on youTube as“Suspect with Crowbar Shot Outside Carls Jr Monterey Park”It looks to me like excessive force putting the suspect down with 9 shots in a matter of seconds, the suspect had what looks like a metal stick, while the police officer had a K-9 and a gun and opted to use the gun. these cops have too much of an emotional attachment to these service dogs and rather kill than used their tools appropriately. Kinda Sucks to be protected by untrained Police Officers. Take a look and tell me what you really think.
 erikfx 
Wow, this video shows he didn’t swing twice at the cops… http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY5ioBvrYIg

 Joe 
Your a moron!!!!
 Dan-o-Mack 
Here is a better video.. Sad thing to happen.
 james 
 
 Ern 
wow that’s crazy!!!
 bbq pork 
the pigs are just trigger happy..
 Mimi 
I saw an amateur video of the whole incident. The two lazy cops, got in super close with no intention to physically restrain the man. It seemed this created the situation where the guy“swung”the ax at the cops (if you can even call it a swing or lunge). One of the cops had an attack dog (german shepard) K9 unit that he never let go.

I thought the K9 handlers were suppose to be used in this type of high-risk situation. The cops seemed bent on shooting this dude from the get go. Either that or the cop who shot the suspect wasn’t that creative thinking on his feet. Additionally, they misfired the tazer too. Bad policing IMO–so quick to shoot you dead in the U.S.
 mimi 
My thoughts exactly. I hear stuff like“Oh the dog is a police officer too blah blah blah.”One’s moral compass is way off if they value the life of a dog over a human. These dogs were bred for a specific utility to be used in dangerous situations to preserve human life. What the hell are these dogs suppose to be used for?…apprehending jaywalkers with no chance for getting hurt. Why even allocate tax funding of K9 units if they aren’t going to be used in these types of situations. The cops were trigger-happy plain and simple. It shows how cheap we value life in the U.S. amongst the chorus of anti-abortion and pro-war chants. Pathetic police. Follow this mentality and you have a very threatening future.
 Great white American 
Wow, hispanic got shot 10 times.

I am praising the police and the k9 who did this great job. One by one, the community is coming back to its peace. Perhaps a million more to go, but I will wait. And I just saved a copy of this video so I can enjoy it over and over again. And I sure will share with the next generation down the road.
 truthfully 
Hey Ron, perhaps that lliberal ponytail is pulling on your scalp too much for you to realize the idiot was not killed because he broke a window. He was killed because after numerous commands to drop the metal bar as he was advancing towards officers, he chose to assault the offcer with a 3ft metal pole. Ever get hit in the head by a full grown man with a 3ft long metal pole? Odds are if you did, you would either be dead or suffered severe brain damage. In other words, Alpha is not being insensitive. He is simply stating that today people like you are so busy trying make excuses for people who choose to do drugs and go on violent rampages like it is acceptable and perfectly normal. What if your loved ones were the patrons in that restaurant, even worse small children present while that idiot was threatening everyone with a metal pole? Let me guess, you would try and give him a hug and tell him its not his fault? Perhaps it is you that should do the thinking. Those officers did an outstanding job and saved not only taxpayers dollars but also the lives of innocent people.
 mimi is lame 
Move to Russia or China if you think it so“rough and unfair”here in the US. Thos officers used great restraint. They verbalized for that idiot to drop the pipe numerous times. They pepper sprayed and tasered him to try and stop him. He chose to walk towards the officers and assault them with a pole. Perhaps when you settle into your apartment in Moscow or Shanghai, you can get drunk, smash windows with a pole and assault the police there. I am sure they will beg you to stop and try to reason with you while making sure they are not violating your civil rights. Mimi, you are truly naive and have no appreciation for how great this country is compared to other places in the world. So, as you drink your starbucks and flip through your facebook page next to your cozy little heater, just know you are sadly ignorant of the realities those offciers were faced with during that incident. Continue with your sheltered little life.
 cloudnine 
OMG just saw the video on YouTube. Those cops could have used so many other methods. I feel for the cop because it clearly shows he panic&amp;was remorseful.
This is a truly sad story.
 Memo Diaz 
Why don’t cops just blow out the guy’s knee or something in these instances? Why even aim around his vital organs?
 Drew 
you play a stupid game you win a stupid prize
 HAVE HEART 
WOW.. IT SHOWS ON THE VIDEO WITH WHOLE THING CAPTURED AND HE DID’NT SWING ONCE.. AND TO TOP IT OFF THEY HAD THE NERVE TO ARREST HIM .. WHY ?? OBVIOUSLY HE WAS DEAD WITH 10SHOTS TO THE CHEST! ITS BULL SAYING HE PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL!.. YOU GUYS THAT SAY ITS GREAT TH. THAT HES DEAD HAVE NO SYMPATHY.. WHAT IF IT WAS YOUR SON GOING THROUGH SOMETHING HE TOOK IT OUT THE WRONG WAY BUT DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE.. THEY COULD HAVE SHOT HIM IN THE KNEES AND HE WOULD OF WENT DOWN.. THEY WENT OVER BOARD!! VERY SAD.. AND MOST OF YOU WHO ARE SPEAKING SO PROUDLY ABOUT HIS DEATH ARE MOST LIKELY WHITE AND DONT LIKE HISPANICS .. VERY RACIST!.. GOD BLESS HIS FAMILY
 Null 
Aguilar…he started to be a threat with that huge pipe bender tool bar thing, that looked like a serious piece of metal that could really injure if not kill someone.

He was shot because he became a threat stupid. Not over broken windows.

You’re an ELAC student aren’t you?
 Null 
NO MIMI. The cops were ready to take him down if he continued to be a deadly threat to ANYONE including the cop that was making an effort to taser the thug.

The thug tore off the taser and then seemed to get ready to lung that HUGE metal pipe tool at the taser cop who seemed to be struggling with reloading his taser.

Its that clear and simple.
 Null 
Dodo. No one that is good and reasonable, goes around bashing windows threatening other peoples lives when they have a really bad day.

Kcuf.
 null 
No actual swing, but the first move to take that HUGE heavy metal pipe bender tool and START to lean it back to take a swing at the taser cop who was struggling to reload his taser gun.

IF that thug would of hit that cop with that huge pipe wrench tool, he would of probably been killed or really seriously hurt, bad.

That tool became a lethal weapon and he was shot.

There’s no argument, its as clear as it is and that thug was literally disregarding authority like they were nothing.

They tell you to freeze, you freeze. They ask that you drop that weapon, you drop it.

You don’t start up to lunge it a police officer.
 null 
Another spinner and delusional viewer of video who just won’t learn not to write in ALL CAPS….

Not an actual swing, but the first move to take that HUGE heavy metal pipe bender tool and START to lean it back to take a SWING at the taser cop who was struggling to reload his taser gun.

You also have internalized racism, you have issues dude. I’m Latino and I can tell you it has NOTHING to do with not liking“hispanics”.

In truth, you are your own worst enemies. You never take responsibility for your cultural failings that produce thug after thug.

In my cultural side of my Latino heritage, we don’t have cholos, thugs or gang bangers in our culture.
 Null 
Knees? Those are targets you may miss and they may not be instantly effective in taking down a seriously threatening person with a huge large metal pipe wrench which he was starting to pull back and swing at the cop.

By the time, mere seconds that that HUGE heavy metal wrench would of reached the other taser cop head or upper body, in those valuable seconds, the K9 cop would of been foolishly trying to shoot his knees.

You watch too many movies. Think about it.
 HAVE HEART 
WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE A THUG? OR A CHOLO?.. AND SORRY HUN BUT IF YOU READ A COUPLE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE YOURS AND MINE YOU WOULD SEE THEY ARE RACIST! MY WHOLE POINT OF WHAT I AM SAYING IS NO ONE DESERVES TO DIE BECAUSE STUFF LIKE THAT UNLESS THEY DID SOMETHING AS IN HURTING SOMEONE.. ONCE HE HIT THE COP OK I WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT 10 SHOTS REALLY? HE WAS PROBABLY GOING THROUGH SOMETHING IN HIS LIFE AND DIDNT HAVE ANYONE TO TALK TO OR SOMETHING.. BUT TO BE SO HAPPY AND HAVE JOY ON HIS MURDER IS WRONG!
 Lupe Ignacio 
Mimi, I take it you have a 1st-grade education and you obviously have zero compassion for animals. A canine’s bite is his or her only defense. How can you compare that to a 3-foot iron pipe wielded by a crazy man who just had no response to a tazor? You are saying the canine should be ordered to go into a situation resulting in a sure death or serously mamed. Aside from the serious issues of abuse, it is a loss of tens of thousands invested in that canine officer. Canines have been used since World War II and have been a valuable asset to this country. Get educated.
 null 
YOu don’t know who the real racists are…HUN.

Stop all CAPS please. I don’t ever engage in posts discussion with people who use ALL CAPS. Makes you look looney.

You need to think this over though. Think. The THUG, because thats what he was, look at the video, if you don’t know a thug when you see one, you’re a danger to yourself. That thug was about to swing at a policeman who was trying to taser him down. That pipe wrench is heavy metal. Not some light hollow pipe. He was going to HURT A HUMAN.

What part of that don’t you get? Hun? I don’t know how many shots, I’ve read 7, I’ve read 10, even seven is a lot, but he wanted to make sure he was going down.

You should of been there to…talk to the thug and council him and talk him out of breaking windows and saying sorry to every one there who were under physical threat and possibly worse…hun.

No one is having“joy”.

Calm down.
 John 
Why was he a thug? Um does smashing the windows out of a building for no good reason count?
 Mike 
Maybe if you read the article you’d know that’s not what happened.

That’s exactly what the morons at this“news”site want you to think, but the officers attempted to subdue him with a taser, it had no effect, and then they resorted to deadly force when the suspect confronted them with deadly force.

Maybe if people like you would stop trying to automatically chastise the police and use your head (you know, that useless ump that’s three feet above your butt), you’d come off sounding a bit smarter than a can of soup.
 Craig 
WOW, The older brother wants an investigation on the Police Officers, Why his brother got shot? Seriously Idiot Have you looked at the video?
 John 
He is a THUG? One less THUG in the street.. Wake up Dude…This guy was on a mission and could of her an innocent person (could of been a loved one of yours) So wake up
 genna 
Mimi, a crazy person who was swining a large metal pipe with ZERO, literally ZERO disregard for human life was shot to death, women..children..it didnt matter who was in the restaraunt, and when police showed up the CRAZY MAN WITH A LARGE WEAPON showed NO signs of stopping even after commoands AND getting tazered and even began to make a threatening move at the officers, this is a sad situation but no reason to defend the perp. What do you want mimi? do you want one of the cops to get bashed in the face with the metal pipe before defending themselves..your a joke, and police dogs have more of a purpose than just sending them to fight crazy men with no response to tazers, you need an education and a more realistic approach to life because you clearly dont see police officers as people too but just disposable objects of your unrealistic view of life.
 juztees 
Regardless if he had a metal bar or a stick, the stupid trigger happy cops should have used common sense and shot that individual on the legs . The system needs to be regulated. For y’all who viciously are happy that he got killed, God will take care of your evil thoughts. Your time will come . This youngster has a mother . , and something like this could happen to any one by taking medication or getting hit with a crisis.
 FidelityBraveryIntegrity 
So was your mother!!!!!
 FidelityBraveryIntegrity 
You just mad cause you get smoked by your boyfriend punk!
 FidelityBraveryIntegrity 
There really is no more just shooting in the knee. To much paper work and lawsuits. Next time someone attacks you or your family with a deadly weapon, i wanna hear you basically just shot them in the knee.
 randy 
Yes, Mimi, the cops caused the guy to swing an ax at them. i guess that’ll work, if you subscribe to the popular“if the police did it, it’s wrong”theory.
 David Davidson 
They should have just just given him an arrow to the knee.
 bob 
Did you stop to think he could have killed or maimed someone with that metal pipe? Nobody is happy to see him die. I’m sure he had mental illness or was high on drugs.
 bob 
yeah like jedi mind control or do a jackie chan legsweep and then kick the pipe out of his hand while he’s on the ground
 bob 
mimi you’re a low IQ chimp. those police dogs weren’t bred to be killed or maimed by a psychopath with a metal pipe. nobody wanted to see the guy killed. he brought it on himself by acting like a dangerous psycho with a metal pipe. i hate seeing cops abuse their power, but this isn’t one of those cases
 mike 
What do i think??????? I think you’re a complete moron, that’s what i think!
 mike 
What’s very sad, is they actually let you type a response without being able to put together a proper paragraph. Hell a proper sentence at that…. Stupid MOE!
 mike 
Well, that moron’s time has already come. That’s what is important about your stupid post.
 John 
Have you ever actually fired a pistol? Much less at a moving target? Shots to extremities like that are something from the movies. You don’t aim for legs, or arms, or the head. You aim for center mass in the chest to minimize the chance of missing and potentially hitting a bystander with full miss or a ricochet. That’s standard operating procedure.
 Jay 
Another nonviolent drug offender. A pipe’s a deadly weapon so yeah cops aren’t going to wait to figure out what you’re gonna do with it.
 lopan2000 
Love this shoot! I thought the police did a great job! I wish they would cap more of these idiots out there, maybe the streets would be safer for us regular folks!
 juztees 
Oh really? I don’t see the cop’s shooting at these drug addict bums in down town Los Angeles.
They are dangerous people on drugs and very hostile. I have seen these creatures pushing decent people and screaming profanities at women going to work. Where are the cop’s ? The whole system is so racist and discriminatory. These cop’s know exacly who to kill. They don’t dare shoot those african american people in down town that are on drugs sleeping in the streets becoming very hostle and dangerous, cause they know very well who to and not pick on. The streets in down town Los Angeles are filled with cameras every where, these cops can see it all, only they choose to not. Hmmm…Y’all are idiot’s.
 juztees 
and relax, this is not meant as a racist comment. Just pointing out how the system is so twisted and crazy.
