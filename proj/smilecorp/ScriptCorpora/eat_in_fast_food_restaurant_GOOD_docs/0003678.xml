Is it just me or is Arby&apos;s the nastiest fast food restaurant ever?
 I know fast food is all pre-made frozen chemical crap, but Arby&apos;s just seems so much worse. Their roast beef doesn&apos;t look like any roast beef I&apos;ve ever seen. The bread is that sweet, soft gummy bread...ick. Plus everything just tastes like salt as opposed to having any real flavor. I ate there for lunch because it was close to work and I couldn&apos;t believe how gross it all was.

 Sorry, I have to disagree, I can&apos;t live without their curly fries, beef and cheddar with bacon, and jamocha shakes. Oh yeah, the loaded potato bites, too. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

 Skip the roast beef sandwiches and try the Market Fresh sandwiches. And some of their curly fries. You&apos;ll change your tune. :)

 No it isnt you. They have gone downhill over the past couple years. The quality sucks and the prices are terrible. I had a fish sandwich from there about a month ago and almost threw up after 1 bite. The only thing I like from there is the beef n cheddars but even then it is rare since the bread is usually very very very dry.

 It really does depend on where it&apos;s located. I ate at Arby&apos;s in Modesto, CA and it was some of the grossest food ever. But now I&apos;m in Minnesota and our Arby&apos;s is sooo good. I actually crave it now and I refused to eat there for a long time because of my experience in CA.

 You are correct, the roast beef is not appetizing to look at and tastes fake.
I stopped eating the food because I kept getting sick every time I ate there.

 Not great, but not the worst. I ate at a Subway once and the kid never put on gloves, used the same knife to cut the sandwich as he did to open a new box of the wax paper/wrapping stuff, wiped his nose on his arm...you know, so it didn&apos;t drip into my sandwich and then the bastard had the nerve to ask me if I wanted a&quot;meal&quot;with that. I walked out before he even got the total on his cash register.

 I love when people go to a place known for there food like roast beef from arbys and order a fish sandwhich. That makes alot of since. What do you expect. I think im going to have a hamburger from a mexican restaurant im sure it will be good because they are known to make good tacos.

 I work with (not for) the fast food industry so I try not to be too negative, but I do have to say that I personally dislike Arby&apos;s. The mozzarella sticks are okay if they are hot and cooked through but I cannot eat the roast beef and the cheese sauce is very gummy. The market sandwiches are okay but I don&apos;t even know if they still make them as I&apos;ve not been to Arbys in ages.

Answer hidden due to its low rating
 I have to agree with you from your first opening words! Arby&apos;s and every other fast food establishment gets their meat from manufacturers that process meat that comes from farms that inject artificial hormones into animals and they use processed cheese that has artificial ingredients and comes from animals that are injected with artificial hormones.

This explains why: all-natural hormone-free meat, all-natural organic cheeses, and organic bread (not the processed kind made with artificial ingredients used at fast food restaurants) are better for you and what you need to make a healthy sandwich. You can buy: all-natural hormone-free meat, all-natural organic cheeses, and organic bread at Whole Foods. It may be cheaper to buy organic lettuce and tomatoes from Stop&amp;Shop and Shaw&apos;s on the east coast and Albertson&apos;s on the west coast or Hannaford&apos;s.

I used to think that Arby&apos;s wasn&apos;t a fast food place when I first saw their commercials. That was the time, I thought it was a family-owned eating establishment named after their father or grandfather. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It is a fast food restaurant!

Did you know that money hungry crooks opened up the first fast food restaurants in the 1950s not caring if the meat they served to their customers was injected with artificial hormones and other crap or not? They just figured the more food they are able to prepare and sell at a fast pace, the more money they make. Health food is not a concern for fast food restaurants. Even the healthy options that fast food restaurants have now like the chicken wraps at McDonalds have trans fats in them which are artificial fats put into food. The artificial hormones that these fast food establishments put in their food makes people sick with: stomach pains, diarrhia, and nausea with or without vomitting.

You can make a healthier chicken cordon bleu sandwich with: all-natural hormone-free chicken, all-natural hormone-free ham, organic all-natural swiss cheese, organic bread, and organic all-natural dressing like all-natural Mayonaisse or Veganaise which doesn&apos;t have any dairy instead of the artificial mayonaisse crap the fast food establishments put on their sandwiches. Just grill your chicken breast the night before that way it is done and you can make a sandwich with it the next morning. Use organic all-natural olive oil to cook your chicken! Fast food places use artificial vegetable oil or corn oil with is very bad for you! People in Italy and Spain use olive oil. I am Italian and I grew up knowing that olive oil was what you needed to use.

A diner is another good option if you wan&apos;t greasy food because they don&apos;t serve you the same crappy meat that they serve you at fast food restaurants. I am going to see if I can get my boyfriend to go to a diner. He told before he would and l love the 1950s diners like the ones James Dean and Marilyn Monroe frequented in their day.

Jesus served the people fish from the ocean and bread made from the grains of the earth not fast food and He certainly didn&apos;t create fast food.

If you must eat fast food then do it in moderation (once a day not three times a day) and pick places like El Pollo Loco which doesn&apos;t use trans fats in their food and use 100% chicken or go to Wendy&apos;s and order a burger there because they use fresh meat to make their burgers or go to Taco Bell and only order the steak or chicken frescas because they don&apos;t grease those soft tacos and they are the healthiest thing or their menu.

The chicken tenders at McDonald&apos;s are supposed to be made with 100% all-white chicken not like the chicken nuggets they used to make in the 1980s and 1990s that had other artificial stuff in them. So maybe that is also another option for you. My boyfriend likes going to places like: McDonald&apos;s, Arby&apos;s, and Taco Bell because he can&apos;t afford the organic food at Whole Foods and he likes to eat out every night but he also can&apos;t afford to eat at a nice restaurant every night he tells me. I think he&apos;s just about how I charge up a storm at Whole Foods and my bill is usually very high but I make that food last three weeks because I buy a lot of frozen organic vegetables and fruit. I also think he doesn&apos;t like to go food-shopping because you have to stand in line. He doesn&apos;t even go shopping at big chains like Stop&amp;Shop or Ralph&apos;s. I can&apos;t afford to shop at any grocery store and buy everything in site but I buy what I need and what I know is good for me when I go to Whole Foods. I&apos;d charge up a storm on food because I know everything there is so good -- both taste-wise and health-wise and I would buy a lot of sorbet and icecream which is expensive. The best sorbet and tortilla chips are only found at Whole Foods!

Anyways, if I have to suffer eating their artificially-hormone injected meat then I am going to order the chicken tenders or just forget about eating all-natural food that day and say&quot;I&apos;ll have a burger with fries.&quot;

Maybe I&apos;ll go to a different Arby&apos;s and say&quot;I&apos;ll order your roast beef and your chicken cordon bleu and your turkey wrap and pray that it at least tastes better than the other Arby&apos;s I went to.&quot;

I would eat at a fast food restaurant only for my boyfriend&apos;s sake so he doesn&apos;t say&quot;I can&apos;t take you to too many places because you only eat organic all-natural food.&quot;He doesn&apos;t want to leave me no matter what but I want to please him so that when he and his son go out to eat alone at the fast food places, he won&apos;t look to see other women eating fast food and think about wanting to eat fast food with them because they don&apos;t care about eating hormone-injected meat. I try not to think that way but I realize that I might have no choice but to eat at fast food restaurants to please my baby because I love him.
