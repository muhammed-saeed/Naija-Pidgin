Review - Apartment in Becici
 10 / 10 Peaceful and confortable Submitted by: melsimunovic@yahoo.fr in 09/06/10 
 Age Group: From: Traveller type: Young Couple 
 We had a great stay at this place in Becici. It is very conveniently located, only 5 minutes walk from the main beaches of Montenegro. And also off the road, which means it was a very peaceful place to rest in the evening on the terrace or near the pool. The flat itself was very comfortable, in terms of bedding and everything you need is available in the flat in terms of cooking but also linen and bath towels.
Finally, Montenegro is worth a visit, we spent a wonderful time visiting Budva nearby Becici but also Sveti Stefan and Kotor bay and lake Skadar, both about half an hour away from Becici.
Will definitely come back!

Important Notice : Avoiding Fraud

It&apos;s rare, but some helpful hints to watch out for with regards to fraud:

 It is important to NEVER wire funds or use/employ other fund transfer mechanisms such as western union: Always use a credit card to protect yourself against fraud. If owners pressure you into providing a deposit or
 refuse to accept credit cards, there is a high probability that this is a scam. If at all suspicious of fraud, ask to see their website, or any other literature they can provide or send to you. Ask them for contact details for guests who have previously stayed on their property insisting on telephone numbers.
 Be suspicious of emails that originate from free email services (yahoo, hotmail, gmail, etc) Research the property thoroughly on the internet to see if there is any history or mention of scams associated
 with the property.
