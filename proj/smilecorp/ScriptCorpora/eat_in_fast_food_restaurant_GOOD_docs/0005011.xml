Was this self-defense?
 Consider this video:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vEc0VIV-… 

A grand jury refused to indict, saying the clerk was justified in using self-defense. He was charged with assault. The jury saw exactly what you are seeing. The only thing to add is that two women jumped the counter because the clerk did not like the $50 bill he was handed, thinking it might have been counterfeit.

Additionally, the women were also charged with disorderly conduct, and other charges are pending. Nothing in the news indicates anything about the money being counterfeit, but the story is still active in the news right now, so the Secret Service might have something to say if anyone thinks the bill is bad.

But based on what you see, do you think it was justified?

 Oh, and despite the title of the video - no one was killed or seriously hurt.

 It is very interesting to see the events ONLY from the customer-side of the counter. What we don&apos;t see is what happened behind the counter. It is likely that McD probably had a security camera on the employee-side of the counter, which was likely additional footage that the grand jury was able to see.

We can probably conjecture that the women, stupid enough to do what they&apos;d done already done (like bringing fingernails to a lead-pipe fight), probably fought back. If this is the case, that&apos;s what the GJ probably saw - leading to their decision.

If I were the general manager, I&apos;d probably put the clerk ahead of the line for employee of the month.

 That went beyond self defense in my opinion. Initially yes, but when he continued to hit them after they were down, I would have to say he entered into the realm of assault. Of course we aren&apos;t hearing any of the testimony, it is slightly conceivable that they were still trying to get up while they were out of frame behind the counter and acting threatening. I also could not tell what he was using, if it was a metal rod or something less ridged, as that would make a difference too.

 It&apos;s like being back in Newark...

At first it was self-defense but then it seemed like he went overboard. We don&apos;t exactly know what the person on the ground was doing behind the counter, but I assumed that when one of the worker&apos;s colleagues tried to stop him he had gone a bit overboard.

Micky Ds doesn&apos;t accept 50s anyway, as jwbulldogs pointed out.

 interesting. he had every right to use self defense, they were being verbally and physically abusive, especially jumping the counter, if you jump the counter I would smack you with a pole too. but he has been in jail for ten years already for manslaughter, I think he may have some anger/or some other kind of issues that need to be dealt with, he had the right to self defense, but from what it looks like, he took it a bit too far.

 Where I come from (the UK) that behavoir is deemed as self defence. They where entitled to self defend the moment the scum bags jumped on the counter. The extra hits where for good measure and definately deserved, he was protecting the staff from a possibly threat, surely he can&apos;t wait for something to happen for him to react. The people jumped the counter, its war.

 Self defence without a doubt!
Protect yourself by all means!
Would you jump the counter for anything other than aggression?
It was a reasonable reaction!
Better to put the aggressor down, than be killed.
HERE, HERE! Excellent move on the part of the defender!
The counter jumper could have been killed, without remorse from the law.

 Well my father is a lawyer and so are most of his friends.
I was taught early on, that self defense has to be with a weapon of lesser or greater value, same goes if it is self defense of another.

 He was justified in defending himself with the pole when they came at him. Afterwards, as much as I would have wanted to beat the crap out of them too, hitting them while they were down can&apos;t count.

 This is bad. They had no right to put their hands on him. They should have come over the counter. I don&apos;t blame him for defending himself. But from what I can see he went beyond self defense. They were on the ground. He waited a few and hit them some more and some more. To me it appears as if he thought about it some more and was upset by it and continued to beat them.

I can&apos;t even tell what he was using to hit them.

It doesn&apos;t matter if the bill was counterfeit. McDonald&apos;s policy is not to accept any $50 bills. Sometimes they don&apos;t observe the policy, but they are within their rights not to accept them. It keeps down the temptation for people to rob them.

I&apos;m believe he will lose that job. His actions doesn&apos;t make them look good.

I&apos;m conflicted on this. In a sense they got what they deserve. They were upset and using profanity. They verbally assaulting him. Then they physically assaulted him. I think I would have hit them too. I don&apos;t believe a man should hit a lady, but they weren&apos;t being ladies. I don&apos;t think a man should be a punching bag to the women either. He should defend himself, but he went too far. They were down. The threat was over. He should have stopped.

Even though I think he went too far, I don&apos;t think I would have indicted him either. That is my conflict. I don&apos;t think it was adrenaline either. If it were adrenaline he would have just kept beating them which he did for a few moments. But he stopped and looked at them on the ground and whacked them some more. Then he did it again. That was anger and malice.

The customer yelling at him should have been yelling at the 2 women.

 Hard to tell when you were not there. It looks like one of the women threw the first strike then jumped the counter followed by tho other. What customer would jump the counter to go after an employee in the first place no matter what the dispute? When the employee retreated they followed him. What did he use to defend himself? If noone was seriously hurt he could not have beaten them too brutally. If you engage in a fight you get bruises. When the women jumped the counter and pursued a retreating individual they chose to fight. It was not the employees decision by the time he fought back. Granted there were a few whacks too many when one woman tried to get up again but that&apos;s what adrenaline will do when you are scared and having the opponent back on her feet puts the defender at risk again. The media tends to leave out important things to make more drama so I don&apos;t believe anything they say anyway. Having actually been on the other side of the counter in a robbery I have to say it is one of the scarier things so I understand the employees reaction. With all the info given here I would not have indicted either. Women can be vicious opponents if guys want to admit to it or not.
The really interesting thing would be if the attackers would have been guys how would the reaction have been? Would you still think there were too many whacks dished out? Or were the extra whacks just a safety measure to make sure they don&apos;t get up and start attacking you again.
And shame on the McDonald&apos;s to cave in to the media and fire the employee.

 &quot;The only thing to add is that two women jumped the counter because the clerk did not like the $50 bill he was handed, thinking it might have been counterfeit.&quot;

In response, I point to the sign saying&quot;We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.&quot;A cashier suspicious of a note has the right to refuse it. But let&apos;s not get off track.

I watched two subjects arguing with a clerk, apparently throw what appears to be a a purse at him (the scuffle is obscured, but the red purse on the counter seems to disappear), lay hands on the clerk, then jump the counter. I watched a clerk retreat as the subjects (apparently women) continue to accost him and back him into the kitchen, posturing aggressively. He then, outnumbered, grabs what looks like the metal pole to fish objects out of the fryer and proceeds to fight them off.

The clerk is later discovered to have a prior criminal history; does this change the terms of this occurrence? No. This is a logical red herring and does not figure into this case.

According to you, the Grand Jury refused to indict, feeling the case was one of self-defense. Self-defense, remember, is an affirmative defense – the Grand Jury is saying they feel the evidence of the case shows that he undeniably committed an assault (presumably aggravated), and the response was appropriate under those circumstances. It&apos;s not for us to say it&apos;s self-defense or not, though he was undeniably fighting back to protect himself from obvious aggressors. The determination of self-defense rests with a jury. It seems, however, he&apos;d have an incredibly good case.

 I think it was self defense until the attackers were on the ground, crawling, and he just put in about 2-5 more than was necessary. Probably due to over adrenaline or something, makes untrained people tend to go out of control because adrenaline is an energy that once started, has to go somewhere. Not to mention fear/rage components.

The jury probably didn&apos;t wish to convict because there was the bare bones justification for the use of force. Jumping counters and cornering fast food employees, pretty obvious to a jury. In civil court, of course, he&apos;d be slapped with some liability stuff for unjustified force or damage.

I find it hilarious that there is a woman screaming&quot;STOP&quot;over and over again, and getting shriller when she realizes her&quot;voice&quot;has no affect on&quot;male physical violence&quot;. Many women discover that little truth sooner or later. If you want him to stop, make him. Words don&apos;t count people. Just funny how untrained people behave.

EDIT1: http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/14/s… 

&quot;That’s when the cashier can be seen on the video disappearing into the back of the fast-food restaurant. He comes back with a metal rod and begins hitting the women.


Other customers watched in horror as McDonald’s workers tried unsuccessfully to stop the violence.

One female customer had a fractured skull that required surgery and a broken arm. The other has a deep laceration&quot;

Lion, yeah I would say the same thing if the two counter jumpers were 7 feet men as well. I still say the same thing for this situation, after discovering the&quot;injuries&quot;and&quot;metal rod&quot;thing as well. I didn&apos;t need to know about injuries. I already knew it was a high possibility when I said he swung too many times. Because that results in injury. And just as it happens, there was injury.

If you want to neutralize people, you don&apos;t stand there while they are down. You get up close and put your body weight on them, and make sure their entire body does not have any hidden weapons. If the other person tries to get up, then you can wack them to keep them down while you search the first person. After you are done, get to the second person, search them. Now you can walk away with your back turned if they are still conscious, and tuck yourself somewhere else or outside the building, with your metal rod. Or you could have just ran for the nearest exit when the two people got knocked down. Either would satisfy legal self defense requirements. Just because someone is untrained, ignorant, or lacks skill, doesn&apos;t excuse them from the consequences of the law. As the clerk already knows from serving 10 years for involuntary manslaughter. This fresh&quot;incident&quot;isn&apos;t going to help him any.

Btw, the best thing that can happen for me when I&apos;m working the counter is if someone jumps over it. Because then they are in my range, and it won&apos;t matter if they have guns or not. Someone with a gun pointed at you across a counter, now that&apos;s tricky.

EDIT2: The last 2-4 hits in the video were either due to malice, as JWBulldogs offered, or keeping the women down (unseen behind the counter from the cellphone), or a combination of both. Look at all those other people, including gloved MacDonalds workers and customers. They look shocked. They look afraid. They cannot believe it. They have this look on their face, like they have never seen real physical violence before. Guess watching MMA didn&apos;t work after all. Doesn&apos;t matter if it is man or woman or transgender, one strike on a disabled and downed opponent in the right spot, and that&apos;s all it will take to finish them. I don&apos;t feel panicky enough for more.
