 THE FINAL ENTRY 
 Posted on December 30, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So here we are–end of December and the end of another year. The original intent of this blog was to help inspire others and maybe even guide those down the path of health. Was I successful? If I helped at least one of you out there I did my job. One thing that I didn’t do a good job on was on the promotional side of this blog. I didn’t actively market this blog to get more readers so I could help others. My bad–to be honest, I wouldn’t know where to start.  But that is in the past and you have to concentrate on the future. Since this blog is entitled,“Change Your Life 2011″–it would be odd to continue with the same blog title.

It’s funny–when I talk to others about blogging their biggest barrier is that they don’t have enough material to blog about. They start for a few months and then eventually give it up. However, with this blog the key ingredient was passion. I truly feel that if you are passionate about what you write about, you could do it everyday.

I wish I could finish up this blog with 1 key secret that will march you down the road to weight-loss. The fact is that if you have followed my entries, you know the path is a long marathon not a short spint.

Looking back over the last few years it was pretty dark for me. Alone with nothing but empty pizza boxes and bottles of alcohol. I do feel sad that I wasted so much time. Now things are different. I still struggle but I don’t give up. I am far from perfect and want everyone to remember that each day is a gift. If you wake up in the morning, you too can change your life.

If there is some interest out there for me to continue, I will do so (alebit under a different blog title) and let everyone know.

Either way, I want to thank everyone for taking the time. All the best–it has been a fun 12 months.

If you have any questions, concerns or comments–email me at mr.wrongway@gmail.com .

Have a healthy life!

 THE ABSOLUTE BEST FULL BODY WORKOUT 
 Posted on December 21, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So recently I have been changing up my workouts to keep things fresh and my body guessing. I just finished the below workout and I have to say that it was amazing. A few reasons why I say that:

1) Finished it in 44 minutes–this includes not only the workout itself but also a 10 min stretch and 10 min cooldown

2) Total Body–the workout accounts for all muscle groups

3) Low Maintenance–All you really need is a pair of dumbbells or a barbell .

4) Cardio and Muscle Fatigue - This workout had my heart rate at a level that was beyond anything I experienced on a treadmill. It combines polymeric movements that use your own body weight 

5) Customizable–You can alter the weights, reps, or cooldowns to make it easier or harder depending on your fitness level

You do this workout 2-3 times a week and your body and fitness level will be taken to the next level.

1) 10 min stretch–you should stretch beforehand to ensure you dont pull anything…there are a lot of full body movements, so it is important to make sure you have properly warmed up

 Workout –Complete all movements as a circuit (no rest in between). After you have completed 1 circuit, take a 2 min rest…then do it again. Stop when you have completed 3 circuits:

2) Leg Raises on the floor–while on your back, slowly raise both your legs up (keep them straight) to just past your waist…then lower so your legs come close to the ground without actually hitting the group. Do 20-25 reps

3) Jump Push ups –this is exactly like a standard push up except when your chest hits the floor push up hard enough that your hands leave the floor (similar as a clap push up). When you land, go right into another push-up. These are tough so if you can’t do it, just do a standard push up. Do 6-8 reps

4) Angled Push ups–put your feet on top of a bench or chair and do a standard push up. Do 8-10 reps

5) Goblet Squats–take a dumbbell (20-25 pounds) and hold it in both hands just under your chin. Crunch down so that your elbows touch your knees. This is hard to explain, so simply google Goblet Squats to see what it looks like. It is a simple exercise–Do 8-10 reps

6) Lunges–standard lunges and alternate legs. Do 7 reps per leg

7) Clean and Sweeps–this is the best full body exercise you could do. It is amazing. Again, google it to see the right technique. I use a barbell (low weight) but you could also use two dumbbells. Do 6-8 reps

8) Box Jumps–If at your gym you have platform or box simply adjust the setting so that you can hop on top of it. Then go down and repeat. If you don’t have one of these handy you can use a bench as well. Another option are squat jumps–with your legs shoulder apart do a standard squat (no weights) then spring up as high as you can. When you land go into another squat jump. Great for leg conditioning and cardio. Do 6-8 reps

9) Moutain Climbers or Everest Climbers–again you can google these and there are plenty of You Tube videos on them. Everest climbers are a more difficult version of moutain climbers. Try for 20 reps or so

After you have completed the above (8 exercises) take a 2 min breather. Then repeat. If after the first circuit you are not tired then you need to up the intensity.

Once you complete the 3 circuits take a 10 min cooldown…you will need it!

Try it out!

Have a healthy week!

 A HEALTHY THANKSGIVING 
 Posted on November 6, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So I am a proud Canadian and realized that I didn’t post anything regarding Thanksgiving and eating healthy. Since I have some American readers, I thought I post something for their upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.

I will start off by saying don’t expect to eat 100% healthy during Thanksgiving. It is too tough even for the most disciplined individual. The key is moderation–however, there are some traditional food options that are not bad during the holiday:

1) Turkey –Turkey is extremely healthy for you. On its own it is packed with protein. The problem is that by nature Turkey is incredibly dry…so we end up pouring gravy all over it. Instead use cranberry sauce–this is a great way to add some moisture to it. Dumb a bunch of it on…sure there is sugar, but it is better than the alternative.

2) Ham–Similar to Turkey, Ham is good for you. It has more flavour than Turkey and provides the same protein boost. You can eat Ham on its own, or add a bit of dijon or pickled mustard to it…the combination tastes great and doesn’t explode with calories.

3) Sweet Potatoes –these are nutrient rich and an extremely healthy food. Most people mash it up so you need to watch out for the butter they put in it; however, this is way better than traditional mashed potatoes .

4) Salads –Salads are of course healthy; however, the dressing is what kills. My mom makes an amazing caesar salad but it is packed with fat. If you have pre-mixed salads (salads with dressing already on it) keep the serving small. If your guest provides dressings on the side, it makes it a lot easier to be healthy…you can add 2 tbsp of dressing to it.

5) Vegetables –these are almost always safe with the exception of when it is part of casserole. Casseroles always have lots of cheese and breading that takes away from the dish..they taste great, but are killer on waistline…stick to steamed or even stir-fried vegetables.

6) Pumpkin Pie –Ok, so your host will most likely have this as a dessert and you look weird if you take it! So stick to a small piece without whipping cream …pumpkin pie does have sugar and fat; however, a moderate piece without whipping cream will keep satisfied without the guilt.

7) Stuffing –there isn’t anything healthy about it. I love stuffing; however, it is empty calories…if you have to have it, keep it to a minimum.

Probably one of the best tips I can provide you with is to not show up at the dinner hungry. Sounds weird, however, if you are hungry you will give into everything that you shouldn’t. Grab an apple before you go or some almonds.

There you have it!

Have a healthy week!

 WARNING–INSIGHTS INTO PHYSICAL BEAUTY 
 Posted on November 1, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So today we are going to mix things up a bit. Be warned that I am about to challenge a number of notions out there. I wanted to talk about something that everyone at one point thinks about:

 Physical Appearance 

It is no secret that women have been put under the microscope for countless years when it comes to their external appearance. I will never argue the fact that men will notice beauty first. However, I will present the fact that over the last number of years men have been under a similar type of pressure to look a certain way.

Poetic justice? Maybe…

Lets explore a few observations out there:

1) For all my female readers out there, I want you to indulge me in an exercise. Imagine you are at a coffee shop or a restaurant with a few of your friends. When all of a sudden walks in a man . He is well dressed, has a nice smile and you notice him immediately…

What does he look like? How would you describe him?

_____________________________________________

….I forgot to mention that he is 5 foot 6”. How many of you mentioned he was‘tall’.

Some men may prefer a taller woman; however, I have never met a man who wouldn’t date a woman because of her height (extremes put aside). For a woman, if she is shorter than average she can always wear heels. For a man it is different. I have known countless number of women who would not go out with a man if he wasn’t over 5′10”. I am not here to argue someone’s preference–lets face it, a taller man is more attractive. I have asked a few women this and they all factor in not only their height, but the height of their heels. This is fair–however, the funny thing I also noticed was that even with heels if the guy was slightly taller than her she still deemed him too short.

2) Larger Women vs Larger Men–I personally prefer a woman with curves. I really am not into skinny girls (aka runway models style bodies). Yeah, yeah, I know…every girl reading this will roll their eyes…however, it is true (to be honest, I am talking body here–I will admit they are facial beautiful). In fact, I think women would be surprised how many guys find‘curves’attractive. I am not talking about fake style…I am talking real woman curves. I have known a number of guys that are self-declared‘chubby chasers’(a rude term but used to illustrate a point).  I have met women who prefer a man to be a bit bigger (vs skinny). However, in all my years on this earth, I have never met a woman who was a male chubby chaser . Never.

3) Women are way better at leveraging their physical assets –ask a woman what she thinks her best physical asset is and she could probably tell you right away. Ask a guy and he will look at you weird and or make a rude gesture! We all have some feature that makes us special. However, the difference between women and men is that women know how to accentuate that asset and camouflage any imperfections.

4) Tools of the trade–I have noticed over a number of years that there is a trend in male cosmetics ( anti-aging , moisturizer, etc…). This is no accident. Plastic surgery was once a service tailored to women–now, more men have procedures than women. However, males are still behind the 8-ball when it comes to products used to enhance their appearance.  Outside of the obvious example (make-up), I will use another: The Bra. Thanks to the medical marvels in bra technology a woman could alter her appearance in almost anyway–smaller, push-up, bigger, etc…the list goes on. Imagine if a guy had push up underwear….he would get arrested for public indecency .

So why am I mentioning this? To make the men feel unworthy and the women feel shallow? No.

If women were more like us, we would be in big trouble. Above I pointed out some things that may challenge the notion that men have no pressures on them to look a certain way. However, the good news is that there are some observations about women that help us out:

1) When they love you, they really love you–I know this from experience. I really let myself go for a number of years; however, my girlfriend at the time still looked at me like I was the sexiest guy on earth. That is true love. When you are at your worst, a woman in love with you will still see you for who you are.

2) Body Language–woman are way more intuned to someone’s body language . Having strong body language demonstrates confidence. Confidence is sexy–by standing straight and simply looking them in the eye you have already demonstrated you are worthy of their attention

3) Trust Your Male Instincts–we really haven’t evolved that much over the years…just the way we do things. Back in the day, the man had to act like the man. Now it isn’t as black and white as it used to be. However, women really appreciate the little things. One day I had a flat tire with my girlfriend. Instead of calling a tow company, I decided to change it myself. I am far from handy, but I do have some survival skills. After it was done, my girlfriend told me it was the hottest thing she has seen. The funny thing was she probably could have it changed it herself, but she enjoyed it because it was the‘manly’thing to do. So don’t be afraid to be a man once in a while–your woman appreciates it more than you know.

The point of this post is losing weight and feeling better is about building a better you. Life isn’t fair. We don’t wake up rich and beautiful.

If you are a woman–don’t beat yourself up if you don’t look like someone from a magazine. We find you sexy in your own unique way.

If you are a man–go out and buy a nice looking outfit. Take your woman out, stand up straight and don’t be afraid to be a man.

We can learn from each other.

Have a healthy week!

 2012 STARTS TODAY 
 Posted on October 15, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
It was about this time over a year and a half ago I decided to make a change for the better. I used to be similar to everyone else:
you wait until the end of December or start of January to say, “This will be the year I get my health under control”. The problem with this is that like everyone else, you begin to lose motivation just after that first week.

To help make that statement a reality, you need to plan BEFORE the end of the year. The reason goes back to one of my original statements: “Consistency trumps Intensity”.

For some reason the moment Jaunary 1 st comes around,
people become hardcore. They eliminate carbs and go the gym like they are training for the Olympics.

What I recommend doing now is making those small changes before January comes around. This will help you start with a good base
and you will have already a running start. Some of the changes you can make right now include:

1)      Reducing the frequency you eat bad foods – if you eat McDonalds everyday, reduce it to every other day. If you drink a litre of Coke everyday, start to switch to Coke Zero…pick one of your worst habits and start to make small changes to it.

2)      Start hitting the gym – slowly! If you never go to the gym, don’t be a tool and jump into an old workout you did when you were 17 years old! Start by going for a walk three times a week…whatever you do, commit to doing it…no matter how small it may seem

3)      Figure out your 2012 goals – Start to think about this time next year…where will you be and where do you want to go. Here is a tip: Write yourself a letter! Sounds odd? It works! Write yourself a letter as if it is one year later and you met your goals. What would you talk about? How would you feel? The simple act of getting into a winner’s mindset is extremely powerful…then promise not to open up the letter until 1 year later (or whatever your timeframe is).

The key is not to wait until everyone else starts
making a resolution…seize your goals today!

Even the longest journey begins with a single step.

Have a healthy week!

 IDENTIFYING YOUR TRIGGER POINTS 
 Posted on September 24, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So what I wanted to do today is talk about your trigger points.
These are moments during your weight loss journey where it causes you to just go completely off course. Everyone has a trigger point and this terminology is usually reserved for addicts trying to overcome addiction. Think about a time when you were
progressing along in your goals and all of a sudden a thought develops in your mind. That thought usually derails or distracts you from your goals – for example, you are out with friends and
having a good time. You ate a healthy dinner and have no intention on cheating . Then someone orders dessert – it looks and sounds great – you start thinking about it wouldn’t be bad if you had a bite….then you start thinking that you ate a healthy dinner and deserve a
treat – you order an entire dessert and eat the whole thing. You immediately feel guilty about it.

That thought was brought on by a trigger point. Here are some of
my trigger points:

1) Pizza – My favourite sin food. Believe it or not,
you can actually have a healthy pizza ordered for yourself. Unfortunately, the moment one of my friends suggests it, the last thing I want to do is order a healthy pizza

2) Movies – Sounds strange? – Not for me…if I am
going to watch a good movie or even a TV episode I really want to see, it tends to bring out the urge to have popcorn, chips, and of course.. pizza!

3) After Work – Even when I was fat, the worst time
for me was after work. I actually wouldn’t be too bad in the morning or afternoon. However, once I head home from work all I can think about is eating something nasty or having a drink to unwind. Not sure why – just the way it is.

In the examples I gave above notice a trigger point is not isolated to a certain food, situation or person (and yes, a certain person in
your life can trigger you towards bad habits). The challenge is to identify all your trigger points and address them head on. Here are some tips on how I addressed the above:

Pizza – This will always be with me because it is just one of
those things. However, what I do is give myself a cheat day once a week. I use that to address any pizza cravings – if it doesn’t happen on the scheduled cheat day, I won’t allow myself to indulge. The reason this is effective is that you still maintain control. You gave yourself permission – so you don’t feel guilty. The trick is to schedule it so that it doesn’t happen as a spur of the moment decision

Movies – What I will do is actually have my dinner while
watching a movie or TV show at home. Instead of making it late at night where I can get hungry and crave those snacks, I will actually have it with my healthy dinner so that I don’t get the cravings during the movie.

After Work – This may sound a bit odd but I take a different
route home. The reason being is that my place is near or on the way to a number of fast food places. I take a separate way that makes it more difficult to go to those places. I literally have to do a U-turn to get into the place – which when I am tired after work, do not have the energy!

What I am attempting to teach you here is that those trigger
points were established through a routine in your life. At one point, I just started to grab bad food after work – next thing you know it becomes a bad routine. To avoid that you need to establish new routines that re-enforce your healthy lifestyle .

Take 20 minutes or so and list out all your Trigger Points . Then
beside each one think of a solution.

Have a healthy week!

 WHY START THIS BLOG? 
 Posted on January 8, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
12 Months ago, I was sitting in the dark watching TV. I was drunk as usually and it was the afternoon. As I looked around there were obvious cues that a massive feast took place, but no one else was in the room. Pizza boxes, wings, leftover take-out were spread across the kitchen and livingroom. As I looked over at my life in a drunken haze, I realized something had to give.

My life had steadily declined in terms of my health. I had struggled with weight my entire life, but things had come to a head. I had easily gained over 100 pounds in 3 years and have shut myself off from life, love and family. I was stuck in a relationship I didn’t want to be in and realized quickly how selfish I was.

Then comes 2010–I decided I needed to change. There was no other option. Since I hadn’t reached the suicide route, I knew there only one option: make 2010 The Best Year My Life.

Over the next 12 months, I made small changes that added up to huge accomplishments. I lost over 60 pounds, spent more time with family, received numerous awards from my profession, and even raised $1.5 Million for charity.

So I why am I here telling you (the reader) all of this?

I owe it to you that’s why.

If you are fat and scared–I can help. If you want to change your life–I can help. If you want to feel like you did before the weight gain–I can help.

The Cost?–Nothing. Actually that is a lie…

The cost is your commitment. The cost is that you wont look for quick fixes. The cost is that you pay it forward the same way I am doing.

I am not done with my journey. Far from it. However, I broke it and I can fix it. This blog will be used as a two-way street for me to provide you the tips and tricks on how to lose weight and change your life. Here are the areas I plan to discuss:

1) Realistic Goal Setting

2) Exercises

3) Diet

4) Routines

5) Dealing with Setbacks

6) Motivation

7) Temptation

I am not a literary genius; however, I will try to be as clear as possible. If you have any questions or comments, please include and will do my best to answer you.

I am not a trainer. I am not a  doctor. What I am is a former fat guy that was tired of being sick and tired.

Think about–what will you accomplish in 2011?

 The Longest Journey Begins With A Single Step 
 Posted on January 16, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
Today I wanted to talk about some general tips and tricks to get you started on your weight loss journey. These are things that I  learned over the years and really took to heart in 2010. Listed below are the core values I try to keep in mind each day. I plan to provide additional detail in future posts, but as a basis these will tips will help set yourself up for success:

 Rule 1: DEVELOP A REALISTIC PLAN WITHIN A REALISTIC TIMEFRAME: 

When I started I wanted to lose 100 pounds in 12 months. However, once I did the quick math, I knew that would be very difficult to achieve:  100 Pounds / 12 Months = 8.3 Pounds a month = 1.9 Pounds a week. In the beginning, that is achievable; however, it isn’t sustainable. I knew I could do well in the beginning, but sooner or later I would fall…this would not lead to long term success (which was my true measure of success). As a result, I revised my goal to 52 pounds in a year = 1 pound / week. You may think that this was a bit of sandbagging on my part–but it wasn’t. It was part of a larger picture–during my journey I knew there would be ups and downs, but if I consistently shot for 4-5 pounds a month, it would keep me focused. I looked at it from a simple standpoint: if I was 52 pounds lighter right now, would I be happier? The answer was YES!!! I ended up losing over 60 pounds and feel a lot better.

 Rule 2: WEIGHT LOSS IS NOT THE ONLY THING TO TRACK 

Part of a long term strategy is to track different fitness goals–not just weight loss. If losing pounds is your only goal, you have missed the point. At this point, you are probably ready to stop reading this blog and delete it from your favourites (lol). Losing weight is more than weight loss–it is about a lifestyle change that involves multiple accomplishments. What makes up a healthy lifestyle: how about number of days you are active, days you eat healthy/ unhealthy , number of KMs, your bench press weight, etc…you get the picture. What I did differently in 2010, was that each month I started tracking number of days I worked out, my bench press, number of laps I swam, number of days I ate unhealthy, etc…and yes, number of pounds lost. This was a way to keep me motivated–if I accomplished those other goals, then I would accomplish my weight loss goals as well. They go together and comprise the components of a lifestyle change. So, dont always track weight loss–track other components that help you achieve weight loss. I used an excel calendar spreadsheet (you can download for free–search google) and highlighted in yellow each day I would workout and highlighted in red if I ate unhealthy (I track a few different items but you get the picture). Also, try to weigh yourself once a week–not every day. Your weight will go up and down, but if you track it on a weekly basis it will keep you motivated and provide a measure of consistency.

 Rule 3: CONSISTENCY IS BETTER THAN INTENSITY 

I saw it in 2010, and see it this year as well. That first week of January is filled with new faces at the gym. During their first workout (in who knows how long), they absolutely kill themselves. The result: I don’t see them again till the summer. I used to be the same. What I learned was that I would rather work up a decent sweat but leave at least something on the table for the next workout. Whatever you do, make sure you consistently do it. This obviously depends on your current level of fitness. Small changes make big impacts. If you never exercise before, and then you go for a 20-minute walk 4 days a week–you will lose weight. Whatever you decide on in terms of a workout, make sure you dont kill yourself in the beginning–I started with a jog/walk on the treadmill 30 miuntes a day. I did this 5-6 days a week. That sounds like a lot, but I focused on consistency vs intensity. At the end of each session I felt good about going to gym, generating a sweat, and knowing I will/can make it the next day. What you find is that SUCCESS BREEDS SUCCESS–once I got into the zone, the intensity came NATURALLY. Sure, you see people on THE BIGGEST LOSER putting up huge numbers each week and say you want to do the same. The more calories you burn, the more you lose…but the key is consistency. That separates the long term winners from the short term losers. Whatever you decide on doing, make sure you can do it consistently. You will find that your changes will result in not only improve your health, but also your lifestyle.

 Rule 4: YOUR FIRST 3 WEEKS WILL BE A CHALLENGE 

It typically takes 3 weeks to develop a‘habit’. Depending on your current level of fitness and nutrition, the changes you implement in the beginning will be a bit of challenge. What worked for me was trying to schedule my calendar for those first 3 weeks so that it put me in the best position to avoid TEMPTATION. This isn’t easy because we have families, friends and work priorities–however, it is important to prioritize your health goals. This doesn’t mean checking into a hotel by yourself and avoiding phone calls. It means considering postponing (not avoiding) parties or social events that you know will tempt you. I know, I know, this isn’t easy. For me, I simply rescheduled business travel and social events until after those first 3 weeks. Some things you can’t avoid, so take a look at what your first 3 weeks look like and identify those dates that could de-rail your progress in the beginning. Another way to look at it is that after the first 3 weeks, you will have gained more confidence and will look and feel better–that is the best time to see people!

 Rule 5: IT IS NOT CHEATING IF YOU SCHEDULE IT 

I was your classic example of a guy who lost a ton of weight in a short period of time and then gained it all back (and then some) in an even shorter period of time. I couldn’t figure it out–I was either all in, or all out. I then considered having a CHEAT DAY. This 1 day a week that I could eat and drink what I wanted. I used it as a security blanket and a way to help me get through the other 6 days. Some people only schedule 1 cheat meal / once a week. Whatever you are comfortable with. For me, I used to eat McDonalds once a day and pizza/wings every night. So in relation, I reduced my habit from 7 days a week, to once a week. The funny thing was that after 6 days of eating healthy, I almost didn’t want to eat anything bad on the seventh day–I was on a roll–but it was there if I needed it. Try to plan ahead–if you know you are going to your favourite restaurant on Saturday, make that your cheat day…there is a difference between having it SCHEDULED vs a last second LOSS OF SELF CONTROL . Believe me I have been there–you are socializing with friends, you are hungry and just want to eat. What can it hurt? Next thing you know you feel bloated, tired, and realize that you just set a new wing-eating record. When I give myself permission, I plan ahead and remain in control.

So there you have it–I kept it pretty high level at this point, but don’t worry, I will get into specific details in future posts.

Cheers and have a healthy week!

 HOW TO DESIGN YOUR WORKOUTS 
 Posted on January 23, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So last week we talked about some general tips and tricks to get you started on your weight-loss journey. Today, I plan to drill down further and talk about Designing Your Own Workouts . I wont get into exact exercises (I will do that in a future posts), but will give you some fundamental tips what to do and how to do it.

1) DECIDE ON YOUR COMMITTED FREQUENCY –Last week I talked about Consistency vs Intensity. What you need to decide is how often will you workout. Remember: Whatever you decide, you need to consistently maintain it. I recommend at a minimum 4 days/week. I am more of a 6 day/week guy, but that is because I have adopted it as part of my routine. Lets say you pick 5 days/week. If you can, try to keep it the same 5 days: For example, Monday to Friday. This will help your mind and body develop a routine.

2) YOUR GOAL IS TO ADOPT A‘ROUTINE’–It typically takes 3 weeks of doing something consistently to develop a habit or routine. This isn’t strictly associated to working out, but also other good and bad habits. Your goal in the first 3 weeks so to make sure you get your workouts in as committed. This is the sweet spot–when you dont have drag yourself to the workout, you just naturally go there because you have trained yourself to.

3) DECIDE ON THE DURATION–A number of years ago I used to workout for 2 hours. No joke. However, I learned that an 1 hour (or less) is just as effective. You need to decide on how long you will workout. Make sure you time yourself and make it‘fit’your schedule. This will help you accept the fact it is part of your routine. Lets keep it simple–say 30 minutes. So at this point (from above example) we have committed to 5 days a week (Monday–Friday) @ 30 Minutes each session.

4) MORNING, AFTERNOON, OR NIGHT WORKOUT?–They typically suggest that morning is the best time to workout. However, pick whatever suits your needs and schedule. I am a morning guy–cant help it! I hate afternoon workouts and will not do them at night. The funny thing is that I see the exact same people in the gym in the morning. I have developed some good friends from going in the morning, but I will not try to convince you. Most people are not the morning type, so decide what fits for you and go from there.

5) GYM OR HOME GYM OR NO GYM?–I like the gym, but that doesn’t mean you need one. Remember what I said–Consistency vs Intensity. If all you can committ to right now is a 30 minute walk/5 days a week, than that is your gym. If you have some weights and home, than do that. There isn’t a perfect answer, just an answer that works for you.

6) TRAINER , WORKOUT PARTNER, OR SOLO?–Ok, so I will go against the grain on this one. I never relied on a trainer or a workout partner to get me to the gym. Am I crazy? No, I just didn’t want to rely on someone else to keep me motivated. What I do recommend though, is that if you know nothing about working out than seek the advice of a professional…to get you STARTED. I started working out at a young age and learned from books. However, a trainer can help design a program for you. With that being said– DONT RELY ON A TRAINER TO WORKOUT. I have trainer friends and love them. The challenge I see is that a lot of people will only go to the gym if they have scheduled it with their trainer. I also hear a lot of people tell me they have a love/hate relationship with their trainer–all in good fun. If you have the funds to spend on a trainer 5 days a week and it keeps you motivated…than fill your boots. However, at the end of the day, you need to rely on yourself. Trainer, no trainer, friend, solo, it doesn’t matter–you need to workout. Dont let anything influence you to do otherwise. A trainer can provide you a structured workout routine and will work you hard. That is their job. What I recommend though is to start slow. That is sustainable. So if you need a trainer or partner to make it to the gym, than make sure you have a backup if they are not available to come with you.

7) SUCCESS BREEDS SUCCESS–This was core in the beginning. I had no confidence, felt ackward, and lacked the discipline to consistently workout and eat healthy. However, once I started routinely going to the gym and eating healthy, I naturally evolved and increased my intensity. At the start it was 20 Minutes on the treadmill, now it 7.0 MPH on a 10 Incline. Part of a long term solution is to develop the routine of having a healthy lifestyle. This comes with practice–dont kill yourself in the beginning. The good news is that at the start anything incrementally healthy will benefit you.

8) WEIGHTS, CARDIO, OR BOTH?–So I will get into specific workout plans in future posts, but there is a place for both weights and cardio in your workout. In the beginning, if you have committed to a walk that is fine. Dont change it. But realize at one point you will need to incorporate weights into the routine. Weightlifting actually helps you lose weight–next week, I will talk about some awesome routines that can be done anywhere and for a short period of time. Depending on where you are from a physical standpoint, you may need to just keep it simple. What I would recommend is that whatever you do, try to change it up as well. This helps you work different body parts and avoids the routine being boring. So if you love the eliptical, use it, but start trying to incorporate the bike, treadmill, stairclimber as well…keep it fresh!

9) WEIGHING YOURSELF–Anytime you start a new routine you want to measure your performance. The real reason is that you are looking for additional ways to keep you motivated. I highly recommend weighing yourself ONCE A WEEK ONLY. Your weight can fluctuate throughout the week, but if you weigh yourself once a week that will give you an accurate picture. The best time to weigh yourself is FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. Dont eat anything beforehand -  it should literally be the first thing you do in the morning.

For those more advanced readers, I will get into specifics later on. I will also talk about recommended diet tips, books, pills, etc…stay tuned!

Have a healthy week!

 HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT BY LIFTING WEIGHTS 
 Posted on January 29, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So last week, I talked about the general practices and principles involved with designing a workout. Today I want to talk about one of the key ingredients to shed weight and lose body fat: CIRCUITS!

If at this point you have no idea what the hell a circuit is and why it is associated with working out, let me explain a few things first (bear with me if this is basic):

1)“REPS”–These are the number of repetitions you do of a certain exercise. For example, you do 30 Push ups .

2)“SETS’–Are the number of groups you complete of a particular exercise. For example, you did 3 sets of 30 Push ups (30 reps per set).

Typically you would have a brief rest in between SETS–the exception is if you are‘Super-Setting’(which wont be explained today) or doing a‘Circuit’

3)“CIRCUIT”–A circuit are a group of exercises completed in a row. So for example, if you did 10 push ups, 20 sit ups, 10 burpees and 30 jumping jacks. That would be 1 SET of your circuit. You don’t rest in between exercises–only after you have completed the SET. At that point you would rest for a brief period and then repeat.

I really started to lose weight when I started Circuit Training . It was insane. This has now become my favourite way to workout because it does 2 things–1) BUILDS MUSCLE AND 2) SHEDS FAT. The reason is that you are doing 2 good things at once: Cardio and Weight Lifting ! I also love this because you can do circuits anywhere and typically does not take that long to have a kick-ass workout.

What if you don’t have a gym? No problem. What I will do is layout a few different circuit workouts that are very basic and can be done anywhere.

1) AT A GYM–This is the easiest because there are a ton of options. If you are unfamiliar with a machine or exercises speak to a Trainer. Here is a very basic full body circuit that you can do at the gym:

Pick 5-7 exercises that you can do together–ie, you don’t have to run to different ends of the gym. Find equipment or free weights that are close by. Here is an example: a) Bench Press  b) dumbbell Flyes  c) Barbell Curls  e) Lounges f) Upright Rows

Pick a weight that you can do for 10-12 reps. Typically you can use the same barbell for your curls as you do for your upright rows (if you don’t know these exercises, check the internet–hopefully I can start posting pictures of these).  Grab your weights and place them near you. Then begin as follows with no break in between:

1) 10 Reps of Bench Press 

2) 12 Reps of dumbbell Flyes

3) 10 Reps of Barbell Curls

4) 12 Lounges on each leg

5) 10 Reps of Upright Rows (using same weight as your Curls)

Once you have done all those exercises–Rest for 1-2 Mins (depending on your level of fitness). Then repeat. Do this 3 times. At the end, if you are not tired than use heavier weights or complete the circuit 4 times. At the end your heart rate should be elevated, your muscles burning and guess what…it should only take you 20-25 Minutes to complete. You just worked out your entire body. You can obviously add additional exercises for your shoulders or triceps, but at the start, just hit the big muscle groups.

2) AT HOME OR A HOTEL ROOM–I used to hate travelling because I knew I wouldn’t workout and I would make an exercise that the hotel just didn’t have a gym. That is a BS excuse. You truly can exercise anywhere. The best thing about circuits is that you can combine any group of exercises. Here is one that can work well without any weights:  a) Push-ups  b) Crunches  c) Jumping Jacks  d) Burpees (you will need to look this one up) e) Lounges without weights

1) Push-ups x 20 Reps (or about 70-80% of your max amount)

2) Crunches x 40 Reps

3) Jumping Jacks x 50 Reps

4) Burpees x 12 Reps (these burn!)

5) Lounges x 12  Reps per leg

Same as above–complete the above and then rest for 1-2 Mins, then repeat for 3-4 circuits. This might take you longer because there are a large amount of reps…however, you should be done in 30 mins.

There you have it–2 very basic routines to get you started. The key ingredient is to pick 5-7 Exercises you can do that target different body parts. If you do Circuit Training 2-3 times a week you will not only lose weight, but also lose fat and gain muscle endurance.

Till next time….HAVE A HEALTHY WEEK!

 CONFESSING YOUR FAT SINS 
 Posted on February 6, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So this week I was going to talk about Nutrition dos and don’ts; however, I decided to talk a bit about the emotional effects of obesity. Before we do that, I wanted to give you some further background on me. My story is nothing new and unfortunately is becoming more and more of trend throughout the US and Canada . I struggled with my weight for most of my life. One day my uncle gave me this old school‘Gold Gym’s Workout Book’and I started learning about proper nutrition and exercise. The problem was that I become either completely intense about workout or I did not care–there was no in-between. Unfortunately, this led to bouts of massive weight-loss followed by massive weight-gain . I can count about 6 times in my life where I was in complete extremes of spectrum. I recognized a growing trend–every time I lost weight I gained it back and more. Until I peaked in 2009 and was in extremely bad shape. Not just,‘Oh looks like you gained a few point’–more like,‘Do you need to see a doctor?’.

It was during these times that I committed a number of Sins. So in the spirit of full disclosure, I wanted to admit to my sins in the hopes that maybe you (the reader) recognize these signs early and avoid making the same mistakes:

SIN #1–AVOIDED ALL FAMILY MEMBERS: So this one is big because it impacted my family members. I moved away from home when I was 18 to go to University. Since it was a long distance away, I would only see my family once maybe twice a year. Once my career started, it was pretty much the same. The problem was that once I gained all this weight, I didn’t want to see them. I felt ashamed and I didn’t want to go through that. You see, going back to home town is like a high school reunion–regardless of my professional success, my image screamed,‘Failure’. I was too proud and vain to do that. As a result, I spent the last 3 Christmas ‘alone. The impact of that was lost time with the people I loved. I can’t get that time back–and given the age of my parents, they don’t have much time left. It was selfish and I blame myself for it all. The good news is that since I have lost the weight, I havent done that again. Regardless of the weight, you should never avoid your family; but that is why this is a drug - you don’t think straight and make decisions that impact others.

SIN #2–LIED TO FRIENDS: So for the first few years of my career I was what they called,‘ Mobile ‘–this meant I could/would be relocated across the country. This really helped my career. Unfortunately, when I moved back I was getting closer to my peak weight and did not want to see any of friends. These are people I grew up with and/or friends from University. They meant a lot to me. However, I did not want to see them when I looked like this. As a result, I would lie to them in order to avoid seeing them–eventually the phone stopped ringing. I was alone and depressed. During 2010, I made a resolution to get together with them at least once a month. Sure I was still training and losing weight, but I needed to repair the damage that was done. These lies extended to special occasions as well–marriages, birthdays, parties…I missed a lot of special moments due to my weight. The good news is that although I have lost contact with some, I remain strong with the core friends. The weight gain cost me more than years off my life–I lost some good friends as well.

SIN #3–CAUSED PAIN TO EX-GIRLFRIEND. So when I started to working at my company, I had a crush on this girl. She had an amazing personality and I just wanted to be with her. Eventually when I moved away for work, we lost contact. However, when I got back we started talking. We then went on a date and I admitted to my crush. She felt the same way. Next thing I know I am in 2 year relationship with this great girl. We broke up in 2009 because we wanted two different things (she wanted kids and I didn’t). Looking back we weren’t right for each other at the time and it should have ended there. However, I started calling her again. She was still in love with me and I just felt lonely. What you have to realize is that for most guys, girls don’t randomly hit on them. I am a decent looking guy, but at the time, I was obese. As a result, talking to a girl that still loves you is a major confidence booster. As a result we went back and forth until mid 2010. My sin was that I couldn’t just let her go because I didn’t think anyone else would love me. This wasn’t fair to myself or her. I still miss her, but I know she isn’t right for me. It was tough letting go the only area in your life that gave you confidence–however, it needed to be done for both her and I.

There you have it–my top 3 sins. You can see the common themes and trends. Avoidance, Low Self Esteem, etc…the challenge is that you know you are doing these things, you are just too self-absorbed to care. The weight changes who you are and those around you. Make a change in your life - not just for yourself, but for those around you.

Have a healthy week.

 BASICS ON NUTRITION 
 Posted on February 13, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So as promised, today I wanted to start talking about nutrition . Eating poorly has always been my problem. For the most part, I was active and enjoyed working out–but I loved eating unhealthy. To make any type of change, I knew I had to get a handle on my nutrition. So I started doing a bit of research on the 4 basic food groups. It sounds easy, but to go from eating essentially no vegetables, to eating 8-10 servings a day was a stretch. However, once I learned more about the goods and bads about nutrition, my results started to take-off.

So lets examine these Food Groups :

 1) Vegetables and Fruit: 8-10 Servings a day 

I love Fruit, but hate vegetables. So what I did start doing was incorporate small servings throughout the day. I didn’t measure out a serving or anything like that, I just started to consciously incorporate more vegetables. For example, I would have a small bag of carrots and celery with hummus. I love hummus, but you could use any low fat option. 1/2 cup of vegetables is 1 serving. During my main meals I would cook vegetables in different ways. All you need to do is pick a vegetable and look up a quick recipe on the internet. Quick recipes are a great way to turn a crappy tasting vegetable into a tasty option. You can also drink V8 or some other vegetable/fruit drink. ***Caution–always look at the sugar content and calories before resorting to drinks. Some of these are 200 calories a serving–that is a lot. The sugar content may be from natural occuring sources, however, nothing beats the real thing. I do like salads–so I started making these different salad recipes as well (I will share some recipes in a future post). It is a great way to get 3 servings into 1 meal. ***Caution–the salad dressing turns a healthy meal into a nutritional nightmare. When choosing salad dressings try to pick one that has 2.5-3 Grams fat per tbsp. These are usually the‘reduced calorie option’–but check to make sure.

 2) Grain Products: 6-7 Servings per day 

So I am going to go down a bit of a tangent here, but it is important to note that,“YOUR BODY NEEDS CARBS !!!”. Carbs help fuel your body and severely reducing your intake will lead to a drop in energy and a swing in emotions. Trust me, I have been to that movie. What you should do is start consciously introducing Good Carbs into your diet. These are whole grain options like bread, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, etc…to go from eating white refined carbs all day and night to no carbs at all is ridiculous. Going back to previous post,“MAKE SMALL INCREMENTAL CHANGES”–so instead of having that white bagel, switch to whole wheat. Then reduce it to a half whole wheat bagel. In a future post I will talk about some of the fad diets I have been on and what has worked and what wasn’t. However, for now, think long term - not short term. Sustainability is the key. Your grain intake can be from anywhere–cereal, oatmeal, toast, potatoes, etc…

Oatmeal is one of the best breakfast options out there. It keeps you full and it is a slow burning carbohydrate. That means it keeps burning within your system and it slows down the conversion into sugar. I love the Instant Oatmeal packets–I usually have 1 1/2 packets for breakfast. ***Caution: Watch out for the flavoured options because they do have a lot of sugar. They have now come out with‘REDUCED SUGAR’options which is good. Here is a quick recipe I use with Natural Oatmeal (i.e. no flavour):

- 1 1/2 Packets of Instant Oatmeal

- 1/2 Banana

- 1/2 Handful of ground walnuts

- 1 Tbsp of Chocolate Flavoured Protein Powder

This is amazing. The protein powder gives it some chocolatey flavour with the protein, but without the sugar. This will keep you going for a while. Because it is Instant Oatmeal you can essentially have it anywhere.

 3) Milk and Alternatives: 2-3 Servings a day 

This surprised me–I would have thought it to be higher. However, when you think about it, it makes sense. If you had 1 cup of milk with each meal you would reach it. However, you can also have 175 grams of yogurt as well. Obviously this also includes Cheese as another alternative. Yogurt is great for you–if you read the back of the label you will see it is filled with nutritional goodness. Yogurt also keeps you full–so it makes a great snack. Like most packaged products, you should read the label. The fat content should be less than 3 grams per serving. Calories should be 100 or less. Watch out for the sugar content as well–however, if it meets the first 2 requirements you should be ok. I have a portable package every day.

 4) Meat and Alternatives: 2-3 Servings a day 

I love meat! But this is not limited to steak–it also includes Fish and Chicken. I used to hate Fish. But I started experimenting with some recipes and really started to enjoy it. The killer for meat is the Fat content. Basic rule of thumb: 1 serving of meat should fit the palm of your hand. Anything more you are probably having more than you need. Similar to salads, what kills the nutritional value are the sauces used when cooking meat. These are riddled with sugar, fat and calories you don’t need. I love chicken wings more than life itself. However, I started cooking an alternative that is just as good (well, close to it anyways!): Skinless Chicken Drumsticks. With chicken the skin is filled with fat. So I started buying Skinless Chicken Drumsticks and cooked them as follows:

- 10 Skinless Chicken Drum Sticks

- Salt and Pepper

- Paprika

- Olive Oil (optional)

- Jerk Spice or any other spice (Tarragon, red peppers, etc…)

I will drizzle a little bit of Olive Oil on the drumsticks, then season with salt and pepper. Then some of the Jerk spice and a little bit of Paprika. But them in the oven for 20 Mins @ 375 Degrees. Flip over and cook for another 10 Mins. You can jazz them up with really anything, but this receipe keeps the fat and calorie content down. I usually have 2-3 Chicken drumsticks as a serving.

So there you have it–some real basic information on the 4 Food Groups. I did not talk about Good Fats/Bad Fats, but will in a future edition. I will also talk about a detailed meal plan as well.

Have yourself a healthy week!

 IS THAT YOUR LUNCHBOX OR BOWLING BAG? 
 Posted on February 19, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
Ok, so on the heels of last week’s post, I wanted to talk about what a typical meal plan looks like for me and the thought/theory behind it. When I am in the office I typically carry in a large bag that borderlines between being a lunch box and a bowling bag. I laugh about it myself and sometimes need to rearrange other people’s lunch in the office refrigerator to accommodate this large beast. Why do I carry around this thing? Well, its simple. The last thing I want to do throughout my day is run out of food. I learned this a while ago and it continues to serve me well today. When you first start changing your eating habits you become very vulnerable to your own urges. Working in an office environment offers a wealth of temptation–anything from cookies, cakes, elaborate lunches or dinners. Take your pick…any one of these obstacles can send you right back to where you dont want to be. As a result, I started packing my own breakfast, lunch and snacks for the day. These add up, but allow me to stay focused, satisfied and nutritional sound. So what is in my in bag? Here it is–a breakdown of what and when I eat throughout the day:

7:30 am–1 1/2 scoops of protein powder with water

8:30 am - 1/2 a banana

10:30 am–1 1/2 packets of instant plain oatmeal, 1/2 banana (the other half), a handful of walnuts, 1/2 scoop of protein powder –all mixed together

12:30 pm–Big Salad, with some protein on top (chicken, beef, pork, etc…) and 1 slice of whole wheat toast

3:00 pm–1 scoop of protein powder mixed with water

3:30 pm–carrots, celery with hummus

4:00 pm–1 package of yogurt

4:30 pm–a few slices of low fat luncheon meat

5:00 pm–2 handfuls of almonds with cashews

5:30 pm–100 calorie Fibre 1 granola bar 

7:00 pm (prepared at home)- asparagus, mushroom caps, and protein, 1 piece of fruit

So you might look at the above and say,“What the hell? That is a crap load of food…how can you eat that much?”Well, the truth is that I need that amount of food to keep me going throughout the day. Sure, I could probably cut back a few items here and there, but I dont need to. Following the above plan has allowed me to drop 73 pounds (as of last Sunday!) and cut my body fat in half. If you look at what I am consuming it covers all the food groups (remember last week’s post), allows for a treat (the small granola bar), enables whole grain carbs, and just tastes great! Of course you would need to tailor your meal plan to your age and sex. I am male in my early 30s. I workout an hour a day, but since I work in an office, I dont burn many calories in the afternoon or night.

 So How Can You Apply This To Your Own Meal Plan? 

First off, write down your typical meals (and when) throughout the day….the good, the bad, the ugly. When are you at your hungriest? For me it was around 2pm–6pm…once you have your daily meals planned out start making SMALL changes to improve it. Here is an example:

 BEFORE: 

8:00am–Bagel with cream cheese and XL coffee with cream and sugar

10:00am–someone brought in muffins: you take 1 blueberry muffin

12:00 pm– McDonalds , Burger King , etc….burger, fries, coke

3:00 pm–snack on some chocolates or cookies or donuts around the office

6:30 pm–on the ride home you pickup takeout from your favourite fast food joint or you order pizza when you get home.

 AFTER: 

7:00 am–a bowl of healthy cereal, coffee with milk (instead of cream), and sugar-free sweetener,  and an orange or apple

10:00 am–you take the bran muffin or low fat muffin instead of blueberry muffin

12:00 pm–you brought in a sandwich and some soup

2:00 pm–you have some carrot sticks, celery with low fat peanut butter

4:00 pm–You have a banana and yogurt mixed together

5:00pm–just before leaving the office you grab a granola bar

7:00pm–at home you have some chicken (without skin), some potatoes (no butter) and a side salad.

You can definitely see the different between both days. The“Before”meal is riddled with calories, fat, and there is no nutritional value . The“After”meal is much more healthier–you should have more vegetables than the scenario I spelled out; however, at the start just make SMALL CHANGES. Notice at 5:00pm on the After meal, I grabbed a granola bar before leaving the office? That is because if I feel full or at least partially satisfied, I wont want to drop by McDonalds on the ride home!

 Cheat Day: 

After posting, I remembered a very important aspect to maintaining a sustainable diet–scheduling a cheat day or meal. I mentioned this a few posts ago, however, it definitely belongs here. 1 day a week, I will give myself permission to have a‘cheat day’. This is a no-holds day where I can eat and drink what I want. When you go from eating fast food or crap 7 days a week to 1 day/week, you will lose weight. In reality, I dont really use that day. I eat normal meals; however, it is there if I need it. Once I realized I didn’t have to be perfect all the time, it made it so much easier to follow a plan. Sundays are my usually day where I will cook some cool new receipes and usually enjoy a glass of wine. It helps me enjoy the moment. When I first started, I usually had 1 meal that was devoted to my food vice–Pizza. Now that I have done this for 13+ months, I no longer crave it. However, if I am out for dinner or lunch I have that 1 day I can eat what I want. The bottom line here is to give yourself permission to enjoy life, good food and friends.

 What About Counting Calories ? 

I like to keep things simple, so I don’t count calories…however, I am aware of them. There is a difference–I couldn’t tell you how many calories I have in a day but I know what is going into my body provides me the nutritional substance needed…it is as simple as that. When I buy food I dont usually buy I will check the back of the label…sometimes I am surprised, sometimes I am not. The key here is to commit to small changes…they really add up.

So review your current eating routine and make some small fundamental changes to it. Pay attention to the time of day as well–your body is used to a routine…it can be a good or a bad routine…the choice is up to you.

Have a healthy week!

 WEIGHT-LOSS PILLS&amp;OTHER SUPPLEMENTS 
 Posted on February 23, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So if you have ever been overweight, you have probably considered weight loss pills. I could devote an entire blog to this topic–but I wanted to talk about some of the pros and cons, and what has worked for me. There are a plethora of pills available on the market today and it seems like each one promises you will be ripped in a few weeks. All you have to do is take a few pills each day and voila…you are beach ready and a walking underwear model. In a place I refer to as,“Real Life”that just isnt possible.

However, there are some supplements that can help you maximize your workouts and help minimize your appetite. Before considering any pill–consult your doctor and understand the side effects.

What works? What Doesn’t?

Before I get into that, I should explain a very important concept:

 ANY WEIGHT LOSS PILL IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE EFFORT YOU PUT BEHIND IT! 

There is no magical pill–trust me, I have looked! What does work is a pill that is used as a“SUPPLEMENT”to your workouts. Not a REPLACEMENT. If you dont put the effort in at the gym, you will not see results. Certain pills contain caffeine and green tea extract–these aide in the suppression of appetite. There are a number of different ingredients that are said to help reduce fat in your body. There are fat burners, weight loss pills , carb-blockers, etc…you name it, there is a pill for it.

I could probably devote an entire month worth of posts about supplements; however, I wanted to tell you what worked and what didn’t work for me. In future posts I can dig a little deeper in each one.

1) HydroxyCut / Xenderine - I took both of these (on separate occasions) back about 10 years ago. I was working out pretty hard and was looking for something to give me that extra boost. Both pills worked well: 1) I had extra energy  2) My appetite was reduced 3) I had a euphoric feeling when working out. I took 3 pills in the morning and 3 pills in the afternoon. I preferred Xenerdine because I found it gave me more energy than Hydroxcut. I lost about 30 pounds in 10 weeks. After I lost the weight, I stopped using them. Eventually I gained the weight back (my fault not the pills) and started taking Xenedrine again. But I didn’t get the same high during my workouts and it did not really have an impact on my appetite. I switched to HydroxyCut - same lackluster effect. I did some research and found that one of the key ingredients in both of these pills is something called“Ephedrine”. Epherdrine had been linked to heart attacks and was eventually  banned in the US and Canada. As a result, both of the producers could not include this ingredient in any of their supplements. This dramatically reduced the effectiveness of both HydroxyCut and Xenedrine. If you search either of these brands you will see mountains of research–I am not a doctor, nor am I a scientist. There are a lot of testimonies out there so spend some time looking into these. They may work for you–personally, I found that once they removed Ephedrine (which was for good reasons) they were not as effective. It was a pain in the ass to take 3 pills in the morning and then again in the afternoon.

2) Creatine–Creatine was (and still is to a degree) the foundation of any bodybuilder’s supplementary diet. It can be found naturally in high protein foods like fish, chicken or beef. However, when taken in its powdered form, it seems to draw water into your muscles and gives you a‘bigger’look. I call it‘bigger’but some people might call it‘bulkier’. I started taking this in University and found that my strength went through the roof and my biceps, shoulders and chest got huge. Here is the rub–once I got off creatine, I stopped working out and quickly turned it into fat. Creatine should not be used to loss weight–it will increase your strength and overall performance in sports, but it wont take an over weight person and turn them in a lean fighting machine. If you have problems gaining weight (yes, I hate all of you type of people….just joking) and want to gain some muscle mass, creatine will do wonders. When you start taking Creatine you need to go through a very annoying‘Loading Phase’. This consists of taking the powder with water (or grape juice) for 5 days straight x 3 times a day. After that, it can be taken before or after your workout. There are different types of creatine on the market; however the best is called,“Monohydrate Creatine”. Creatine works well if you want to build some size and strength.

3) NO2 - NO2 is a muscle builder that is designed to help you build lean muscle . Have you ever really pushed your workout hard and felt that‘pump’feeling in your arms or chest? This supplement helps prolong that feeling for a long time. After taking it and working out, you feel like you have just won Mr Universe. It also gave me insane strength–I took this back in 2007 and had a steady drop in body fat and got some decent results. One of the biggest drawbacks is the cost–it is incredibly expensive. The product works well, but if you are looking to just drop some weight (nothing fancy) this product is overkill.

There are a lot of other supplements I have taken but I just cant remember them at the moment. However, as you can see, I am guilty of the same thing I warned you about at the start of this post. Sure, I did mix in a good workout program with the supplements; however, I didn’t have a long term plan in place…just a quick fix. I have learned over the years: I didn’t quick fix anything…I merely temporarily solved a problem that would come back to haunt me. Lesson learned and now I am a wiser man.

So….you are probably thinking,“Great Thanks…all that for nothing! I just want to lose weight and get healthy”. Well, you are in luck–to start off, I recommend the following:

1) Protein Powder –You can’t lose with this. Everyone needs protein and an extra amount is usually a good thing. Your body can only absorb 20-25 Grams of protein every couple of hours. When choosing a protein powder, I look for the following:

a) Whey Protein–this is the best type of protein powder to buy and provides one of the highest quality of protein. You can find it anywhere in health stores or even your local supermarket

b) Low Fat /Low Calories–Some proteins are designed to help you gain weight (yeah I know roll your eyes now!). Choose a protein that is lower in calories–the nutritional info is on the back and measured per‘Scoop’. You usually only need 1- 1 1/2 scoops a serving.

c) Low Carb –I go for the low carb option because I actually have protein as a snack. It is quick and can easily absorb in a drink.

2) MULTI- VITAMIN–I take a good multi-vitamin everyday. It seems to work well for me and I haven’t been sick in over a year. I used to get sick 2-3 times a year. This helps you get the added vitamins and minerals in your diet. So I recommend finding a multi-vitamin that fits your lifestyle–they have designed ones for kids, adults, seniors, active lifestyles, etc…pick the one that suits your situation.

So there you have it. If you are looking to start supplementing your healthy lifestyle start with Protein Powder and a Multi- Vitamin . Before taking any additional supplements  (as the ones listed above) consult your doctor and understand the side-effects. Do your research!–Just because you see a“Before and After”picture, doesn’t mean it is right for you. Either way, remember the key message here: It is a Supplement, Not A Replacement! 

Have a healthy week!

 KEEPING IN SHAPE WHEN ON THE ROAD 
 Posted on March 5, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So this week I found myself on the other side of the country from Monday to late Thursday. In my previous role with the company, I was on the road for 2-3 days out of the week. However, in my current role, I don’t get the chance to travel too much. Which is a good thing when you are trying to lose weight.

I’ll be honest–I was a bit nervous being on the road and having to keep up my training and nutrition. Anyone who has spent some time travelling for a living is familiar with the following scenario:

1) Get Up–not a great sleep because you are in a strange bed

2) Breakfast –a plethora of fatty foods (fried eggs, bacon, hashbrowns) with limited healthy options

3) Intense meetings or workshops until lunch

4) Lunch can be somewhat healthy (soup, sandwiches)–but you are starving because you haven’t eaten since 7am

5) More intense workshops and/or meetings

6) Break –coffee and cookies/sweets

7) Dinner –which comprises of some elaborate place that just begs you to stuff yourself

8) Drinks –you have to go for drinks right? This turns into a bonding experience with co-workers where you dont go to sleep till midnight if you are lucky…usually 1am and beyond

Sound familiar? Well, you will be happy to hear that I stayed focused throughout my travel time and ate as healthy as I could. How did I do it?–Some Planning and Some Scariface:

 TIP #1–PICK A HOTEL THAT HAS A GYM 

Most places these days have a gym or some type of fitness centre. In some cases you dont get to pick where you are staying–however, most places have some type of place to workout. If not, do some exercises in your room or go for a jog/walk. The place I was at had a decent hotel-style gym

 TIP #2– PLAN YOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS 

So you should know what your schedule will be like when you are on the road–when you start, generally when you have a break and when the night ends. For me I knew we were starting meetings at 8am. As a result, I knew I had to be down for breakfast by 7am at the latest. That means, I had to workout before that (and have time to shower and change). That meant I had to wake up around 5am. I know, I know, it isn’t easy. I am a morning guy, but for those that hate mornings this is tough. However, I made the commitment in my head and I ensured that I stayed focused. If I had to get up at 5am, that meant I had to go to bed early. When the night was wrapping up, I was off to my room to get some sleep

 TIP #3–DONT LOSE CONTROL 

When you know that you will be away for a few days on business there is a tendency to treat it like a VACATION. You eat what you want, you drink, and basically let loose. It’s just for a few days right? Wrong–you get back home, feel guilty and basically either beat yourself up or slip into your old ways. For me, I knew I couldnt eat as well as I could. So I made the best choices I could: sticking to fruit and veggies as snacks, having small portions of other food that could be unhealthy, etc…I remained in CONTROL. Did I have some of the fried chinese food on the first day? Yes, but it was very, very limited. When you set limits for yourself you remain in control. This feeling will keep you focused throughout your travels.

 TIP #4–MAKE A COMMITMENT 

So I planned not to drink…and I didn’t. To avoid temptation, I avoided some of the after hours events. I knew I would get myself in trouble. To me it wasn’t worth it. You may commit to working out 2 of the 3 days, or only drinking 1 of the days, etc…whatever it is, set limits on what you will do and what you wont.

 TIP #5–PICK A WAKE UP TIME AND SLEEP TIME 

This goes back to Tip #1–but focuses on when you plan to be in bed and when you plan to wake up. This will allow you to know your limit when heading out afterwards. I used to go with the flow of the evening and see where it took me. Here is what used to happen:

1) Go to dinner–&gt;2) Go for a few drinks afterwards—&gt;3) Stay up with some of the hardcores—&gt;4) Grab late night (early morning) fastfood snack—5) Sleep like shit—&gt;6) Feel like shit the next day—-&gt;7) Eat a classic‘hangover’breakfast

Wash and repeat. This time I did the following:

1) Go to dinner—&gt;2) Stay for 1 drink ( Diet Pepsi )—&gt;3) Head to bed—&gt;4) Sleep ok (for a hotel)—&gt;5) Wake up and go to the hotel gym—&gt;6) Eat a healthy breakfast

Plan it right and you can stay focused as well.

 TIP #6–IF YOU CAN, BRING SOME FOOD FROM HOME 

Obviously you arent bringing last night’s lasagna. However, if you bring some almonds, granola bars, maybe some bananas, protein powder, etc…you can at least have some of the food with you to help you get through the day. Dont be afraid to bring it to the meeting. During the break, you can eat some of your healthy food as opposed to the typically sugar-based snacks most conferences provide.

It may sound like a lot of work and planning for just a few days; however, it can make the difference between staying focused and getting side-tracked. If this is part of your new lifestyle, you need to figure out what is included and what isn’t. Even if you commit to one thing, make sure you stick to it…at all times, in all places.

Have a healthy week!

 SOUTH BEACH DIET–A FULL REVIEW 
 Posted on March 13, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
If you have ever been overweight, obese, or just wanted to lose some extra pounds, you have probably tried some type of fad diet. You know, the ones that promise large weight loss in a short period of time…

I have been there, done that, and seen the movie twice…

What I wanted to talk about today was one particular diet and how it has actually helped me: the SOUTH BEACH DIET

At the end of September of last year, I had hit a peak in my weight loss. I wasn’t going anywhere and started to lose my focus. October and November were terrible months and I started to pack on the weight again and was heading down a really bad road. As a result, I knew I was at a fork in the road: 1) Continue down this path of self-destruction or 2) Stop it now, refocus and keep pushing myself. I chose option 2. I truly believe if I hadn’t made that decision, I would be well on my way back to the weight I had worked so hard to lose. To do so, I bent one of my golden rules to avoid FAD DIETS. I mentioned‘bent’as opposed to‘break’because I looked at it as longer term solution. I started to research the SOUTH BEACH DIET. What I liked about this one was that it is meant to be a longer term solution. You will find it is very similar to the Atkins Diet–only it promotes lower fat protein choices.  I will give you the cole notes version of it:

 Focuses on 3 Phases: 1) 2 Week Phase 2) Continuation Phase 3) Maintenance Phase Objective: Lose weight by reducing your carb and sugar intake and normalizing your blood sugar levels 

 PHASE 1: 2-WEEK STAGE: 

This is the hell stage. For 2-weeks you are not allowed to have any carbs in your diet. This includes avoiding dairy (with the small exception of cheese), fruit, and grains. Obviously alcohol is banned as well. They estimate that you will lose 8-12 pounds during this period. It sounds easy, but it isn’t. So what can you eat?–I have attached a good link for a list of recipes:

﻿ www.southbeach-diet-plan.com/receipecollection.html 

Without going through the entire list, the approved foods include:

- Most Vegetables with the exception of higher sugar items like carrots

- Coffee

- Nuts, Seeds, etc…

- Eggs

- Most Meats, Fish, Chicken - try to ensure they are lower fat-choices

- Low sugar/no sugar sweet snacks (Fudgeicles, no sugar added fruit pops)

- Limited qtys of low fat cheese

If you do some research there are an exact list of foods allowed. What happens during phase is that you find yourself incredibly restricted. It forces you to have a hard look at what you put into your body and you become‘super-aware’of any food you eat. Unfortunately, what it doesn’t tell you is that it can impact your emotional swings. Reducing your carbs is not a good thing–but the objective during the 2-week period is to help normalize your blood sugar levels, so that when you do introduce carbs into your diet, your body can properly digest and absorb.

 PHASE 2–Continuation Phase 

This phase is much more reasonable. You can start introducing carbs and alcohol back into your diet. However, it is more about a restricted portion of it. For example, 1 slice of whole grain toast vs your usually 2-3 slices. You can have fruit, milk, and of course vegetables are always encouraged. This stage can last as long as you want. The estimated weight loss is 1-2 pounds a week. You can say that I am still in this stage. You can use the same link I listed above to see recipes and foods included.

 PHASE 3–Maintenance Phase 

This is similar to Phase 2–the only really difference is that portion isn’t controlled, just common sense. You should avoid refined carbs (e.g., white bread), but it is meant to be your plan for life. No weight loss–simply maintaining your current weight.

So….the big question is how much have I lost on this?–For me, the 2-week period was only 6.5 pounds. That included working out (which it does not take into account). However, I have dropped a lot since then. Here are the key things to keep in mind with this diet:

 Don’t Do This Purely For The Weight Loss– Why I liked this is that after the 2-weeks, I was incredibly focused on my nutrition. It just happens that way: after you restrict yourself for 14 days, even 1 piece of bread is like a gift from heaven! What this has done for me, is that it forced me to enjoy more vegetables and I have kept the same recipes even after Phase 1. Don’t Do This As Your First Course of Weight Loss Action– I did this after 9 months of working out and maintaining a good diet. I didn’t jump into this on Day 1 of January 2010. This isn’t a quick fix. To go through Phase 1 takes a lot of discipline and if you dont even have the basics together, you wont make it. As a result, I recommend starting through basic changes in your diet (see my previous posts) and eventually work your way into this when you are mentally ready for it. This Isn’t About Phase 1 Only - I know, I know, if you can just lose 8-12 pounds in 2 weeks, you will be good to go. It doesn’t work that way. To lose it and keep it off, you need to have a long term plan. This diet helps you get there if you look at it as a lifestyle change, not a 2-week quick fix solution. Book time off or clear your calendar for Phase 1– That sounds crazy right? Wrong. Due to the fact phase 1 only includes certain foods, you find yourself cooking all the time. You have to–you cant just have salad for all your meals. Also the mood swings can be a bit difficult. I found little things got to me and I have heard of similar experiences from others. As a result, if you do go down this road, make sure you can dedicate the appropriate time needed. Take The Time To Try New Foods - What I liked about this diet was that it forced me to try new recipes and vegetables. I hate vegetables, but through this, I have learned to enjoy a bunch of things I never thought I would. Dont Just Diet– This statement doesn’t just apply for this, but in general. Dieting is only a part of the puzzle–you need to be active. You can lose weight and still be unhealthy. You need to exercise and this will help supplement your new lifestyle. 

So would I recommend this to everyone? The short answer is no. I would recommend it to those that want to incorporate this into a longer term plan. For me this wasn’t about the quick weight loss. For me, it got me refocused for December and helped drive me past my goals. I found that I am now much more aware of my diet (which was pretty good when I started this a year ago) and helps take me to that next level.

If you have any further questions, let me know.

Have a Healthy Week!

 HOW TO OVERCOME SETBACKS 
 Posted on March 19, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
I would be lying if I said 2010 was a perfect year. There were a few months where I had my fair share of setbacks. When you are focused on a goal sometimes you hit that‘breaking point’. When you just want to let loose and forget all about proper nutrition and working out . For me, that was usually the first step to gaining back all the weight . It’s that moment when you start justifying your past success so that you don’t feel guilty about what you are about to do.

So why do I feel the need to bring this up? The answer is that I had my first setback this week. A few posts ago, I talked about staying healthy when travelling. I found myself this week on the east end of the nation in a pretty cool city. I had done all the right things: I worked out the morning of my flight, packed my gear, and even called the hotel to find out what type of gym they had. Unfortunately, by the time we had dinner it was late and I was starving. I ended ordering a pretty healthy meal, but followed up with 2 big pints of beer . Not bad, but I didn’t plan to drink and it was a spur of the moment type of thing. I did get up and workout the next day. I did eat healthy up until dinner.

Going back to the hotel I had mixed feelings about what I wanted to do. I had this overwhelming urge to eat pizza and drink some beer. Not sure why. Unfortunately I gave into that urge. I had a big pizza, some dessert and about 3 beers. Anyone who has been reading my blog knows I am a big fan of small changes and keeping things in moderation. I lost control that night and just ate.

So for some of you that may be a daily activity. Some of you may say,“ok, no big deal man…its not going to kill you”. To a degree you are right. Why beat myself up for it? Well, the answer is not that I am worried that meal will force me to gain all my weight back. I am worried about the mental side of things. In the past when I did something like that it would bleed into the next few days.

The funny thing was that after I did it, I felt like saying‘screw it’–I’m not working out tomorrow. That would usually lead me to saying,“well I am not working out today, I might as well call it a cheat day and eat what I want”….wash and repeat. That has been my cycle for a long term. So what did I do?

I refocused on my month end goal. I went to sleep and got up and worked out the next day. I could only manage a few hours of sleep (probably due to the food and alcohol). I went back to my routine ASAP. I didn’t wait for myself to start negotiating workouts and proper nutrition…in short, I GOT BACK IN CONTROL.

That night could have easily turned into something nasty. However, I stayed strong afterwards and refocused my efforts. For anyone who knows what I am talking about, you have probably been there. You got some success and feel you‘deserve’a break. You probably do, but make sure you remain in control.

In summary,

 If you have a breakdown, move past it mentality. Don’t beat yourself up. Record it, and move on. Workout the next day…no matter what. If I hadn’t woken up and worked out, I probably would have started a string of destructive behaviour. Do something, do anything, but don’t go back to those old habits. Stay focused on your short and midterm goal–I try to keep my goals on a monthly basis. That is what I hold myself accountable for. Crap can hit the fan throughout the month, however, when it comes to that month end weigh in, that is what you are accountable for. Don’t think, just do–I found the more time I had to waffle around, the less likely I was to workout that next day. I started negotiating with myself to stay in bed. Whatever it takes, don’t think about it…just do it. 

I realize this is not a 911 signal. However, I do realize that for me, food had become a drug. Like any other addiction you need to embrace your vulnerability and avoid falling off the wagon. Unlike drugs, it is ok to occasional indulge into your cravings. Just make sure you remain in control.

Have a healthy week!

 HOW TO GET A SIX-PACK 
 Posted on March 28, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So with summer around the corner, I wanted to provide readers with some tips to flatten your stomach and gain that elusive six-pack. It has been 14 months for me and to go from a +50 size waist to the formings of a six pack is a true accomplishment for me. I have learned a few things along the way that can help you. Sure, a six-pack is something everyone wants, but having a strong stomach not only helps you look good, but reduces stress on your back and helps you keep good posture.

Here are a few tips to help get you started:

 TIP #1–Work your abs at the START of your workout vs the END. I see this time and time again where people will be extremely tired at the end of a workout and will try to squeeze in a few situps. I recommend training your abs at the start because you dedicate some time and energy to it. It also helps you with a warm up because they can help loosen your back muscles . Take some time at the start to do a good job as opposed at the end when you are too tired to really work them.

 TIP #2–Only Work Your Abs 3 Times a week . Your abs are a muscle group like any other muscle group. You can over train them so try not to work them more than 3 times a week. I used work them every time and found that I was more effective when I trained them well for 3 times a week vs every time.

 TIP #3–Cardio and good nutrition are the cornerstones of a six-pack. If all you did were situps and weights you wont get a six pack. You may get a flatter stomach, but you wont see the same results if you dont incorporate cardio into your routine. Everyone was a six-pack–the problem is that it is hiding under a layer of fat and water. You need to do some cardio training to strip away that fat and have those muscles pop. It goes without saying that proper nutrition is obviously key as well. You cant get a six-pack, by drinking a six-pack!

 TIP #4– Target different areas through a mix of exercises. The main muscles in your abdomens, consist of 3 areas: 1) Upper  2) Lower 3) Sides. I basically do one exercise for each one of these areas. Crunches target your Upper Abs. V-ups target your core and Lower Abs, and Side Bends target those obliques (sides). I change-up my ab routine every 6-weeks or so to keep things fresh.

 TIP #5–The Swiss Ball is your Best Friend! Ever see those big bouncy balls in the gym? Those are called‘ Swiss Balls ‘and they are a great tool in your exercise arsenal. You can structure your entire workout around the Swiss Ball. Start of slow, by getting used to it–once you get the hang of it you can use them for anything. They really target your core muscles. These are those muscles around your mid-section which helps you maintain balance and posture. You can even use weights while on the Swiss Ball to work both your core and other muscle groups. If you are a bit nervous, asked a trainer to help you. If you look up‘Swiss Ball Workout’in goggle you can find a bunch of different exercises. Here is a good website that shows you what the exercises look like: http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/strengthening/swiss_ball.php 

Having a six-pack shouldn’t be your overall goal of working out. It is merely a by-product of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Cardio and good nutrition helps maintain a healthy heart–but also helps strip away fat around your muscles. By incorporating a proper ab workout into your routine, you too can be ready for the beach this summer!

Have a healthy week!

 YOUR 1st QUARTER PERFORMANCE 
 Posted on April 2, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So as we knock off another month in 2011, it is hard to believe how fast the year has gone by. It seems like yesterday I was getting ready to go out for New Year ‘s Eve.

With all that being said, I figured it would be a good idea to take a break and reflect on the past 3 months. With my current workload, it is very easy to keep going on the current routine and not look back. However, that becomes the trap you can’t fall into.

When I started things back in 2010 (13 months ago), I had a bunch of goals that were not only fitness related, but also focusing on other areas of my life. Each month I would have goals broken down in terms of:

 HEALTH 

SOCIAL

FAMILY

CAREER

 MENTAL (Building My Own Capability )

As 2011 flies by, I find myself needing to stop and look back at what I have done so far and what needs additional focus for the remainder of the year.

 Physical: 

This has been my strongest area so far in 2011. I had a goal to swim 150 laps by year end in one session and was able to achieve this by early March. I have also met my other month ends goals in terms of # of workout days per month, and various nutritional goals to keep me focused. In terms of weight loss, I have lost another 14 pounds since the start of the year.

 Social: 

The good is that I have been able to get together with my closest friends at least once per month. The bad is that I really haven’t expanded my social circle at all. When I am done work, I really just want to chill out. However, that has boxed me into a corner where most of my friends are married and/or have kids…they have their own lives. I need to get mine. The other area that I planned to focus on is my love life. Being a single working man, it is easy to just let things happen as they come. However, I have taken a similar approach to my working out. Come May, I plan to start actively trying a bunch of dating services . Online, speed dating , match matching, etc…partially out of interest. Why May?-summer is coming and I want it to be a good one!

 Family: 

This continues to go well. My sister and I get together once a month and grab dinner. I also speak to my family at least once every 2 weeks (they live far away). I also had a goal to remember everyone’s birthday or special event. So far, so good.

 Career: 

This continues to go well, but I am definitely challenged at work. I am in a very demanding role and still trying to find my way. There is a lot of stress to it, but I am managing. I want to kick more ass in this category though

 Mental: 

So this has been a mixed bag for me. I continue to stay on top of current events through the newspaper and I cook a different recipe each week. Also, I have promised to update this blog once a week which I am doing (right?!). What I haven’t really looked into is exploring other hobbies or interests. I tend to get focused on a task and then goof off for the rest of the day. As a result, I wanted to read more (outside of the newspaper), but really haven’t made the time. I need to refocus on this. I have started playing chess this year which is cool. I used to be really good as kid. My dad taught me a bunch of stuff and I had some talent. Unfortunately, I lost interest. However, I am playing at least….Financially I have made it my goal to double up my mortgage every month and hopefully be done with that by the end of the year or mid next year.

The point of this entry is that success breeds success. Take a second and reflect on what you have achieved this year?

If you are disappointed…you still have 9 more months to make it right.

Have a healthy week!

 BREAKFAST-STARTING YOUR DAY OFF RIGHT 
 Posted on April 10, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So today I wanted to talk about the most important meal of the day: Breakfast. 

You have probably heard that before, but why is it the most important meal of the day? Well, quite frankly, the calories you eat first thing in the morning sets the tone physically and mentally throughout the day. Having a well-balanced breakfast, can start your metabolism going and set you up for success.

If you are like me (and everyone else it seems!), you are pressed for time. I hear that excuse a lot from people saying they don’t have the time for a well balanced breakfast. So, they end up grabbing a donut or whatever is quick and go on their way. So in an effort to help you avoid bad decisions in the morning, I decided to talk today about some quick and easy breakfast options. I also want to talk about some common pitfalls in some of the more common breakfast choices.

 Cereal: 

Cereal can be as healthy or as unhealthy as you want. You should always check the sugar content. I like granola cereal, however, there are a lot of calories, fat and sugar. So I pick a more bland cereal (Special K, Cheerios, Bran Flakes) and add fruit. This is a good way to get some additional nutrients to the meal. What type of milk do you use? Surprisingly, Milk actually has a higher sugar content than you would think. I have gotten used to Skim Milk , but for those dead set against Skim, try 1%.

 Bacon&amp;Eggs: 

A classic breakfast option. Outside the cholesteral concerns, eggs are great for you. You can have them anyway you like. I like to hard boil them and I choose turkey bacon. Turkey (or Chicken) Bacon is pretty close to the real thing. You can beat classic bacon, however, the fat content is just insane. The worst part is that the fat is mostly Saturated (the most damaging type of fat). So try Turkey bacon -it has 1/3 of the fat and calories.

 Muffins , Toast, Bagels : 

When you are on the run, nothing beats grabbing a quick bagel or muffin. The problem with muffins is that they are like eating a mini cake. You can almost always guarantee that muffins have high calories, fat and sugar. Avoid Muffins! Bran Muffins give you the high fibre content; however, it is offset with higher calories and fat. Bagels are actually not bad for you. You need to stick to the whole wheat, flax or grain types. Also, avoid adding butter, full fat cream cheese, or any other topping that adds the calories. Bagels do have a large calorie count (300-400 calories), so I pick the smaller ones. Grocery stories now carry these smaller bagels that reduce the fat and calorie count. Same story with toast–stick to Whole Wheat , Flax or Grain. Toast is usually the better choice among muffins or bagels. Just watch what you put on it. I do put a small amount of natural peanut butter on it–it tastes great!

 Fruit Juices : 

The thing to watch out with fruit juices is the sugar content. It is insane! Some of the sugar comes from naturally occurring sources; however, it is comparable to drinking half a soda. You need to watch out that you dont drink all your calories. I prefer to stick with water and pieces of fruit instead. Not suggesting a glass of orange juice is bad, but you should be aware how much you are putting in your body. People know that these fruit juices help you reach your daily Vitamin C intake. However, you can achieve the same results by meeting your daily fruit or vegetable servings.

 Breakfast Sandwiches : 

These things kill me–I love my Sausage Egg McMuffin. I cant help it. However, I found that I could make a very similar option at home with a 1/3 of the calories. Take an Egg and fry with a bit of cooking spray (not butter). Use Canadian Bacon , Ham, or Turkey Bacon instead of Sausage. Use low fat cheese slices instead of the regular full fat cheese. Use a whole wheat english muffin instead of the plain white one. This doesn’t take long to make and tastes great! Have it with a banana and you have just had a serving of fruit, protein, dairy and carbohydrate.

 Oatmeal: 

I have saved the best for last! Oatmeal is incredibly nutritious and quick to make. I use the instant version–watch out for the full sugar flavour versions in the grocery store. 1 packet for me is not enough, so I usually go with 1 1/2 or 2 servings. If I used the full sugar versions, that usually adds up to the same amount as muffin. So I started using the reduced sugar packets. I then moved to plain oatmeal. However, to add some flavour, I usually add 1/2 banana, walnuts, and some protein powder. You could also use a bit of peanut butter to blend in. Oatmeal is a slow burning carbohydrate, so it takes a long time to digest in your system-this allows you to feel energized throughout the day.

The lesson I am trying to convene in this post, is that you can take any normal everyday meal and turn it into a healthy option. It is actually not hard at all. So be open to trying some different (healthier) versions of your usually breakfast options.

Have a healthy week!

 The Best Chicken Receipe 
 Posted on April 17, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So one of my goals this year is to cook something new each week. I typically decide on a base ingredient and look up different ways to cook it. This could include a protein ( chicken , fish, beef, etc…), vegetable, or carb. A number of months back I picked a book called,“Cook This Not That”-I believe it is from the same sources as Men’s Health Magazine . It teaches you how to cook a bunch of different receipes in a healthier manner. It also compares the calories and fat content of similar dishes you can get from popular restaurants. I have found this book bean amazing source of information on receipes and cooking healthier.

One of the receipes I wanted to share with you today is a twist to a classic receipe– Fried Chicken . I just finished cooking the below receipe and have to say it is absolutely amazing!

Oven Fried Chicken:

 2 Cups Buttermilk (I use 1%) 1/4 Cup Hot Sauce Skinless Drumsticks (you can pick up at almost any grocery store) 2 cups Bread crumbs 1/2 tsp of Garlic salt 1/2 tsp paprika 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper Salt and Pepper 

All you do is combine the Buttermilk and Hot Sauce in a large bowl and marinate the chicken in it for a couple of hours. Then you combine the spices and crumbs in a bowl and dip the chicken in the mixture. You then place the breaded chicken onto a baking sheet and cook in the oven (at 450F) for 20 minutes. Absolutely amazing!

 What is good about this receipe? 

For starters you are using skinless chicken. Most of the fat on chicken comes from the skin. You are also using the oven vs deep fryer which saves a ton of calories and fat. The 1% Buttermilk mixture is low fat. You could argue that breadcrumbs is just wasted calories -you would be right; however, in the grand scheme of things it is not that big of a deal. The taste definitely outweights the few additional calories.

I dont have any financial benefits from promoting the book, however, I have to say, there are a lot of easy receipes in there. What this teaches you is how to take your classic receipes and turn them into tasty, healthier options.

 BEING IN THE ZONE 
 Posted on April 24, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
If you have been following a proper diet plan and workout routine for a couple of months you may relate to this next post. I was just finishing my lower body workout and someone came over to talk to me. I see this guy quite a bit and he definitely means well. We start talking about our training and I found myself starting to get irritated. I keep my workouts compact, which forces me to rest at a very limited time in between sets (45 secs-1 min). As he was talking I found myself trying to cut the conversation short so that I could get back to my sets. I wasn’t trying to be rude–I was just in the zone. Once you establish a routine it seems like everything is in the routine–you use the same treadmill, you use the same machines, you even use the same locker. I have gotten so focused on my workouts, that I sometimes find myself blocking everything else out. This is both a blessing and a curse.

When you are in the zone, nothing else matters. You are able to completely remove temptation and focus purely on your goals. It is a beautiful thing–the only problem is that you dont realize it until you fall out of the zone. If I think back 15 months ago, it would have been an accomplishment just to get to the gym. Now, I am getting irritated if someone wants to socialize with me or if I don’t get my usual locker. Everything in life is a balance–you need to stay focused without forgetting the fact that you need to enjoy the present before it becomes the past.

15 months ago, I was in a different type of zone. The only think that would get me out of bed is the prospect of sitting in front of the tv and stuffing my face. Nothing else really mattered.

Now that I am on the other side of the fence, I find I wake up trying to push myself harder. Obviously this is a better position to be in; however, there needs to be balance. My fear is that if I take it easy, I will fall back to my old ways.

I haven’t been able to help‘manage’my zone–but I think it is something worth mentioning. The ultimate goal here is to be healthy and happy. These things are not mutually exclusive.

A bit of different post this week, but it was something on my mind!

Have a healthy week!

 HOW TO ORDER IN A RESTAURANT 
 Posted on May 1, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So this past weekend I had my monthly dinner with my sister. I had recently been eating out a lot due to my travels and realized one of the core changes I have made throughout the past year was how I ordered in restaurants.

Here are some tips on how to stay healthy while eating out:

 CHECK OUT THE MENU BEFORE YOU GO TO THE RESTAURANT - Most restaurants these days have their own website along with a sample menu attached. You want to decide BEFORE you get to the restaurant. The reason being is that when you are in the‘here and now’sometimes you dont make the right decisions. It is one of those spur of the moment decisions to give into temptation. Avoid that by already deciding (or at least a general idea) of what you are going to eat before you get there. GRAB A QUICK HEALTHY SNACK BEFORE YOU GO- By having an apple or a few almonds before you to the restaurant, you can make sure you dont have that starved feeling by the time you get there. This will help reduce the cravings and temptations. SKIP THE‘APPIES’- Appetizers are usually just wasted calories before you even get to the main event. I used to love appies-but now I realize that most of those mini-meals are not needed and just add to your waistline. BEWARE OF SALADS- Salads can be one of the worst choices you make. Go to any fast food website and look up the nutritional information for a salad . They actually contain more fat and calories than the burgers. Most of that is in the dressing–when ordering a salad from a restaurant, ALWAYS ask for‘dressing on the side’. They usually drench it with a high fat dressing that turns a healthy choice into a nightmare. You can also ask for some different choices in dressing. YOUR MAIN DISH –So what to order? Well here are some things to watch out for: a) Pastas -try to avoid these at all costs. Pasta actually is not that bad for you; however, the restaurants will never make the dish so it is healthy. Stay away from the pasta choices b) Beef/Steak- these are usually high fat and high calories. If you need to order a steak stick to the smallest portion on the menu. The size of the meat should be no bigger than the palm of your hand c) Fish-fish is usually a good choice, but watch out for any of the‘cream based sauces’d) Chicken- chicken can be good as long as you remove any of the skin and watch out for the sauces. For any of these options, just use common sense YOUR SIDES- So most people will tell you to avoid any carbs. I disagree with that. A healthy meal includes Proteins, Vegetables and Carbs . Just make the right choice of carbs. Fries are a No-No. Rice is good. Baked Potato is fine as long as you skip the crazy toppings (sour cream, bacon, cheese, etc…). Sweet Potatoes are also a good choice. Try to avoid Mash Potatoes–they are just filled with added calories. Small mini potatoes are not that bad, but you should limit your intake. DESSERT - I am not a big dessert person. So it is easier for me to say this but AVOID ALL RESTAURANT DESSERTS . I have yet to see a healthy option here. You cant win here! For some people this is extremely difficult. If you absolutely need to have dessert, watch your portion size…or share with a friend. However, you should avoid this as much as possible. 

So there you have it–your guide to eating out in a healthy fashion. I may have listed out a bunch of rules; however, dont over think it. If you follow the above tips, you will be in control and enjoy a great healthy meal with friends…that is what life is all about!

Have a healthy week!

 THE 20 MINUTE WORKOUT 
 Posted on May 10, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
I guess you could say I am not like most people. I actually like cardio–most people I talk to say they cant stand it and want to get it over with as quickly as possible. When I first started out I thought I had to do long sessions of cardio to lose weight. Sure it helps-but another way to go is through what I call,“Pyramid Training”. I first read about this from a Men’s Health Magazine article, but more recently from,“ Body For Life ”by Bill Phillips.

The concept is quite simple -in 20 minutes you can have a kick ass cardio session. How? By having multiple short bursts of high intensity intervals followed with brief cool down sessions. You could do it on any type of equipment, however, I use it on the stairmaster. Here is how:

2 mins–Level 4 ( Warm up )

1 Minute– Level 5 

1 Minute - Level 6

1 Minute–Level 7

1 Minute–Level 8

1 Minute–Level 9

1 Minute–down to Level 5(cool down)

1 Minute-increase to Level 6

and so on…..

Repeat until you have completed 20 Minutes. Everytime you reach the peak level, increase your cool down level. By the time you hit 20 Minutes, your old max becomes your cool down level. It is incredibly difficult. It takes some time to figure out what level you can start and end with; however, your heart rate jumps up quickly.

You can do these intervals on pretty much anything. You can do it on a treadmill by adjusting the speed or incline. You can do it on a bike by adjusting the intensity or speed.

Rule of thumb-Your lowest level should be around 60% of what you can do with the highest level you should be giving +90% effort.

Try it out–for only 20 minutes you can burn fat and lose weight.

 MY FAVOURITE INSPIRATIONAL BOOKS 
 Posted on May 14, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
You ever get that feeling that you are lost and that there is a book out there that could help guide you? Ever finish reading a book and think,“Wow, I never thought of it that way”?

Throughout my years, I have read a lot of books on working out and staying healthy. Most of them were based on the same concepts. However, there were a few that really stuck to me and helped me to define my mindset to this day. They really helped frame and build the foundation to a healthy lifestyle.

HERE ARE MY TOP PICKS AND WHY:

 ‘ LIVING THE GOOD LIFE ‘-BY DAVID PATCHELL-EVANS– This is about David Patchell-Evans who amongst other accomplishments, started the fitness franchise,“ GOODLIFE FITNESS “. If you are not familiar with this chain of gyms they have over a hundred throughout North America . Dave was also a five-time rowing champion, who battled back from a serious motorcycle accident. The book does talk about his struggles; however, more on the proper mindset. This was one of the first times I read something that told me if I just do anything (no matter how small) fitness related I could achieve tremendous results. I was always all in or all out. I worked out 7 days a week, or didn’t move from the couch for 7 days. His book relates to anyone who wants to get healthy, no matter how old or young you are. His book taught me that the longest journey does begin with a first step. THE END OF OVEREATING - BY DAVID A KESSLER –This book will completely change your mindset. It focuses on why we over eat and why the food industry keeps us that way. There is actually a lot of shocking material in it. I am not a fan of blaming the industry for my past weight problems. The big doesn’t necessarily do that, however, it does explore why you overeat and the mechanics behind it. There is stuff about portion control and other useful information. You will really enjoy reading this book and I think it will help you further understand some of your behaviours. Understanding the‘Why’is always important. BODY FOR LIFE - BY BILL PHIILIPS– This book will put it all together for you. It starts off talking about the author who used to write health articles in a newspaper. At one point, he met some of his readers and realized most of them were obese? So he decided to put up a challenge–Those contensants who lose the most weight, look the healthiest and have made the biggest transformation in their lives will win a brand new sports car (we are talking $200K range). The time period was 12 weeks. The response was staggering–he received numerous stories and photos that blew his mind. He started documenting them and put together a 12 week plan to mental and physical strength. An absolutely amazing book–talks about personal struggles, actual step-by-step workouts and nutrition. This book is probably one of my all time favourites. 

So there you go–stop by your local book store and check them out.

Have a healthy week!

 HOW TO BUILD‘BEACH-READY’ ARMS 
 Posted on May 23, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
With the warm here, it is time to start showing off that body a lot more. Whether you go to the beach or go shopping, summer means less clothes. I used to wear jackets everywhere I go–no matter how hot it was. I simply wanted to hide my body. However, after you drop some weight you gain a lot more confidence. I am going to Spain in a few weeks and will need to look my best.

One of my strengths has always been my arms. I believe everyone has an asset with their body. Some people have great legs, great chests, back, etc…my strengths are my arms. I have those kinds of arms that are big but not bulky big. There is definition and size combined. Sure there may be some genetics at work; however, these arms did come with some work in the gym.

What I am going to share with you applies to both women and men. I hear from some women they are scared of working with weights because they don’t want to look like‘she-man’. Unless you are taking weight gaining supplements, lifting heavy weights, and doubling your calorie count, that won’t happen.

Here are some tips for anyone who wants some more defined, chiselled arms:

1) WORK THE TRICEPS - Your tricep is actually bigger than your bicep. People make the mistake of just working their biceps and think they don’t need to work the tricep. Wrong. My mom complains about the‘chicken wing’–she is referring to that waddle of fat under your arms. By working your triceps, you tone that area and gives your arms a much cleaner, toned look. Here are some exercises:

a) Pulley Pushdown - this is a good beginner or advanced exercise that really isolates that muscle. What I do is after 1 set of that, I actually do a Reverse Pulldown . This is when you take an underhand grip on a bar and pull down–it works the back of your tricep.

b) Dips–these can be done on a bench or through a free form dip bar . These not only kill your triceps, but also work the back of the shoulder

 2) PREACHER CURLS - Preacher curls give you the peak you see on your bicep when you flex. For me it is like an apple when I flex because I have been able to build it up. Preacher curls are a great way to isolate your biceps. These can be done with a barbell, dumbbell or on a machine.

3) BARBELL CURLS - To me this is timeless exercise similar to bench press or leg press . You can do these sitting or standing–however, I do it standing with a barbell. Make sure not to rock your body and keep your elbows in. Keep a moderate pace–don’t rush and swing the weight.

 4) SHOULDERS - Part of having nice arms is having defined shoulders. This should not be overlooked. Shoulder Presses work great–they really push the deltoids (that top front hump on your shoulder). Side Laterals or Front Laterals also work well. You take 2 dumbbells (lower weight) and arch them out to the side in a controlled fashion. For Front Laterals, you take an overhand grip of the dumbbells and slower raise them in front of you. You need to watch the weight here because you don’t want to injure yourself.

 5) KEEP YOUR REPS FROM 8-12 –8-12 reps are the ideal amounts when working your arms. You should have to squeeze out that last rep. If you are go low reps, high weight, typically you are working for strength. This is fine–however, keeping within 8-12 reps builds up muscle endurance which will burn more fat.

 6) CARDIO– So for all those that hate cardio, I got some bad news: Cardio is one of your key components to building not only nice arms, but a nice body. If all I did was lift weights, my arms would not have the same definition as they do. Cardio can help burn the fat off your arms and body–the weights help to sculpt the rest of the body. For arm development: I found the row machine, swimming or boxing can really make a difference. If you don’t believe me, look professional swimmers, boxers, or rowers….very defined arms.

Sounds like a lot of stuff for just one area of the body! Don’t worry, here is a quick beginner workout to get you going:

1) Shoulder Presses–3 x 4 sets

2) Tricep Pulldowns–3 x 4 sets

3) Reverse Pulldowns–3 x 4 Sets

4) Barbell or Dumbbell Curls –3 x 4 sets

5) Front or Side Laterals–3 x 4 sets

6) Finish up with some cardio–whatever you choose to get your heart rate up. Ellipticals are pretty good as well and this type of workout.

You should be done the above workout in 45 minutes or so.

Have a healthy week!

 SNACKS TO EMBRACE–STAYING FULL 
 Posted on June 6, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
 

 I used to be a professional snacker. I would consume an entire day’s worth of calories in a span of a couple hours. I loved salty food that was quick to eat – peanuts, chips, popcorn…you name it, I ate it. Based on feedback from others – I am not alone. Snacking (or ‘Grazing’) is one of the biggest contributors to weight gain. 

 

 Throughout your journey you will learn a lot about yourself and your eating habits. The trick is to know when you are most vulnerable (hungry) and to ensure you have the right snacks in place to stay focused. As I evolved, I learned to work around my internal cravings and establish a snacking routine that kept me satisfied throughout the day: 

 

 Here are some of my tips: 

 

 Timing – in general, you should have a good idea what time of the day you start getting those cravings. For me, it was in the afternoon and just before I got home at night. Once you understand this, you can structure the timing of your snacks so that when the cravings do hit, you will be equipped to move pass them. For me, I basically have small snacks every 1-1.5 hours starting around 2:30pm. 

 

 Working In Your Veggies – I used to really hate veggies. The only time I would have any is if they landed on my pizza. However, I started to incorporate a few choice veggies as a snack…the twist was I wouldn’t have them alone. I started to bring carrots and celery sticks with low fat peanut butter . This made it more tolerable. Once I started though, I moved from peanut butter to low fat ranch dressing…then down to hummus. I found that this trick helped me enjoy veggies as a snack and not as a necessary evil. You obviously need to watch out for what you pick as a ‘dip’, however, if you stick to a small portion (2 tbsp) you should be ok. 

 

 Protein Powder – back in the day protein powder came in two flavours – chalk or sand! Things change – you can now get a plethora of flavours with different benefits. Mixing protein powder with low fat milk , low sugar juice, or water is a great replacement as a snack. I used to only drink it after the gym – however, I found with 1 scoop I was able to have a quick energy boost that kept me full without all the fat. Recommendation – go with a low carb/low fat protein powder. I have it with water, however, as long as you drink it with something healthy you should be good to go. Some protein powders are built to have a lot of calories and carbs for those that are looking to put on mass – however, if you stick to the low carb/low fat options, you will be good to go. 

 

 Fibre Is Your Friend – Fibre keeps you full…and regular. Your snacks should have an element of fibre in it – there are many different sources. These can range from both fruits and veggies – however, one of my staple sources comes from Almonds . Almonds are a great snacking food because they are dry and easy to keep – having a couple of handfuls of almonds can keep your energy up and provide you with both Fibre and a good source of Fat. Try to avoid salted or roasted Almonds – they carry more Sodium and Fat 

 

 Special Moments – one of the things I have learned throughout my journey is that it is ok to enjoy a special moment. By this, I mean having a small portion of something you crave. For some people it is chocolate. Over the last number of years, the industry has jumped all over portion control . The result has been a number of different ‘small size’ chocolate offerings that cater to those that want to maintain control. Incorporating these into your snacking routine gives you something to look forward to and does not have a large contributor to your waist line. If you can’t trust yourself with just one – then avoid altogether! 

 

 Gum: Your Secret Weapon – I have evolved over the last while where I don’t crave chocolate or salty snacks. However, sometimes I do get hungry before I get home for dinner. I used to grab a burger on the way home – now, I chew sugar-free gum. It sounds simple but it works. There have been times when I started to get that hungry feeling and I popped in some gum and the feeling subsided. You obviously can’t replace a snack with gum, but it does help with the cravings. The type I use is sugar free and has the added benefit of teeth whitening! 

 

 There you have it! – Some of my tip tricks to keep your snacking inline with your health/lifestyle goals… 

 

 Have a healthy week!

 GOING THE DISTANCE 
 Posted on June 15, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
 You know it is a funny thing….if you have been losing weight over long periods of time you start to get used to a lot of things. You get the compliments, you get used to wearing clothes that fit and you start to accept your new body. Over the course of time you start to forget just how far you have come. Last Friday, I participated in a run/ walk /bike event for charity. I have participated in this event every year. It is extremely easy going and most people simple walk for as long or as far as they want. Last year, I gave myself a pat on the back for walking 10KMs. By the end of it, my feet were sore and I was tired – but I got through it. This year I was still planning on keeping it casual – I actually just wanted to walk it because I really didn’t have anything to prove. In fact, I got up in the morning and did a hard 1 ½ hr upper body workout. After the gym, I headed down to the event – as usual, it was a gorgeous day with a nice breeze. Since I wear a shirt and tie to work everyday, people were surprised to see me in my t-shirt and shorts. I kept having people come up and compliment me on my new body (it has been a year and a half). As always, I thanked them gave them some tips and that was that. I see one of my friends who I usually walk with every year and she states she wanted to jog a couple of kilometres. I decided what the hell, sure lets do it. I start jogging with her and find that I am no where close to being winded. In fact, I start to get that feeling that I could run all day – so I keep running and running – next thing I know I just finished running 15 KMs without stopping.

The amazing thing was that it was pure heart and determination – all the struggles I faced over the years came to light and I just wanted to show everyone I was a new man. 15 KMs may not sound far for some, but you have to remember I put a hard upper body workout in the gym a mere hour before. Last year I could barely walk 10 KMs, this year, nothing could stop me from jogging 15 KMs.

 

The lesson I learned that day was that the scale and the clothes were mere lagging indicators of my success. True success comes from doing something you never thought you could.

 DON’T BLAME MCDONALDS 
 Posted on June 18, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So this will cause some debate amongst readers out there, but it is something that needs to be said. During my time as an obese person I spent a lot of time going through drive-thurs. Sometimes I was so ashamed that I used the word,‘we’a lot so that the person taking the order thought it wasn’t all for me. With that being said, I never once blamed that fast food place for my weight problems. I knew what I was doing and I knew it was making my problem worse. Over the last number of years there has been an attack on fast food restaurants to offer more healthy choices. I agree with that position and whole-heartedly endorse more healthy options at these type of places. What I dont understand is why people specifically blame these places for their weight problems. I have read the books (and seen the movies) that claim there are additive substances specifically put into these foods to keep people coming back. That may or may not be true–I have no idea. What I do know is that it took me a long time to own up to the fact that I was the one physically going through and ordering the food. McDonalds didn’t pick me up at my house, pay for my meal, and open my mouth to dump the food down my throat. I did that. I got fat.

Life is all about choices–some are more tempting than others. Sure, I love Big Macs and Whoppers . However, I know I love myself more the way I am now than what I was before. I still eat junk once in a while–but again, that is my choice. None of these restaurants are going away–you can’t wait them out of existence. What you can do is look yourself in the mirror and decide you will start making changes today. If you eat McDonald’s 7 times a week, reduce it to 2, than to 0, etc…whatever you commit to, stick to it. The best part about that is that you can’t blame anyone else when you succeed…it was all within you from the beginning. I took me a long time to realize that. Take responsibility for your actions–I took responsibility for my bad health and now I take responsibility for my success.

Have a healthy week!

 EATING IS NOT A HOBBY 
 Posted on June 25, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
Looking back at myself I realized that I just gave up on life in general. I didn’t really care about anything other than eating or drinking. There were no other interests – I got up went to work

and came home and ate. There were no goals. There was no direction. There was food and that was it. When I decided to change my life, one of the first things I did was make a list

of all the things I wanted to do . The list included everything under the sun – travel, romance, health , family/friends and education. I realized that since I gained the weight, I basically had

wasted the last couple of years. Professionally I was doing well – however, in the grand scheme of things that meant very little. If you are going to change your life, you have to de-construct everything

that got you to where you currently are, and then put together the pieces so that you end up where you want to be.

In order to do this successfully, you need to try new things. So I started listing out all the activities I always wanted to do (or be better at) but because of the weight, held me back from following through.

One of these items was Cooking. I was always interested in cooking, but never took the time to really learn. So I started taking cooking classes at night. In doing so I learned how to cook in ways that are good for you and taste great as well. From this, I challenged myself to make a different recipe each week for a year. Every Sunday , I plan out what I am going to make and dedicate some time to do. The recipes are not difficult, but it is the sheer dedication to ensure every week without fail, I make a different dish. What I found is that this was the perfect hobby for me and my new lifestyle.

In the past, when I went on a diet, it was based on eating very similar meals each day and quickly became boring. However, now that I forced myself to try new foods and recipes I see that this truly supports a lifestyle change.

The point here is that you should pick a hobby that helps support your health goals. The obvious choices involve being active; however, be creative – there may be some things you always wanted

to do that can help you keep focused. For example – maybe you like photography. Why not go for a nice hike and take some pictures along the way. Regardless of what you choose – you should

enjoy it and dedicate some time to it. It can not only be good for the heart, but also the soul.

 THE BIKINI MOTIVATOR 
 Posted on July 7, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So believe it or not, yours truly is going on his first real vacation in about 7 years. The last time I actually went somewhere classified as a vacation was back when I first joined my company. One of my goals in 2011 was to go somewhere that was both exotic and somewhere I have never been. That really isn’t a challenging task because I rarely go anywhere outside of the country. However, I made a pact with myself to do it this year. Who am I going with? Friends? Significant Other? Someone Else’s Significant Other?

No – I am going alone. Well, it will be with a tour group – but the 20+ hour flight there and back will be alone!

One of the trends I have realized over the last few years is that people change – their priorities shift and those good old times and few and far between.

So why am I mentioning this on a health/weight loss blog? Its simple – this is another example of what I missed out as an obese person. I had plenty of invites to hit the hot destination places when I was fat. Back then you had fellow wing men who had the same lack of priorities as you. However, as we grow older time passes by and these things only come up once in a while. The unfortunate part was I passed on all the opportunities which I can’t get back.

Realizing this last year (and the fact my passport looks cleaner than a choir boy during Mass ) – I made a pact to go somewhere hot. I didn’t want to go when I was fat because I wouldn’t have enjoy myself and it would have been a waste. As a result, in less than 1 week I will be hitting infamous, IBIZA, SPAIN . Ibiza is filled with beautiful people with beautiful bodies – a perfect place for a former fat guy to show off his hard work!

I have gotten to a point now in my training where things are very routine – I changed my workout routine, my diet, etc…but I still seemed to have that ‘funk’ feel.

However, once I booked my trip and it started to come down to the wire, I felt my training has been taken to a new level. There is no question that I am probably over doing it – but I can’t help it. A year and a half ago, I couldn’t even walk up a flight of stairs without breathing heavily – now – in less than a week, I will be stacked and partying in one of the craziest places on Earth .

My point of all this is you need to determine what your Bikini Motivating Factor is….This does not mean that your sole purpose of getting in shape is for the trip. It simply means time is ticking. Look into booking something that you were unwilling to do because of your weight. No matter how silly it is – do it – you will never regret it.

Unfortunately for my dear readers, I won’t be providing any updates until I get back – which will be in a few weeks.

Take care and we will speak when I get back – have a healthy couple of weeks!

 GETTING YOUR GROOVE BACK 
 Posted on August 14, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So it has been a while since my last post and that would due to a few things: a) being away on vacation (see last post) and b) I have had some trouble getting back into the routine. Before I get into that, I would quickly recap the vacation. Spent most of time on the sunny beaches of Spain and the other half of the day and night at the clubs! It was insane–both from a visual point and from a health standpoint. My first day I was actually trying to be healthy , but that went to hell in a handbasket quickly. All inclusive vacations–you have to love it. I could drink anything I wanted from as soon as I got up, till when I went to bed. The food was brutal in sense that I had no incentive to eat healthy. I figured I knew I was going to eat and drink myself silly, so might as well go all the way. The kicker?–When I got back home my mind was still in that mindset.

I wont lie–I have only been to the gym a small handful of times since I have been back and seem to be resorting to my old ways. This obviously goes against my creed, but cant seem to make that mental shift back to reality. What I think I need to do is bring it back to basics:

1) Get to the gym in a consistent fashion–that means setting goals each week at a bare minimum.

2) Diet –get back into eating the right foods. I dont need to be as strict as I was before, but still need to get my fruits and vegetables

3) Alcohol –cut back on the alcohol. So the challenge I have had is that I am back in the dating scene and have been busy! When you go on these dates you are at various lounges, restaurants, etc…this lends itself to drinking…which slows down your progress

4) Sleep–I haven’t slept well since I have been back. Nothing to do with the jet lag…just haven’t had any of those deep sleeps I thoroughly enjoy.

Would I have done it any different? The honest answer is No. However, I think the lesson here is that when you go on vacation you need to have a before and after plan. The before gets you ready for the trip and the after gets you back to where you were before you left. I missed the mark on the latter.

I am not going back to where I was before–I just need to make health a priority again. I will get there–just like I did before…one day at a time.

Have a healthy week!

 The 300 Workout 
 Posted on September 4, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
So before we get into today’s post, I want to apologize to my readers for not maintaining my weekly updates. There hasnt been a good excuse–things havent really been consistent since I got back from Spain . With that all being said, I want today’s post to be about the conditioning it took for the actors of the’300′Movie. Seeing Gerald Butler and all the supporting actors is truly inspirational from a fitness level. I did some research and found some interesting facts on how they trained:

1) The Environment–The actors were taken to a secret location that did not have mirrors, did not have the traditional weight machines and did not even have air conditioning . Every part of their training was meant to take them to the mental and physical edge. This doesnt mean you need to find a warehouse to train–you just need to be able to find a place that can keep you mentally focused…the body will follow.

2) Constantly changing workouts–I read that the actors had no idea what they would be doing from day to day. They would show up and they could be doing harsh cardio drills, heavy weights or tire flips…it was constantly changing to never allow the muscles to get used to the workout. The lesson here is that the most efficent and impactful workouts keep your muscles guessing. When you are in the gym, you notice those people that do different exercises with different motions…these people usually the ones who are seeing the biggest gains. This doesnt mean everyday has to be a different workout–you just need to keep it changing enough so that your muscles dont get used to and lazy to the routine

3) The Famous’300′ Workout –This workout became extremely famous due to the movie. However, there was some misconceptions out there regarding the workout. Some say it was done everyday; however, it was revealed that this was a one-time challenge to the actors…almost a rite of passage. This should not be done within its full capacity without being in top physical shape. However, there are some variations that can make it less difficult.

Original 300 Workout :

1. 25x Pull-ups
2. 50x Dead-lifts
3. 50x Push-ups 
4. 50x Box Jumps
5. 50x Floor Wipers
6. 50x Clean and Presses
7. 25x Dips
This is tough because they are all difficult movements and the high reps really challenges you from a cardio side of things. See the below video link– h ttp://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/300_workout.htm 

If you starting out you can change it up by reducing it to 150 or follow the below link for a beginner’s version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsFkdrCUyl0 

These workouts are amazing because they work you cardio wise and weights wise…the beginner’s version is great because you dont need any weights so you can easily do it in a hotel room if you want.

For these workouts you want to time how long it takes and try to beat your personal best.

Check it out!

Have a healthy week!

 My Job Made Me Fat 
 Posted on September 16, 2011 by Change Your Life 2011 
I have heard this quote directly or indirectly so many times. I recognize it because I used to use it all the time. I should have changed the title to,“I allowed my job to make me fat”. Listen, I get it…none of us can take time off work to workout full time. Life doesn’t work that way. However, if you make health a priority nothing will get in the way of your goals. Throughout my blog I have put bits and pieces on how to avoid the temptations at work, but would like to consolidate the knowledge into this post.

Here are some quick tips to avoid using the same old excuses and correlation between your weight and work:

1) PACK YOUR OWN MEALS–I mentioned this a few times; however, I cant stress it enough. We tend to go through a drive-thur because it is quick, the food tastes good, and we avoid the embarrassment of going inside. Instead pack your own meals –if you workout in the morning bring your breakfast, lunch and snacks. If you workout after work, bring your lunch, snacks and something to keep you check before you leave. This was one of the biggest contributors to me success–when I brought my meals, I was focused…when I didn’t, I tended to let things slide.

2) TREATS AT WORK–This goes alongside my first tip. It always amazes me how we tend to try to sabotage each other. I work in an office and there is always someone bring in a cake, case of donuts or chocolates. I know this is tempting because it is both free and your co-workers seem encourage you (the reason they do that is so they don’t feel as guilty!). Dont give in–stick to what you brought in and you will be fine…make sure to pack a little treat to help you get through those tough moments. I like low fat granola bars !

3) AFTER WORK DRINKS–This is tough because you want to socialize but you want to stay good as well. I have been to my fair share of these things and it is never just one drink. Almost always someone wants to order appetizers or buy a few rounds. Make a decision before you go on what you will or will not allow yourself to do. The trick is avoid the last minute on the spot decisions which will always be the wrong one! If this is your cheat day, enjoy it! If not, put some barriers on what you will and will not indulge in.

4) LUNCH TIME WALKS–People around my office started fitting in lunch time walks. I think this is a great way to add some fitness into your day. Some people tell me that walks can’t help–however, I disagree with that. Something is always better than nothing. Always! So bond with some co-workers and enjoy the outdoors…

5) START A SUPPORT GROUP –So some people around my office actually started a support group. They actually brought in Weight-Watchers into the office in which a consultant comes in and helps them. This is a win-win–the representative grows their business by having engaged customers and the customers win by bonding with other co-workers.

6) HOST A WEIGHT-LOSS COMPETITION–So some caution here: people will jump on board and will try crash diets that don’t work. Put a spin on it: Whoever loses the most and keeps it off within a certain time period wins the prize. Remember to think long term when it comes to weight loss. This can be the spring-board you need to get started–in which case everyone wins.

There you have it!  If you have any questions or suggestions let me know

Have a healthy week!
