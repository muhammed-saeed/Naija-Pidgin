Fast Food
 
Fast food is prepared and served quickly, and often consumed quickly as well. A spin-off of street food, a classification that spans eras and cultures, modern fast food has focused on being economical, filling, and tasty, often in that order. Within the foodservice industry, fast food restaurants are termed Quick Service Restaurants, or QSRs, and may also be termed Limited Service Restaurants, indicating the absence of traditional table service from a wait staff. 
Within the American food industry, the leading fast food chains include McDonald’s (the quintessential fast food chain), Burger King, Subway, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, KFC, and Arby’s. As this list implies, hamburgers, other sandwiches, Mexican-style foods, and fried chicken are standard fare in the American fast food industry.
In the U.S. market, fast food chains have faced increasingly competition from street foods, which have been seen a significant revival in consumer interest and appreciation.
Healthfulness, moreover, is an increasingly concern of contemporary fast food chains and their customers. Consumers may or may not view prepared foods available at retailers such as supermarkets as being competitive with fast food in terms of cost and taste. Fast food restaurants compete heavily on cost and convenience, particularly as it relates to getting food quickly. Food retailers may be in a stronger position to meld healthful eating and prepared foods together.
