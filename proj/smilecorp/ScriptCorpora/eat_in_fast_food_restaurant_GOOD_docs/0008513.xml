 Get Him to the Blog 
 23 Sep 
“You have to blog,” They said. “Everyone who’s anyone does it.” Besides, I’m a real estate agent—blogging is simply presumed, like having a snappy professional website and pretty business cards. Never mind that most agents’ cards feature barely passing likenesses that are only misty memories, photographs taken in happier days and now bearing witness to the fact that our profession has made us Old.

“But blogging is fresh, it’s so 2011, you need it to keep up with the starry-eyed agents who’ve embraced social media like fawning tweeners at a Beiber sighting!” Look, I’m not some technology Luddite with an anti-social media agenda. I’m simply into logic and common sense. Perhaps overly so. I tweet, I have two websites and I’m on the cusp of possibly considering maybe creating a Fa cebook page for my real estate business. But tell me about this thing you call a real estate blog. “It will offer links to listings and lists of useful information about buying and selling homes!” Umm, isn’t that called a website? “You could write meaningful articles on staging one-bedroom condos and identifying termite mud tunnels!” Wow. A must-read bookmark-me-now destination that I’m sure no one’s thought of before. For their WEBSITE .

Not to be a real stick in the mud, I see the value of providing useful information for my clients. Sort of like teaching them how to quickly de-ice their car door locks or safely belay down the sheer face of a cliff. Problem is, you see, they may not be contemplating a rock climbing vacation in the Canadian Rockies, and it may be June, a somewhat balmy month for car locks to freeze. To beat my point to death, the contacts on my extensive client list are not necessarily in the process of—or even entertaining the thought of—hiring a good home inspector in anticipation of purchasing a home. If they were, my phone would be ringing off the hook and I wouldn’t be blogging about blogging.

I want to blog. There’s something visceral about putting one’s thoughts to paper in the hopes that they will be read, anonymously, without risk of judgment. But reaching out to a circle of people who’ve trusted me in the past and offering them a wealth of real estate knowledge packaged as a blog is inviting a collective wan smile and polite response: “That’s nice. Jotted down your email. Will think of you in the future. If we remember.”

So I will not blog much about real estate. Oh, there will be posts and links, to be sure. Think of this blog not as a roadside stand offering freshly picked real estate veggies that are wholesome and good for you, but a general store filled with all manner of quaint curiosities and artifacts to touch and admire. And there on a shelf, convenient and available if you need them, are those wholesome real estate veggies.

“So what will you blog about?” Ah. Anything and everything. Musings, observations, rants about the trivial lint of life. Reverence and convention have their place; just don’t look for them here. Whether you’re an old or new real estate client, a friend, a colleague, or someone who just followed a keyword or tag on Google, welcome to my general store. Wander around, enjoy, leave a note of approval or even disapproval. My ramblings are displayed for your pleasure. And if you’re in the market for a home, the wholesome veggies are right over there in the corner.

 (Primer. Here. On what I really thought of Miss Pencilpoint’s grammar class in seventh grade.)

 The short, sweet life of a coffee stirrer 
 16 Mar 
I was stirring my morning coffee, that deliberate motion that is part necessity and part subconscious effort to delay the start of another arduous day, if only by a few seconds. That’s a time when the brain, not yet steeped in caffeine, teeters between the necessary and the whimsical.

Mid-swirl, my mind went out to the stirrer between my thumb and index finger: a thin plastic stick, brown, hollow. I thought of the process by which it was made—most likely an extrusion method whereby molten plastic is drawn through a mold, then mechanically sliced into uniform lengths to be packed by the thousands. I thought of the engineering that went into that stirrer: drawing up specifications for the plastic; sourcing the raw materials; fabricating the dies and mechanisms to extrude the stirrers; designing, printing and assembling the cartons; installing the conveyors, automated equipment and logistics systems to get everything from fabrication to warehousing to store shelves. All for me to be able to swish it around in a cup of coffee, then toss it in a trashcan.

What an absolute waste of resources. All that effort and expense for what—so I can avoid picking up a spoon, swirling in a cup for five seconds, then running it under a stream of water for another five seconds before placing it in a dish rack? A very expensive savings of five seconds indeed.

I get it. In a public setting such as a fast-food restaurant or a business conference, making sure spoons don’t walk or aren’t tossed out is more than worth the cost of a spoon proxy. And I’m sure that factories that produce coffee stirrers use their equipment for more than just that. But still—all that for something that has a useful life measured in seconds! 

 Which got me to thinking (in another not-so-subconscious effort to delay the start of my day). What object has the absolutely shortest lifespan? What else has man created that exists for no other reason than to save him seconds, no matter the expense? I decided that this would be a good topic for me to mull while driving the car, walking my puppies or anytime else I would want to kill some time, like, perhaps, between bouts of productivity in the office.

First, some ground rules. “Lifespan” would be defined as the time elapsed between someone reaching for an object and tossing it away. Storage doesn’t count. After all, that hapless coffee stirrer that started this whole rant may have sat on a store shelf or on our break room counter for months before its five seconds of glory.

So, who were the candidates? First up, I thought of the stalwart and ubiquitous match, whether the book or stick kind. Yep, its life is short, unarguably shorter than that of a coffee stirrer. A stirrer’s life is dictated by the personality of the, um, stirrer him- or herself: the more obsessive compulsive, the longer the swishing. A match has a very defined lifespan, the end of which is signaled by a rather pronounced pain of the fingers.

I thought of movie tickets, paper napkins and a whole range of medical equipment, or more correctly, medical equipment protectors, that qualified as candidates. For the latter, a doctor slaps a thin plastic cover over an ear canal examination thingy scope (that’s the official medical terminology, by the way), jabs it in your ear, and in a mere second determines that you are not worth filing lengthy insurance forms. The plastic cover, like a high tech ear canal stirrer, gets tossed.

I can make a parlor game out of this, for those times when either too much or not enough alcohol at a party demands drastic measures. Or I could use this as a quick conversation stopper among co-workers to teach them that killing work time with Bo has its consequences. I highly doubt if more than a sorry handful of people have ever pondered this weighty question.

When I was a kid in the Bronx, the Fourth of July was an important holiday marked by Older Kids setting off the firecrackers and “Ash Cans” that they had somehow illicitly acquired. The really cool kids had Roman Candles; hangers-on like me made do with sparklers and cracker balls, pea-sized colored bomblets that made a satisfying crack when hurled onto the sidewalk. I came across some of those not too long ago, different in shape, but still the choice of the pre-matchbook set.

Until someone convinces me otherwise, I decided that the winners of the Short Life competition were those gaily colored little grenades. Reach into your pocket, draw one out, sneak up on an unsuspecting kid and “Bang!” Life over in the blink of an eye. No contest. Matches, stirrers and napkins go vie for second place.

So that was that. My coffee-stirring rumination over, my quest accomplished, it was back to the mundane world of the concrete and meaningful. Sometimes, in the time-killing spectrum, a short lifespan is not necessarily desirable. This little thought exercise straddled the border nicely between useless and wasteful. Stolen moments of a day are often more satisfying when stirred slowly, not hurled away with a bang.

 Do not ask your father for advice. Please. 
 28 Feb 
Fathers are men, and men have an extra advice chromosome that women lack. Oh, I know, mothers are the ones always offering advice and opinions: Wear a sweater, it’s cold outside. The blue top matches the lovely shoes you just bought. Chicken soup will help with your cold. That Timmy, he’s such a nice boy, you should date him.

Fathers offer advice as well, especially when it comes to sports or cars: Keep your elbow up when you swing the bat. Loosen the lug nuts before you jack up the car. That Timmy, what a waste of a first-round draft pick.

Problem is, men tend to pick up steam when they see a challenge. Ask a woman how to get to Quakerbridge Mall and she will say, “Take Route 1 to Quakerbridge Road and it’s on the left side of the highway.” Now ask a man. “Get on New Road and go about four miles; you’ll see the Kendall Park fire station on your right and Woodlot Park on your left. Make a right onto Route 1—watch out for cars coming out of the Exxon station at the corner. On Route 1 you’ll pass a restaurant on the right, can’t think of the name, used to be Rumbleseats, then something else and Route One South until last year. That new Target and Best Buy mall will be on your left just after you pass Promenade Boulevard. Watch out for constru ction around Harrison Street, they’re building an overpass there for the new hospital in West Windsor. You’ll pass the Washington Road intersection with a gazillion lights, but don’t worry, they’re all timed to turn green at the same time…” The man is still ten miles away from Quakerbridge Mall, but you’re cooked. Your eyes are glazed and you best be looking for a woman to tell you how to get there.

In real estate there are certain Kisses of Death for an agent that doom a potential sale. Finding out that your client’s credit score is 540 is a kiss of death. Two inches of standing water in the basement is a kiss of death. Sadly, I’ve experienced another example several times with especially promising young couples who’ve fallen in like with a nice home. They ooh. They ahh. This is by far the best of 18 homes I’ve shown them. Then comes the Kiss: “We want to see it again with our parents.”

With all the enthusiasm of a convicted criminal I make the next appointment and meet The Parents. The moms are OK, they comment on the amount of light coming through the windows and how the sectional will fit in the living room. The fathers are primed for combat. Their kids asked them for Advice. The honor of men worldwide is on the line here.

You see, fathers, being men, are genetically predisposed to find fault. It’s not that they don’t like things; it’s just that not finding fault is admitting that one does not know everything about something. How can you display your wealth of knowledge about an item without pointing out its flaws? Can’t be done.

Fathers start their commentary in the foyer and leave a wake of verbal destruction as they tour the home. The hardwood floors should really be stripped and resealed; that’s expensive. The thermostat is an older model, they make better ones now. Wallpaper may not have been sized; you know how hard it is to remove wallpaper that hasn’t been sized? That’s a 110,000 BTU furnace you got there; builder chintzed and should have put in a 115,000 BTU unit.

Needless to say, by the end of the Parents’ Tour, the shining castle in the eyes of the young couple has been reduced to a smoldering Superfund site. Their dejection is palpable, matched only by the dejection of the real estate agent who regrets not having made the appointment on a workday or during an NFL playoff game. Another set of fathers who are not buying a home killing dreams and hopes with a deft display of knowledge.

Young couples, you love your parents, and they love you even more. Fathers especially want to protect you from every evil known to Home Depot. Just be aware that asking them for advice is like brushing your teeth with a carpet cleaner. Very thorough indeed. I’m not saying ignore them, but be aware of the perils. That’s my advice to you. I know. I’m a father.

 Marketing for Panhandlers 
 11 Feb 
A duck and a gecko sagely tell you all you need to know about insurance. A frighteningly precocious baby day trader packs a laptop and smart phone in his crib. Every product or service worth shilling has a hook, a punch line to draw you in and separate you from your hard-earned scratch. Marketing is definitely the Word on Wall Street.

Every driver who ever plied the streets of Manhattan in the eighties remembe rs daily encounters with “squeegee men,” characters of questionable character who ambushed stopped cars with squeegees (or rags or wads of newspaper) to clean their windshields in return for a handout, purportedly for food, whether the windshields needed cleaning or not. Seinfeld even alluded to the practice in the episode “The Gymnast,” where George was suspected of being a bum for wiping down the windshield of a limo. I experienced my share of ambushes, and it got to where I knew exactly where the next one lay, as prime ambush real estate was as prized and staked out by those urban entrepreneurs as viewing spots for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

I eventually made my peace with the ubiquitous panhandlers, budgeting an extra two or four bits for every commute home from work. Some battles just aren’t worth fighting, although making a traffic light and zipping past an outstretched hand was a small victory to be had now and again. I figured that these guys were better off begging for their meals than stealing for them like their less inspired brethren were inclined to do.

And so it was with particular amusement and enjoyment that I witnessed a couple of incidents on such commutes. At the New York City entrance to the Holland Tunnel one day, I was approached by a very happy, very animated little sort with very few teeth who waved and said, “Hey man, I’m not gonna bullshit you—I just want some money for a beer!” I laughed, out loud. His fresh sincerity won me over and I gave him a couple of quarters. Honesty shoots and scores.

Another time I was inching along a traffic-clogged street where I knew a particular squeegee-wielder plied his trade. It was a dreary day, heavy with drizzle. Sure enough, at the appointed spot my man stepped out from between parked cars, but something was different. He was wearing a large hand-scrawled cardboard sign that read, “Due to inclement weather window washing has been suspended, but your donations are sincerely appreciated.” I laughed, rolled down my window to call him over and gave him a buck. Again, sincerity and creativity from the most menial of “services” impressed me.

Rudy Giuliani made good on his promise to eradicate the practice of squeegeeing windows for loose change during his tenure as mayor, vowing to rid the city of the human detritus that gave the Big Apple a rotten image. Where all those independent contractors went I do not know, and a fond New York City tradition was erased forever like the passing of the last Horn&amp;Hardart sandwich vending machines.

But a wise lesson in corporate marketing remains. The takeaway here is be honest. Be creative. Be persistent. Build your brand. Don’t take your customers for granted, earn their appreciation. If you do that, you can sell just about anything. Just ask the creators of Pet Rocks and soy milk.

 And this is why I don’t play the lottery. 
 07 Feb 
We all have a bit of Walter Mitty in us. It’s human nature, irresistible. And nothing brings out the dreamer in us more than playing the lottery, be it scratch-off games with their promise of a $2 haul or participating like massed lemmings in one of the multi-state, multi-gazillion-dollar mega-lotteries. All the proceeds go to educating our young’uns, yeah, we know. That’s not what’s important to us.

I’m no different. How many times have I stood at the Stop&amp;Shop customer service counter, slapped down my dollar (two if I was feeling especially lucky) and walked away dreaming, the winning ticket heavy in my pocket. Oh, the dreams! I’ll pay off my debts! All my extended family’s debts too! College costs? Not an issue anymore. Mortgage? Paid off with a laugh.

 I was careful with my newfound millions. I don’t really need a 20,000 square foot house, even if I could buy it for cash. Nah, a nice, 4,000 square foot one will do. Cars? A Lexus will do nicely, thank you. No real need for a Maserati, I don’t want to be ostentatious. OK, that still leaves about $199 million. Let’s see…

I was generous with my largesse. Everyone who had ever been nice to me would get a big fat check, with enough added to cover taxes. I was a benevolent man, yessir. One of millions who were spending their imaginary winnings at that very moment, each with his or her winning ticket safely tucked away.

I do think a lot. When I’m not thinking about my millions, I like to think of math. Out loud I say that thinking of math has been proven to stave off dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and rickets in the aging population, of which I am a card-carrying member. The sad fact is that I simply am a geek. So I did what geeks do best. I decided to see what the real odds were that the steaming-hot lottery ticket in my pocket would actually bring me fortune and new friends.

I picked a popular game, the New Jersey Mega Millions lottery that people flock to like gnats to a lantern in summer. (Why no one seems to play unless the pot tops $200 million is beyond me. I guess winning a mere $20 million is just not worth standing in line for nowadays.) Last I checked, the odds of winning that baby were 175,711,536 to one. Cool.

But a number with two commas in it loses meaning, it has no grounding in reality. “How big are those odds?” “I dunno. Pretty big, I guess.” Nothing in my sphere of influence is that large; not the number of pennies in the empty soda cans I keep in my closet, not the number of times I’ve changed diapers or carted off the physical evidence of my puppies’ walks, both fairly substantial amounts.

Time to put this into some physical perspective. Let’s pretend that the number One is a square inch. A happy little square, one inch on each side. So what do 175,711,536 square inches look like? Geek time: the square root of that many square inches is 13,256. That means a very large square measuring 13,256 inches on each side will hold all those millions of happy little squares. Stay with me, class.

Big numbers make my vision blur, so let’s work on this. 13,256 inches is 368 yards; let’s just make that a round 360 between us friends. How long is that? Well, a football field is 120 yards long counting both end zones, so we’re talking three football fields laid end to end. Ah.

A football field is 53 yards wide (I looked that up), so the aforementioned 13,256 inches is about seven football fields wide. Do the quick math and you’ll see where I’m going with this: 175,711,536 square inches more than cover twenty one football fields laid out in a 7×3 pattern.

Those of you who have not had the pleasure of being in close proximity to an actual football field may want another perspective. Those fields cover 27 acres. Really.

Not a farmer? OK, if you live in a squished New Jersey development where the amount of land you get to call your own and pay taxes on is about a quarter of an acre (I’m including sidewalks and streets to keep it real), we’re talking a development of 108 homes.

Picture a residential development of 108 houses. A square inch is roughly the size of a USPS Forever postage stamp. Now picture a rather large sheet of stamps covering every square inch of that development. Literally.

If someone were to tell you that one of those postage stamps covering 27 acres represented a jackpot of $200 million and all you had to do was fork over a buck and guess which one it was or choose a stamp at random, how lucky would you suddenly feel?

After going through those mathematical gyrations, my brain hurt and I forever lost any interest in dreaming of how I would divvy up my after-tax lump-sum lottery distribution. Dream shot. Game over.

I told my little story on the day of the last Big Drawing to one of my colleagues, a sweet lady, gentle and pleasant as they come, a lesson in class. She looked at me with a sweet smile and kindly proffered her opinion of my wet-blanket analysis. Only she didn’t use the word “fudge.”

 Balloons are like puppies. 
 30 Jan 
In the course of my real estate business, I have developed an intimate knowledge of helium balloons. They’re an integral part of our marketing after all, those things we tie to Open House signs on Sundays to distract drivers and small children. I know more about balloons than most people want to know: they don’t float worth a snot when it rains, they burst readily after hitting the Open House sign they’re tied to after only 400 times, and they’re an absolute joy to transport in the back of your car.

Back in Real Estate School they taught us to tie several balloons to each sign. “More is better! You want to make a statement, be noticed!” the instructor would exhort, displaying a shiny new sign with a half-dozen balloons tied to it like a centerpiece at a six-year-old’s party. In a separate class, that same instructor taught us to use a prodigious number of Open House signs as well. “More! You want buyers to follow your signs like Hansel and Gretel’s bread crumbs!” Sadly, we never did the math until just before our very first open house.

So even after experience and a small car taught me to pare down the number of helium balloons I used on Sundays to about a dozen or so, I still went through the ritual of stopping by the local Dollar Store before each open house and putting down coin for a selection of colorful balloons, the hues dictated by the company I was representing, much like suiting up in team colors for a Sunday football game. Wrapping the strings tightly around my hand, I left the grinning clerk to wrangle the bobbing little beasties through the front door, out into the wind and through the all-too-small doorway of my waiting car.

We have two puppies in our family who just love car trips to the local doggie park. They seem to know when there’s a trip coming and where they’re headed, and their excitement grows exponentially from house to car to park. It is inside the car that their boundless joy, bounded by the small interior, is most evident. Anyone who’s transported puppies for any distance knows this for a fact: putting them in the back seat and keeping them there are mutually exclusive concepts. They wind up on the center console. On the front seat. Paws on the dashboard. In your lap. Back to the rear seat, only to start the carousel all over again.

I’ve never transported puppies to an open house, only balloons. But you’d never know it from the experience. No matter how becalmed the day, no matter how carefully I tuck 18 balloons into the back end of the car’s interior, as soon as I tap the gas they all start behaving like a kennel of Schnauzers headed to a screening of 101 Dalmatians . First they inch toward the front, tapping my ears and shoulders, testing the air currents. Then a massive surge follows as they slip between the seats and try to make themselves at home over the gear shifter. I bat. I swat. I hold my arm out until it loses circulation from the strain. I mutter choice words best heard by no one else on a Sunday. All to no avail.

Every time I transport balloons I think of my puppies. And every time I transport my puppies I think of big, fuzzy, yapping balloons, nudging me and trying to be one with the front seats. Puppies behave that way because it’s in their genes to be goofy and excited. Why balloons behave that way in the breezeless interior of a car is beyond me. If there is some scientific principle that can explain why balloons move forward inside a car like demented moths driven to the lights of the dashboard, I would most certainly like to have it explained to me. In the meantime, I’ve taken to planting my Open House signs sans balloons next to my competitors’ helium festooned ones, figuring that if buyers can see their signs, they can see mine as well. And mine are prettier.

 Haunted Traffic Light on Route 1 
 29 Oct 
OK, so maybe “haunted” is not quite the proper term. But in t he spirit of Halloween, I can’t resist venting about the traffic light at the intersection of Route 1 and Ridge Road. Oh, it works just fine, all right. But altogether too fine in my experience.

I’ve been plying Route 1 for years in that vicinity, and frequently use Ridge Road as a shortcut from Route 522 or to avoid the dreaded backup on 1 on most mornings. So I know from whence I speak. And this is what I’m whencing about: Why is it that no matter what time of day it is, no matter how heavy or light the traffic is, I always get stopped by that light travelling on Route 1 in either direction, and get stopped by that same light coming from Ridge Road in either direction? 

Logic, common sense, the laws of probability and pure dumb luck all dictate that a fraction of the time—oh, say half the time—I should approach that light and see a welcoming green waving me through. From either road. After all, it can’t simultaneously be red facing both ways, can it? You would think, no? Ain’t happening.

Approaching Ridge Road along 1, I instinctively let off the gas and tap my brakes well before the intersection, knowing and resigned for what awaits. No question. No discussion. It is so rare to see a green light at that corner that when it does appear, it makes me sit up and consciously take note: “Wow! It does happen! Wait, full moon tonight?” And approaching that same corner along Ridge is as safe a bet as an Alabama/Army football matchup: There Will Be A Red Light There.

For those of you familiar with the northbound approach on 1, an easy explanation would be that the Ridge Road light is synced with the one at Independence Way just before it, causing commuters who slip by the first to be gleefully caught by the second. Not so fast, though. Independence Way is just a glorified parking lot exit for its glass tower residents, and the purpose of the light at that corner is give Route 1 drivers a reason to momentarily hate the selfish oaf who dared to trip it on the pretext of trying to cross the highway with his car in one piece.

So, what’s the deal here? It’s not my imagination; this bothers me to no end and irks me enough that I am more than mildly obsessed with the Haunted Light. It mocks me. It defies the very thing that defines me—logic. I really and truly don’t give a spit about losing a few precious seconds at that intersection for a good cause, such as my safety. But c’mon, let it make some sense!

 Reason Prevails in Kingston 
 18 Oct 
 Driving to work southbound down Mapleton Road in Kingston a few mornings ago, I came upon a construction squeeze in the road. Nothing serious, I foresaw only a brief delay on the lightly traveled road. But once I spied the reason for the work zone itself, my heart fairly soared and all I could think to do was belt out, “Ding dong, the witch is dead!” The speed bumps on Mapleton Road were being removed.

Speed bumps is probably not the appropriate term for those Evil Things, as the township itself professed them to be “rumble strips” on signs posted on either side of the infected zone. They had been four strips of cobblestones set in the macadam, three on the northbound side of the road, one gracing the other. But neither term was ultimately correct.

The four double-strips of pavers were too low to be proper speed bumps. (Wanna experience true speed bumps? Cruise down Princeton Avenue in Montgomery!) Although initially suspected to be such when first installed, they hardly slowed anyone down making the commute home from Forrestal Village to 27 and beyond. But styled as “rumble strips” by the Powers That Be, they were rather gnarly ones at best. Rumble strips are those subtle yet awakening affairs that guard tollbooths along the Parkway: “Yo, dude, ease off the gas and reach for the quarters.” The Mapleton bricks were jar-inducing, teeth-rattling numbers that spilled coffee and shook hubcaps off cars. (Umm, hubcaps? Sorry, showing my age.)

Anyway, Mapleton commuters quickly assessed the Bumps early on and decided that the best course of action to avoid CD skips in their cars was to swerve around the beasts, aiming at least one tire well onto the shoulder or across the double yellow line. It was not uncommon to observe several cars in front of me swing all the way into the oncoming lane three times before reaching the Ridge Road intersection. To say that this created a farcically dangerous situation would be an understatement.

The Township of South Brunswick finally came to its senses and determined that there had never been a situation along Mapleton that required grabbing the attention of drivers via automatic seat massagers, and quietly removed the pretty cobblestone bricks. My commute along that stretch has been literally a smooth one in the last few days, and I feel a bit more secure knowing that the only thing that will cause oncoming drivers to play chicken with me in the future will be one of the gazillion deer that inhabit our wooded homeland. Reason and common sense have prevailed. Now if someone would only address that hair-raising intersection where Fackler Road spills out onto 206, I’d feel much better.

 We are NOT dog owners! 
 14 Oct 
 The “D” word is not allowed in our home. We have two puppies, as the fur on our furniture attests, and they’ve seen their share of changing seasons: Archie is five, and little Zoey recently turned three. Anyone who doesn’t know any better would point out that puppyhood is now in their past. But calling them “Dogs” by those of us in the household who carry ourselves upright on two legs is proscribed, and our reaction to hearing the word on the radio or TV is not unlike that to hearing Ozzy Osbourne holding court in the vestibule of a church.

We used to own tropical fish. We owned a string of hamsters as well, keeping them in a cage only a few evolutionary steps removed from the tank that held their waterlogged brethren. Fish and hamsters were pretty much a commodity: You buy one. You name it and look at it. It dies. You buy another one. Repeat steps two and three. So we no longer own pets. We don’t utter the “P” word either.

Archie and Zoey are as much a part of our family as our two daughters, except that they’re somewhat shorter and don’t speak very clearly. And we refer to them as puppies because the alternative sounds harsh and simply wrong. “Do you own dogs?” “Yeah, two. And we own two women as well.” Those of you whose families include happy children and puppies know exactly what I’m talking about. Those of you who only own men or women may never get it.

I know, I’m coming across as a member of that fringe that is dangerously close to having the word “lunatic” attached to the front of it. There are a great many pet owners (gaaah!) who politely ask Fido to sleep in the garage and refrain from even thinking about elevating himself above the level of a shag carpet. Archie’s three paws have seen every surface of every sofa in our house, and Zoey is most in her element plopped on a mound of pillows on a bed. We don’t impose any restrictions on them that we don’t impose on our daughters, except perhaps don’t bring a friend home that hasn’t been neutered.

So forgive me for going off on a rant; it’s not like anyone’s ever questioned our methods or sanity regarding this. Kindred souls will understand and appreciate. Everyone else can go sprinkle dried corn meal to their pet fish.

I started this blog with the intent of creating a hybrid site where I could engage my real estate clients while indulging my innate desire to put Stuff down in words. The real estate part is coming along nicely; it will be quite functional once completed. The blogging thing, still in its infancy, is showing signs of trouble. Like giving my beloved Archie a foot-long bone and saying, “Here, lick this twice and put it away for later.” Right.

I read somewhere that the average blog post is about 250 to 500 words long; a good number are considerably shorter. I just saw one with a single sentence and a link to Elsewhere. The post on Subway Wars I just published, on the other hand, comes in at a corpulent 2,100 words. Yikes.

OK, I get it. Blogs are individual, there is no Miss Pencilpoint looking over shoulders, ready to pounce on grammar and word length transgressions. It becomes a matter of what end am I seeking. Do I want readers to nibble on an appetizer or amuse-bouche on their iPhone? Or do I want them to tuck into a five-course feast on their Kindle? I want both.

I have neither a Kindle nor an iPhone, those are generic analogies. I check posts, tweets and college football scores on my trusty Android-fueled smartphone, but that is neither here nor there. The point is that my blog will reflect whatever my muse is inspiring me with at the moment. Hopefully those who stumble upon my bite-sized nuggets will be intrigued enough to poke around the mini-novellas I publish now and again. Sounds like a plan.

277 words. Woo.

 Subway Wars 
 12 Oct 
A boy stands on an elevated subway platform in New York City. At the Castle Hill Avenue station in the Bronx, to be precise. He’s about 15 years old, young in relation to the gathering masses of morning commuters slowly filling the platform. The boy is armed with a briefcase, a hard-sided piece of luggage more commonly seen in the hands of business types. But this is 1969, and backpacks have not yet been invented. Oh, they’ve been invented all right, but are larger in size and meant for Boy Scouts packing for a week-long Jamboree in the Catskills. In elementary school the boy carried what was called a “school bag,” a very imitation leather satchel modeled after pre-war European luggage. But high school calls for a meaner look, and a briefcase bears his schoolbooks, homework and lunch nicely.

 The No. 6 subway makes its presence known to the commuters and rumbles busily into the station, too quickly at first, then slowing down with an almost audible sigh as if the station presents a necessary hindrance to its tight schedule. As the ten subway cars’ windows flash by the massed commuters on the station, they signal that this morning, this train will offer more of what can be expected at this hour: crammed bodies inside, some sitting but most standing, taking up every available inch of space in each car. The lucky commuters who boarded at the Pelham Bay terminus are sitting, while everyone else is holding onto handles over the seats or poles placed strategically throughout each car. A fair number of people are not holding onto anything at all; the massed bodies around them make it impossible to fall no matter how fast the subway travels or how tightly it hugs a curve. Personal space does not exist and is not expected.

The massed commuters on the Castle Hill platform view this scene with resignation. Nothing new here. Maybe another, less crowded train is just behind this one, that happens sometimes. The boy’s eyes narrow involuntarily. He sees something different. Like a football offensive lineman eying the opponent’s defensive line, he sees a challenge, one he knows he’s up to. He’s the Crimson Tide of Alabama, after all. His opponent, a worthy foe from a lesser conference, is simply overmatched. Game on.

The subway lurches to a halt, and the boy aims for one of the double doors nearest him. As they slide open, a familiar sight greets Castle Hill station: the sturdy backs of the two passengers who had been leaning against the doors, and beyond that, not a breath of space that is not occupied by massed bodies. This being only the fifth stop from the terminus and still a long way from Manhattan, no one is getting off. Castle Hill is where tired workers come home to sleep, not commute to in the morning. The subway car appears to exhale imperceptibly. The open doors yield some of the constraint that had held the passengers in, but the passengers themselves are reacting in a subliminal manner: they almost seem to will themselves larger to fill any void created by a hopeless attempt at civility in a crammed moving car. They are bracing for attack.

The boy takes the scene in, and his practiced eyes move to the threshold of the open car door. The door opening is roughly five feet wide. Usually only two passengers lean against the closed doors, and today is no exception. Three to a door has been observed at times, but only with very slim individuals who ideally know one another. The boy knows the math without thinking. Two pairs of shoes, no matter how wide or strategically placed, cannot cover five feet. Now he’s a running back facing a defensive line of four shoes with a distinct disadvantage: they cannot move to tackle him. No contest.

Even as his fellow Castle Hill commuters sigh in resignation and remain fixed in their tracks, the boy moves decisively forward. He chooses a vacant gap in the threshold not guarded by a shoe and plants his right foot firmly inside the car. His left hand brings the hard-sided briefcase across his body like a Roman centurion’s shield as he reaches up with his right hand and anchors it just inside the upper edge of the open doorway. Once this position has been established, the result is inevitable.

The boy is keenly aware of the reaction of the massed bodies inside the subway car. No one looks at him; no one makes any sign of acknowledging his presence. But the mass of humanity in the car moves as one, like a viper poked with a stick and uncoiling in anger. Passengers well inside the car inch toward the door, and the two stiff backs facing him actually arch outward. “You are not getting in,” the mass speaks silently. “We are suffering here collectively, we do not need you to add to our grief.”

The boy does not heed the objections of the mass. His right foot and right hand are firmly in place; in his mind he’s already staked his claim inside the car. Stiffening leg and arm muscles, the boy arches his body forcefully against the backs in front of him, accepting no debate or resistance. The mass pushes outward, but the boy has an unfair advantage—his age. Not the strength that comes with being fifteen, that’s an even exchange in the heat of a commuter war. His advantage is the fact that a fifteen-year-old boy can shove adults more than twice his age with impunity. The adults cannot reciprocate; it comes with the territory of being more mature. In mere seconds the battle is over. The boy’s body has been forced inside the car, and the sliding doors scrape his and other backs on their way to meet each other. He is inside.

As the subway lurches forward and picks up speed on its way to the next station, the human mass inside the car relaxes from its battle mode as passengers attempt to recover their tiny zone of comfort and politely refrain from pressing against one another as much as they can. Battles in New York City are constant and frequent, and feelings dissipate rapidly as the next set of challenges is presented and addressed. The boy is now just another passenger leaning on a subway car door, maybe the newest addition forming the infrequent three-across formation, or perhaps having displaced a previous leaner who is now doubling up on an overhead handle.

Soon the subway slows and reluctantly comes to a halt at the Parkchester station, which bears the name of a rather large nearby development, called a “project” in the day. The teeming masses on the elevated platform dwarf those at Castle Hill, and this crowd is restless. The subway doors open, and the battle is joined.

The boy, his back to the masses on the platform, makes his next practiced move. Reaching up with his right arm again, he anchors his hand on the same doorway edge that had served as a fulcrum in his last campaign. His move and intent are obvious to all, but once again age is an overwhelming advantage: fifteen-year-old boys have no shame. Braced for anyone who dares to breach the gates of the keep, the boy arches his stiffened back outward in preparation for the possible threat. Often the mere sight of the braced boy elicits defeat on the part of the platform commuters, but if a challenge does come, the outcome is not a foregone one. The subway car mass exhales again and surges outward, the boy leading the defense. Sometimes an attacker will even win, slipping past the boy or forcing his way in on the momentum of a tightly massed attacking force on the platform. Either way the battle is fierce, ending only when the sliding doors separate the winners from the losers and allow the subway to proceed to its next battleground.

As a logistics executive in my previous life, I had several opportunities to join new departments and companies as my career progressed. Often I was the new manager, one hired to look at situations with a fresh eye and invariably tasked with turning them around. An advantage of bringing a new guy in from outside the organization is the different outlook and wealth of new ideas the newcomer brings. His perspective is fresh, he bears no preconceived notions or pre-established loyalties.

So it was whenever I came aboard. Looking at everything with a critical eye, I questioned procedures, motives and standards. How easy it was to spot faults that seemed obvious to everyone—how long have you guys been doing this in such an unproductive fashion? Are you seriously still doing things this way? The pushback I received ranged from subtle to not so. What the hell did I know about their organization, so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and not having gone through countless battles with deadlines, budgets, personnel issues and the myriad obstacles strewn in the path of a weary team?

Pushback or not, I prided myself on ramming changes through, as subtly or forcefully as was called for. Invariably the changes had their intended effect, the organization strengthened and thrived, productivity increased, all was well with the world. Then time went by. Anyone who’s taken even a cursory look at company payrolls knows that managers earn their keep; operations are a slogging campaign in the trenches, obstacles are numerous and imposing. After several seasons of struggle, everyone is bloodied and bruised, getting through the next day and project with as much grit as can be mustered.

In comes another newbie, perhaps an auditor or a new member of senior management. The dreaded questions are raised: Why are you doing this or that? How do you justify your performance vis-à-vis your burgeoning budget? My reaction in such cases was invariably harsh and not unexpected: Who do you think you are, what do you think you know about our problems and issues? Your proposed methods are slick, but they don’t mesh with the systems we’ve set up and have been running for years!

As the young boy on the subway platform so many years ago, I fought the subway wars as a sport on my way to school, much as I played pick-up basketball after classes. The social implications of the battles did not register with me, and almost certainly not with the passengers within or without. We were all just trying to get to school or work in the quickest and most comfortable manner possible, two qualities that were irreconcilably at odds during rush hour.

It wasn’t until I was in management that memories of the subway wars came back to me and symbolized typical human behavior in confrontational situations: If I am outside, I will fight the Enemy inside to take my rightful place in their midst. Once I am inside, I will band with my new-found Allies to repel attacking outsiders. George Orwell describes a scene in 1984 where a party rally supporting Oceania’s alliance with Eastasia against Eurasia makes a dramatic u-turn literally mid-sentence to portray Eurasia as the new ally against Eastasia. The subway wars of my youth were very similar in the rapid and constant shifting of alliances among passengers. Management u-turns, or even slight bends in the road, are not as dramatic, but they are most definitely a reality. The rationale may differ from Orwell’s doublethink, but the results are the same. If you and I are not on the same side of the subway threshold, we are at odds.

How many other decisions and attitudes are determined by a subway war mentality? How many people hew to a political party line simply because that’s the accepted plank in the platform? Don’t even get me started on religious differences. And is there an answer to the “I’m in, you’re not” mentality? Actually, there is. I could have left my house earlier, stood on the platform and let trains go by until one arrived with reasonable breathing room. Step inside, no fight. That’s called “Compromise.” I make the extra effort, I let reason prevail, and everyone gets what they want. But tell that to a fifteen-year-old boy running late to his geometry class.

I still fight subway battles with others engaged in similar wars, both in business and on personal fronts. What is it they say,“Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it”? In many ways, we are all too often just fifteen-year-olds still repeating history.
