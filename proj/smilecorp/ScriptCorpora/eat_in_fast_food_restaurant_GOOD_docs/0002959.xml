View Full Version : Burger King Indy Toys and Whopper 
 Pages : [ 1 ] 2 IndySeven 06-28-2007, 09:11 AM Does anyone think that Burger King will make Super Deformed figures for the Indiana Jones promo like they did with Star Wars? I think that it would be pretty cool!:) Niteshade007 06-28-2007, 12:10 PM I don&apos;t quite understand. What are super deformed? That sounds like a bad thing. Yet you seem excited about it...

And I thought that places like Taco Bell and KFC had Star Wars promotions. I don&apos;t remember Burger King&apos;s, but then again, I&apos;m not a big Burger King or Star Wars fan. Aaron H 06-28-2007, 12:30 PM They had huge heads and little bodies. Niteshade007 06-28-2007, 12:40 PM Oh, interesting. Kind of like bobble heads? Or did they not wobble? Either way, I agree it&apos;d be neat to have Indy characters like that. Lon 06-28-2007, 01:21 PM I&apos;m guessing they won&apos;t since it&apos;s something they&apos;ve done already. I liked what they did with their Fantastic Four 2 figures and hope they do something similar to that.

Or do collector&apos;s glasses. I would love to see those make a comeback. McDonald&apos;s just did some for Shrek the Third.

Keep in mind, Burger King doesn&apos;t necessarily have to do toys. I believe for Attack of the Clones they did watches. Niteshade007 06-28-2007, 01:32 PM I hope they don&apos;t do watches, those are lame. Lon 06-28-2007, 01:38 PM At least we&apos;ll get something. Live Free or Die Hard has a tie-in with Arby&apos;s but I don&apos;t believe there is a premium, or even promotional cups. There&apos;s an online game and contest you can enter but I think that&apos;s it. That&apos;s lame. Lon 06-28-2007, 01:40 PM A co-worker of mine knows a woman who is a manager at a Burger King so he&apos;s going to set me up with any Indy advertising displays the store uses.

He said she&apos;s given him Spider-Man 3, Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones ad materials so she&apos;s willing to give that stuff away.

Woo hoo! :whip: Niteshade007 06-28-2007, 01:46 PM Congrats! I wish I knew someone who could get me that stuff. Listen to me, I want stuff that isn&apos;t even out yet! Aaron H 06-28-2007, 02:21 PM Here is a sample:
http://www.slave1.jp/collection/boba-fett/boba-image4/medicom-v-boba06.jpg Niteshade007 06-28-2007, 02:33 PM It&apos;d be cool to see Indiana Jones like that, but I don&apos;t think they could get away with other characters looking like that. All the other characters are new, and they would just look odd, you know? I mean, Star Wars characters are easily identified, so any variation on their look and one can still tell who they are. With the new Indiana Jones movie, it won&apos;t be like that. We are going to be introduced to these people for the first time, and who wants a giant head of John Hurt? IndySeven 06-28-2007, 08:13 PM Nice!!!!:up: JimmyPSHayes 06-28-2007, 08:50 PM Maybe if I start going there more often now, I can make friends with a manager and get some stuff too. When Last Crusade came out, my best friend worked at McDonalds and was able to get me the huge Indy display from when they were selling the VHS tapes. Ohio Jones 06-28-2007, 11:38 PM Or do collector&apos;s glasses. I would love to see those make a comeback. McDonald&apos;s just did some for Shrek the Third.


That would be great... I love the vintage BK &apos;Star Wars&apos; glasses.

We are going to be introduced to these people for the first time, and who wants a giant head of John Hurt?

Maybe &apos;Elephant Man&apos; fans :p. Shortie 06-29-2007, 12:01 AM They also did the same for Spider-Man this year. I like these deformed figures&amp;I hope that Indy gets this style. Shortie 06-29-2007, 12:02 AM I know someone who works at W*M. Maybe she can hook me up with some Indy promotional stuff. kongisking 06-29-2007, 02:33 PM Are you kidding? Those deformed toys look ridiculous! You can barely do anything with them! If they have Indy 4 toys at Burger King (and Jesus I hope they do), they just should make good old fashioned action figures. Or at least do us the pleasure of having figures that say movie phrases, like the great Lord of the Rings toys did a few years back.

Oh wait! I got a great idea for BK Indy Toys! They could probably make figures in the style of AttacktiX, with bases and scorecards and that other stuff! That would be great! And they could also do a cool promo-thing where they give out limited edition tickets to the movie! (fat chance)

Or perhaps even give out an Indy Burger-a Whopper with bacon cut into whip-shapes and a pic of Indy burned into the top bun (think McGriddles). Ha!

I&apos;ll think of some more ideas for BK promoting Indy 4. I&apos;m definitely not done yet! kongisking 06-29-2007, 02:35 PM A co-worker of mine knows a woman who is a manager at a Burger King so he&apos;s going to set me up with any Indy advertising displays the store uses.

He said she&apos;s given him Spider-Man 3, Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones ad materials so she&apos;s willing to give that stuff away.

Woo hoo! :whip:

You lucky SOB. Damn!!! :mad:

Congrats, though. Maybe you can talk him into giving you extra, so I can have some! (just kidding, but I WOULD like that!) :o indyt 06-29-2007, 02:37 PM Good job man. I need to go to may towns BK and go ahead and get dibbs on the promos. Viper 07-15-2007, 12:21 AM My neighbor said she got something for me at a garage sale. It was an old 80s Indy toy, still in the freaking wrapper! It was just a pin with a picture of Indy and it said&quot;McDonalds&quot;at the bottom, but man that&apos;s old.

I hope my younger sister tells me if she sees a commercial for Indy toys, because besides the fact I watch almost no TV whatsoever anymore, I HATE fast food. Edward The Head 07-15-2007, 06:11 PM My neighbor said she got something for me at a garage sale. It was an old 80s Indy toy, still in the freaking wrapper! It was just a pin with a picture of Indy and it said&quot;McDonalds&quot;at the bottom, but man that&apos;s old.


I don&apos;t think that&apos;s from the 80s. I&apos;m pretty sure that it&apos;s from the early 90s when McDonalds was doing the videos for sale. I was working there at the time, but I didn&apos;t keep anything.

I don&apos;t know what to do about the toys at BK. I don&apos;t eat fast food any more, see working at McDonalds, so I don&apos;t know how I&apos;ll get them. Maybe they will just sell them like we used to do. Or I&apos;ll just have to buy something and throw it away. JimmyPSHayes 07-16-2007, 08:20 AM Back a few years ago, when McDonalds had the beanie baby craze going, they let you buy the happy meal, but donate it to a charity and keep the toy. That would be a nice alternative. IndyJr. 07-18-2007, 08:05 PM I&apos;m guessing they won&apos;t since it&apos;s something they&apos;ve done already. I liked what they did with their Fantastic Four 2 figures and hope they do something similar to that.

Or do collector&apos;s glasses. I would love to see those make a comeback. McDonald&apos;s just did some for Shrek the Third.

Keep in mind, Burger King doesn&apos;t necessarily have to do toys. I believe for Attack of the Clones they did watches.

they won&apos;t just because they did it already? pfft... they did that for StarWars 2 and 3 (2 didn&apos;t they?) and for Spider-Man 3... possibly even more... so that doesn&apos;t mean anything... it&apos;s like a BK trademark... Shortie 07-21-2007, 01:25 PM No they didn&apos;t do it for AOTC. I don&apos;t think they did anything for AOTC. No Ticket 07-21-2007, 02:25 PM No they didn&apos;t do it for AOTC.

Oh yeah?

I&apos;ve heard here and there that Burger King will be included in the promotion for KOTCS, What do u think theyre planning and when it starts??? I wonder if its going to be like the Star Wars ROTS line. I hope they have toys, crowns, cups etc. I love collecting burger king toys. What do u all think??? Little Indy 02-22-2008, 11:57 PM Maybe they&apos;ll have fedora crowns!;) Mr. Fusion 02-23-2008, 12:28 AM Maybe they&apos;ll have fedora crowns!;)

That would be sweet! I wonder how SA they&apos;d be?:rolleyes: IndySeven 02-23-2008, 09:14 AM Oh yeah?

http://cgi.ebay.com/Star-Wars-Burger-King-Watches-4-different-Mint-in-Tin_W0QQitemZ130134721478QQcmdZViewItem

That watch promo was for ROTS. AOTC had no fast food promo at all, which was a real shame. It would&apos;ve been great to see some fast food promos for AOTC!:up: Insomniac 02-25-2008, 01:59 PM They should make Mini Chubbyz Uki 02-25-2008, 05:42 PM I think it&apos;d be pretty nifty and somewhat likely that BK would get the SD toys going for Indy, possibly a collection spanning the entire series of films as the SW toys did a few years ago. Arab Swordsman 04-13-2008, 08:48 AM I thought this was pretty funny...

Godamned marketing. We&apos;re a world defined by our symbols rather than one where we define our symbols. You know? Whatever happened to creativity and artistic expression? The value of expression. Now there&apos;s no value unless it can be plastered with a Burger King logo.

Nicely put. Unfortunately, I share your sentiments. I&apos;ve decided to adopt moedred&apos;s (http://raven.theraider.net/showpost.php?p=293149&amp;postcount=11) logic of legitimation, though. It&apos;s much easier that way:
Indy&apos;s humble origins, cliffhanger serials, did whatever they could to bring you back next week for more newsreels. They cheated heavily between installments. The filmmakers must have been quite cynical. Certain death was always given a reprieve. So, consider it all homage.

I merged the&quot;King&quot;with the rest of fluff news. bonoferox 04-13-2008, 09:45 AM I didn&apos;t even know BK was having a promotion. When did this start? crowmagnumman 04-13-2008, 10:03 AM Nicely put. Unfortunately, I share your sentiments.

This moedred seems wise. I admit that I feel the same way about the surge of commercialism. I tend to like things that aren&apos;t so commercial. But if Indy 4 is good I&apos;m going to have to like it anyway and just ignore all this commercialism. metalinvader 04-13-2008, 10:03 AM I didn&apos;t even know BK was having a promotion. When did this start?


It&apos;s starting in May... Moedred 04-13-2008, 06:37 PM This moedred seems wise.
Wit limitless composition time, the wisdom of King Solomon or Burger is achievable! I&apos;m pleased with the marketing onslaught. Notice how these promotions all say&quot;only in theaters&quot;below the movie title. Licensees could learn a thing or two from Lucasfilm about herding people like cattle into theaters. If this repels a few, fine, more bacon and pepper jack Indy Whoppers for me! herr gruber 04-13-2008, 06:47 PM http://i8.ebayimg.com/07/i/000/e9/05/4a77_1.JPG

Oh no Sarah, he IS Indy :eek: iLUVINDY 04-16-2008, 07:02 PM Does anybody know when the Burger King Promotion starts, i remember reading somewhere that is starts May 1st, but with so many dates to remember, i&apos;m not sure if its correct.

May 12th according to the poster I saw at a BK today.... blueseattle 04-16-2008, 11:39 PM I&apos;m gonna have to walk to the BK near my school to grab figures. This is a good work out. Hah. I just won&apos;t eat anything. masterJ 04-17-2008, 11:23 AM Does anyone know what toys will be included with this promotion? I hope its action figures! blueseattle 04-17-2008, 12:06 PM I think it&apos;ll be the big head things, actually. iLUVINDY 04-17-2008, 02:47 PM i love those Super-D, big head figures, i dont know why.... i think there different and original, are they gonna have just new toys from the new movie or from all 4 movies... like Star Wars did, I hope its from all 4 films!!!!!!:whip: Shortie 04-18-2008, 12:29 AM Looks like we&apos;ll be seeing these in June, because is also doing crappy (the toys not the movie) Iron Man toys.

I get where you&apos;re coming from RA, but come on. Indy hasn&apos;t really been in the spotlight very much in the past 20 years. And this whole ordeal is going to come and go pretty quick... at least, this level of marketing will.

Besides, advertisements have never worked on me anyway. It doesn&apos;t sadden me to see the Burger King dressed up as Indy. I think it&apos;s kind of funny.

Doesn&apos;t mean I want to go buy a whopper. RichardJones 04-18-2008, 01:52 PM I get where you&apos;re coming from RA, but come on.

Good point No Ticket , I really dont go to BK much now and a whopper is not going to taste better because of Indy King or what ever they will call him. I do look forward to the BK figures, My kid is going to eat alot of Kids meals. Ok , ok , I&apos;m going to eat alot of kids meals :rolleyes: Maybe they will let us buy the figures like they did for the star wars bk line :up: iLUVINDY 04-21-2008, 03:24 PM The Burger King site has updated with the Iron Man promo toys.... i guess they will have iron man from April 21 - May 11, since Indy 4 promo starts May 12th.... i really hope it starts on time and not pushed back until JUNE, STUPID IRON-MAN!!!!!!!!!!!:down: :down: QBComics 04-21-2008, 03:38 PM Well then I will frequently be going to Burger King to see Indy blueseattle 04-21-2008, 06:02 PM I don&apos;t eat fast food, but I sure do spend a couple of dollars here and there.. consider those figures mine. Lon 04-21-2008, 06:20 PM Do we know for a fact toys or other promotional items are being offered?

USA Today has an article on the marketing for Indiana Jones and it only mentions an&quot;Indy Whopper&quot;at Burger King.

Burger King. Starting May 12, BK will offer an Indy Whopper with two burger patties, spicy sauce, bacon and pepper-jack cheese. It&apos;s an&quot;adventurous&quot;concoction Indy would favor, says Brian Gies, vice president of marketing.

Stores already have posters of BK&apos;s King character dressed as Indiana Jones, including a leather jacket, fedora and whip.

&quot;It&apos;s a powerful movie franchise,&quot;Gies says.&quot;There&apos;s a legion of fans out there for Indiana Jones.&quot;

I&apos;m kind of shocked they didn&apos;t go with the super deformed style that they did with the SW figs a few years back...Oh well... JimmyPSHayes 04-23-2008, 08:04 AM I HAVE to have that mine car!! :D I actually had a steak house burger from Burger King last night, it wasn&apos;t too bad. Thanks for posting that Moedred!

Those toys really look cool! Darn, too bad there aren&apos;t any Burger Kings out here... I&apos;ll probably have to go to Holland or Germany... RelicHunter 04-23-2008, 09:54 AM Wow! cool, I don&apos;t like Burger King but looks like I will be there a lot.

Are you jokin&apos; me? The deformed figures are kinda stupid-looking! I like actual action figures, thanks very much, and I am happier than sh!t that we are getting BK Indy toys of that kind.

:down:
Agreed. I miss those SW figs like that and it would be awesome if they did it with Indy. We got like fifty SW SD figs when BK did it back then, but now we are just getting like ten because they did it differently. They should have done SD figs.
I like actual action figures, thanks very much, and I am happier than sh!t that we are getting BK Indy toys of that kind.
They aren&apos;t exactly action figures. Just figures that aren&apos;t deformed. kongisking 05-01-2008, 03:08 PM They aren&apos;t exactly action figures. Just figures that aren&apos;t deformed.

I like my toys realistically-proportioned, thank you very much...;) :hat:

That&apos;s why I HAAAAAAAAAAATE anime; the style is gross and sick to look at. No finesse, depth or realism! GAHHHHHGG! WillKill4Food 05-01-2008, 06:04 PM I like my toys realistically-proportioned, thank you very much...;) :hat:

Same here, as regards to anime.
But, I like the Burger King figures. Don&apos;t know why, but they grew on me. EvilDevo 05-01-2008, 07:30 PM Does anybody know if these toys are available at Burger King yet? The Golden Idol 05-01-2008, 07:31 PM Does anybody know if these toys are available at Burger King yet?

As far as I know, only Iron Man is at BK right now. IndyKate 05-01-2008, 07:57 PM I believe the date given for the beginning of the Burger King Indy promotion was May 12th. If you check out TheRaider.net and throwmetheidol.com I think that is the date posted. Lao Che Pun 05-04-2008, 06:50 PM Is that thing still coming out? I imagine it would&apos;ve been out by now, no?

If they do Hulk. Lao Che Pun 05-11-2008, 09:32 PM I know where I&apos;ll be going tomorrow for lunch. I can get the chicken sandwich they have on sale each Monday at my BK for 1.29 and pick up some Indy toys!

The 1.29 Chicken sandwich? Are you crazy?

You mean, you&apos;re not picking up the Indy Whopper? QBComics 05-11-2008, 09:41 PM Cool. :) Just saw an BK Indy commercial sponsering the sweepstakes. Arab Swordsman 05-11-2008, 09:55 PM The 1.29 Chicken sandwich? Are you crazy?

You mean, you&apos;re not picking up the Indy Whopper?

The pepper jack and bacon is a bit much for me at lunch! On Monday&apos;s they have 1.29 chicken and Wednesday&apos;s is 1.29 regular Whopper (2.99 for the combos). Pretty good deal. BlackSleep 05-12-2008, 09:28 AM I&apos;m heading to BK for lunch today, hoping to strike gold with an Indy toy. Only another hour and a half to wait! blueseattle 05-12-2008, 09:38 AM I hope its the mine cart or the journal. IndyKate 05-12-2008, 10:07 AM I hope they have all the toys available... in the past I went in and was able to get 2-3 different toys at once, but sometimes the cashiers are hard-asses and won&apos;t accommodate my obsessions...

But I think I only want the mine car and the rolling boulder... maybe the journal too, or Mutt on his cycle.

Has anyone had any success yet? bonoferox 05-12-2008, 10:40 AM I&apos;m heading to BK at lunch as well if I can make it there in 30 minutes. It&apos;s only about 2 miles away (or less) but it&apos;s at one of the worst intersections in Indianapolis, so it takes about 20 minutes to get there. veldhuid 05-12-2008, 11:01 AM Got the Journal and Mutt on the bike yesterday.

Journal is kinda cool and worth picking up. BlackSleep 05-12-2008, 11:03 AM Just got back from BK--got Mutt on Motorcycle. blueseattle 05-12-2008, 11:34 AM Just got back from BK--got Mutt on Motorcycle.


Yes! That&apos;s the one I wanted! BlackSleep 05-12-2008, 11:39 AM ^ it wasn&apos;t really the one i wanted, but i have to admit it&apos;s really well made and has Shia&apos;s likeness down better than the Hasbro action figures do bonoferox 05-12-2008, 11:40 AM Can you buy them individually, or do you have to get the meal? IndyKate 05-12-2008, 11:49 AM Can you buy them individually, or do you have to get the meal?


Usually you can buy them separately, but it costs something like $1.25 or $1.50 per toy now. And sometimes the cashiers will be little punks and won&apos;t let you have different toys. Never hurts to ask, though. JimmyPSHayes 05-12-2008, 12:00 PM I got an Iron Man toy..........in an Indiana Jones bag. :mad: BlackSleep 05-12-2008, 12:02 PM I got an Iron Man toy..........in an Indiana Jones bag. :mad:

I was really scared that would happen to me, given my luck...

I&apos;ve never tried to buy them individually, but if you schmooze someone at the counter for a minute, then request a specific toy in your kid&apos;s meal, you can usually get some help. But you have to say something nice to them up front, so you don&apos;t come across as a picky, pushy neurotic. JimmyPSHayes 05-12-2008, 12:05 PM Yeah, I&apos;m going to hit the one by my house on the way home and go inside and see if I can get an Indy toy. Maybe they&apos;ll even be nice and let me trade in this Iron Man toy. blueseattle 05-12-2008, 12:20 PM A part of me dies when I go into Burger King... a bigger part of me vanishes when I have to ask for kids meal toys.

sigh... Yep. Munkeewrench 05-12-2008, 01:45 PM Lucky for me that I have a 3 year old to take with me, although I do ask for 2 of each... indyjones2131 05-12-2008, 02:07 PM And i feel like I just ate a bad date.

It was tasty. Kids toy was the invisible pen. So cool to see all of the Indy stuff - they went all out. Agent Spalko 05-12-2008, 02:10 PM Did you swap the whopper with a bag of fries? Agent Z 05-12-2008, 02:35 PM And i feel like I just ate a bad date.

It was tasty.


Hmmm, a conflicting field report.

So, is the Indy Double Whopper recommended? :confused: whipcracker666 05-12-2008, 02:50 PM [QUOTE=indyjones2131]And i feel like I just ate a bad date.

It was tasty. QUO
TE]

I have that experience everytime I eat at burger thing, I mean it&apos;s always tasty but afterwards I feel like I ate something that was never meant for human consumption.Come to think of it , takes longer for my body to recuperate from a double Whopper than it takes to recuperate from an all night extacey binge. BlackSleep 05-12-2008, 03:01 PM ^ I&apos;ll second that tupogirl 05-12-2008, 03:23 PM I actually love Whoppers (Jrs) and I seem to need a certain amount of protein to function well.

But yes, knowing my luck, we&apos;d get more Iron Man toys. We seem to have hit BK a lot lately for some reason. I didn&apos;t think the Indy toys would be out so soon! loganbush 05-12-2008, 03:45 PM I got the Shia motorcycle. I took it back and said I hated Shia, can I exchange it for a different one. Then they gave me an invisible pen. Lao Che Pun 05-12-2008, 04:03 PM I got an Iron Man toy..........in an Indiana Jones bag. :mad:

That&apos;s frickin&apos; funny.

On the toy note, apparently the mine cart isn&apos;t available yet then? bonoferox 05-12-2008, 04:29 PM Got the journal thing with&quot;invisible&quot;pen in the kids meal. Not bad. Didn&apos;t win anything on my medium sized cup that was given to me instead of the kids meal sized drink Deckard 05-12-2008, 04:41 PM Haha, Yea I&apos;m 22 and I&apos;m eating a kid&apos;s meal.

http://i268.photobucket.com/albums/jj32/deckard86/0190.jpg blueseattle 05-12-2008, 04:56 PM Of course... I went to mine and while they had all the Indy stuff up (some kid even ordered an Indy Whopper), the lady wouldn&apos;t sell me the toy alone and said they only had Sponge Bob toys. GREAT management, huh? reverendB 05-12-2008, 05:12 PM SPONGEBOB TOYS?!!? OH FOR SHAME...

Yup. Like everyone else who got Indy toys, I got the pen and Mutt. I asked and I received. I got both. No hassle, no kids meal. And only a buck a piece. I won nothing. The BKINDY sight is kind of fun too if you go to it with the Bonus Play ticket on the fries/ cups.five hours My onion rings are STILL talking to me 5 hours later!!! ugh. . .


ReverendB iLUVINDY 05-12-2008, 06:05 PM I went today and was only able to get Mutt w/ Motorcycle. Does anybody know how there releasing these, 2 by 2.... or what??????? Nurhachi1991 05-12-2008, 06:12 PM I got the grail diary


The Indy burger is a booby trap of fat! lol Nurhachi1991 05-12-2008, 06:14 PM A part of me dies when I go into Burger King... a bigger part of me vanishes when I have to ask for kids meal toys.


Me to and there was a hot girl from my school working in there and she saw me order a ******* kids meal. The Golden Idol 05-12-2008, 06:20 PM What&apos;s the best-looking BK Indy toy? metalinvader 05-12-2008, 06:36 PM I just got two of those stupid pens.Though the little Grail diary is awesome.

On a side not,This food is ****ing disgusting.I have not ate fast food in two years but DAMN is it good!
It&apos;s disgusting, but good?
I hate fast food.
Eat it all the time, sadly, but I hate it. Nurhachi1991 05-12-2008, 06:44 PM Im not a big fan of fast food either but Indy promos make everything taste like perfection metalinvader 05-12-2008, 06:46 PM It&apos;s disgusting, but good?

Heh.I meant taste.

It taste good but in reality it&apos;s deep fried sh!t. BlackSleep 05-12-2008, 07:16 PM yeah from here on out i&apos;m going to try to buy the toys w/out the food, and if i can&apos;t do that i&apos;m tossing the food in the garbage. The Golden Idol 05-12-2008, 08:17 PM Does anyone have the TV Indy Burger King commercial that is described on the front page of The Raider? EvilDevo 05-12-2008, 08:58 PM Just ate the Indy Whopper. Delicious. Deliciously horrible for me...
Seriously though, best fast food burger I&apos;ve ever eaten. And subsequently wished I didn&apos;t.

As for the toys, I bought the only two they had available: That green pen thing... and Mutt on the motorcycle. Weak! I wanted Indy in the mine cart and perhaps this grail diary I&apos;ve been hearing so much about. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back...

Probably going to have to get (and then laminate) a place mat, and a cup too. Are there two different cup styles?

Wow... I&apos;m talking about saving paper cups from BK. What has Indiana Jones done to me? metalinvader 05-12-2008, 09:02 PM As for the toys, I bought the only two they had available: That green pen thing... and Mutt on the motorcycle. Weak!

The Grail diary comes with the pen.It&apos;s the little note book you write in.I was shocked myself when I found that out! Dr.Jones 05-12-2008, 09:09 PM This is intended not only as a great story, but as a possible tactic some of the community might want to try:

It all started this morning when I eagerly shuffled up to the local Burger King, anxiously awaiting the decorations inside. I pushed open the door from the chilling air to feel the warm gusts of adventure. Indiana Jones Standees advertising a prize campaign caught my eye. It was Indy holding a rope that connected to the ceiling, simulating a whipswing. Whip (coiled whips) posters hung fron the tiled ceiling, each picturing a different prize. A giant poster of the King in Indy garb adorned the wall. The Toys were pictured beautifully in a clear plastic bubble. I ordered a French Toast Kids Meal and took the Motorcycle Mutt figure (no Jones yet :mad: ). But as I waited for my humble breakfast, I noticed promotional posters draped over the counter, awaiting display. As the worker handed me my sack (and an odd look), I sarcastically said&quot;Can I have one of these?&quot;She looked down, looked at me, looked down again, and turned back. I walked away and ate my rather mediocre meal in peace. Naturally I took an extra table card and was almost ready to leave this haven when the woman grabbed my arm. She looked into my eyes and said the following&quot;Leave your name and number.&quot;I apparently looked confused. But then she said the oddest, but best, words to grace my ears all day:&quot;You can have everything when we&apos;re done - including the leftover toys&quot;
:confused: At first it wasn&apos;t registering in my brain.&quot;Give me Indy stuff?&quot;I thought, my normal functions returning. It finally hit me and I gave exactly this :up: as I walked outside.

I now eagerly await the day I am called by the King... :gun: No Ticket 05-12-2008, 10:10 PM I just ordered a kids meal.


And they gave me an Iron Man toy!!

OH Cruel Fate! Shemp 05-12-2008, 10:11 PM Your are very lucky indeed! Great story! Looks like I might have to hit up some BK&apos;s :whip: ! drwynn 05-12-2008, 10:47 PM I&apos;ve been using a similar tactic since&quot;Temple of Doom&quot;came out on VHS in the mid-80&apos;s...

...when I first saw the poster advertising the VHS for the film, I asked the owner of our local video rental place if I could have the poster when they were finished...and sure enough, I got it. Over the years I&apos;ve amassed quite a collection of posters that way;&quot;Temple&quot;, some&quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;posters, a HUGE Freddy Krueger standee, some 6-foot posters, etc. You get the idea...

Anyways, I haven&apos;t hesitated to ask my local retail/grocery stores for their Indy promotional materials this year. And so far...it&apos;s paid off in the form of a 6-foot Indiana Jones standee and a 5-foot wide, 2 1/2 foot long Indiana Jones banner. I think I might have to visit BK tomorrow morning...

It never hurts to ask for stuff...what&apos;s the worst that can happen? They say no and life goes on, right?

Ahhh...but if they say yes; fortune and glory awaits, folks! Dr. Indy Jones 05-13-2008, 12:02 AM Man, now I need to head out this week and find what stores have this stuff on display and ask them if I could have it. I&apos;ll let you guys know what happens. EvilDevo 05-13-2008, 12:29 AM The Grail diary comes with the pen.It&apos;s the little note book you write in.I was shocked myself when I found that out!

Yeah I found that out a couple hours after I posted that message. Nice surprise!

I also saved myself a cup... and&quot;chose wisely&quot;winning a BK french toast. Nice surpise! High in fat!&quot;What... is happening... TO ME?!&quot;:dead: QBComics 05-13-2008, 06:59 AM This is intended not only as a great story, but as a possible tactic some of the community might want to try:

They had a stack of Indy flyers by the register which had all the toys listed on the back. I spread it out and asked if I could buy them separately, then asked which ones they had. They only had the two listed in this thread (Motorcyle; Diary), so I assume they&apos;ll get a different pair each week. Lon 05-13-2008, 04:00 PM A guy I work with has a friend who manages a Burger King and I had him put her on alert for me to try and get the promotional, posters, standees, signs, etc. I said I was more than happy to buy kid&apos;s meals and get the toys on my own.

No Ticket 05-14-2008, 02:33 AM Is it weird I saved my Indy whopper wrapper? lol. BTW, the Indy whopper is delicious. It really does taste like someone dug it up somewhere!

Haha.. kidding. Agent Spalko 05-14-2008, 02:57 AM I think these BK toys are totally uninspiring. They look like cheap vending machine junk. I almost wish they had been Super D toys. I miss the days of really cool food promotional items. It would have been neat if they had sold some crystal skull drinking glasses like they did the LOTR goblets.

I still need to hit our locak Burger King and see what they got. Maybe this Friday, I took the day off.

I asked at a Borders Book Store for a cardboard display of the Indy paper back books. They took my name and number down. Hopefully they will call once they are finished with it. But, you are right, it never hurts to ask. tnswman 05-14-2008, 08:33 AM I was ableto secure the BK Indy stand up, WITH THE WHIP :) and the Blockbuster standee all in one day :) WHOOOHOOOO! bonoferox 05-14-2008, 09:54 AM Glad to have you back, tns

Good score on the BK items ChromiumBlue37 05-14-2008, 09:58 AM Welcome back, TNSWMAN!!! :hat:

It was so quiet without you!! Billy Ray 05-15-2008, 08:27 AM Finally hit BK last night. My daughter got the pen/grail diary...she thought it was pretty cool. The Indy Whopper is mighty tasty too. will have to stop by and see if I can pick up some more of the toys. Really want the boulder set, mine car set, and hidden temple thing. What is up with the&quot;hip whip&quot;though? What is it supposed to do? It&apos;s a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Indy fan 235 05-15-2008, 09:25 AM From the pictures I really like the Indy Boulder, Mine Car and Temple one, they are nice iconic toys from each film. I wish the LC one was something like that.

I might have to try the Indy Whopper, keep the whole&quot;Indy vibe&quot;going while there. MaxPhactor23 05-15-2008, 09:47 AM I&apos;m really only after the classic ones, ie: boulder and mine cart. The diary is disappointing. I wish they had something else, like perhaps a grail itself. The others look pretty nifty though. RichardJones 05-15-2008, 10:36 AM Just left bk and as I am eating I notice some fine print on my cup, under the $ 1 Million Dollars contest it says * payable over 20 years. Dont get me wrong , I will take 50K a year but its not like you could quit your job if you won, I would have to have a job to pay for Gas:mad: Lets see if I won.:up: RichardJones 05-15-2008, 10:38 AM Nope :down: Munkeewrench 05-15-2008, 07:48 PM Ah the joy of eating at BK...They forgot a large fry, my son&apos;s apple juice, put mayo on my burger when I asked for none and gave me 1 of the 4 toys I paid for (2 of each...1 for me and 1 for my son)...This BK has messed up my order 7 of the last 9 times I have been there...Repeated trips to the counter are the norm...

Why couldn&apos;t Mcdonalds have gotten the license? BlackSleep 05-15-2008, 08:17 PM Just got back from BK, thought I got another Mutt at first but it&apos;s the giant Ant! in the crate. It&apos;s rigged to jump out at you when you open the crate, which actually scared the @#&amp;^ out of me the first time. Pretty cool. Munkeewrench 05-15-2008, 09:55 PM That is one of the ones that I really want...Not too excited by the first 2...I wonder what the release schedule will be? 2 toys every 5 days or so? Anybody know when the promotion ends? I want to be sure that I don&apos;t go back before they put the next 2 out...My cholesterol can&apos;t take it... ValenciaGrail 05-17-2008, 12:25 AM &quot;I want to be sure that I don&apos;t go back before they put the next 2 out...My cholesterol can&apos;t take it...&quot;

Then just buy the toys, and skip the food. That&apos;s what I do; they&apos;ll sell them seperately for about a buck and a half. Dr. Indy Jones 05-17-2008, 03:38 AM So I went to Burger King today and asked them what they plan on doing with all of their display pieces, and they said this -

&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but we have to return it to the company that we got it from&quot;

What the #$%&amp;is the company going to do with it? Throw it away? I mean come on it&apos;s cardboard for heaven sakes. Thats all I wanted, but I guess they can&apos;t do it. Which I think is a load of crap!! Has anyone else tried to get any of it yet? Anyone want to sell theirs? fixer79 05-17-2008, 04:01 AM So I went to Burger King today and asked them what they plan on doing with all of their display pieces, and they said this -

&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but we have to return it to the company that we got it from&quot;


Boy, have I heared THAT a lot...
I even doubt it&apos;s true... Maybe they want to keep it for themselves...
:mad: IndyKate 05-17-2008, 02:27 PM I just ordered a kids meal.


And they gave me an Iron Man toy!!

OH Cruel Fate!


That happened to me, but I looked in the bag before I drove away and made them switch it. Really pissed off the guy in the car behind me, but what do I care about that? I got my toy! :whip:

So, we&apos;ve seen Mutt, the Journal, and the Ant... what other toys has anyone been able to get? iLUVINDY 05-17-2008, 02:30 PM That happened to me, but I looked in the bag before I drove away and made them switch it.

So, we&apos;ve seen Mutt, the Journal, and the Ant... what other toys has anyone been able to get?

The first 2 toys where: Mutt and Journal
The second 2 toys are: The Ant and Tomb Reveal

There coming out 2 by 2, i guess 2 different toys each week. :up: Goonie 05-17-2008, 05:51 PM The first 2 toys where: Mutt and Journal

So far all I got was Mutt and the journal. I asked a girl at BK today how the toys are coming out and yes she said by twos. She said they are expecting 2 new toys on monday or tuesday. The local BK is a little behind. No Ticket 05-17-2008, 06:10 PM That happened to me, but I looked in the bag before I drove away and made them switch it.

Yeah, I drove home before I checked. Tonight or tomorrow I&apos;m going by again and see if I can&apos;t get it right this time. haha. Munkeewrench 05-17-2008, 07:37 PM I called BK before I left and they said they had the ant and the tomb reveal...When I got there and ordered 2 of each they told me that they had not opened the new box and it was too late to get my money back since I had already paid...They were going to give me 2 Mutts and 2 Grails...Finally the manager told them they could open the new box...

A close call... The Drifter 05-18-2008, 01:14 PM Now, I tend to stay clear of this spoiler forum.
So, I may not be up-to-date with them, and this may be old news. If it is, please accept my apologizes.

But, my son got a Burger King kids meal today.
I opened his toy for him (The Mutt Williams on a motorcycle) and I was scanning the small scrap of paper that came with it.

It showed the different Indy toys, and there was one with a crate with ants sticking their heads out, and one with a whip, and a snake and another ant to&quot;kill&quot;

So, I guess BK just spoiled me by letting me know that ants will be the new&quot;creepy crawly&quot;!

So, I guess BK just spoiled me by letting me know that ants will be the new&quot;creepy crawly&quot;!

Damn, you BK!

If it makes you feel any better, I have a hunch that there will be TWO creepy-crawly scenes in this movie. Most others probably know what I am referrning to, but if you don&apos;t yet know I won&apos;t spoil it.

Thank you.
I have been spoiled enough already lol Billy Ray 05-20-2008, 08:35 AM My daughter got the Tomb Reveal toy yesterday in her kid&apos;s meal...very cool if you ask me! I thought it was just going to light up or something for the&quot;reveal&quot;action, the draining&quot;sand&quot;feature is pretty neat! Indy fan 235 05-20-2008, 09:20 AM I&apos;m going to check again this Saturday for the next two toys. I&apos;m glad there are only 8, compared to the big batch that came out for Star Wars a few years ago. Munkeewrench 05-20-2008, 01:53 PM There are 8 for now, but I bet just like they did for the Star wars, when the DVD comes out we will get another wave...

We can always hope...:cool: ... SPECTER 05-21-2008, 07:18 AM i got to say that INDY Whopper(only bacon and cheese) is the best thing i have had thats fastfood in years, it was just great.you know what it almost looks like the pic of it to. I love when BK does this stuff tho, the peel offs and heavy themes-they allways draw me in with them,Star Wars,Spiderman,now this love it...
but I never buy there toys i feel i waste money on them.

I wish they did the McDs glass mug things those where great back in the day. tupogirl 05-21-2008, 12:45 PM I wish they did the McDs glass mug things those where great back in the day.


We got 3 of the 4 Shrek 3 glasses last year. I love them. And they&apos;re glass, but short and pretty sturdy. I let the kids use them;). My Blockbuster Indy glasses are up very high right now. Not that that would stop my climbers per se, but it gives the glasses a fighting chance... James 05-21-2008, 04:12 PM I tried a different BK today, but they still only had the Motorcycle and Journal. According to the manager, a store doesn&apos;t receive the next shipment/wave until they&apos;ve sold out of the previous one. Unfortunately, it was like pulling teeth just to get that information.

**Warning: Not really a rant, but a long, sad story about a grown man trying to purchase toys nonetheless.**

I initially ordered a Coke, and asked the cashier which Indiana Jones toys they had available. She just started looking around the counter, as if the answer would somehow be located there. She then replied,&quot;I don&apos;t know. I would have to check.&quot;She then proceeded to stare at me, as if her reply had completely resolved the issue and I should just pay for the Coke.

Now, going into a restaurant and asking for toys isn&apos;t exactly high on my list of things to do, but it&apos;s still a perfectly valid question. So I was beginning to feel like I was trapped in a Seinfeld episode and simply asked,&quot;Well...could you check?&quot;

Finally the manager came out, rifled through a box, and stared at the small package as if it were a chunk of kryptonite. After some inspection, she announced,&quot;We have...this...journal.&quot;I pushed my luck by asking,&quot;Do you have any others?&quot;The manager went into the back to check, and the cashier continued to stare at me like those villagers watching Willie try to mount the elephant. (Her mouth was literally hanging open.)

To try and speed things along, I went ahead and paid for the Coke. When she handed me the cup, I noticed there was a larger, plastic cup on the end (which I thought was the size I had purchased). So I casually asked what size it was, and if I could see what it looked like. She held it up...with the text side facing me.

It still hadn&apos;t quite dawned on this girl that I was only in Burger King to purchase Indiana Jones stuff. I politely asked if I could see what image was on it, and she turned it around to reveal Mutt. In the back of my mind, I heard Indy say,&quot;Ha ha ha...son of a *****.&quot;

The manager finally returned, and told me about how their shipments worked. I thanked her for looking and hastily beat a retreat, as the whole incident had taken nearly 10 minutes to resolve. My only satisfaction here is that I&apos;m sure it blew the cashier&apos;s mind when she saw me take the empty cup...and just walk out the door without putting anything into it. Goonie 05-21-2008, 04:22 PM ^It seems like I went through the same thing yesterday.;) SPECTER 05-21-2008, 04:52 PM you need to check before you leave BK i almost got screwed. Got a med Coke and large fries, they hand me my stuff i pull of look down they gave me a med orange in a non indy cup go in they change it i leave get home and my fries where not in the indy thing.this happens alot at BK and McDs. Hovito 05-21-2008, 05:52 PM I think all the toys look reely cool are burger king making them in england? for the shops here. ValenciaGrail 05-24-2008, 09:33 AM ....

The Seinfled take is perfect. The local BK&apos;s are actaully quite used to me by now, not buying any food, but the toys. I have no shame; I will make them fish through the box and pull out the toys. :)

Result: I collect them all instead of having to hit ebay.

This was how I got two of the impossible to find Darth Vader BK toys back in 2005 when ROTS came out FETT1 05-25-2008, 12:23 AM Does anyone think that Burger King will make Super Deformed figures for the Indiana Jones promo like they did with Star Wars? I think that it would be pretty cool!:)


OH THAT WOULD OF BEEN WAY TO COOL!...
I&apos;m passing on the regular stuff...
just not what I need!...
fett1:whip: Crack that whip 05-25-2008, 11:36 AM Has anyone here actually tried the Indy Whopper itself? I did a few days ago, and I do have to say it&apos;s pretty tasty, but at the same time it&apos;s just... too much for me. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s up lately with all these multi-patty burgers the various fast-food chains offer these days; I&apos;m sure there are people out there for them, but it seems to me a single quarter-pound patty plus bun and toppings is burger aplenty for the overwhelming majority of people, yet I see BK and the others now routinely offering these two- and even three-patty monstrosities (I&apos;m glad the Indy at least isn&apos;t one of those triple-deckers). It seems like an awful lot of meat to be offering in a&quot;mainstream&quot;menu item (especially when also layered with cheese, bacon, etc.).

But it is a tasty burger. Perhaps I&apos;ll have one today, after waiting long enough to be really hungry... Indy fan 235 05-25-2008, 12:00 PM I haven&apos;t had the burger, but maybe I will give it a try one day. I don&apos;t eat much fast food, so the trips to BK have been a treat for me. I need 3 more toys to go. Nurhachi1991 05-26-2008, 05:14 PM The toys this week are sweet!

What are the toys this week?

So far I have Mutt, the LED pen with journal, the Whip, and Boulder Escape.

When does the promotion end? Nurhachi1991 05-26-2008, 08:42 PM This week are the boulder chase Indy and the hip whip DrHapgood 05-27-2008, 05:18 AM Thanks to stopping at 2 different BK&apos;s along I-5 to and from San Jose (from Anaheim) this past weekend, I managed to snag 3 more toys putting my total at 6 (Mutt, Whip, Boulder, Ant, Journal, Tomb Reveal).

I&apos;m still missing the Mine Cart and Temple of Mystery.

Has anyone found those yet or will they be the last to be released? :confused: iLUVINDY 05-27-2008, 09:35 AM Thanks to stopping at 2 different BK&apos;s along I-5 to and from San Jose (from Anaheim) this past weekend, I managed to snag 3 more toys putting my total at 6 (Mutt, Whip, Boulder, Ant, Journal, Tomb Reveal).

there the last two for next week ChromiumBlue37 05-27-2008, 09:37 AM If anyone has more of the Tricky Treasure, (Ant with the crate), I would love some more! They are sold out in my area.

Please send me a PM, if you have any you do not want. Thanks! Agent Crab 05-28-2008, 12:08 AM The only BK toys I have is the LED Pen with the little book, Mutt and I recently got the Bug in a box.

My kitten loves to chase the Mutt toy, however. Mutt currently sits on my TV along with some other toys I have. Goonie 05-28-2008, 12:43 AM Which day do they normally put out the new toys? Monday or Tuesday? Somewhere I read or heard Tuesday, like DVDs. Just wanted to make sure. Agent Crab 05-28-2008, 02:37 PM Which day do they normally put out the new toys? Monday or Tuesday?

New toys here seem to come out either on the weekends or mondays where I live. Despite we have two BK locations around 12 miles apart from each other. ChromiumBlue37 05-28-2008, 03:06 PM Aside from the Tricky Treasure, (of which I would like at least 20 of), I am all caught up.

All that is left for me to get is the Temple of Doom mine car and the Akator Skull set. James 05-28-2008, 05:26 PM I don&apos;t think the Mine Cart and Temple Mystery have been released yet.

Today I got the Whip and Boulder, but didn&apos;t have any luck finding the Temple Reveal and Tricky Treasure. I try to go during off-peak hours, and have found it&apos;s best when you can ask someone older- preferably a manager. It seems like the younger employees just don&apos;t give a damn and act like it&apos;s a struggle to even answer any questions. You&apos;d think they&apos;d at least be willing to try, since I&apos;m only doing this for my nonexistent niece. :D Eric Solo 05-28-2008, 05:42 PM Those BK toys are actually pretty cool! I&apos;m 0 for 3 on the scratch off game... EvilDevo 05-28-2008, 05:46 PM Hey Chromium, are you building a warehouse full of crates? Or what? DrHapgood 05-29-2008, 01:15 AM I don&apos;t think the Mine Cart and Temple Mystery have been released yet.

Anyone know when these 2 will be released? :confused:

And Burger King really nailed me on this now. I&apos;m a vegetarian and through going to BK for the Indy toys I&apos;ve discovered that BK is the only major fast food chain with a mighty tasty Veggie Burger.

I used to love just the way they made their burgers topping-wise, and now that they make it the same way Veggie-Style means I&apos;m in love. :up: blueoakleyz 05-29-2008, 01:56 AM I got the whip, boulder chase and aztec temple/cs thing. All are awesome.

the whopper tasted nasty! ChromiumBlue37 05-29-2008, 07:51 AM Hey Chromium, are you building a warehouse full of crates? Or what?

Exactly! Problem is is that the crates only look good from 2 sides. Wondering if they are still available. When I ask at my local BK&apos;s the person at the front counter acts dumb. Agent Z 05-29-2008, 07:59 AM Wow, BK has a veggie burger, eh? Now I have an excuse to go there and get Indy toys! :up: Miss_Jones 05-29-2008, 09:10 AM Hi all, I search this thread and also Google for information on the BK promo but I haven&apos;t seen anything about glass mugs. In Portugal they don&apos;t have the Indy Burger, but they have the 8 toys and also are giving a collection of 4 glass mugs w/Indy theme (one for each movie). :D To get a mug you buy a menu and pay extra 1.25 euro. And you can choose the mug you want! I was going to collect the toys but once I saw these babies I settled for the mugs instead. Maybe this is a European exclusive?

I have two already and plan getting the other two this weekend. When I get home tonight I&apos;ll post a pic of the two I&apos;ve got.:) indyclone25 05-29-2008, 09:48 AM they usaully start their toy promos on monday and the get the new cases on sat shipments and try to finish up the last weeks toys over the weekend --- so on sunday or monday the stores should have the last two toys available --- which means that the promo for indy ends too and i hoping to snag the indy stand up s and possibly the outdoor indy hold the whip EvilDevo 05-29-2008, 11:18 AM Exactly! Problem is is that the crates only look good from 2 sides. Wondering if they are still available. When I ask at my local BK&apos;s the person at the front counter acts dumb.

Yeah, tell me about it... it&apos;s like pulling teeth getting those BK employees to even reach into the kids meal bags to get the toys. The older ones are pretty helpful when it comes to that, but the high school kids who work there look as though you&apos;ve just asked them to hop over the counter and dance with you.

&quot;.............................................you.................just want the...toys?&quot;

Part timers... I hate these guys.

&quot;Part time!&quot;heh

Anyway, good luck building your warehouse... when I go in next Monday to get the final 2 toys, I&apos;ll pick up any crates that might be left... if you want. ChromiumBlue37 05-29-2008, 11:40 AM That would be wonderful and I thank you, Sir!!!

I had one kid just stare at me with his mouth open. The he says,&quot;nah, we ain&apos;t got a way to just sell the toys....&quot;The rest of the staff was looking at me behind the scenes, laughing, so I gave up and left empty handed. Ignatius Stone 05-29-2008, 12:18 PM The toys are finally starting to appear in more BK branches in UK. Very late.:mad: Picked up the pen&amp;diary today.

Back when BK had the Revenge of the Sith promotion I was able to just go into the place and buy the toys outright without even buying any food.
It might be the same for Indy. Will try it. I guess it just depends on the manager, or maybe how much stock they have. kongisking 05-29-2008, 03:24 PM That would be wonderful and I thank you, Sir!!!

How is that racist? I am of Native American heritage and I have spoken English and some German since I was born in 1972. ValenciaGrail 05-30-2008, 09:42 AM How is that racist? I am of Native American heritage and I have spoken English and some German since I was born in 1972.

Let me clarify:

Being proud of your Amercian heritage and having the audacity to expect that people who live and work in the USA should speak English is rasict and elitist.

Residents of all other countries, however, are under no such restrictions. They are perfectly justifed in preserving their language and cultures.

I think this was a U.N. Resolution at some point...the sooner, you understand this, the sooner you will fit into the America-hating norms.

You folks who have been unable to buy just the toys - you should ask to speak to the manager or go to another BK.

I have never had a problem buying them at any of the many locations I patronized (Denver area) Flash Dixson 05-30-2008, 10:15 AM yeah I have had no troubel either, but when I ever I go there I always see people staring at me.

Yeah but the truth is in many establishments i have seen foreign workers do that, (not to say that they all do) one time I was in mcdonalds at about 8:oo, having dinner, and a guy walks in asking if he could have one of the bags. The women said,&quot;you want food?&quot;he said no i just want the bag, she said&quot;what food you want&quot;he said I do not want any food (the woman was asian by te way), she started to look all confused (as if) and said&quot;we no have that&quot;so the guy just gave up and walked awaya.

not racist. maybe a little ethnocentric, but i agree that folks in a customer service position (including front-line positions where people communicate with the public) should be able to converse in a little english, or know who to call when they need some help. but the world isn&apos;t flat, and america is becoming incredibly diverse. evolve or perish, amigo.

when ever i ask for them the people ar eusualy like uhh I don&apos;t want to look throught the toys right know. ValenciaGrail 05-30-2008, 04:14 PM when ever i ask for them the people ar eusualy like uhh I don&apos;t want to look throught the toys right know.

Tell them to do the job they&apos;re paid to do. The key is having no shame; and in my case, I&apos;m usually buying about three of each toy, so I&apos;m spending as much money as the average person buying food.

It&apos;s either that, or be bashful...and complete your collection by paying ebay markups + shipping. With only eight toys in the Raiders set, it&apos;s not that bad. But I never would have collected all the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings toys without being assertive and persistent. Especially not the impossible to find Darth Vader from the SW set.....

Fishing through a box full of toys is hardly asking them to run through a brick wall. The toys are just another product available from their business, nothing more.

In my experience, the manager on duty will usually speak English and can usually help you. They are also savvy about collectors that visit their stores during these promotions. If you talk to a manager, you will not likely be the first adult who has ever asked about movie tie-in toys. It also helps to ask during slow periods...avoid the lunch rush, for example.

Of course, if you&apos;re not a pack-rat, overgrown, geeky collector of junk like me...then life goes on if you don&apos;t collect the whole set. (But then why would you be reading this thread...) James 05-30-2008, 05:14 PM It also helps to ask during slow periods...avoid the lunch rush, for example.

Yeah, this is really key. I finally got the ant crate today, but unfortunately, they only had one. I hope I haven&apos;t completely missed the Temple Reveal because of lazy employees that didn&apos;t feel like searching last week.

The managers are usually extremely helpful. I had one guy search in the back and bring me everything they had- including leftover Iron Man toys. And today I had a lady go out of her way to search every box- which is extremely gracious for something that will ultimately only net a sale of $1. Flash Dixson 05-30-2008, 09:32 PM Yeah uusualy the managers an ass hole teenager when I ask for one (though I am a teenager to LOL) but I remeber once I got a lady who when I asked for some figures, she did that plus gave a bunch of the posters for free, and a few free cups and bags, and I didn&apos;t even ask.

Yeah those are good ones, I realy like the Temple on because it looks great on a shelf, or a desk or something. featofstrength 05-30-2008, 11:21 PM ive got em all now except the boulder chase...guess i better hit ebay iLUVINDY 05-31-2008, 10:43 AM ive got em all now except the boulder chase...guess i better hit ebay

I have an extra boulder chase, maybe we can trade, I need the Temple of Mystery and the Mine Cart indyclone25 05-31-2008, 11:06 AM the mine car and the temple of mystery then im done i guess the promo runs for one more week ending next sunday the 8th of june IndyKate 05-31-2008, 12:17 PM Normally I&apos;m a bit scared to go to the nearest BK - it&apos;s in a rather shady part of town - but today I ventured there and the WONDERFUL young ladies working the drive thru opened the new box of toys a day early so I could get the boulder chase AND the mine car!!! :up: ValenciaGrail 05-31-2008, 12:47 PM ive got em all now except the boulder chase...guess i better hit ebay

Not necessarily. Just because a new wave of toys has arrived does not mean that a given location might not still have leftovers from previous weeks. Make the rounds of BKs and ask about ALL the toys they still might have IndyKate 05-31-2008, 02:08 PM Exactly. Because apparently the people who put together my Kid&apos;s Meal had already popped a Diary in the bottom before I asked them for the other toys. So they still had those around.

Also, I know McDonald&apos;s sometimes gets an extra box of toys, the manager I spoke with years ago called it the&quot;Customer Satisfaction Box&quot;- and it had all of the toys in, so people who were collecting could find the ones they missed.

Good luck finding the Boulder Chase - it&apos;s really cool! Agent Crab 05-31-2008, 02:29 PM Despite I will have some repetes. I will keep those in their packages... I won a full set off of Ebay.

Though, Mutt and his amazing Motorcyle graces himself ontop of my TV.

I&apos;m gonna miss this promotion Agent Crab 05-31-2008, 03:14 PM I just need two more on Monday............. I&apos;m gonna miss this promotion

So will I... So will I. kongisking 05-31-2008, 03:15 PM Is Burger King planning to do any other movie tie-in promotions this Summer? Hulk? X-Files? WALL-E? Batman?

I&apos;ve been eating kids&apos; meals since the Iron Man promotion started. I need to change my diet soon to McDonald&apos;s or Wendy&apos;s. lol :D

We&apos;ve got Hulk coming, that&apos;s for sure. That&apos;s all I know. :hat:

Anyway, I went to my local BK a few days ago, and found out that they were out of whips!!!!!!!!!!!!! They had them LAST week, when I had a super-fat schedule and couldn&apos;t make it during that period! I was shocked, humiliated, and was near depression when the lady at the desk said:

&quot;you know, I can ask the manager if, when the promotion is done, he can set aside/save the toy whip that we&apos;ve got in the display case, since it&apos;s the last one we have, and you can then come back another day and buy it then.&quot;

I almost cried with gratitude. I will never whine about BK ever again!

And that&apos;s my BK Indy story! (Now I need a Grand Casino one...:rolleyes: ;) ) vBulletin v3.5.0, Copyright©2000-2012, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.
