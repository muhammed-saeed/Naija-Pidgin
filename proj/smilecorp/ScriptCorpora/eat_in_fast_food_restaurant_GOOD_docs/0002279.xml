Food Trucks Scout Broward After Miami-Dade Ruling; Check Cauley and Kendall Roundups

 Yellow Submarine will be at Cauley Square tonight. 
​ For months, people in Broward and Palm Beach counties have been complaining that they have to drive to Miami-Dade for their food truck fix. While many owners actually make their base in Broward and Palm Beach ( Slow Food Truck and Nacho Bizness are both headquartered in Broward and Rolling Stove owner Troy Thomas until recently drove his truck to Miami from Palm Beach county daily), roundups up north were few and far between.
But after passage of the recent Miami-Dade food truck ordinance, which requires roundup organizers to pull permits, provide site plans and get written permission from local residents, Broward and Palm Beach locations might seem more promising.

Tonight, for example, almost two dozen food trucks will hold a roundup at Ed Morse Sawgrass Auto Mall in Sunrise. Miami staples like gastroPod , Latin Burger and Sakaya Kitchen will head north to serve dinner.

Is this a new trend or just a way to expand horizons and investigate a plan B? We&apos;ll just have to wait and see. In the meantime, there are two food truck roundups in Miami this evening, so don&apos;t despair.
 
 Cauley Square Food Truck Party is holding a contest to see who can bring the most friends for dinner. Whoever brings the most people (eight person minimum) wins dinner and dessert for the group. Cauley Square also has a beer and wine garden, live music and lush gardens to explore. Food trucks serving from 5:30 to 10 p.m. include Catered Bliss, Caza Crepes , Che Grill, Clarabelle&apos;s Cupcakes , El Rincon del Coqui , Shao Roma Romanian Fresh Food, Wing Commander , Wrapidito Yum, and Yellow Submarine . 22400 Old Dixie Highway, Miami 

 Kendall Car Wash is holding court from 6 to 10 p.m. Trucks include  Dim Ssam a Gogo, The Fish Box , Latin Burger 2 , Ms. Cheezious , The Red Koi , Sugar Rush , Sugar Yummy Mama . 9750 North Kendall Drive, Miami 

If you are planning on going north, Ed Morse Sawgrass Auto Mall is hosting 22 food trucks this evening from 5 to 10 p.m. Trucks heading north include Aaron&apos;s Catering Express, Big Kahuna, Blue Tree Café, CheeseMe, Chef on 4 Wheels , Chef on Wheels, Churro Mania , Coldstone Creamery, Divan Bakery, Esther&apos;s Caribbean Grill, The Flying Saucer , gastroPod , Gyromaniakz , Grill Master Cafe , Kitchen Kabab, Latin Burger , The MexZican Gourmet , Moty&apos;s Grill, PopBurger Love&amp;Chocolate Love, The Red Truck, Sakaya Kitchen, Snow Caps, and Tango Grill

i belive thatthey should go outside dade county just to prove a point, the goverment wants a piece of everything and anything, I like how the asked whos gonna PAY for the additional police inforcement, to my understanding if theres a large group of people gathered its already expected that the police should govern it, there job is to protect and serve the people, not exploit for protection
 
After you own Broward streets pass by Naples I bet you will as much crowds!!!
 
They should expand to Broward/Palm Beach anyway..Miami isn&apos;t the end all be all. End all maybe,  but.
 
What ever it takes to grow the business.
