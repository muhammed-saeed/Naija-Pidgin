This was a disappointment, staff had no clue, I was given the wrong order twice. The dips are bland and the salad taste so fresh they were not washed! Never again, sorry.

 Food   3     Ambience   3     Service   1     Value   2    


Wow this is disappointing. I went here quite often when it had just opened and they assured me that their falafel was gluten free. As I&apos;m vegetarian that&apos;s my only choice and I was happily eating it since it was delicious. When I went last time I did my routine check on the falafel saying that I needed something vegetarian and gluten free. The girl then says that the falafel Does contain gluten!

Also, she recommends their beef wrap. What? I wonder how long they&apos;ve used bread crumbs without telling their customers. And for your knowledge, beef isn&apos;t vegetarian.

I love this place. Lots of fresh ingredients, although I am not sure the portions are conducive to losing weight, despite half of them being vegetarian. Good value, and a heatlhy, vibrant alternative to a kebab.

A lebanese fast food restaurant? Though a little sloppy to eat because they really stuff the pita bread, I was happily surprised with the lamb plate dish I got and the lemonade was the right consistency. The chips were the only plain thing I ate there. Worth a look and a cheaper option than other places in Newtown.

Dined here using a jumponit voucher and we were both pleasantly surprised. Genuine middle eastern food with a modern twist. When the plates arrived we thought there wasn&apos;t that much food but with the pita pockets, it was a feast. Shish chicken plate for me was the standout. Highly recommended!

Sabbaba is my new favourite place for uni lunch. Middle Eastern food is becoming a huge trend and it&apos;s no wonder, it is delicious. Good quality middle eastern food is hard to find, and usually expensive. Sabbaba has cleverly taken the best of middle eastern food and put a fun twist on it, and it&apos;s affordable. All the salads and felafels are so fresh and tasty, and while $9 might seem a bit pricey for a pita pocket, it is jam packed with quality salad, dips and beautiful meat/felafel and so yum! I usually get the Sabbaba pita pocket with no salsa...mmmm. Love the decor as well!

Fantastic cafe/takeaway-style place for Lebanese and Middle Eastern food. I was surprised at the size and quality of the servings as well as the excellent value. The ambience is what you would expect from a cafe-ish place and comparable to Moo Burger down the road. Definitely a welcome change from the pizza/burger/kebab shops of the area.

The Middle East is so where it’s at right now. Luke Bayliss (Sumo Salad) shows he has his finger on the pulse with his newest entry to the King Street foodie parade. He scratches the authentic itch (as well as the easily franchisable one) by partnering with Nic Kat, who’s been serving Bondi residents Middle Eastern food for the last eleven years. It’s all good – that’s what the name means, and that’s what you’re likely to think if you head on down for a Pita ($9.90), Bowl ($14.50) or Plate ($16.90). Augment the crisp salads, dips and fluffy pita with a selection from their list of meats, poultry, cheese, fish and vegetarian delights.

Moist lamb kofta, riddled with pine nuts and herbs, scrub up particularly well. Make a meal of it with a Value Pack ($4.90) of two selections from a list that includes Sabbaba Lemonade (plain or ‘pink’ with added rose water) or desserts like Cashew and Pistachio Baklava. There’s also Felafel Balls ($7.50/12) but suggesting anyone does the best felafel in town is fighting words, so I’ll just say my heart still lies in Surry Hills at Al Aseel. To help you get down with the multi-cult, graffiti artist Jeremy Hession has tagged the walls.
