 Floods in Barranquilla 
 It has been raining in Cartagena and Barranquilla, Colombia for awhile and the has cause serious flooding resulting in the loss of life and property. Some of the CI sponsors were trying to find out about our sponsored children and Debbie provided this update for anyone who has a child in the area:

&quot;As many of you have read or seen, this winter Colombia has experienced a harsher than normal rainy season. Because public sewer/drainage systems are not adequate the communities tend to flood each time it rains - winter or summer. Typically the flood waters recede in a day or so, and may rise again the next day, but always recede. When we started to receive word of the floods last month it was thought they would end soon as they usually do and there would be no permanent damage. Unfortunately this winter the rain just keeps coming, and permanent damage, loss of property, etc. could become the reality. To date, Children International has responded to the heavy rain season in Colombia by providing food baskets to 1,051 families in Cartagena. These families consist of parents/siblings/guardians that make their living selling items in the streets, and because of the flooding are unable to work. Supplies and sandbags have been provided for families in Barranquilla to keep the flood waters from entering their homes. Both of our agencies in Barranquilla and Cartagena have continued to operate, despite the flooding, and have continuously kept us informed about how the sponsored child population have fared. All the sponsored families are safe and very resilient. They are used to the rains and flooding, just as many people are used to the snow and sleet in other parts of the world during the winter months. Of course, we will share any specific information about affected families losing property, etc. with their sponsors individually.&quot; Posted by Shana at 4:07 PM No comments: Links to this post
