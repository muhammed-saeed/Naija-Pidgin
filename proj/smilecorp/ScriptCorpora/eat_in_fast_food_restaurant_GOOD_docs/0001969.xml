There is also a great deal on Aveeno Hair Care with the $2 in-ad coupon, $2 Video Values coupon and $1.50 IP, plus it will qualify you for the $10 MIR! Here’s the scenario…

Buy
4 Aveeno Nourish shampoo or conditioner (priced $7.49 @ my store)
Use
(4) $2/1 Aveeno Skin or Bath care in-ad coupon
(4) $2/1 Aveeno Nourish Hair care Video Values (available to earn thru 6/26)
(4) $1.50/1 Aveeno Nourish Hair care (coupons.com)
(1) $5/$25 purchase Video Values
Total OOP: $2.96
-$10 MIR makes it a $7 moneymaker!
 munckin74 
Just FYI, if you do the John Frienda deal above you can use the $5/$20 video rewards coupon to make the oop price $2 rather than $7. If they will let you use the John Frieda video coupon from May (exp 6/30) as well, then your total oop would be $1 with $10 +UP rewards. That would be a $9 profit, right? I hope I&apos;m not getting my hopes up for nothing!! :o)
 
 ScottK 
basically…I just posted my way of doing it above. It&apos;s a rebate tho, not a +up.
 
 bee gee 
Its posted above as 10 +up wyb.
 
 susansaver 
I believe the $1 off $10 coupon states that it cannot be combined with any others so you might not be able to do the $5 off $20 and the additional $1 off $10. Still not a bad deal and you can always try to push through both Q&apos;s!
 
 grace 
I used both, my $5 off 20 and my $1 off 10 for skin care
 
 
 ScottK 
The john frida deal is amazing! I&apos;m going to combine it with Veet item

Total $27.01

- $5 / $25 coupon
- $3 in ad coupon for veet
- $3 veet printable
- 4 times $3 root awaken coupons ($12)
-$1 for $10 or more hair purchase

Total: $3.01
Rebate: $10

$6.99 profit to buy FOUR of what is regularly priced $6.99!! And my mom LOVES the root awakening shampoo!
 Mutiaja 
for huggies diaper it&apos;s have printable store coupon also 1.00 off when you buy diaper and wipes
 VanessaCook 
Just an FYI- (for the John Frieda deal) My store will not let you use two dollar off purchase amount coupons. Such as the $1 off $10 in certain products and the $5 off $20 total purchase. So this may be one of those YMMV deals. Still super deal!
 
 AmyFMSC 
I was able to use both of them tonight without a problem. But, like you said, YMMV. The Rite Aid that is closer to me probably wouldn&apos;t have let it fly, but the Rite Aid I have to drive farther to get to is AWESOME! Everyone is so nice! Fortunately, I have options.

Looks good to me! I think I may have to do this, because whitestrips for free basically?! Crazy!
 guest 
Looks good to me!
 Brandi 
Looks good to me! But you would get $12 up+ rewards instead of $10 making it an even better deal :)
 
 Littlepanchuk 
Actually, I think the 12 up+ rewards are for the larger box. This deal is the one listed just before that one.
 
 AmyFMSC 
I did this exact deal tonight&amp;it worked great! Thanks!
 
 Littlepanchuk 
Anyone have a zip code that works for the Red Plum -$5/25? Thanks
 
 Sue 
I could not find it either using the link. So I opened a new browser window and went to redplum . com. I then typed“Rite aid”into the search box at the top and it found it.
 
 guest 
Rite Aid generally releases a long and short ad. I unfortunately, live in an area that always gets the short ad. Does anyone know if the wrap (contains the white strips, diapers, etc) will be on the short ad?
 
 Anonymous 
You can view the long and short ads at iheartriteaid.com. I get the short ad too and always have to double check that the deal I want is actually available at my Rite Aid. HTH!
 Guest 
It was not in my ad :(
 
 Molliehayes 
I can&apos;t find the $3 off Veet Hair Removal coupon. Did anyone else find it? The page that comes up is for Lysol.

i can&apos;t find it either
 
 Jenni 
Concerning a common question on if we can print and use multiple copies of the same AdPerks coupons for $5/$20 or $5/$25 for watching specific videos: If you read the new fine print, it is made very clear that though you can print more than one due to their set-up, you are only legally allowed to use ONE, period. Using additional ones is therefore fraud. Additionally, honest logic would say that if you can only EARN it once, you can only USE it once. Here is the exact fine print from my just-printed June $5/$20 coupon:

“Coupon good through 7/24/2010 and can only be used once. This coupon can only be used towards once purchase which includes at least $20 of eligible product. No cash can be given. This coupon not valid on purchases of prescriptions, prescription co-pays, Medicare and Medicaid prescriptions, lottery tickets, tobacco and alcohol products, money orders, gift cards, prepaid card, stamps, licenses, other mailing services, online purchases or any other items excluded by law. May not be combined with any like offers. Limit one coupon per customer. v4″

I always hoped it was okay to use more than one, but in my gut knew that they would eventually make it clear whether or not we could. And now they have. They make so many of these available currently via AdPerks and Red Plum that there shouldn&apos;t be any reason for a person to commit fraud to save $5.
 
 Littlepanchuk 
Thanks for your comment. I have thought the same as you. I&apos;m glad when people go out of their way to do the right thing…I don&apos;t want RA to decide to stop offering coupons because of fraud.
 alibcat 
I was at Rite Aid tonight with 2 coupons from watching the videos and the clerk would not take them because they would not scan. One of them was a little faded due to low ink, but the other one looked good. I&apos;m not sure if I want to bother with them if they are not going to take them.
 
 Elizabeth 
I have had the problem before with print quality with the VV coupons also. The cashier just keyed them in manually with no problem.
 
 Bridget 
I have noticed that in the last few months, the video values coupons print with your name on them, which they did not in the past. I am guessing that it is one more way to make sure no one is making 50 copies of the same coupon. That said, they really should correct the way they print them so they are limited like the bricks coupons, then there would be no issue.
 
 Daniel 
I&apos;m a pharmacy student working at Rite Aid as an intern so I see some of the deals before they are deals. One I noticed coming tomorrow that I didnt see mentioned was ReNu Sensitive Contact Solution. Retail 8.49–7.99 SCR–2.00 printable (- my 20% discount hehe) = a good deal (but I dont wear contacts).

Also, where can I find the $3 off John Frieda coupons everyone is talking about? My wife would like the shampoo deal!
Thanks!!!
 
 grace 
they were in June 6th paper. Are you allowed to do the deals too?
 
 Daniel 
I&apos;m not aware of any rule against it, but I just started the couponing deal last week.

I&apos;ve looked through my sister&apos;s coupon inserts and I&apos;m sure she had several of that date, but no luck.
 
 cashier 
We&apos;re allowed to do the deals. Video values and all. Do not abuse the Video values though, they will fire you if you print off multiples of the coupons like so many people do. The program is meant to be one per customer, but for now there&apos;s nothing RA can do to prevent it, but they have fired employees who when they say that we allow customers to do it, they&apos;re told“but you know better.”Just a heads up Daniel, but beyond that we still get all of the deals. From rebates, to +Ups to our immediate 20% discount.
 
 
 Cassia 
The ReNu rebate is only valid next week (from July 4th through the 10th)–just FYI. :)
 
 SR 
There is also a $2 SCR on the Luvs deal–so it&apos;s $5.99
 Couponzgalore 
Anyone have the zip code for the $5 off 25 coupon?? Its not on any I have tried so far.
 
 Sue 
could not find it either using the link. So I opened a new browser window and went to redplum . com. I then typed“Rite aid”into the search box at the top and it found it.
 
 Littlepanchuk 
Thanks! I found it this way.

Are the Cover Girl and Venus rebates ones that will start 7/1? I can&apos;t find them in my little rebate book and assumed that must be the explanation?
 
 ScottK 
The June rebate period ends today, the 26th. July starts June 27th so it&apos;s in the newer book.
 
 Sue 
I could not find it either using the link. So I opened a new browser window and went to redplum . com. I then typed“Rite aid”into the search box at the top and it found it.
 lenore 
I had a rain check for $3.00 off luberderm lotion and I had a 1.00 manufactures coupon and riteaid wouldn&apos;t honer the 1.00 coupon because it was one penny over and they can&apos;t change anything on the register. How did other people get this item for free the week of 6-12?
 
 ScottK 
the policy is supposed to be that they either modify the price of the item up, or they punch in your coupon for 99 cents instead of $1. This varies by store tho, as rite aid employees are not supposed to allow coupon overages, they also don&apos;t have the time or genius math brains to total all your items and match up the coupons…
 
 Aminehdestin 
My store always tries to double check for overages and modify down accordingly. Nine times out of ten though, the customer fumes that other stores don&apos;t cut their coupon value, because they&apos;re buying stuff to cover the overage. I&apos;ve said over and over, that I love coupons. I love to get a good deal, and I enjoy seeing what everyone is able to do to save money, but I&apos;m even getting to the point that I resent coupons. I&apos;m reading comment after comment and one is just so thrilled to get their purchase with no hassle, even though that“great deal”could come at the expense of the cashier who in not wanting to ruffle feathers, doesn&apos;t modify coupons down, and then the next is someone angry because the cashier wouldn&apos;t allow that same transaction to go through. Like with the Finish 50% off this last week. You can&apos;t get $7 off of $5.49. You just can&apos;t. I got yelled at by someone because I was modifying the VV coupon down to $2.49 from $4 because she was losing $1.50 by me doing that. She mentioned policy, and I reached under the register and pulled it out to show her. She stomped out refusing to ever come to our store again, because we steal from her. It doesn&apos;t take“genius math brains”it takes an extra minute, and some serious patience when the customer starts asking“why”when you stack the coupons and start writing a different price on to some. Our reg. customers will mainly all tell you that I&apos;m very coupon friendly. But there are ways to annoy even the coupon friendly stores.
 
 Littlepanchuk 
I&apos;m very sorry that coupons cause extra stress for you. Can you help me understand how“overage”works? I have always been under the impression that the manufacturer reimburses the store for the face value of the coupon, whether or not the store actually sold the item for a price below that. Is this not the case? The reason I get frustrated when someone lowers my coupon value is because I thought they were just trying to make more money (and cause me to save less money) on my coupons that I have gone to the trouble to obtain. But maybe I have been wrong in this.

I&apos;m with you on this one. I would like to know the store&apos;s perspective on this. I can see if an item is 99 cents and your q is for $1, adjusting down a penny. That&apos;s not that big of a deal to me. BUT if I have a $5 q on an item that only costs $3 and they adjust it down to $3, then turn it in and get the $5 + 8 cents handling fee, essentially making a profit of $2.08 off my q, then I would be upset.
 Elizabeth 
I am with you also. For manufacturer Q&apos;s, the store is getting reimbursed so if RA is adjusting down the value they are committing coupon fraud in my opinion as they are being reimbursed the full amount and not the customer. And with the VV Q&apos;s, I would be willing to bet that RA is also getting reimbursed because they got the customer to watch the manufacturer&apos;s commercial, so to speak. And what difference does it make if a customer comes in with just the VV Q or with both Q&apos;s and is given the full value? RA still gets reimbursed! I think a few employees are under the impression that they are losing money on coupons and don&apos;t understand the concepts of coupons and Marketing. The manufacturer benefits because the consumer is trying their product and may become a repeat buyer, the store wins because they are getting the consumer into their store instead of the competition, and the customer wins on the great values.

I recently switched prescriptions to RA because I am in there more frequently now, and had a coupon for only one of those prescriptions. Do you think RA lost money on my $50 teeny tiny tube of topical antibiotic??? And that was just my co-pay amount, not counting what my insurance company paid them also….

Just wanted to point out–I don’t know how it works, and I do assume that Rite Aid is reimbursed the full amount, BUT–it is clearly on their policy that they will not allow coupons to go over the full price of the item, that they will adjust down coupons for this. The best way to get“overage”is to do so through Up+ rewards and/or SCR because those aren’t affected by the“coupon doesn’t go over purchase price”policy. (policy is hosted at here )For me, I am a little irked by the idea that they would basically be making money off of those cases, but because it IS in there policy I figure I just need to deal with it. That’s something that I have to accept by shopping at their store, at least for the moment. I guess it’s fair given how many $5/$25 I’m able to use (because they seem to issue so many on Red Plum and their Video Values site), and I’m pretty sure they don’t get any reimbursement for those.

Sorry–posted twice. Oh well. :)

Personally, it is annoying to have coupons adjusted down as most other stores allow the full amount as long as the entire transaction doesn&apos;t go into“overage.”But since it is in their policy, I figure that&apos;s something I have to agree to if I choose to shop there. I guess it&apos;s more than made up by all the $5/$25 coupons they keep putting out (Redplum and their Video Values site), which I&apos;m pretty sure they aren&apos;t reimbursed for.
 Elizabeth 
I abide by their policy but it still doesn&apos;t mean their policy is ethical in my opinon because they are receiving reimbursement for the full value of the coupons and the customer is not. If they want to adjust the Q down, I have no problem, but they need to make certain that they are not receiving full reimbursement either. It just isn&apos;t ethical.

They put out the $5/$25 coupons to get customers into their stores. It is a marketing tool and if they were losing money on them they wouldn&apos;t keep putting them out. Not every time do I go into RA do I have a $5/$25 or similar Q because I use them only once, as is stated on the bottom of the Q, such as the ones we print from VV. They are not losing money on coupons.
 cassia2 
I know–I&apos;m not saying we&apos;re taking them down by using their coupons. :) And I don&apos;t print the VV multiple times, either. But the Redplum ones do allow two prints per computer. But again, the marketing tool is still something they are not technically paid back for. That&apos;s just the way I think about it. But truthfully if it really bugs you still (which I do understand), then maybe it would be best just to avoid buying those things that you&apos;d only buy if they gave you overage. :)

Alright, I&apos;m going to try to respond to each of you in one reply so I don&apos;t congest the website with my name. ;-P The manufacturer does reimburse for product sold. The way I understand it though, is that they reimburse based on the sales price. I&apos;m not positive on that, because I do work at store level, but based on everything I read from the store and corporate it is the selling price. I know we have a print out every week listing coupons used, so it may be that as they&apos;re processed, it goes through a database of the transactions they were used on. We&apos;re supposed to modify RA coupons if they&apos;re being stacked, because to a store, that isn&apos;t actually accounted for as currency like Man. coupons are. It&apos;s more like just being an extra sale/advertisement, meaning we don&apos;t get paid back for those.
When it comes to modifying a coupon down, I understand the thought that people think, well if you&apos;re getting paid the face value back, aren&apos;t you (the store) then in essence, stealing? That&apos;s why we are actually supposed to mark the front of the coupon and write in the value of the coupon. Then, we only get paid back for the amount that it was taken for. So really there, the manufacturer is the only one“making”any extra money, because they don&apos;t have to pay out that full amount. Really then though, they&apos;re paying for the coupons to run, they&apos;re paying for the sale, and for the Videos and Ad Perks etc..
I really do understand the questioning, because a lot of people do treat their coupons like currency. A lot of people HAVE to treat their coupons like currency. But, from what I understand from everything they&apos;ve sent to all employees about coupons, what a lot of retailers seem to accept, actually does constitute fraud. I came home and looked up coupon fraud one night, so that I had a tighter grasp on the issue. The reason overage is considered fraud, is this: (I&apos;m going with the Finish scenario again, because it&apos;s good for this explanation)
You buy the Finish Quantimatic [or whatever it&apos;s called] at $5.49
You use a man. coupon for $3 and a VV coupon for $4 giving you $1.51 overage.
You are 100% responsible for your tax, or else everyone can get in trouble because the governor wants to be paid. So you buy $2 worth of merchandise that you don&apos;t have coupons for. In the end, you only pay $0.49 and tax for your purchase if no coupons are modified down. The reason this is an issue is because then when the coupons are processed, Finish is not only being“billed”for it&apos;s item, but for the $1.51 in other merchandise. That is considered coupon fraud, and if we as retailers know it, it&apos;s considered coupon fraud on our part as well. Finish shouldn&apos;t have to pay for a Hershey&apos;s product or whatever else was used for the overage. Without the modification, they can refuse to pay the coupon all together. I&apos;m not sure that it ever happens, because like I said, I&apos;m at store level, but by policy and by law, it could happen. Beyond that there&apos;s also the fine that can be implemented that&apos;s always hanging over our heads, or jail time/fine hanging over the consumer&apos;s head. Does that make sense?
 Coupons090 
i agree with you for the most part about the fraud but .jenny has posted (the life of a coupon somewhere here) . for the most part after it leaves the store its an animated process , not sure it can look for writing on each of them. wal-mart did the ajusting to me the other day. i had four coupons each w/ 0.03 overage . the time it took the cashier to ajust them down and all the ticked off customers behind me , cost them . not me.
 Aminehdestin 
I actually looked up“the life of a coupon”to read what you were talking about. I just found this site, so I hadn’t seen it before. I also googled the same process. The only thing that I’m not sure about is before it actually gets to that process. RA is like a lot of companies, who don’t send the coupons in directly, it goes elsewhere first and they are sorted. Paperwork gets sent in as well, so I’m assuming that there’s a reason for that. Obviously not working there I’m not sure what they do but because I don’t like to think of anyone intentionally conning anyone this is my thought:
Technically, we are not supposed to modify down a man. coupon because of the possibility of getting back the face value. On the other hand, we could be fined for taking the coupon @ face value. So RA has set it up so that we don’t lose that sale, we adjust down. It’s possible that in that middle step, after it leaves our store, but before it gets sent in for processing, they black out the bar codes of adjusted coupons so that they don’t scan and have to be done manually. That way the company is covering themselves 100%. No fraud at any stage. Now, obviously I can’t promise this, but it is a possibility. Plus, if it takes so long to process coupons, I know that we do it slightly differently because stores get reports I *think* weekly, but it could be monthly, informing them how much credit they got on coupons, and how much money was lost in bad coupons. I know that because we HAD to discuss it at store level when we had a week of severe loss.
 
 
 
 
 My3boys1girl 
I had a $5 off $25 purchase coupon that I printed from Rite-aids website and the cashier would not let me use it ,she said it is for 1 item that is&gt;=$25. I have been mislead by these coupons, is this true ?
 
 guest 
No. She should have taken it.
 Courtney 
She was wrong not to take your coupon. I would have asked for a manager. The coupons state a $25 or more PURCHASE not one item. Try again…and good luck. :-)
 
 Jennifer 
I went to littleswimmers.com and was able to print out a $1.50 off coupon! If you’re already signed up for Huggies’Enjoy the Rewards program, you can log in with that information in order to print the coupon. Also, my Rite Aid lets me purchase all of the UP products in one transaction and all of the rewards print at the bottom; it’s the store on the corner of Old Milton and Hwy. 9 in Alpharetta, GA.

I am so sick of the up rewards. They say they can only be used for a $10 purchase or more on a household item, or a seasonal item, etc. Sometimes they will ring them all up and let me use multiple ones, but the manager tonight would only let me use the ones for household items, not seasonal or anything else. Therefore, they don&apos;t work like CVS extracare bucks, which I can use together and on anything. It is so frustrating. I had a bunch to expire today because they wouldn&apos;t let me use them!
 
 Guest 
Are you sure that you are not confusing +Up rewards and +Up coupons. Coupons print randomly on the bottom of receipts and are only good for specific types of items. Rewards are earned by buying specific products, are also printed on the bottom of your receipt, and can be used on anything. Also only 1 coupon is supposed to be used per transaction (as stated on the coupon), while multiple rewards can be used.
 
 Jlbail1 
They say“+up rewards”at the top of the paper, but maybe I am confusing them. I&apos;ll have to go back and check again to see what the deal is.
 
 guest 
For some reason these $1 off coupons say Up Rewards too. Hopefully, this is something they will change.
 
 cashier 
They technically are +Up rewards as well. You get them for making purchases with your wellness card. They&apos;re $ off of total purchases though, while the others are simply $ off. The same two print out on [almost] every receipt (sometimes none will print) during that time period, which is 2 weeks or a month, something like that. They are different, but they&apos;re still“rewards”given for using your card. Those are one per customer because they&apos;re just like the $5 off coupons, $X off of $X, they don&apos;t add up. Just like even if you spend $60, you have to split your transactions to use more than one of the $5 off coupons. Your store should know this and be able to explain it to you.
 
 
 
 
 mamac 
How do you get the venus razor rebate?
 
 guest 
This is a Rite Aid rebate. Go to Rite Aid&apos;s website, look for“Single Check Rebate”and they will explain the program to you. If you haven&apos;t already you probably want to check out the Get Starting Guides for the stores.
 
 http://angiesfreebies.com/ Angies Freebies 
I was just reading on some deal scenario&apos;s on another site and they are saying the wellness amount off is used like a coupon. For instance, the john freida deal would be $10 off not back. I have not done any of these types of deals yet.

So are the wellness up rewards just like ecb&apos;s?
 
 Daniel 
Yes. Wellness +UP rewards print at the bottom of the receipt and can be used toward your next purchase of ANY merchandise (excluding Rxs, tobacco, alcohol, gift cards, etc.) IF you make a purchase of a qualified item (items that qualify will be shelf tagged as such). This is not to be confused with the +UP reward coupons that print at the bottom of every receipt and specify what they can be used for (ex. $1 off a $10 oral care purchase). Hope this helps!
 
 http://angiesfreebies.com/ Angies Freebies 
Thanks Daniel! :)

My ad this week has like none of these up rewards in it that are above does anyone know if these are at all stores or just select ones
 
 Guest 
They are not in my ad either and I live in a fairly big, capital city. I would be interested to know where you have to live to get these deals!
 TraceyGA 
As much as I love SS, I don&apos;t plan my Rite-aid trip based on what Jenny posts because I don&apos;t get the same ad. I get the much smaller ad. It&apos;s soooooo annoying. The Atlanta paper usually has the full ad. I&apos;m in GA too but somehow, we still only get the small ad. I would also like to know how they decide which cities get which ad. It certainly isn&apos;t by region if two cities in the same state get different ads.
 
 Lee 
I&apos;m in N. GA and AJC won&apos;t sell up here anymore so, I have to drive to Cumming to get the paper every week
 
 Amy 
I went to my Rite aid and there were no up rewards on the stuff I wanted. Must be regional or something???? No up reward on the duracell, luvs, venus, BUMMER!!
 
 Kelley 
Just FYI, the last time I went to Rite Aid the cashier would only let me use ONE printable STORE coupon. The policy was in writing on the front desk, so I don&apos;t think this was just her opinion.
 
 Mcheronecook 
It should be just ONE $ off a certain amount. For instance, if you tried to use a $5/$25 purchase, you can still use your Rite Aid Ad Perk coupons for the products you are buying and a manufacture coupon for that item.
 
 AWS 
Cant&apos;find Banana Boat on AdPerk Videos…there is Coppertone. Does Coppertone own Banana Boat too?

The banana boat was in the June round that ended last night. Today is July.

 Debbie Parnell 
I pass two Rite Aids coming home from work on Woodruff Rd, does anyone know which one is more coupon friendly, if either?
 
 Heather7704 
I went to the one on Woodruff Road across from Walmart today and had tons of coupons. No problems. My first time doing the Rite Aid deals, too.
 http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=649435583 Kelley Collins 
The Rite Aid at Five Forks is coupon friendly BUT they also check very carefully. If everything in your transaction is right (correct product, no overages, etc) they have no issue but if anything is off they will not take it. I still go there because it is convenient for me but I always make sure my transaction is spot on before I get to the checkout.

I cannot find the Veet Product on the Rite Aid Video Values. Is anyone else having this problem?
 
 guest 
The video value for Veet ended yesterday.
 
 Becka 
I think the Crese Whitestrips deals must only be in certain areas. I checked my ad and they were not listed. I also checked with the store manager and he didn&apos;t know anything about there being sale prices or UP rewards for those products. Bummer! I was really hoping for these. I&apos;m in Columbia, SC and thought a capital city would have the larger ad with all the deals, but that never seems to be the case :(
 
 NewSaver 
Me too! I live in Savannah. It stinks! I really wanted to purchase additional products.
 
 Hol 
My riteaid said there are not $5 up rewards for the pampers cruisers big pack
 
 AmyFMSC 
I just bought some&amp;the $5 +Up rewards printed. I also used the $2 coupon from the paper and the $3 coupon from the P&amp;G book that Rite Aid mailed out with my qualifying purchases from last month. Great deal along with the $5 off $20 coupon.
 
 acpack 
love this scenario! thanks for posting.
 
 k8winn5 
Your Rite Aid may not be running that reward on the huggies in your region. Their ads are different depending on what region of the US you live in.
 
 Amy 
There was a $2 off Duracell batterties on the larger packs at my rite aid today.
 jhh 
Is the Duracell Battery $10 with $2 up reward regional? In my rite aid ad I couldnt find it.
 
 guest 
Yep, and it&apos;s ridiculous. I sent Rite Aid an email. It&apos;s unfortunate that they offer different sales in different areas. They missed out on about $50 of my money today because they didn&apos;t have a lot of things on sale, and I am not paying full price.
 
 Jenni 
I will be calling regarding the issues I’ve encountered thanks to the smaller ads. I’m interesting to see what they say/do.
 
 
 Maryglennjernigan 
In Statesboro, GA (near Savannah) the Pampers and the Venus razors didn&apos;t work for me.
 k8winn5 
The eastern region sales ad didn&apos;t include a lot of the good deals. I&apos;m so bummed!! All of the crest deals and certain coupons were not included in the eastern region ad. BOO to Rite Aid!!
 Andrea 
Can anyone tell me where to find the five dollar off 25 coupon. I have printed them before but needed a specific zip code. I think it was either red plum or smart source. Thank you.
 
 Jori 
On Red Plum if you search Rite Aid the coupon should come up. It did not come up under my zip but when I searched I was able to print :-)
 
 Andrea 
Thank you. I will try that.
 Jenni 
This worked for me, too.
 
 
 esturm1 
FYI, I&apos;m in Upstate SC and our Rite Aid ad this week was very different than what Jenny posted. The Cover Girl B1G1 items did not qualify for the $5 rebate, and the Venus razors, Crest 3D mouthwash, Cresh 3D Vivid White Strips, Oral B 3D toothbrush were not on sale and did not come with UP rewards.
 
 Bobbie14243 
I&apos;m in coastal Alabama and ours didn&apos;t either :-(
 cashier 
A lot of places don&apos;t have the ad wrap. That&apos;s where the 3D products are advertised this week, and I think the Covergirl as well. Not sure about the razors, but I&apos;m assuming they&apos;re there as well since they aren&apos;t on sale for you.
 
 Sandra 
Hey, that might do it. When I look online at my ad there isn&apos;t an ad wrap. Does one show up for you? They don&apos;t have a search for it so I can&apos;t look up VENUS razors. That would do it! That would at least mean I&apos;m not going nuts!
 
 carolyn090 
i looked at the on line ad for folkston ga. i didnt see the 3d white or the luvs either . that was the two things i really wanted .so glad you posted .saved me from a big oops! opon arrival. so luv the up sure i can make something work
 Catherine 
I got the Venus razors and it didn&apos;t print Up rewards for me either, and only the 1 pack was 5.99. I&apos;m up North though.
 Sandra 
Ya I was wondering about that, I could not figure that out for the life of me–I never saw a sign at any of my rite aids but I also could not find venus disposable razors that were anywhere near 5.99–9.49 were the only price. None of the razors were one sale. Mid michigan here.
 Jenni 
My Venus 3 ct rang up as a 6 ct–I have to get that fixed. Hopefully that was the only reason mine didn&apos;t print. I was at the Woodruff, SC, Rite Aid. Rite Aid needs to quit this small adds here and there business.
 
 Sandy 
Just a heads up. RA has new policies regarding $5.00 Video value coupon, $5.00 Wellness coupon. Still a bit confusing to me but seems that you can only use 1 per month of each as it is now being attached and recorded to your Wellness card (and coded differently as well). Can anybody confirm????
 
 http://www.dollars2cents.com jseveran 
I haven&apos;t tried to use more than one per month, however, the manager at Rite Aid did tell me yesterday they have changed their computer system and would know if you use the same q twice.
 
 Susan 
Nope–that&apos;s not true. As of the end of July, it will be true, though.
 
 guest 
It&apos;s true! It&apos;s not all of them–but definitely the 5 off 25 and 5 off 20. FortheMommas blog tried using a 5 off 25 purchase twice (printed from July video values) and the register rejected it the second time–she even took pics. If you printed multiple June $$ off coupons they will still work but they expire soon.
 
 Rayraymears 
So you can use 1- 5$ off 25$ and 1-5$ off 20$ each month? Or just 1 total each month?
 
 
 
 
 3monkeysmom 
What&apos;s the deal with all the“infomercial”products on Video Values??? Bump-Its, Peg Egg, Aqua Globes……can I get some real coupons please?? :-)

Our ad was very different too!!! only 8 pages and none of the stuff i was going to get was in it…I went by the store just to see if they had any signage and they didnt. The Crest White strips, and the Veet were the two things i was after and neither were in our ad in Dothan, AL
 Rebecca 
Can I just say, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Rite Aid, AND this website! I am getting so many freebies/cheapies that I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever have to pay full price for hygeine items ever again (lots of household-type stuff, either!). Don&apos;t forget the SCJohnson rebate is over on the 30th! I just bought some more ziplocs today for next to nothing, and am expecting $5- back again (google scjohnson rebate if you don&apos;t have the form). I&apos;m off to order my free rite aid mousepad. Thanks again, Jenny!
 Ereffner 
I have a very strong dislike for rite aid. I am never pleased when I go there. I&apos;m trying so hard to save money, but our store doesn&apos;t seem to match what Jenny put.
 Ben Danagipson 
My area has a Rite Aid that is an“8 page ad”store. However, the newspaper I buy always has the 12 page ad, and my store is very good about“matching”their prices to the 12 page ad. Today, I purchased the Crest White Strips (10ct box) and my store adjusted their price to the $22.99 ad price. I had the $10.00 mfg q, and was then expecting my $10 +UP reward at the end of my receipt. I didn&apos;t get it. I got 2 other $1.00 each +UP rewards that were due to me though. I also bought 2 Head&amp;Shoulders (they had to adjust the price on these as well to $3.99) used $3/2 mfg q and was expecting a $2.00 +UP reward. This one didn&apos;t print either. I will add that I used one $1.00 +UP Reward from last week, from the Folgers coffee purchase. I also used a $1.00 off any oral care purchase of $10.00 or more (+UP Reward from last week). I don&apos;t know if that changed anything or not. My cashiers are so helpful that I really don&apos;t want to go back in there and ask them about it, unless there&apos;s really something they can do there. I was going to email corporate first. Does anyone have any suggestions on this?
 
 guest 
My guess is you&apos;re going to get the price match but not the Up Rewards. I don&apos;t think there is a way for them to force the register to give you an Up Reward. If I was you I&apos;d just go into the store and ask them if you can get the price match as well as the Up. At the very least, be happy that you at least got the prices matched. The rest of us are sitting at home with yellow teeth. 8 page ads and no price matching.
 Aedungan 
it might feel weird to go in there again especially if the cashiers were helpful but it&apos;s not about them, its about you. you probably wouldn&apos;t have bought these products if you knew you weren&apos;t going to get all the discounts attached to them (such as the +up rewards). i think if u talk to a manager, they can definately help you. they can refund the +up rewards by way of gift card, or they can redo your transaction (even though you already gave them your coupons)&amp;discount the amount of the +up reward you were due. i.e. since you didn&apos;t get the $10 +up reward on the crest white strips, they can refund your transaction, ring you up again&amp;make it for $10 less than you actually paid. there are a lot of options though&amp;you&apos;ll be surprised what they can come up with to help you. but they know most of us wouldn&apos;t even look at half of these marked up products without coupons&amp;all the additional discounts attached to them (in-ad coupons, video values, single check rebates,&amp;+up rewards). so go get them ben!
 Carrollsc2 
I had a +UP reward that did not print. I e-mailed and got a coupon in the mail for the amount of the reward.
 Jenni 
Call corporate and explain the situation. They were very helpful to me last week when 3 different UP Rewards did not print (they were in the ad, too.) I am thinking about calling Corporate about some UPs I thought I was due, because of the same issue: But big city papers, and went to my small town Rite Aid. We&apos;ll see what happens. Hopefully, Rite Aid will get enough complaints/suggestions about the smaller ads that they just do a full ad all over. Why should small town people miss out on the best deals?
 
 Sarah 
Can I use the in-ad Veet coupon and a Veet manufacturer coupon?
Thanks!
 
 guest 
Yes. The in ad coupon isn&apos;t actually a manufacturers coupon (despite the fact that it says it on the top). The barcode probably starts with RC…if it does you are good to go!
 
 Amy 
Great trip to RiteAid today! I got so many M&amp;Ms, it isn&apos;t even funny. I bought 3 of the big bags for $2.50 each, used a B2G1 q and a $.75/2 q. I also bought 8 little packs for free! (Who knew there were coconut M&amp;Ms? I haven&apos;t tried them yet, but they look good.) Actually in my first transaction, I did the John Frieda deal- used 4 $3 q&apos;s, and $5/25 and got back $10 Up+. I got 4 packs of Stayfree for free in that transaction too. For my second transaction, I thought it through so carefully to make it add up to $20, so I could use the other $5 /$20. I wanted the price to come to $10 after q&apos;s, so I could use my $10 Up+. It ended up being only $5, because I forgot to count that $5/20 q (oops), so I paid cash and left with $12 Up+!

Just want to say- Rite Aid in Travelers Rest is wonderful, always patient with multiple transactions/coupons and happy to see me get a good deal.
 
 bridgeti 
Coconut M&amp;M&apos;s are awesome!!! Enjoy!
 
 Nancy 
Does anyone know what the limit is for the Pampers big pack? Is it only one box per household?

Thanks
 
 Aminehdestin 
As long as you buy them one at a time, the +Up will print every time. If it doesn&apos;t print, ask the cashier to try returning it and doing it again or modifying the purchase down so that you pay what the ad says. You shouldn&apos;t have any trouble!
 
 nancy 
Okay, thanks so much!

 Angela 
Great deal and you can still submit for the Schick Hydro Rebate! Making all FREE +. Jenny&apos;s latest post has link for it.
 
 Rayraymears 
My RA add does not show the UP rewards for the pampers or the luvs. Has anyone bought these and DID receive the rewards? It&apos;s going to really mess up my entire plan if I can&apos;t get the UP rewards on these.
 
 guest 
If it&apos;s not in your ad–no Ups :(
 
 Rayraymears 
Awww, thanks for the reply. total bummer, LOL. Oh well, guess I&apos;ll hold on to the pampers and luvs coupons and see what&apos;s out next week, :)
 
 Susan 
You can always go to iheartriteaid (dot) com, iheartcvs (dot) com, or iheartwags (dot) com (this one is walgreens) to see upcoming circulars–usually as far out as a month in advance.
 
 
 Dana 
Wasn&apos;t in my ad either and I bought them and did NOT receive the $6 UP rewards. Price was $17.99 instead of $15.99 as well.

Hi :) My first-ever post here ;) So excited about Southern Savers&amp;Rite Aid!! I&apos;m taking photos&amp;then emailing my couponing friends all my awesome deals—this may be“old had”to you extreme couponing extra-ordinaires, but to me, my head is still spinning about“free products”—forget about MAKING MONEY!! Whoo Hoo!!

Wanted to share about the Huggies Jeans Jumbo packs on sale this week. I found a $2.00 coupon for any Huggies Little Movers inside…couple that with last month&apos;s video-values Huggies Jeans&amp;wipes combo coupon (if you watched&amp;printed/saved it from last month, or this month&apos;s combo coupon for the same), the $.50 Huggies wipes coupon in last Sunday&apos;s paper (Unless you have a better coupon in your stash, which I did not for the size applicable for the wipes SCR),&amp;then await the $1.oo SCR from the wipes…and you&apos;ve got a deal in my book :)

I also wanted to confirm that in Southern Pines NC we are not seeing the same RA weekly deals, either…bummer on the inability to capitalize on Crest White Strips or the Venus razors…stained teeth and hairy legs are NOT a good combo ;)

Another idea for those who love Pantene but dislike the price. Our 2 Rite Aids here have the older products on clearance for half price. There are styling products as well as shampoo&amp;conditioners…there are many coupons available now for Pantene due to recent marketing of the new line. I have so many coupons and so much Pantene in my“stash”now, that yesterday I blessed a sweet older lady with one of my coupons&amp;helped her understand the sale + savings with coupon, she was so tickled!! When I give someone a coupon for something I see in their cart/basket they kind of look at me funny, but when I tell them the savings they are usually very grateful…hey, you&apos;d take a dollar if someone handed it to ya, right?

Quick question I hope can be answered easily…Can I purchase 2 DIFFERENT items that earn UP $ in the same transaction, just NOT 2 of the SAME items? So many rules, trying to effectively strategize BEFORE I get to the cashier!!

Thanks for all you do, Jenny, and for all the helpful comments, you talented couponers!!

Oh, and a P.S. here…a great way to bless the local pregnancy crisis prevention center is to gather up these baby deals/freebies and basket them up sweetly as a baby gift to the less-financially-fortunate mommy-to-be. All of us mommies remember how awesome it felt to be the recipient of such wonderful gifts!!
 
 guest 
Everything you just said, including your question sounds great!

2 different Up Reward items in the same transaction = Good
The same items for multiple Ups = Bad (only can be done in multiple transactions)

Check your Rite Aid for clearanced Mega Packs of diapers. My Rite Aid still had some! I stocked up on Huggies and now will be receiving a voucher for another pack.
 
 TheChapleigh 
Thanks for the info on the UP $. I did see the clearanced diapers last week and capitalized on those, with coupons in hand!! I&apos;m finished with ever paying full price again (unless it&apos;s my favorite sushi place ;) But with all this couponing, I&apos;ve now got more sushi-dollars to spend!!
 
 bridgeti 
Hey I&apos;m in Southern Pines too! I LOVE our Rite Aid- I hardly ever hit Walgreens anymore- it&apos;s just always a hassle. I&apos;m with you, now that I&apos;ve discovered couponing, it kills me to pay full price for anything at the grocery or drugstore. (My husband is one of those who, when he wants it, he wants it NOW :) But all the money I&apos;m saving has gotten his attention, and I try to keep him out of the grocery store. :)
 
 
 
 Missywooten 
The single check rebates on this ad are for July, right?
 
 guest 
Yes
 
 Chris 
I am a little confused…If UP rewards are like ECBs, do I need a Rite Aid Card to get them? Or do they work more like Walgreens RRs? Have been concentrating on CVS and Walgreens but I am getting excited about the possibilities with Rite Aid! :) Thanks!
 
 guest 
Yes, you need a wellness card. You can get one mailed to you, or you can get one in the store.
 
 Chris 
Thanks! I see that in the ad now :)

There is a new coupon on Dixie at coupons.com for $1/2. Stack this coupon with the video values coupon, which ended on 6/26, for a good deal on Dixie that is currently $5/2. If you did watch the video on dixie before 6/26 then it is still available for you to print. Also, There’s a coupon on Dr. Scholl’s for her insoles $2 off. Just saw there is currently a video value coupon for $2 also. Rite Aid’s website shows the price as $5.99, but when this going on sale, hopefully soon, this might be a free deal.
 Tammy 
Help–I&apos;m new to Rite Aid adn Southern Savers. For the Rebates, does it matter when you shop? The ad says they are the July rebates, can I shop now and enter my receipts?
 
 guest 
Depends on the rebate. Some of them are for the whole month, others are only for certain days. If you go to the Rite Aid website it shows you the list of rebates for July and their valid dates.

Is there a reason why all of my comments on here are being reviewed by a moderator before they are posted??

If you have listed a website in your post it will be reviewed. Just a precaution to prohibit spam.
 
 Shannoncrawley1982 
can anyone tell me where the 5/25 is for the redplum one?
 Sdavisva 
You can take a survey about your hair and print a $2.50 on any John Freida product from their website. Go to news and offers and then offers. I think it&apos;s on the bottom left-hand side of that page. It takes about 5 or so minutes. I saw another reader post on a different site.
 3monkeysmom 
Just wanted to say that I think the Fultondale, AL store has the most patient, coupon-friendly cashiers in the world. I had issues when I went in yesterday AND the day before and both times the cashiers were so nice and went out of their way to make everything work :-) They are soooo great :-)
Anyways, between the 2 transactions, my OOP after + UP rewards and SCR, is $5.48 for 2-20 pks of batteries, 1- 8 pk of batteries, 4 packs of Carefree pads, 2 Secret Deodorants, 1 Pro-Health toothpaste, a bag of pretzels and a writing tablet for my daughter :-)
LOVE SOME RITE-AID!!!
 Neharris38 
I got really cheap pampers by doing the john frieda deal with (3) $3 coupons and (1) $2 coupon to get the $10 Up . . . Then got the big box pampers and some carefree liners and stayfree pads to bring my total to above $25. Then I used $5/$25, the B1G1 coupons on the liners and pads, a $3 pampers RA coupon from the P&amp;G booklet of coupons from a promotion a while back and the $2 pampers from the paper. When it was all said and done, I spent $0.40 OOP and got $5 UP reward back for the box of pampers. I am going to use that and some other Up rewards to roll into a big box of Luvs diapers also on sale this week . . . will pay only tax and get $6 Up rewards back. Will also stock up on more liners and pads since I get 3 copies of the paper and I ordered more liner coupons a while back hoping a nice sale would come along. I did another John Frieda deal and got a big pack of Luvs–paid less than $2 OOP for both transactions [also got some Kleenex and Welch&apos;s grape juice and carefree liners. I also got a pack of Huggies and some other things in another transaction that was 80 cents. I am loving Rite Aid this week!!!

I also just found out that along with the $2 Huggies SCR, there is also a $2 SCR for both the pampers and Luvs big boxes [recall that I got a $4 Up for the pampers and a $6 Up for the Luvs]. . . so that another $4 rebate that I did not expect. Turns out all of this will be much better than free after SCRs and Up rewards.

And, to top it all off . . .I think the one manager who I hated seeing in my RA is no longer working there. He always scrutinized my coupons and even tried to keep me from using them sometimes [until I corrected him, of course!]. Once, he would not honor a rain check that I got at another store b/c he said that the day that the rain check was written for he had plenty of stock in his store [as if he could remember what his stock was weeks before]!! When his cashier tried to tell him that it could be used at any RA, he snipped at her to be quiet! The nerve . . . I called corporate on him after that trip! I have avoided that location for a long time to not have to deal with him, but now that I think he may be gone . . . . bring on the deals!!!
 Neharris38 
Always make sure to grab the monthly SCR brochure when you are in the store b/c there are some rebate deals in there that are not advertised in the weekly paper. The Huggies jumbo pack, Pampers big box and Luvs big box all have $2 SCRs this month. I just happened to see them just browsing through . . .

I do not make it a habit to look at it, but I will now!
 Patriciaruvo 
Any NEW 5 off 25 , please let me know,THANKS
 
 Erin B 
go to the rite aid video values. there are two there for watching one video
 
 Shari 
can you use a video values coupon and an in ad rite aid coupon on the same item?
 
 Susan 
yes
 Jenni 
Actually, the cashiers in my store have been told that you cannot do this. Wouldn&apos;t it be great if Corporate would make this clear once and for all?
 
 Up2stampin 
Loving the New set-up at RiteAid.
I purchased over $67.00 worth of product and only shelled out 8.47
and have $10 +Up money…whoo hoo. this never happens to me..
I am the one always getting stuck at the register with the coupons not working together!
 Up2stampin 
I am brand new to couponing seriously and I was hoping to save 1/2 on my non-food related items.. I am doing sooooo much better than that.
I look forward to running out of stuff now…thats silly huh.
Well I decided if I could cut back 1/2 of my total grocery bill I would book a 25th anninversary cruise for next year. Lookin Good!
 Coupon Kathy 
Does anyone know of a way to find out which stores have the extended ad….and if so, do you know of a way to get one of them? I was so disappointed that the Crest White Strips&amp;Duracell battery deals weren&apos;t offered in my area! I called Rite Aid to ask about it and I spoke to two different people…. and they were both very short, blunt and to the point with me…bordering on being rude. I very nicely asked why they were only offered in certain areas…and if there was anything I could do to request them in my area. They both told me it was based on population and there was nothing I could do! But, my local RiteAid told me that if I had the ad, they would honor the prices….I just don&apos;t know how to find who has the extended ads. I&apos;m in the middle Georgia area. Thanks for any help.
 
 Susan 
The AJC had it this past Sunday if you could get your hand on one of those.
 Aminehdestin 
Most of the major Atlanta papers have the“normal”ad. I know the AJC does, and the Marietta daily news but that&apos;s probably a bit north for you. Call around to grocery stores and see if anyone has held on to a Sunday AJC, or call the AJC directly and ask if there&apos;s anywhere you can still buy one. Good luck.
 
 Stephanielmoore 
I can&apos;t find the riteaid printable coupon for Veet or an in-ad coupon. Am i missing it?
 RACashier 
Since so many people seem to be under the impression that Rite Aid employees can&apos;t do the deals, I thought I&apos;d post a condensed version of my week. Keep in mind, I&apos;ve been there every day, so instead of doing multiple transactions, I just do one a day…

First, I paid $2.98 (used $4 +UP from last week) (+ $1.62 tax) for 4 JF products, 1 Tresemme Shampoo,&amp;Crest toothpaste)
Got $11 +UP and will get $2.99 SCR
Second: I got 1 Box Luvs, 2 cereals, 2 Stayfree Pads, 1 mouthwash (used $11+UP paid $1.08 (+ 1.53 tax)&amp;got $9 +UPs, will get $2 SCR for Luvs
Third: I bought Crest White strips for (man. coupon&amp;oral care +UP) $2.99 (+$1.38 tax) after using the $9+UP
Got $10 +UP
Then I did roll that one that night&amp;Paid $0.08 (+ $1.89 tax) (used $10 +Up) for 4 JF products, 1 Playtex, 1 mouthwash, 2 Miniwheats
Got $13 in +UPs
Finally: Bought 2 Schick Quattro refills 4 ct. w/2 bonus, 1 Secret Clinical stregnth, 1 Lysol No touch system, and 1 Physicians Formula coverup for $0.95 (+$2.58 tax) after using my $13 in +UPs

I&apos;ve bought everything I needed this week. And only paid $8.08 total (+ 9.00 tax) for a total OOP of $17.08 but I&apos;ll get $4.99 back in rebates. Close enough to free to make me VERY happy. I got the diapers for a baby shower gift and the shampoo and conditioner for 2 friends who are having money trouble. Beyond that, I don&apos;t think I need anything else household wise, or personal care wise for at least a month. I waited on the second round of JF products so that just in case it was popular, I didn&apos;t buy too much myself. It&apos;s not a big seller in my store though, and besides that I bought 1-2 of each item I got. This week worked well for me.
 Coupon Kathy 
Thanks for the info. I may not have time to get my hands on an AJC this week…but that let&apos;s me know to check it out from now on!
 Ginaod2000 
Hi! Just wanted to let everyone one know I did the cover girl deal #7 with the B1G1 Free deal (mentioned in the second offer up top) It didn&apos;t work :0( The rebate #7 are not the same covergirl products as the ones on sale B1G1. I thought I had a mega deal buying these coupled with the coupons I had. I will probably keep them…was still a great deal…just not a steal like I hoped :0) Take care all!
 
 Jenni 
Really? I will have to check on that.
 RA Cashier 
I noticed that first thing on Sunday when we were putting the signs up. It&apos;s so much harder to put the rebates up when they do that, but that&apos;s what the manufacturer wants this month…
 
 Super Socks117 
Don’t know if someone’s already said it, but don’t forget the moneymaker in there: TENA Ultra Thins had a rebate in 4/26 inserts. Scan for $12.99, use $3.00 in ad coupon, plus a $2.50 manu here: http://www.tena.us/Documents/84_Region_North_America/USA%20-%20English/Documents/retail/SCA_10021_TUTcoupon_v2.pdf 

You make $5.50–Tax.

Also @ the Rite Aid“employee who thinks, we think, they can’t do deals”: Did you get two UP back in the same order? It looks like you say that“Paid $.08 and got 13 +UP”But I was under the impression you must to multiple transactions as only one +Up prints per transaction. Is this wrong?
 
 Dianne 
Do you have a CVS close to you? There&apos;s a better deal there this week on Tena pads.They are B1G1, so with the rebate, you are getting two packs for free. AND, thank you so much for posting that link for the coupon. We can use two of them on the deal at CVS!
 
 Guest 
Does anyone know if the rebate form is available online?
 
 Super Socks117 
I don&apos;t think it is.
 
 Super Socks117 
I don&apos;t have a CVS in walking distance and I do not have a car. :( I also don&apos;t use the Tena pads, I am getting them because they are making me $5.50 and I can donate them to my mom&apos;s workplace.
 
 RA Cashier 
I did. You can only get one of each deal in one transaction, but if you bought each item that has a +Up at the same time, you should just have a very long receipt with a +Up for each one. I got the $10 for the JF, $1 for the Mini Wheats, and the $2 for Crest 3D mouthwash in that transaction. I wouldn&apos;t have been able to buy 2 of the mouthwashes together though, and get 2 $2 rewards, that&apos;s when you have to roll them. Just a heads up though, our DM has said that splitting transactions is fine, but we do need to limit them. We were told that 2 is reasonable, but if we&apos;re not busy or if the customer is willing to let other customers check out in between their purchases, we&apos;ve been allowing 3 (we haven&apos;t had anyone want to do more than that).
 RA Cashier 
Oh, and I didn&apos;t mean anything by how I started my post…saying“Since so many people seem to be under the impression that Rite Aid employees can&apos;t do the deals”it just always makes me laugh when customers look shocked when I say what my shopping plan is. I&apos;ve had a dozen people actually say something about us being able to take advantage of the sales too, this week alone.
 
 Lisa 
I have a question about the BOGO sales at Rite Aid and the $5/$25 Q. When I buy the 2 items that are BOGO, do they ring up (example) $3.99 and $3.99 or will it ring up $3.99 and $0? I want to get to my $25 mark so I can use my coupon, but I don&apos;t know how BOGO&apos;s ring up. I hope that made sense! Thanks!
 
 Neharris38 
It will only ring up the price of 1 item . . . for example the pads/liners this week were 3.99 and BOGO . . . for every 2 that you get, it only puts you $4 closer to your $25 goal. I used the pads/liners to bring me up to my total with diapers, so it was not hard to get to that mark for me. I was able to get lots of diapers [big boxes] and lots of pads plus juice and a few boxes of kleenex . . . oh and 2 john frieda deals all for less than $10 after tax and I will get $6 in SCRs and have $6 Up reward to use for next time. Can&apos;t beat that!!!
 
 Lisa 
Thank you for clearing that up, I rarely shop at Rite Aid because there is not one close by.
I would love to see your diaper deal scenario! That&apos;s why I am making a special trip tomorrow!
 
 Neharris38 
Let&apos;s see . . . I got 3 big boxes of Luvs and 1 big box of Pampers Cruisers and 1 jumbo pack of Huggies [to make 4 out of my 5 for the free Huggies promo . . . I will need to get my 5th pack later in the month]. I started off with $8 in Up rewards [3+3+2 from the motrin and colgate deals last week].

For the 1st transaction, I did the John Frieda deal with (3) $3 coupons and (1) $2 coupons. I got 2 carefree liners and 2 stayfree pads to bring my total to $28.
-used $5/$25 = $23
-used the John Frieda coupons = $12
-used 1 each of the carefree and stayfree B1G1 coupons = $4 + tax, got $10 Up [could have used one of my $3 Up rewards if I had not left them at home!]

I rolled that $10 Up into:
1 big box Pampers cruisers (17.99 b/c I have hit the 10% off level with the wellness+)
2 carefree liners (3.99)
2 m&amp;ms (0.88)
1 Kleenex (0.99)
-used $5/$25
-used $10 Up
-used $3 cruisers coupon from RA booklet (P&amp;G promo a while back)
-used $2 pampers coupon from paper
-used M&amp;M B1G1 coupon
-used carefree b1g1 coupon

my subtotal was -0.94 cents, tax was 1.34 so my grand total was . . . . 40 CENTS!!!
I also got $5 Up from the pampers.

After that, I just kept rolling my Up rewards to get the Luvs boxes and Huggies and used carefree liners and stayfree pads to get my totals up to $20 or $25 [I had my RA adperks coupon from last month, got a new one this month . . . also had several $5/$25 ones from my 3 computers plus the one I got in email for signing up for wellness +]. I did another John Frieda deal with the bricks link for $2.50 off when you do the survey on their website. i had two more of the $2 coupons from the paper since I get 3 copies. In some of my later transactions, my liners and pads rang up at 3.59 with my 10% wellness discount, but not in my first transaction.
 
 Neharris38 
looks like I got 2 kleenex boxes in that pampers transaction since I was not expecting the discount on the pampers . . . just had the cashier ring up another kleenex to bring my total up to the $25 mark.
 Aminehdestin 
This week is amazing for diapers at Rite Aid…with that being said, have you submitted your receipts already? Most people are getting the rebate for the free pack of Huggies after buying the 4th pack instead of the 5th. It may have changed being the beginning of the month, but considering it started in April I think, you may have already earned your free diapers!
 Neharris38 
Hmmm . . . I submitted my receipts, but I&apos;ll have to check my status. Yeah, I cannot believe the diaper deals I got this week! I got 4 big boxes of diapers [3 Luvs and 1 pampers] and 2 jumbo packs of huggies all for right around $10-11 OOP and will get $6 back in SCRs [and maybe my free pack of Huggies?] . . . plus I still have $6 Up rewards to use later . . . and that OOP also included 2 john frieda deals, lots of pads and liners, 2 bottles of grape juice and several boxes of kleenex!! I&apos;m still giddy about it :)
 Neharris38 
I just checked and I have 4 packs of Huggies showing in my account but it still says“you did not purchase all of the required items”. . . so I guess I still have 1 more to go. Maybe there will be another good deal for me to get my last pack . . . I hoping for a good deal with an Up reward so that I can roll the $6 I have into another deal that will give me more . . . . also hoping that the $3 off coupon will come back to coupons.com or facebook!
 
 
 
 
 Erin B 
Has anyone else watched the Kotex video on the Rite Aid Video Values yet? It&apos;s HILARIOUS! Even if you don&apos;t want the coupon, you&apos;ve got to see it if you need a laugh.
 
 Neharris38 
I saw it . . . . it was very funny! It kinda reminded me of a SNL spoof . . . I certainly am not twirling in circles and feeling giddy during that“special”time :)
 
 Gamego71 
Has anyone seen a new 5 off 25 coupon for Rite Aid yet since the old one expired on 6/30?
 
 caseyandgrantsmom 
Just go watch another video ;)
 
 Sarah 
Can someone please tell me what I did wrong in trying to get the Duracell SCR? I bought:
5 pkgs. Duracell batteries totalling $25.45
Coppertone Sunscreen for $8.99
Secret deodorant for $1.99
Tissues for $.99
and used
$2 coppertone coupon,
$5 off $25 RA coupon
$2 wellness plus coupon
$5 wellness plus coupon

I submitted my receipt for the $10 SCR when you spend $20 on Duracell batteries and it said I didn&apos;t spend enough, but I spent $25 on batteries. Where&apos;d I go wrong? Did I use too many coupons? My OOP total was $24.59, so I spent plenty of money!!
 
 3monkeysmom 
I was just coming on here to warn everyone about the Duracell rebate :-)
What size and count did you buy?
The rebate says you have to buy AA8, AAA8, AA16, AAA16, AA20+5 FREE, C4,D4,9V2,C8, D8 or 9V4.
I bought 1 pack of AA8. I also got 2 bonus packs: 1 AA and 1 AAA, these were both 16 count + 4 free.
If I recall correctly, that&apos;s all that had on the display (with the rebate sign hanging from it!) were the bonus packs. I checked on the status this morning and I didn&apos;t qualify.
I can only figure that it was b/c I bought the bonus packs. I haven&apos;t called to confirm this but I think I&apos;m just going to exchange them for smaller packages or something.
 
 Sarah 
Thanks, I just went over my receipt AGAIN and finally figured out what I did wrong–I bought a package of AAA4, which was not included. So I will exchange those for something else and hopefully that will take care of it!
 
 
 Gingiraffe 
FYI: There was a special flyer that was in our paper yesterday that has a $5/$25 q and 4 $25 gift card with rx transfer qs in it. Also had some special markdowns listed.

Where are you located? Just by chance it&apos;s a regional thing for your area.

I was disappointed on my trip. They didn&apos;t even have Luvs diapers in the store anymore! Much less have the 6 Up rewards deal for them or Pampers :(
 
 
 Kaysmom 
I had a great buy at Rite Aid…
1 box pampers $19.99
2 single serve M&amp;M BIGI
Used:
$5/$20
$3 off pampers store coupon
$3 off pampers manu.
$3 previous up reward
BIGI M&amp;M manuf. coupon
Total OOP $7.12
Got back $5 Up reward
Saved $15
They did not any blind with all my stacking of coupons. I love my Rite Aid!!
 
 caseyandgrantsmom 
How did you get the pamper&apos;s store coupon? I haven&apos;t seen any of those!
 
 peytonsmom 
Today was my first Rite Aid experience and I left a little confused. There were several deals I had planned on doing that were not advertised in the paper or my store including the venus disposables, pampers, oral b toothbrush, and whitestrips. Are there a lot of unadvertised up+ or are these deals not offered in bham? Thanks in advance :)
 
 Aminehdestin 
There&apos;s the basic national ad, and also a“short ad”. I don&apos;t know the reasoning for it, I saw that someone emailed or called to ask corporate, and they were told it&apos;s based on population, but that doesn&apos;t seem right b/c most of the posts I&apos;ve seen about people having the short ad have been pretty large cities. Your best bet, would be to either find if there&apos;s a Rite Aid with the national ad within a decent distance that would be worth you going a little out of the way, or get your hands on that ad (major newspaper on Sunday!) and take it with you and ask if they are willing to price match the sales price. Not sure if stores are willing to match the +Ups as well, but it never hurts to ask.
 Shelley 
Yeah, I went in wanting the free razors and they were NOT $5.99…$9.49. I looked and looked through the ad and couldn&apos;t see it advertised as a +UP deal and the cashier really didn&apos;t understand when I was asking her about specific UP deals. $5 for 3 razors is not a deal!
 
 Super Socks117 
Can you use more coupons than items? It seems like you do–ie, I wanna buy coppertone and have both the in-ad and the manu. coupons; do I need to bulk up my orders any?
 
 Aminehdestin 
You can use up to 2 coupons on each item. 1 Manufacturer&apos;s coupon and one Rite Aid coupon (even though they do say“Manufacturer&apos;s coupon”on the top. It&apos;s in the coupon policy, so you really shouldn&apos;t have any trouble with it. Really, now with the Video Values, you can really use 3 coupons, one of each mentioned and the VV coupon which looks like RA coupon, but it&apos;s accepted differently. The +Up rewards also don&apos;t work like RR at Walgreens where they are accepted like coupons, at Rite Aid they&apos;re more like store cash, just not able to pay your tax. Good luck.
 
 Votelisa 
can you really use 5 off $25 puchase rite aid q at publix????
 
 Angel_in_Charleston 
Some do, some don&apos;t. It all depends on who is considered a competitor in your area. Ask the manager at your Publix!
 
 DianaY19 
FYI, the covergirl rebate does not include the Eyelights eye shadow as listed above. I submitted for the rebate, it didn&apos;t work so I faxed them the information. Got a confirmation that it didn&apos;t include those eye shadows (it wasn&apos;t listed on rite aid site either). Just thought I&apos;d let those know who purchased this so they don&apos;t go through trying the get the rebate.
