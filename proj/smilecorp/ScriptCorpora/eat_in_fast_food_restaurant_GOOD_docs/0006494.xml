 Added on : Monday July 02nd 2012 08:00:45 PM I work as a software engineer, and graduated 2 years
ago. I have been fortunate to have decent job, and have
been more or less conservative with my spending habits.After accounting for a healthy emergency fund, I have saved
just about enough money to pay off my student loans in full. To date I have been paying these down at about 150% of the
statement amountACS Loan Services: Remaining balance $11,000 @ 6.2%
Nelnet Loan Services:Remaining balance $4,500 @5.6%I&apos;m leaning toward just paying them off in full.
Should I do it?Concerns:1. Any tax benefits I&apos;ll miss out on by holding on to the student loans?2. Because of the student loan bubble, are we about to
see major restructuring or dismissal of loans that could be of benefit?3. Is it a good idea hold on to the debt at these relatively low rates
and invest in a broad market index fund with the principle? Like I said, I am leaning far towards paying them all off by the end
of next month, but wanted to hear from the FW community first.
Thanks!!gk

 OCZ Agility 3 - 90GB, 2.5&quot;, SATA III, Solid State Drive - $69.99 Shipped @ Newegg 
 Added on : Friday June 22nd 2012 08:00:04 AM Seems to be $10 cheaper than other sellers currently for this SSD. Features up to 525 MB/s read and 500 MB/s write times (for SATA 6Gbps) and 4KB random write performance of 50k IOPS. 4/5 eggs rated with 66 reviews.LINKOCZ Agility 3 SATA III Solid State Drives are designed and built to provide an exceptional balance of performance and value. The Agility 3 Series implements the cutting-edge SATA 6Gbps interface to deliver excellent sequential and random data transfer rates, significantly improving your computing experience over hard drives.In addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability. Unique and innovative, Agility 3 SSDs deliver a one-of-a-kind storage solution.
ENGINEERED FOR COST-EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE
The OCZ Agility 3 SATA III Solid State Drives are designed and built for cost-effective performance. By leveraging the latest SATA 6Gbps interface and the second generation of SandForce SSD controller (SF-2281), the Agility 3 pushes the limits in both sequential and random data transfer rates with up to 525MB/s read plus incredible 4KB random write performance of 50,000 IOPS. This significantly improves your productivity, gaming, multimedia, and overall computing experience. It is backwards compatible with SATA II / 3Gbps, and is also compliant with ATA/ATAPI-8 Standard Native Command Queuing (NCQ). (Max performance achieved using Native SATA 6Gbps chipset. Rated speeds may vary slightly depending on the benchmark used, drivers, windows version, bios version and file size.)A SUPERIOR PC EXPERIENCE
In addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability.TRIM SUPPORT
The OCZ Agility 3 offers native TRIM support featured in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Designed to maintain the performance of SSD at an optimal level over the lifetime of the drive, TRIM functions by actively deleting invalid data from the SSDs memory cells to ensure that write operations perform at full speed. Since a memory block must be erased before it can be re-programmed, TRIM improves performance by pro-actively erasing pages containing invalid data, allowing the SSD to write new data without first having to perform a time-consuming erase command.S.M.A.R.T. TECHNOLOGY
The OCZ Agility 3 adopts Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) which enables the PC to predict the future failure of hard disk drives. Through the SMART system, hard disk drives incorporate a suite of advanced diagnostics that monitor the internal operations of a drive and provide an early warning for many types of potential problems. When a potential problem is detected, the hard drive can be repaired or replaced before any data is lost or damaged.ECC RECOVERY
Designed with the file verification and repair tool- ECC Recovery, OCZ Agility 3 provides up to 55 bits correctable per 512-byte sector (BCH), protecting your important files and sensitive data against digital corruption by using Reed-Solomon codes.

 OCZ Agility 3 - 240GB, SATA III, 2.5&quot;, SSD - $169.99 aMIR Shipped @ Newegg

OCZ Agility 3 SATA III Solid State Drives are designed and built to provide an exceptional balance of performance and value. The Agility 3 Series implements the cutting-edge SATA 6Gbps interface to deliver excellent sequential and random data transfer rates, significantly improving your computing experience over hard drives.In addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability. Unique and innovative, Agility 3 SSDs deliver a one-of-a-kind storage solution.
ENGINEERED FOR COST-EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE
The OCZ Agility 3 SATA III Solid State Drives are designed and built for cost-effective performance. By leveraging the latest SATA 6Gbps interface and the second generation of SandForce SSD controller (SF-2281), the Agility 3 pushes the limits in both sequential and random data transfer rates with up to 525MB/s read and 500MB/s write, plus incredible 4KB random write performance of 45,000 IOPS. This significantly improves your productivity, gaming, multimedia, and overall computing experience. It is backwards compatible with SATA II / 3Gbps, and is also compliant with ATA/ATAPI-8 Standard Native Command Queuing (NCQ). (Max performance achieved using Native SATA 6Gbps chipset. Rated speeds may vary slightly depending on the benchmark used, drivers, windows version, bios version and file size.)A SUPERIOR PC EXPERIENCE
In addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability.TRIM SUPPORT
The OCZ Agility 3 offers native TRIM support featured in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Designed to maintain the performance of SSD at an optimal level over the lifetime of the drive, TRIM functions by actively deleting invalid data from the SSDs memory cells to ensure that write operations perform at full speed. Since a memory block must be erased before it can be re-programmed, TRIM improves performance by pro-actively erasing pages containing invalid data, allowing the SSD to write new data without first having to perform a time-consuming erase command.S.M.A.R.T. TECHNOLOGY
The OCZ Agility 3 adopts Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) which enables the PC to predict the future failure of hard disk drives. Through the SMART system, hard disk drives incorporate a suite of advanced diagnostics that monitor the internal operations of a drive and provide an early warning for many types of potential problems. When a potential problem is detected, the hard drive can be repaired or replaced before any data is lost or damaged.ECC RECOVERY
Designed with the file verification and repair tool- ECC Recovery, OCZ Agility 3 provides up to 55 bits correctable per 512-byte sector (BCH), protecting your important files and sensitive data against digital corruption by using Reed-Solomon codes.

I bought this a few months ago for transferring emails between Google Apps accounts. It was the only one I found that transferred the emails correctly. The transferring process is a little slow because it checks each email against the target account to make sure it doesn&apos;t upload any duplicates.

 3M Filtrete HVAC Filters - Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off - drugstore.com - + 3M Rebate 
 Added on : Monday May 28th 2012 02:00:04 AM First deal post, so the usual pleas for mercy apply.I was looking for a 3M Filtrete Elite filter in a size not available in the Amazon two-pack mentioned at 3M Filtrete Allergen Reduction Filters, 2200 MPR, 16 x 25 x 1, 2-Pack $36.21 w/ S&amp;S;@ Amazon and found the best net price for one at drugstore.com. However, when I went there, I saw that all Filtrete HVAC filters there were Buy One Get One for 50% Off - with one-inch filters ranging from 1000 to 2200 MPR. With standard shipping free, the cost for two Elite filters was $34.99 - less than the two-pack price at Amazon. Furthermore, the Filtrete site has the $6.00 rebate for three filters of 1000 MPR or more mentioned in the earlier thread as well as a $6.00 rebate for TWO filters of 1500 MPR or more, which you could use on the Amazon two-pack as well.I&apos;m sure some people will say that filters are all the same and others will say that high-filtration filters may add too much resistance, but I&apos;ve used a 1900 MPR Filtrete filter for a while longer than the three-month recommended change interval and definitely notice a difference - and I have a shedmonster of a dog and housekeeping habits that are haphazard at best. There&apos;s a lot less dust to ignore. Also, Consumer Reports recommended the Elite and rated it highly for non-smoke filtration and little added resistance.

Price Matching
How does price matching work?
-If you find an item in a competitor&apos;s printed ad that is priced lower than it is at your Target store, we will match the price. The competitor&apos;s ad must be local and current, and the product must be the identical item, brand name, quantity and model number. What if I&apos;ve already made the purchase at Target?
-No problem. Within seven days of purchase, bring your Target receipt and the competitor &apos;s current printed ad. What qualifies as proof of a competitor&apos;s advertisement?
-Please show us the entire printed advertisement. What does &apos;identical store item&apos; mean?
-The program covers items with the identical brand name, size, weight, quantity and model number of the item at Target stores. Can I use coupons when price matching?
-A guest can use coupons when price matching per Target&apos;s normal coupon policy. When the guests presents a coupon(s), these steps will be followed:
Manufacturer Coupons:
Manufacturer coupons will be applied after the price match is made.Target Coupons:
Target coupons will be applied before the price match is made. If the competitor price is still lower than the price after the Target coupon has been deducted, the ad match can be adjusted to match the competitor&apos;s price.Combining both a Target and Manufacturer Coupons:
The Target coupon will be applied before the price match is made. If the competitor price is still lower than the price after the Target coupon has been deducted, the ad match can be adjusted to match the competitor&apos;s price. Once the price match is made the manufacturer coupon will be applied.Reminder: We accept one manufacturer coupon and one Target coupon for the same item unless either coupon prohibits it.EXCLUDES: Owned brands (i.e., Home, Merona, Circo, Market Pantry and Archer Farms), Non-branded items (e.g. produce not marketed under a specific brand name)
Coupon policy
Manufacturer&amp;Target coupons:
Target accepts one Manufacturer Coupon and one Target Coupon for the same item (unless prohibited by either coupon).
Item purchased must match the coupon description (brand, size, quantity, color, flavor, etc.).
Coupon amount may be reduced if it exceeds the value of the item after other discounts or coupons are applied.
We can&apos;t give Cash Back if the face value of a coupon is greater than the purchase value of the item.
All applicable sales taxes are paid by the guest at the full value of the item.Internet (print-at-home) coupons:
We gladly accept valid Internet coupons that contain a clear and scannable bar code.
We do not accept Internet coupons for free items with no purchase requirements.Mobile coupons:
Guests can receive Target Mobile Coupons by signing up for Text Alerts at Target.com/mobile or by texting COUPONS to 827438 (TARGET).
Message and data rates may apply. See site for full details.
To redeem, simply show your coupon barcode to the cashier. With one simple scan, all applicable coupons are applied.Buy one get one free coupons (BOGO):
BOGO coupons cannot be combined (i.e. you cannot use two BOGO coupons on two items and get both for free).
A second cents-off coupon of the same type cannot be redeemed towards the purchase price of the first item.
If a Target BOGO coupon is used, one additional manufacturer coupon maybe used on the first item.
If a Manufacturer BOGO coupon is used, one additional Target coupon may be used on the first item.exclusions:
We can&apos;t accept coupons from other retailers.
We do not accept expired coupons.
General Guidelines
It&apos;s a good idea to print out their policies and take it with you (or just put a copy in the car) when you shop at Target. Unfortunately some of their employees are either untrained or simply don&apos;t care and occasionally try to make up their own rules that vary from the actual store policy. If and when this happens, ask to see their copy first. Then, if need, produce or retrieve your own. You may be able to pull it up on the registry kiosks, however most if not all no longer support printing.Some stores have limited the use of store coupons to one per person or one per transaction. The Target coupons themselves actually vary with the wording on each; you can try arguing your point but YMMV. Store policy (manager&apos;s discretion) usually wins. As far as I know, store managers can also limit purchase quantities of high demand items. If you have a problem with using coupons or &quot;doing a deal&quot; at one store, try another. You may even have better luck if you come back during a different shift. More often than not, it&apos;s a select few employees that take it upon themselves to police the transactions and scrutinize customers. General practices and employee attitudes can be surprisingly different within such a short distance.STUFF GOES FAST! If there is a freebie, and there are select re-occurring ones, they will be cleaned from the shelves very quickly....sometimes within a few hours (depending on the concentration of people in the area). It&apos;s always helpful to try and wait to combine trips, but if you aren&apos;t going to be heading there within a short time after word gets around, don&apos;t expect to get any. That being said...Target is usually pretty good about keeping things in stock.When there is a really good deal, PLEASE don&apos;t be one of &quot;those people&quot; and try to go through the line with a shopping cart full of free Sobe water (some people know what that&apos;s a reference to). Not only are you screwing over all the other people who wanted to get in on the deal, but you&apos;re also ticking off the people behind you in line, creating a headache for the cashier, and likely pushing the management toward creating or enforcing usage limits. If you want to do it more than once, that&apos;s fine...just don&apos;t clean out the shelves, don&apos;t do it all at one store, and don&apos;t try and use an obnoxious number of coupons at once (IE. 50 would not be a good idea).It is a good idea to take people shopping with you, when possible. It looks better when arguing the &quot;two Target prints per computer rule&quot; and helps to justify a larger number of purchases. If you chose to print coupons from the Target website, you will have to install a coupon plugin (yes, another one). Do not worry, IT IS NOT A VIRUS! I cannot count how many times the issue has come up, but, these are completely safe. No one is trying to infect your computer or tell the aliens where to aim their Ori Beam Cannons.Strangely enough, Target coupons have been disappearing and reappearing lately with the restrictions (trial/travel) removed...and in some cases, added. I have no idea why it&apos;s happening, but you may get one version initially, then hear of someone else getting a different coupon. There has been a lot of discussion over whether this is happening intentionally as well as whether it&apos;s okay to use them. So far it seems alright as long as they scan at the register. However, whether the cashier accepts the coupon is up to them. For all they know, it could be a copy of a coupon they&apos;d already seen, but with the restrictions edited out. YMMV.

The Agility 3 Series implements the cutting-edge SATA 6Gbps interface to deliver excellent sequential and random data transfer rates, significantly improving your computing experience over hard drives.In addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability. Unique and innovative, Agility 3 SSDs deliver a one-of-a-kind storage solution.
ENGINEERED FOR COST-EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE
The OCZ Agility 3 SATA III Solid State Drives are designed and built for cost-effective performance. By leveraging the latest SATA 6Gbps interface and the second generation of SandForce SSD controller (SF-2281), the Agility 3 pushes the limits in both sequential and random data transfer rates with up to 525MB/s read plus incredible 4KB random write performance of 50,000 IOPS. This significantly improves your productivity, gaming, multimedia, and overall computing experience. It is backwards compatible with SATA II / 3Gbps, and is also compliant with ATA/ATAPI-8 Standard Native Command Queuing (NCQ). (Max performance achieved using Native SATA 6Gbps chipset. Rated speeds may vary slightly depending on the benchmark used, drivers, windows version, bios version and file size.)A SUPERIOR PC EXPERIENCE
In addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability.TRIM SUPPORT
The OCZ Agility 3 offers native TRIM support featured in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Designed to maintain the performance of SSD at an optimal level over the lifetime of the drive, TRIM functions by actively deleting invalid data from the SSDs memory cells to ensure that write operations perform at full speed. Since a memory block must be erased before it can be re-programmed, TRIM improves performance by pro-actively erasing pages containing invalid data, allowing the SSD to write new data without first having to perform a time-consuming erase command.S.M.A.R.T. TECHNOLOGY
The OCZ Agility 3 adopts Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) which enables the PC to predict the future failure of hard disk drives. Through the SMART system, hard disk drives incorporate a suite of advanced diagnostics that monitor the internal operations of a drive and provide an early warning for many types of potential problems. When a potential problem is detected, the hard drive can be repaired or replaced before any data is lost or damaged.ECC RECOVERY
Designed with the file verification and repair tool- ECC Recovery, OCZ Agility 3 provides up to 55 bits correctable per 512-byte sector (BCH), protecting your important files and sensitive data against digital corruption by using Reed-Solomon codes.Newegg Coupons Travelocity: $25 off Hotel Stay with Facebook Code

 Added on : Monday May 07th 2012 12:04:15 PM Hello Everyone,I have searched for answers, but was able to find only bits and pieces of information. I do not need to be spoon fed, but would like to draw on the collective knowledge of FWF in the hope of solving my problem. Would anyone like to help me solve a puzzle?We live in California. We currently live in a townhome that we purchased in 2004. We would be content to live here as long as possible, except my wife has a movement disorder called Dystonia that has recently started getting worse. She starting to have trouble with stairs and has taken a couple of tumbles while weve lived here. We also have a 5 year old and despite our tricks to keep things organized (including garage sales, etc.) her things are taking over.Our goal is to get into a single level house with a bit more space. There are such houses just down the street that would adequately suit our needs. We would like to stay in our current area because of the schools.The subdivision is small, so the single stories do not come on the market as often as other subdivisions. The city is planning to build a large park (complete with boating, etc.) nearby and I worry that after the abandoned gravel pit is replaced by the park, well be completely priced out of those homes (if we arent already).

We are a bit underwater on our townhome. Ive considered renting it out and buying the single-story house, but given my financial picture (and the need for rental history to count incoming rent as income), I doubt that option will work. I feel my biggest hurdles are time, money, and the fact that if I sell the townhome the deal would be contingent.Walking away is not an option because Im the only bread winner and I have a family that needs a stable situation.If anyone has any suggestions on how I might be able to structure things, Id really appreciate it.Townhome Value: ~$300K

 Added on : Tuesday May 01st 2012 03:08:48 AM This is a serious subwoofer, and the sale plus free shipping will
save you $115 or so. Get it and get rid of the crummy sub that
came with your home theater system.
Outlaw LFM1-PlusYou&apos;ll hear less distortion.
You&apos;ll get lower lows.
You&apos;ll feel explosions.
You&apos;ll hear parts of your music you&apos;ve never heard before.Now, that&apos;s a bit of an exaggeration for some. This isn&apos;t a Submersive,
for crying out loud; not at $500. But it&apos;s probably the biggest single
upgrade most people can make to their home theater systems. - There&apos;s not much difference between the sound quality of a
$300 receiver and a $1,000 receiver
- You&apos;d know if your speakers sucked
- It&apos;s harder to make a good subwoofer than to make a good
standard L/R or center speaker due to the amount of air
a sub has to move to accurately reproduce those 25- and
20-Hz sound waves at levels you can detect.I&apos;m not in love with the Outlaw brand, but they make good --
even great -- audio gear and offer a lot of value, since they&apos;re
an internet direct company without a lot of the overhead of
brick and mortar stores.And note (full disclosure) that I&apos;m exaggerating the benefits of a
new sub if you have a large, open room. A subwoofer can pressurize
your room best if the room is smaller, and closed off from other
open rooms/areas. You&apos;ll still hear far batter bass than with
your HTiB system, but it might not quite bowl you over in a large
room, vs. a small room. More than you want to know about subwoofers
(including getting recommendations based on your room and listening
habits, how to find the best placement for your sub, how to hook
it up, etc.) can be found at the avsforum.com subwoofer group:
http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;daysprune;=&amp;f;=...I personally own an Epik sub -- but Outlaw was on my short list,
and I would be thrilled to have Outlaw in my system. This sub
produces usable sound to 20Hz and possibly below. Amazon 04/29 MP3 album Daily Deal: &quot;Wincing The Night Away&quot; by The Shins, $4.99

 Added on : Saturday April 14th 2012 09:03:18 AM So I currently live in the very dull state of Utah.
My cars tags have expired with Colorado plates. I would need to get a emissions + safety inspection ($40) every year to renew my tags in Utah. Additionally, I would need to pay registration fees + whatever else the DMV charges here.A ticket for having expired plates is $30 and are not moving violations. These cannot be given if the car is on private property. Which means I would have to get pulled over, or parked in a public place in order to be cited.Now, where I live is not patrolled by the parking police, and when I go to work I park on private property which leaves errands and trips the only times I can get pulled over for having expired tags.I imagine the police are too busy driving, taking calls, etc to notice the tags on out of state plates to initiate a stop for such.Now some fun analysis:Lets say registration + inspections comes to 160/yr, this is just a number out of a hat and in reality is probably more $$$. I could get pulled over and ticket 5 times and it would still be cheaper than actually registering the vehicle here.
I would estimate that it is reasonable with my driving habits to get ticketed twice per year for this, a total of $60.So the question to you all then, is there any reason I should get my car registered?
Yes, I have insurance.Thanks. Home Depot B&amp;M;YMMV single AA LED flashlights 70 and 50 cents 
 Added on : Sunday April 08th 2012 06:26:14 AM Was just in the Suwanee, GA Home Depot and came across a bunch of clearance items.SKU #721621 is an aluminum and rubber bodied, single AA LED flashlight, similar to the Husky brand AA light that they blew out during the 2010 holiday season. 70 cents. Comes with a standard duty zinc AA cell already installed.SKU #721258 is a plastic bodied, single AA LED flashlight, with a slightly wider nose cone and lens than the aluminum model. 50 cents. Comes with a standard duty zinc AA cell already installed.Both have tail clickies, neither will tail stand. They produce very decent light (the aluminum is more focused, the plastic model is actually a bit brighter with more spill. I am testing the runtime right now with the batteries that came with the lights and will update the the thread when I see how long they&apos;ve lasted. My experience with similar types of single AA LED lights is they will run 10 to 20 hours on an alkaline AA, which makes them very economical. While these are not high performance lights, they are perfect for glove boxes, tool bags, backpacks, etc. Excellent for nightime walks, chores around the house, or bedtime reading.Also great bargains:#837882, 6&apos; tape measure with magnet, 23 cents.#376342, stubby racheting screwdriver with two bits, 43 cents.The Home Depot Coupons Bosch 12-Volt 3/8&quot; Cordless Drill, 2 batteries, charger&amp;case $99 Lowes Free Store Pick-up

* 2. Surprise&amp;Delight Rewards
* 3. 5 Visits in 5 Weeks, $20 Reward on 6th visit
* 4. Birthday Burger
* 5. Buy 9 items, Get the 10th item Free REGISTRATION REWARD
===================
Upon registering a Red Royalty card at www.redrobin.com/redroyalty, a free appetizer reward will be placed on the card. In order to receive the reward, the member must visit a Red Robin restaurant within 14 days and order the appetizer. If there is another reward available in addition to the Registration Reward, the Registration Reward will take priority and be redeemed first since it is a limited time offer. SURPRISE AND DELIGHT REWARDS
============================
Occasionally throughout the year, members will receive email notification regarding Surprise&amp;Delight Rewards that are available to them as a registered member. These rewards are limited time offers and can only be redeemed during a designated time frame. Because of their redemption restrictions, these types of rewards will take priority over any other reward except the Registration Reward. 5 VISITS IN 5 WEEKS
===================
If a member visits 5 times in the first 5 weeks of activating their card in restaurant, they receive a $20 reward to be redeemed on the 6th visit. In order for a visit to count towards this reward, the member must purchase a burger, entre, full-sized salad or sandwich. Kid&apos;s Meals, dinner / side salads, appetizers, soups, desserts or beverages on their own do not count as a visit. Because of the high value of this reward, it takes priority over any other reward except those with a limited redemption window (the Registration Reward and Surprise&amp;Delight Rewards). Once this reward is earned, it remains on the member&apos;s card until their 6th visit or the first visit in which the 5 in 5 is the highest ranked reward, whichever comes first. The entire value of the reward must be used during the redemption visit. If the entire $20 is not used, the unused portion will be lost.
BIRTHDAY BURGER
===============
During the month of the member&apos;s birthday, a free burger will be placed on their Red Royalty card. In order to receive the reward, the member must visit during the month of their birthday and order any of Red Robin&apos;s Gourmet Burgers. If the member visits and orders a burger, but also has the Registration Reward available, the Registration Reward will be redeemed first since it is a limited time offer. Since the burger was ordered during the month of the member&apos;s birthday, it will remain on their Red Royalty card and be available for redemption during their next visit. BUY 9 ITEMS, GET THE 10TH ITEM FREE
===================================
Every time a member visits and orders a burger, entre, full-sized salad or sandwich, they receive a credit. Kids&apos; Meals, dinner / side salads, appetizers, soups, desserts or drinks do not count as a credit towards this plan. Once a member has accumulated 9 credits, the 10th burger, entre, full-sized salad or sandwich ordered will be free. If a member uses their card and their order includes 2 burgers and 1 entre, the member will receive 3 credits towards this plan. Once a free item is earned, it remains on the member&apos;s card until it is redeemed. It does not expire. This reward will restart as soon as it is achieved. CHANGES TO THE RR PROGRAM OR REWARDS

Red Robin Rewards - NEW TERMS&amp;CONDITIONS - Please Read BEFORE visiting Restaurant. Pay down credit card debt or add to IRA to save on taxes? 
 Added on : Saturday February 18th 2012 12:19:30 PM Good morning - Just finishing up my taxes and I&apos;m facing a choice and would love advice:1) Use an extra $1500 from a bonus to pay down part of a balance on a 19% credit card -or- 2) Use that same $1500 to contribute to my traditional IRA, which will save me $300 on taxes. After finishing my taxes, I owe $300, but a $1500 contribution reduces that to $0 owed. I haven&apos;t contributed to the IRA this year as I&apos;ve been aggressively paying down debt. Other random bits: I&apos;ve done every FW trick I can think of to move the credit to a lower %, but am stuck with this one so I&apos;m paying it down quickly. Thanks!

 Added on : Friday February 10th 2012 12:27:34 PM MARTY&apos;S SALAD RECIPE
From the Buggy Works Restaurant
Farmington Hills, MI USA
http://www.familybuggy.com/
SPECIAL NOTICE:
The Buggy Works Restaurant has gone out of business as of January 08, 2012 after 44 years and all of the restaurants collectibles&amp;even parts of their walls have been auctioned off. For more information about the closing please go to their website above. I personally met Don Payne owner of Buggy Works and he&apos;s retiring at the age of 70 and is also a Cancer Survivor. THE STORY OF THE MARTY SALAD
============================
The Restaurant oringinally had 6 other salads prior to the Marty Salad, But weren&apos;t selling well. One of the waitresses said her grandmother had a &quot;Old Fashioned Family Receipe&quot; and she shared it with the buggy works owner in which the new salad became an instant hit. The name of the salad was named after the waitress or the grandmother first name.
SWEET AND SOUR SALAD DRESSING:
1 (14 oz.) can Eagle brand sweetened condensed milk
1 cup Karo corn syrup
1/2 c. white vinegar
1 1/2 cup Miracle Whip Salad Dressing
1/4 lb. (1 stick) margarine, sliced into small piecesIn top of double boiler, over simmering water, combine all ingredients with a wire whisk til margarine is melted completely. Let cook over simmering water 30 minutes (set your timer), stirring occasionally. Put mixture through blender on high speed just a few seconds to combine and cool before refrigerating tightly covered. Refrigerate several hours before using. Note: if dressing becomes too thick, thin with a little hot water.(makes 1 1/2 quarts). To use the dressing like the restaurant serves it, toss together lightly in a large bowl: 1/2 head iceberg lettuce torn into bite sized pieces, 2 c. endive lettuce torn also, 1/2 c. very thinly sliced red onion, 1/3 c. Hormel Real Bacon Bits, 1 pck. (4 oz.) Kraft&apos;s finely shredded Cheddar cheese. Apply enough dressing to lightly but evenly moisten the greens in the above mixture. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Divide between 3-4 salad dishes. Serve additional dressing on the side. i-Work 77-776 15-pc T-Handle Ratchet S/D Set $3 at Newegg + FS

 Added on : Tuesday January 31st 2012 06:04:43 PM A friend of mine wet chpt 11 and left his home in another state. The house is under water with a first and second mortgage. (the second really killed it) The house has not been foreclosed yet, its been a while but eventually the bank will get to it. I am wondering if the house is foreclosed and sold in a short sale, isnt it still possible that the bank sumbits to IRS and he will be responsible for the shortage (deficiency) And the same applies if anyone sells the house in a short sale prior to foreclosure. For his credit report since he already went bust does the forecloseure matter one way or another, or a short sale? If he is hit with a big IRS bill (due to short sale vs mortage) that will really hurt him. My leson in all of this is that second mortgages are not always what the borrowers think.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change was a groundbreaker when it was first published in 1990, and it continues to be a business bestseller with more than 15 million copies sold. Stephen Covey, an internationally respected leadership authority, realizes that true success encompasses a balance of personal and professional effectiveness, so this book is a manual for performing better in both arenas. His anecdotes are as frequently from family situations as from business challenges. Before you can adopt the seven habits, you&apos;ll need to accomplish what Covey calls a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;--a change in perception and interpretation of how the world works. Covey takes you through this change, which affects how you perceive and act regarding productivity, time management, positive thinking, developing your &quot;proactive muscles&quot; (acting with initiative rather than reacting), and much more. This isn&apos;t a quick-tips-start-tomorrow kind of book. The concepts are sometimes intricate, and you&apos;ll want to study this book, not skim it. When you finish, you&apos;ll probably have Post-it notes or hand-written annotations in every chapter, and you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;ve taken a powerful seminar by Covey. --Joan Price CEDAR POINT AMUSEMENT PARK Discount Tickets - 2012 Season - Updated weekly

 Best way to buy Apple hardware? 
 Added on : Tuesday January 17th 2012 06:04:35 PM I did a quick search and didn&apos;t see anything obvious, and I saw the thread on automobile purchases, so I thought I&apos;d throw this out there. I have a need to purchase about $2500 worth of Apple hardware (MacBook, Mac Mini, iPad, and some accessory bits) in the next couple months (waiting on a possible hardware refresh for some lines) and was wondering if someone had figured out a good FW way to obtain said equipment. My first thought is to purchase via Amazon.com, and to set the purchase up with GCs purchased using AMEX Blue Cash Preferred (essentially, 6% off) at the local grocery store. I don&apos;t have any Chase cards with Ultimate Rewards, and it&apos;s not currently the department store category quarter, or I would consider going to Kohls for BestBuy GCs (10% off due to 5% in dept. stores (but only up to $1500) and 5% more in Ultimate Rewards, effectively 8.4% if there isn&apos;t a cap on UR), then buying Amazon Kindle GCs and purchasing from Amazon.I can get Apple Educator pricing, but that seems to be about even with the Amazon pricing, and smaller Cash Back options plus sales tax generally make that a less favorable option.

Endorsed by dentists and screaming tweens around the country, each replaceable brush head sports soft DuPont bristles and a plastic sheathing that complements a thick handle graced with Justin Biebers dreamy doe eyes, floppy crop of hair, and incandescent halo. After pressing one of two buttonsone for both morning and evening brushescavity-crushers can enjoy Biebers cherubic croon for 120 seconds, the exact length of time dentists recommend for shining smile bones. Brushers can serenade bathroom-mirror reflections with the echoing sounds of Biebers Baby and U Smile from one brush, or whip out its counterpart to show off hygiene habits and subtly court secret crushes with midday brushes set to the tunes of Love Me and Somebody to Love.

Expires: December 30th, 11:59pm EST Our cash-only experiment 
 Added on : Tuesday December 27th 2011 03:28:32 PM My family went way over budget for the first time ever this year, spending about 75% more than budgeted for non-fixed expenditures. I can&apos;t pinpoint the exact cause, it was likely some combination of my wife stress-spending (her final two semesters of school were particularly difficult), rewards-driven excursions (Groupon, Envaulted, etc.), and too much time spent lurking in the Hot Deals forums. I saw the problem growing, but my attempts to curb the spending just caused more stress and frustration for my family and I backed off figuring I would be better able to address the situation when things settled down after my wife&apos;s graduation (this seems to be the case).The overspending was alarming to me because I&apos;m very proud of my family&apos;s propensity to save (that is not to say that we&apos;re misers, our budget has always been reasonable and allowed us to easily meet our needs as well as afford the &quot;luxuries&quot; we enjoy). While I panic a bit every time I log in to Mint and see that large red bar, taking a step back reveals that we&apos;re still in reasonable shape financially (still debt-free except for the mortgage), though we have not been able to contribute nearly as much as planned to our emergency fund and IRAs.I believe that this period of overspending was short-lived and that we&apos;ll be able to stick to our budget as usual in 2012. We&apos;ll also have fewer expenses and (hopefully) more income now that my wife has her degree (in nursing, which pays well but is highly competitive in our area).Nonetheless, my wife and I had a discussion about it last week and we decided to try going cash-only for a couple of months to see how it will impact our spending habits. As money-conscious as we are, we still think that using cash will help us focus better on the value of purchases. While I&apos;m disappointed to be giving up the credit card Cash Back, I think we&apos;ll actually save more money and avoid cluttering up our house with unnecessary purchases. My goal is to make up a token amount of this year&apos;s overspending and get a hands-on understanding on how payment method affects how we think about our purchases.Our cash experiment starts January 1 (convenient, since our current AARP credit card bonus ends on December 31). I can go into the mechanics of our plan if anyone is interested, but it&apos;s a simple envelope system. We&apos;ll still use the credit cards on occasion (for gas and online purchases, for example), but we&apos;ll move the cash to next month&apos;s envelope.I feel almost like I&apos;m taking a step backwards, but I think it&apos;ll be a good experience regardless of the outcome. .99 cents!

 Added on : Thursday December 22nd 2011 03:49:38 PM LinkI have one pair for dress and one for my running shoes. They feel great and 1/3 the price of Dr. Scholl&apos;s.
Built with 12 springs that cushion and support the foot, these insoles return energy to the body for a &quot;push off&quot; with every stride. Only 1/4&quot; thick, and undetectable until a step is taken, five coils directly under the heel and seven smaller springs under the ball of the foot disperse the impact from walking to help prevent foot and back pain. Honeycomb padding circulates air as you walk to keep the shoe dry and skin healthy. The insoles are covered in bamboo fabric, a naturally anti-microbial fiber that inhibits odors. Men&apos;s sizes S (4-6), M (7-8), or L (9-10); Women&apos;s sizes S (5 1/2-7 1/2), M (8-9 1/2), or L (10-11 1/2). (14 oz.) Ryobi 8-piece Router bit set 1/4&quot; @ HomeDepot BM $5 
 Added on : Wednesday December 21st 2011 03:28:24 PM Found this set at the local HD in Sacramento, CA.
Link to HD siteSite lists at $20.Found at my local store for $5. Not a &quot;yellow tag&quot; item so I had to look at the price and the product twice to even notice it was so cheap.Yes these are cheap bits. No, they won&apos;t cut like a Freud bit. But I needed something cheap to get me started on a small project and will be good for softer wood or when others use my router and table so I won&apos;t care if they burn the bits.At $0.63 a bit, I can&apos;t really complain.Happy wood-working.

Link What if realistic life-finance was taught at public schooling? 
 Added on : Friday December 16th 2011 09:11:14 AM I&apos;ve literally just had my eyes opened by reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad. This post isn&apos;t a book review, but I think I may bring up an original point or two.As I&apos;ve stated before, I&apos;m 21. Only 21. I&apos;ve been out of public school for three years but have pretty much had my living provided for me by the government. In that time I&apos;ve slowly begun learning tidbits of information, mainly from FWF, about financial literacy and how the knowledge of it can improve your life greatly or lack of knowledge can seriously hinder you. I may be undervaluing public education and perhaps I&apos;m biased on this issue, but I really feel like I was cheated.The things I learned, K-12, about money:1. How to balance a checkbook.2. How to write a check.3. Basic accounting, i.e. assets vs. liabilities&amp;income vs. expense spreadsheets.4. Credit cards are bad.
The things I didn&apos;t learn , K-12, about money:1. How to use credit cards for positive cash-flow.2. What credit was. How it is used. How it is determined. When it&apos;s used. 3. What mortgages were.4. The difference between a HELOC and a HEL. How and when to utilize each.5. Anything about home-buying in general, actually.6. Purchasing your first car, what not to do.7. For as much emphasis as there is on secondary education, I learned not a single thing about student loan debt.8. Taxes. WTH? If I&apos;m going to be contributing X% of my income and purchases to them for the rest of my life, shouldn&apos;t I know a few things about them?The list goes on and on..
I really do understand that much intelligence is passed down from parents to children, and there may be some validity to keeping it that way, but I cant see it. I compare it to the way our society treats sex education. The parents hope that the school system will formally educate the child on the subject and the school hopes the parents teach their children on the subject. Nobody really wants to bring it up. I believe that many of you FWFers would pass on some of that savviness to your children in hopes of better and brighter futures. Maybe my own parents just knew so little they didn&apos;t want to be embarrassed by trying to explain why they were in debt. I really don&apos;t think I&apos;m alone in this. I think the majority of the middle-class was brought up this way.So I really am wondering what would happen to the future of Americans if a broad, but thorough class was offered across the board at public schools? What could happen to various and vast investment markets? Sure, plenty of bad decisions would still be made, but would there be a drastic change in the levels of private, commercial, and government debt?...Maybe I should have just made a blog..

 Added on : Friday December 09th 2011 12:36:51 AM Amazon is running a Dewalt sale. On top of that, they&apos;re running a $25 off $100 dewalt holiday promotion. Deal does not apply to 3rd party sellers on Amazon.com. Sale ends 12/24/2011.Amazon Dewalt Holiday PromotionIt&apos;s quite a large selection of applicable items. Cordless power tools, and pretty much all bits, blades, batteries and chargers, and random other stuff.So why is this a pretty good deal? Most single 18v Dewalt XRP tools (without batteries) are priced close to $100. So if you mix and match bare tools and bit kits or blade kits, you can bump yourself to just over the $100 mark.I did some math and it&apos;s cheaper to get the bare tools, kits, and batteries in separate orders if you can get the order into the $100-105 range, rather than buying a combo kit. Especially if you don&apos;t need one of the tools in the combo kits (the flashlight is pretty useless, imo).Main items:
DCD950B 18v Hammerdrill - $93
DC390B 6-1/2-Inch 18-Volt Cordless Circular Saw - $85
DC385B 18-Volt Cordless Reciprocating Saw - $85
DC9096-2 18-Volt XRP 2.4 Amp Hour NiCad Pod-Style Battery, 2 Pack - $101

 Added on : Monday December 05th 2011 04:01:55 AM &quot;Good news Charter customers, you&apos;re getting a speed bump! The DOCSIS 3.0-based cable service is boosting both download and upload speeds across all tiers of its service -- starting at the bottom with its Express package, which will be a 15 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up offering from now on. The &quot;flagship&quot; Plus level is getting its rates almost doubled from 18 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up to 30 Mbps down and 4 Mbps up, offering you plenty of bandwidth for streaming, torrenting and browsing all at the same time. The fastest connection is getting not just a new speed (100 Mbps down), but a new name -- Ultra 100. Sadly, your $60 a month for the big bits doesn&apos;t get you particularly blazing upload speeds. Charter&apos;s tops out at a pretty modest 5 Mbps up.&quot;Article about it on Engadget.comhttp://charter.com/top/internet Kobalt Multi-Drive Wrench 85599 $19.88 Free In Store Pickup - Lowes

 Added on : Saturday November 26th 2011 12:22:11 PM LinkBosch DDS180-02 18-Volt Compact Tough Drill Driver with 2 1.3Ah Batteries at Amazon
Comes up as $151.94, add to cart and with special promo knocks $20 off at checkout. Great drill at a great price! The DDS180-02 is optimized to worke at two speeds--one for high-torque applications (0-500 RPM) and one for high-speed applications (1,700 RPM)--and it provides a maximum of 600 inch-pounds of torque. The 4-pole open-frame motor and newly developed gearbox provide exceptional power for such a compact drill/driver. The 18+1 clutch settings included in this Compact Tough model and a variable-speed trigger help you match the best speed to the job, so you can achieve precise results. It can drive 500 screws per charge using the BAT619G 3.0 Ah HC battery (not included).Balanced Design and Easy Bit Changes
This drill/driver&apos;s Durashield housing is constructed with ABS/nylon composite, which makes the housing flexible on impact. Unlike competitive tools, which use a conventional plastic housing, Durashield will not crack and can easily withstand 10-foot drops.The ergonomically designed handle and soft-grip wrapped housing offer a comfortable fit for extended working time. The DDS180-02 comes complete with a single-sleeve 1/2-inch auto-lock chuck for one-handed bit changes, as well as increased drill-bit capacity for versatility. And for even greater convenience, LEDs provide illumination when you are working in dark or enclosed areas. Flexible Power System
Like all tools in Bosch&apos;s 18-volt line, this drill/driver can be used with either a 1.3 Ah Slim Pack battery (model BAT609), a 2.6-Ah Fat Pack battery (model BAT618), or a 3.0 Ah Fat Pack HC batter (model BAT619G). If you&apos;re looking for a lightweight option, the Slim Pack is the perfect choice. If longer runtime is what you need, the Fat Pack will do the job. ProVantage Guarantee
The DDS180-02 comes with the ProVantage three-year protection plan, which guarantees two years of battery protection and one year of tool protection. Under this plan, you can receive two years of free battery replacements, tool replacement for one year, and a free tool repair package for the second and third years.

What&apos;s in the Box
One Bosch DDS180-02 Compact Tough drill/driver kit with two 18-volt lithium-ion 1.3 Ah Slim Pack batteries, one 30-minute charger, one carrying case, bits, and operating instructions.

DeWalt DW2180 but set for impact driver $9.95 at Andersons 
 Added on : Monday November 21st 2011 12:18:00 PM The Andersons general store has the DeWalt DW2180 bit set for impact drivers on sale through Wednesday 11/23 for $9.95. This goes for $27.97 at Lowes and north of $22 on Amazon. I&apos;ve got a good number of bit sets, but bought this yesterday because it included some some hex head impact drill bits. When I unpacked it, I realized these were not garden variety bits. They are made of very hard steel, easily the toughest I have. It includes a variety of bit varieties and sizes, inc #1-4 Philips, #1-3 square head, #8,6&amp;10 slot, and T-15,20,25&amp;30 torx, 3 hex head percussion drill bits (1/8, 1/4&amp;5/16). It also includes a magnetic drive guide unlike any I&apos;ve encountered. It is very difficult to remove a bit once inserted; I couldn&apos;t using 2 vice grips until I heated the guide. It seems to have an imbeded spring or something; this is to prevent the bit adhering to the screw head which occasionally happens with impact drivers driven hard. If you have an impact driver and and are lucky enough to live near an Andersons, this is a great accessory to have. Or any driver. I&apos;m going to try to score another today to keep at my farm 500 miles away. LG BD630 BlueRay player $67.99 (Network/Netflix/etc)

1-Blow Case Help with properties of elderly, unwell mother 
 Added on : Tuesday November 08th 2011 03:01:36 AM This thread is probably going to be a little long winded, so Ill apologize for that in advance. My friends mother is not mentally well. She is a compulsive hoarder (as in piles to the ceiling, paths through the house, unknown smells, dead rats left floating in toilets, etc.) and he currently lives with her. He is unemployed and 24 years old. He is finishing up his AA in general education at the local community college next month. He was GE because he was planning on transferring to university and getting a Bachelors but due to financial reasons that is going to be difficult. To be blunt, he essentially has no marketable skills and very little job experience. He does have a car, so theres that. Hes been looking for work but it hasnt been going well. He has his own bedroom and bathroom and he cleans them, but she constantly imposes herself into his space and piles her stuff in. She will not allow him into her bedroom, so we aren&apos;t real sure whats going on in there but the smell suggests it isn&apos;t good. Now the complications- His mother owns 4 rather valuable properties in New York state. She lives in one, and has essentially destroyed it with her habits, rents out 2 (these are apparently in decent shape and the income from them is what sustains them, barely, as far as I can tell), and the 4th property was flooded 2 years ago (burst pipes) and she just left it to decay, which it has done. Its a tri-level home-she didnt clean up the water, all utilities were shut off and there is visible mold. It is also filled with a lot of her junk. She has already expressed her intention to leave 2 properties to him and 2 to his brother when she passes. We are essentially trying to brainstorm ideas to get him into the ruined property, get working on renovating it and protect both his and her interests in making it a habitable, rentable place. It is actually a 3 family unit- a duplex with a small apartment in the back, but the duplex was converted to single family (should be fairly easy to convert back since the house probably needs to be nearly gutted anyways). The mother has expressed interest in living in this house, but lacks both the money and wherewithal to even begin repairing it. Im kind of assuming she has just gotten very lucky with the other 2 houses and had tenants who did not destroy the place, which has allowed her to essentially coast by collecting rent checks without putting any work into the houses. He isnt interested in ripping off his mom or taking the property from her, what he wants to do is get into the house, get it repaired, live there away from his mother (if you are familiar with severe hoarders, you probably know it isnt an easy fix problem, and most advice from psychologists is to just keep your distance and try to keep them as safe as possible) and rent out the other 2 units. Sharing the money with her, even giving her all of it, would be ok. We are just looking for advice from anyone who might have been through a similar situation. The property is worth around $750k fixed up and should have rental income from all 3 units of ~$5k/mo, possibly more. Right now it is just rotting and there is no hope of her repairing it, she is elderly and getting progressively worse. Just sitting down and reasoning with her will not work, she is completely irrational and possibly(probably?) suffers from dementia. We arent looking for legal advice, and we dont need to be told we shouldnt act on advice from the internet- we are in the very preliminary stages of trying to right this situation and are just looking for ideas from people who may have been through something similar.

 Added on : Wednesday October 26th 2011 12:01:27 PM I am in the market for a new car, and was planning to trade in my existing car which was financed through Penfed(72 months @ 4.75%). I could go for the new auto loan @ 2.49% for 60 months or the Payment saver loan @ 2.74% for 60 months. After tradein, I am expecting a payment of 565 for the new auto loan or 372 with a final $13,147.40 balloon payment at the end of the term. I am currently paying 465 on my existing car. So if I continue to pay the same amount towards the new car, my balloon payment at the end will be around 7500. The reason I am thinking of the payment saver is because of my buying habits, I have changed 3 cars in the last 4 years, and this loan is better than regular lease because I get to own the car and can trade it in at any point in time, instead of waiting for the lease to run out. Anybody that used this loan care to chip in with their experiences? 74 piece Combo Cordless Drill&amp;Driver $35 Shipped @ saleoftoday

Link for Free Avatar 3D Blu-Ray (Amazon.com link)The link for the coupon for the free Avatar 3D Blu-Ray is from Amazon, but should work with any Panasonic player bought from an authorized dealer.This player rates 4/5 in the Amazon reviews, but the vast majority of the 1/5, 2/5, and 3/5 reviews report one of the following problems: not Netflix compatible (since fixed with 5/11 firmware update), not 3D compatible with Samsung and Mitsubishi DLP HDTV&apos;s, and does not include the wireless internet adaptor (costs around an extra $100). The rest of the reviews report that this player is excellent. So, if you don&apos;t need WiFi compatible without an optional adaptor, this is a heck of a good deal ($106 shipped at Amazon).

 Added on : Sunday October 23rd 2011 03:00:14 AM Hello fellow fw&apos;ers. This is my first post, but I&apos;m a longtime lurker/recent replier.Anyway, like many of you I&apos;m frugal with my hard-earned money. I&apos;m the sole breadwinner in a family of five and due to owning a business do pretty well. The problem that I&apos;m having is that my wife of ten years likes to spend like a drunken Imelda Marcos in a shoe store. Unfortunately, this is how she grew up ended up in bad financial shape in college and expects me to pay for those mistakes which would be okay, but she keeps on making them.I&apos;ve tried many things such as:1) Guilt-ridden speeches about how important saving money is for our family&apos;s future.
2) Doing a family budget with her.
3) Creating a spreadsheet of all the things she&apos;s spent money on (literally $5 - 10K per month) and showing her.
4) Taking all CC&apos;s away from her and only giving her cash.
5) Taken her off of the bank accounts, cc&apos;s, etc. (although her credit is still not great, mine is).I had started to make some headway, by making her plan her shopping trips in advance and her requesting $x before leaving. But now she says she&apos;s going to spend $200 and spends $600. When I try to approach her about it rationally she gets all emotional and starts saying I&apos;m being disrespectful and so forth. It&apos;s getting really, really annoying and putting stress on our marriage. She spends money on all sorts of bullshit and fills our home with junk to the point where it has caused damage. Her lack of planning also makes things much more expensive than they need to be. I swear that she wakes up and thinks how can I do this as expensively as possible. She stops at every rummage sale and can spend hours and hours at a store. We literally have like 500 picture frames... with no pictures in them.I really don&apos;t want my children to learn these behaviors. As a former student of psychology I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s a pathology (for example OCD) but rather a learned behavior that can be supplanted with a more positive one.Do you have any advice for me?

 Added on : Tuesday October 18th 2011 12:00:07 AM Hey All,2011 was a good year for me, but I am expecting 2012 to be less good. I generally stay away from the market, so I don&apos;t have capital gains or losses.Anyways, a friend suggested this strategy:
In 2011, Buy a decent amount of a stock.
Also in 2011, Buy a similar amount of shorts on that stock.Theoretically, one will go up, and the other will go down.
Before 12/31/2011, sell the one that went down. Keep the one that went up (at least into 2012.. if feeling lucky, then keep for over a year into 2012 to get the lower capital gains tax rate.)That should result in being able to deduct the amount the item went down in 2011 up to $3000.. And in 2012, I will pay taxes on what the opposite went up by, but that&apos;s okay since I will be in a lower bracket (and it may be long term gains anyway, if I keep it for a year.. Of course it could go back down, but that&apos;s the risk of gambling.)Is there anything that prohibits this in the law? Is there any flaw to this logic? Is there something better than a stock this can be done with?Thanks in Advance Got first full time job - how do I set up my financial future? 
 Added on : Sunday October 16th 2011 03:00:06 PM A few months ago I started at my first ever full-time job, so this is the first time in my life I&apos;ve ever had any money left over to save.
The bad news is that it took me two years after graduation to find this full time job (which pays a bit less than $40k), and because of it, I lost 2 years of income. I&apos;m starting life very late in the post-college game and have a negative net worth to the tune of about -$20k (my savings minus outstanding student loan debt).Because I&apos;m playing catch up, I live with my parents, which allows me to shave my total living expenses down to a mere $300 a month. So I have about $2k left after taxes that I can do whatever I like with.Currently, my total $2.4k/month after-tax paycheck is divided up like this:
* 5% to a company-matched 401k
* 20% into emergency fund in a high-yield online savings account (though &quot;high yield&quot; is only 1% these days)
* 45% into student loan payments (I want to have this gone in 3 years)
* 13% into day-to-day living expenses (food, clothes, etc)
* 17% of my income left over for ???? .... this is where I&apos;d like you guys to help suggest where to put it!Any suggestions? I turn 25 in a few weeks and feel really behind on my finances compared to my peers and want to get back in the game. If you know of any bits of investment/savings/life advice that make you go &quot;I wish I&apos;d known THAT when I was 25!&quot;, please share them! I think my income is too low, so I also need a game plan for boosting that. I made the mistake of majoring business instead of a science, so I am hoping that enrolling in an MBA program (goal: top 20 school) in 3 years will save me and get me on a real career path. That said, any MBA-related advice would also be appreciated. I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s realistic to expect that an MBA will launch me from my barely-$40k-nobody job to one that pays around double. I plan to have my undergraduate debt FINALLY paid off right as it&apos;s time to enter the MBA program, so this time I want to make sure my investment in school debt is going to pay off BEFORE I go diving in.Thanks in advance! I see a lot of amazing advice on this forum so I hope some of that wisdom will rub off on me. :] Lemur EconoDriver Fuel Efficiency Monitor $24.99 at Sharper Image

Seems to be in Boston Area only. CRA from online purchase habits - mistaken identity problem 
 Added on : Friday September 30th 2011 12:02:49 AM Hello,I really feel this is a Finance issue since CRA topics have been kept here. I need some help on a situation and what I can do about it (if any).Situation:
-Made an online purchase, transaction was denied online saying problem with payment. Checked with card company, transactions are approved and are showing in pending area. No issue there.
-Thought maybe a problem with their credit card gateway. Found a number for a department that does order reviews at merchant. They took awhile, but then admitted that while the card auth was fine, they used another third-party database with demographics (maybe name/address/email/other stuff?) and that database said that the purchaser had a high fraud probability. This might be considered similar to a database of return purchases overuse in retail stores as known.
-Made the purchase using a different email address/new account effectively (but all other info the same), order went through fine. Merchant using database is AdvanceAutoParts.com (was my first time getting such an experience using this specific email address).I am pretty confident that it was a particular email address that triggered it that I used during the rejected times, but it was likely used by someone out there who thought it was a good &apos;fake&apos; email address and did bad things with the merchant who reported it. Not an issue of normal identity theft in this case. If it helps, this particular email address is also banned from PayPal and Facebook (not through any actions of my own), but these actions I have found are not reversible with PayPal nor Facebook (they do not care). They also do not allow anyway to entirely &apos;delete&apos; false accounts. It is because these sites do not (or did not in the past) verify email addresses used for accounts created and allowed these accounts to continue to be used without any good confirmation of the email address used. Many sites still do this unauthenticated email account stuff, but it is a very bad practice.Here are the questions:-Anyone out there know who is running this particular database (merchant would not disclose and said beside the fact you would have to identify which merchant is reporting the negative and get them to remove it anyway)? Companies that have created this sort of collaborative should not be hard to find. It is going to be hard for me to remove the falsely framed email address (if even possible).Obviously, recommended tips would be to use a different email address (using the varient features available from many email providers). Point noted.However, the CRA aspect was interesting. Not surprising, but I wish it was more transparent (translated: could dispute the issue). This is no different than what happens in real life with credit reports/insurance reports/etc.I could not find another thread about online flagging in this type of situation, and maybe the fact I still have an active account on an email address that someone might think is a &apos;fake&apos; is not that often, but interesting nonetheless.Thanks,

9/28 UPDATE: Above deal has expired - the next best price available is for a 20% discount (19.96 per lic coupon code 5MU-NBU-DFR @ http://www.malwarebytes.org. Same great program - lifetime lic/transferable Also available for $19.00 (DVD) @ Amazon.com (price seems to fluctuate) Purchased myself - registered - no problem. Long time user of malwarebytes (free version). Why did I buy it if I can get it free? Free version is great but you have to manually run it. Paid version automatically runs and stops things before they get on your computer. How many of us remember to do things in a timely manner? This program has been a lifesaver for many people. Computers, like cars need preventative maintenance (cheap insurance). I would recommend it to anyone that they download the free version of malwarebytes and run it whether they go for this deal or not. Just my own opinion, please do your own research. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Lifetime License $14.95

Apparently it can be transferred to another computer if you buy a new computer
I made this posting (deal) after doing a little research on bitsdujour myself. Could find no negatives. Purchased myself - registered - no problem. Long time user of malwarebytes (free version). Why did I buy it if I can get it free? Free version is great but you have to manually run it. Paid version automatically runs and stops things before they get on your computer. How many of us remember to do things in a timely manner? This program has been a lifesaver for many people. Computers, like cars need preventative maintenance (cheap insurance). I would recommend it to anyone that they download the free version of malwarebytes and run it whether they go for this deal or not. Just my own opinion, please do your own research.

 Added on : Wednesday September 07th 2011 12:01:17 PM From the Manufacturer
The Skil 2895LI-20 18-volt 4-tool combo kit includes a 1/2-inch drill-driver, a reciprocating saw, a circular saw and a pivot-head flashlight. The 2-speed drill-driver can deliver 0-450 and 0-1,400-RPM with 400 inch/pounds of torque. The 2895LI-20 features a Power plus system, so it&apos;s compatible with both lithium-ion and NiCad batteries. The lithium-ion batteries included in the kit are 50-percent lighter weight, to minimize user fatigue, and can hold a charge 4 times longer than NiCad batteries, so they&apos;re ready whenever you need them.

Returned item, due to malfunction. Seller/Amazon approved return/full purchase amount.
Amazon will only credit my AMEX gift card with $80. Not my bank account or VISA credit card on file for my seller account and purchasing with 1-click.
PROBLEM: AMEX gift card (no name: &quot;A GIFT FOR YOU&quot;) is lost/stolen.
AMEX will not reissue card without full 15 digit number on GC.(which is in Thailand, on the ground, or where ever LAX-BKK**)
Amazon HAS 15 digits on file, but security policies (understandable so)prevent releasing the full card number. -I offered a threeway with AMEX, and Amazon for billing to release the card #.
-Amazon says the $80 will &quot;be there&quot; for me to use on &quot;my next purchase&quot;
....with Amazon.
-On my other past return with Amazon, bought on visa, the purchase amount was refunded to the CC, crediting my statement.Q: Is there a protocol in place for returns on prepaid debits or AMEX gift cards?
Q: This has GOT to have happened. Someone tosses their GC after using it, and then returns something.
Q: How does one use this $80 credit now?
A: wait until there is an Amazon purchase, buy something for the hell of it, or buy something there, shop there, make a point to find a deal there, &quot;its easy, why make this a hard thing. Just use the Amazon credit.&quot;Thanks in advance, it&apos;s an easy answer for someone with the cash to spare.
FW values makes me want freedom of purchase with the credit.
FW self confidence is low- please move this post if inappropriate for this forum - unsure this is proper.
FWer help is much appreciated!

 Added on : Friday August 12th 2011 03:05:55 AM This is an excellent magnetic bit set. We have these at work and everyone who uses one, wants one.
These Magna kits generally run $25 to $35 plus shipping each set.
Reuseum has them for $9.99 each. But I wasn&apos;t able to get shipping cost as their site can&apos;t automatically calculate it.
But if you spend $15 then you get $5 flat shipping, so I bought 2.

1/4 (for use with power tools) (41180) TouchPad tablet by 20% less 
 Added on : Thursday August 11th 2011 12:01:56 PM Hewlett-Packard Co. has dropped the price of its TouchPad tablet by 20% less than two months after it hit stores, as the computer giant tries to boost sales of its answer to Apple Inc.&apos;s iPad.
H-P said the Wi-Fi version of its tablet with 16 gigabytes of storage will now cost $399 and a version with 32 gigabytes will cost $499. Each is now $100 cheaper than comparable iPads.
View Full ImageAssociated Press
The Hewlett Packard TouchPadThe move comes after H-P lowered prices last weekend, saying it was part of a back-to-school promotion. But it has now decided to make the cut permanent.
Stephen DiFranco, a senior vice president in H-P computer business, disclosed the change in an online message, telling customers that the lower price will allow &quot;both HP and our channel partners to be even more price competitive in the marketplace bringing the cheapest model down to $400.&quot;
Analysts have suspected that the lower prices might indicate the TouchPad is struggling to gain traction in the tablet market, which is increasingly crowded but currently dominated by the iPad. An H-P spokeswoman didn&apos;t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Viacom and Cablevision have settled a lawsuit over streaming content over iPads, but the argument over who can provide media to consumers is far from over, WSJ&apos;s Sam Schechner reports. (Photo: AP Photo.)Apple says it is selling every iPad it can manufacture. Chief Executive Steve Jobs claimed his company had &quot;over 90% market share&quot; when he launched the iPad 2.
Other tablets makers such as Motorola Inc. and Research In Motion Ltd. discuss how many units they are shipping, but don&apos;t disclose how many tablets are actually being purchasedor returnedby customers. Samsung Electronics Co., meanwhile, has stopped disclosing unit shipments altogether.
Apple has also used lawsuits to slow the advance of one of its rivals, which have used Google Inc.&apos;s Android software to build rival tablets. Apple claims Samsung copied its iPad. This week, Apple won a court injunction that prohibits Samsung from importing and distributing its Galaxy Tab 10.1 across much of Europe. The decision does not stop retailers from selling existing stock. The Galaxy tablet went on sale in the U.K. on August 4.

Gateway AMD Quad Core Laptop using the new A8 CPU with the 6620G Graphics, 4GB of RAM, 640GB Hard Drive, 17.3&quot; High Resolution (1600 x 900) Display and all the other bits...webcam...mic..Windows 7...etc. The 6620G graphics chip isn&apos;t high end, although pretty capable, Crysis 2 at medium graphics setting will give you 30 fps.Tiger has a $50 off coupon, FFM37171, bringing the list price down to $549, not a huge discount but considering the spec, it appears to be great value for money imho, especially when you throw in a nice high resolution display.Linky Pending legislation: Helping Responsible Homeowners Act of 2011 
 Added on : Tuesday July 19th 2011 09:00:09 PM I have heard a few recent interviews from mortgage industry folks regarding this introduced legislation. It is a very &quot;simple&quot; bill in its writing. A few mortgage blogs have started to re-publicize this legislation that has been sitting around.Most mortgage folks wonder why this has not been done for Fannie and Freddie while it has existed for many years in the FHA side.Here are they keypoints I saw:-Must have a Fannie/Freddie primary first mortgage OOP (cannot be investment)
-Have to be current on payments (although there is something about waiving some late fees in the text)
-NO LTV LIMIT (125% limit would be gone)
-Limit on how high rate could be versus current normal rates (high LTV rates under current HARP are usually pretty bad compared to advertised low rates)
-Setup as a one-year program, but can be extended.
-Requires HEL/HELOC (2nd loan) holders to subordinate for refinance or they can no longer write their own Fannie/Freddie loans (there are a few lenders out there who will not resubordinate in the current HARP/streamline situation which typically requires that the 2nd loan be untouched in the refi)
-Puts some limits on the mortgage refi feesIn general, I have found the current HARP situation bad in two areas:1) Rates are penalized too much due to high LTV
2) Computerized LTV is terrible. You can sometimes do a full appraisal, but that is no guarantee in itself.
3) Having a 2nd loan typically make it much more difficult to get them to consider you for streamline processes in general.I think this legislation really does attack all three of these issues.RasheedText/summary links to legislation: http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-170Official summary of the legislation:
Helping Responsible Homeowners Act - Directs the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs) each to carry out a one-year program providing for the refinancing of qualified single-family housing mortgages it owns through a refinancing mortgage (and for the purchase of and securitization of such refinancing mortgages) in accordance with this Act and the policies and procedures of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Defines a qualified mortgage as one that: (1) is an existing first mortgage for purchase of, or refinancing another first mortgage on, a one- to four-family dwelling, including a condominium or a share in a cooperative ownership housing association, that is occupied by the mortgagor as principal residence; (2) is owned or guaranteed by the particular GSE; and (3) the mortgagor is current on payments due under the mortgage.

Specifies the terms and conditions of a refinancing mortgage, including a 40-year term to maturity and a prohibition on borrower fees. Requires waiver or forgiveness of all fees and penalties related to any default or delinquency on the original mortgage.

Prohibits the GSEs from charging a mortgagee any up-front fee beyond the standard guarantee fee for the refinancing of the qualified mortgage. Makes ineligible for purchase or guarantee by either GSE of any new mortgage originated by a servicer or creditor holding a second lien on a qualified mortgage who refuses to resubordinate that lien, and thereby prevents the refinancing of the qualified mortgage.

Directs the GSEs to require each servicer of a mortgage owned or guaranteed by the GSE to inform each mortgage borrower of the refinancing program authorized and established under this Act.

Einstein&apos;s Refrigerator: And Other Stories from the Flip Side of Historyebook for kindle and other kindle ready devices (PCs, iPhones, Mac, etc.)http://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Refrigerator-Stories-History-ebo...from the description on Amazon:Product Description
Steve Silverman was looking for a way to add some spice to his high school lectures when he realized that weird and bizarre true-life stories would capture his students&apos; attention. In fact, they worked so well that the science teacher then began posting his discoveries to his own Web site, which he dubbed Useless Information. Well-researched and clearly sourced, Silverman&apos;s unusual tidbits have gained a wide following. In Einstein&apos;s Refridgerator, Silverman collects more than 30 of the most fascinating stories he has gathered - tales of forgotten genius, great blunders, and incredible feats of survival, as well as answers to puzzling questions. Einstein&apos;s Refridgerator is a remarkable book with spellbinding stories. Whatever happened to the refrigerator Einstein helped invent? While it never became a commercial success, its underlying concepts became the basis for cooling nuclear breeder reactors.

 Added on : Wednesday May 25th 2011 09:00:43 PM It looks like Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo will join their technology together to make it easier for customers of any of the three banks to send money to each other (or outside) via ACH without knowing account or routing number of their destination.It is primarily just a wrapper on ACH transfers, but potentially with no fees (unless your account has limits on debits/deposits).Clearly identified as a Paypal alternative for person to person specifically (not necessarily person to business), I think this is a great option when people are not trying to use Credit Cards to fund such transactions. Now, I do not know if they will allow &apos;refund&apos; or &apos;cancel&apos; requests. I doubt that will be available initially since it is pitched as a way to transfer money to people you know easily. Chase requires either sender or receiver must be Chase checking customer, but not both.Links:

In order to get into the accelerated program (18 months for a BSN instead of 4 years), I needed to use the other Bachelor&apos;s degree I had obtained from the same private university. That one&apos;s in Graphic Design. I won&apos;t bore you with the details, but I had a change of heart, that why such different fields. Along this 6 year journey, I acquired about $180,000 in student loan debt. The way this happened was the stars aligned and I slipped into every loophole on the planet. 1) When I started school I had very little guidance from my folks and the people at school. FAFSA told me my parents made too much money and their &quot;expected family contribution&quot; was a good chunk of my tuition...sad to say, there&apos;s no box to check for &quot;extremely selfish parents&quot;. I got nothing from them. I was forced to go the Private (read: Signature Loan from Sallie Mae) route. Of course I could have not gone to such an expensive school, but that&apos;s what a more mature me sees, not a younger, dumber me. In addition, I was unable to work during the accelerated program per requirements, and I was required to live off-campus since I was married, which meant I needed to include rent into my loans. Almost all of my loans are private, as said before. So, the interest (which started to get higher and higher as my debt level increased), ended up tacking like $30,000 onto my loans when I finished my first degree. Now, before anyone says anything, I was pretty frugal. My rent was $925/mo. I had no car payments, my wife was working, we didn&apos;t have &quot;toys&quot;, etc. I just got stuck in a bad situation. Here is my current monthly situation:
Student Loans $1500 (minimum)
Rent $925
Insurance $180
Gas $300
AT&amp;T;$45
ComEd $70
T-Mobile $177
Misc. $150
Spending $60
Prescription/Dr. $60
Food/Diapers $400The Misc. is for car repairs, wedding gifts, etc. The spending is $30 for me, and $30 for my wife...per month. We do have two young daughters, but my wife makes all their food, so they don&apos;t cost much at all. I have NO credit card debt, NO car loans, NO bad habits or vices...I sold my Jeep, my dream vehicle, and bought a used Honda Civic to cut down on gas. Please help me. I am already on a special interest-only style payment plan with Sallie Mae for like 3 more years, and I&apos;m not sure I can afford it when it comes back up. I am working full time, and the night shift to get the extra differential. I also have a second job working 2 additional 12 hour shifts (5 total) per week. I&apos;m making like $44/hr at the second job, too, so the pay is good. We had our second daughter in February, and it didn&apos;t make much financial sense to send both our daughters to daycare when it would cost around 50-60% of my wife&apos;s salary. So, she has just started staying home. Guys, I&apos;m doing it right. I went to school, I got a degree (in a field that is 100% devoted to helping people), and I have NOTHING. I can&apos;t even buy a car or a house because these student loans are destroying me. $1500/month? Are you kidding me? Add that to the $925 I pay in rent and I should be able to be living the good life! I fully understand it&apos;s my debt, and I have earned it, but what can I do? Is there no law against charging someone 25% of their salary for loans?Please folks, give me your advice! No one will consolidate this amount of loans, especially private. My parents have since blown through all of their money (although my four younger brothers and sisters have all learned from my mistakes, which is good). I&apos;m just lost, and it&apos;s really starting to effect my attitude (that, and working 5-6 days a week), and that&apos;s effecting my relationship with my wife and kids...and I hate that. Thanks in advance. DanePS - my wife has recently gotten really into couponing as a way to save more money. And I understand I have a decently high phone bill, but that&apos;s the only creature comfort we really have. We&apos;re honestly considering getting rid of our dogs because they cost money to feed... Your Choice: Skil 21pc Ratcheting Screwdriver, Skil 20pc Driver Set $10 Shipped @ 1 Sale

 Added on : Thursday May 12th 2011 12:00:58 AM Over the past year, I have trimmed my budget of many services, items, and bad habits, to save money with the unintended affect of leading a simpler, healthier, improved life. Some things I have done away with are considered necessities by some. Are they to you? What have you gone without to save money? Is there things you do on a daily basis that achieve both goals of living a better/healthier life and saving you some cash?
I hope some readers will try the same techniques and save themselves some money as well!
Here&apos;s some items I have cut from my budget.
1. Cable.
Having been raised on cable/satelite tv, this should&apos;ve been a tough decision but it wasnt. The less you watch tv, the more active you become. You pick up better habits/hobbies. At least I think so. Instead of watching tv we go outside more, exercise more, have more time to read, go on FW, etc. =)2. Cell phone.
I was raised without a cell phone, and humans have lived for thousands of years without cell phones. They are not necessary and cause more stress, IMO. When I was required to have a cell for work, I was under constant stress and had headaches as a result. Also, people are addicted to their smart phones these days and I believe that is highly unhealthy. Finally, the jury is still out on the whole cancer/brain tumor/other health issues related to having the phone pressed against your head.3. Newer/Bigger car and not spending any money on my current car.
I&apos;ve gone against what everyone else around me is doing and kept my 7 year old Toyota instead of buying a newer vehicle. Not only have I kept it, but my car got hit by a drunk driver (while my car was parked). His insurance company paid me and since it was my choice whether to get it fixed or keep the money, I chose the latter. Does my car look nice? Not really. Do I care? Yes, I care that I have another $2k in my account.
Also I don&apos;t worry about my car being dirty, getting a ding in the parking lot, etc. This leads to less stress.
I don&apos;t get regular oil changes. I get it washed once or twice a year. When the car needed new brakes and a new clutch, the mechanic noted &quot;this thing hasn&apos;t had ANY routine maintenance.&quot; the front brakes were 95% worn. Some may say this was not good because I could&apos;ve put my health at risk but I know my way around a car and can tell when the brakes are ready for a change.4. Vacation.
Haven&apos;t taken a vacation in years. Don&apos;t really need to when most vacations are filled with too much travel time, spending money, etc. We take trips to the park with my son instead. Every once in a while a day trip is fun as well. After years of taking big vacations, I&apos;ve learned that they take 2 things from you: cash and energy. I would like to save both.5. New clothing/accesories.
I almost never buy new clothes. I still have sweatshirts from highschool, tshirts from college, and jackets that are over 15 years old. All are in good shape. I throw out anything that is ripped or badly faded. Actually, being ripped is the standard I use for everything, including my socks and boxers (some are over 4 years old!). I do not go shopping for hours because I would much rather spend my time outdoors, with my family, or at a training course, in a classroom, etc. Spending hours going shopping doesn&apos;t make sense to me.6. Big wedding/honeymoon.
I got married in Vegas. The dinner tab was the most expensive part of the wedding and it was picked up by my brother in law. One of the two round trip tickets was paid for by my sister. Not only did I save cash, but we got a lot of exercise, exploring all the nicest parts of Vegas. Total out of pocket expense was $5500 for the wedding/honeymoon, nice engagement ring and wedding band included.7. Insurance.
I have the cheapest auto insurance from Progressive. I pay $230 every 6 months. No renters insurance. The only life insurance I have is a $20/month gym membership that I use often.8. Going out to eat.
Only necessary when family comes in from out of town, when a gift card is involved, or I get it all free (mystery shop). Otherwise, going out to eat is unhealthy (food is never as healthy as home cooking, nor as tasty), and very expensive. Cooking a meal burns a lot more calories vs sitting for 1-2 hours being waited on hand and foot. We go to the in-laws for a dinner once or twice a week, not to eat off them for free but to come together as a family and enjoy food we all know we enjoy.9. Hair cuts or hair styles
I shave my head with a bic razor every few days. I buy a box of 52 from BJs wholesale club for about $15 and it lasts me for well over a year. Shaving cream costs me $2 each can and I use a can every month or two = less than $35 total for a year. I have done my own hair cuts since I was 17 or 18. I used buzzers on myself and my friends as far back as age 11, so I&apos;ve never been a fan of the barber. The wifey is a hair dresser and does her own styles, or has her hairstylist friends do it for free. These are not cheap styles, either.
Barbershops/Hair salons tend to have chemicals/smells in the air that just aren&apos;t healthy.10. Buying seasonal items in-season/before the holiday.
Going shopping for any holiday item before the holiday exposes you to stress. Big crowds, rude people, I refuse to do that. The items also tend to be full price. We only pick up things the day after the holiday for a 50-75% savings. For easter, we bought our ham last-minute, as the timing is Crucial and we saved 25% on a great ham.11. Long commute.
After working for two years at a job 30 miles from my house, which took me 45 minutes each way on normal days and as much as 2.5 hours on snowy days, I decided to quit and seek a new career. I now average 6700 miles per year. Soon I will have a shorter commute, going against traffic. Less time fighting traffic, less time sitting in a car, talk about a healthier lifestyle!12. Buying a house.
I have decided to put off buying a house for many reasons. Prices and rates may decrease, the market isn&apos;t the best right now, take time to save up a bigger down payment, it&apos;s best to wait for the 2nd career to start before jumping into a house, etc. But buying a house that isn&apos;t relatively new will increase stress because of maintenance. The home owners here know this one all too well; cutting, seeding, watering the lawn, tending to the garden, fixing that leaky faucet/toilet, unclogging the drain, or doing bigger jobs, theres always something to do. For now I will live without repairs and rent at a very low $800/month.I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more but that&apos;s the major items I cut from my budget over the last year. $16.99 TP-LINK Wireless Adapter 150Mbps USB IEEE 802.11b/g/n Newegg.com

 Added on : Saturday April 23rd 2011 05:44:09 PM http://www.b2b-trade.net/shops/product/23-Piece-Offset-Ratchet-H...http://www.oceanstatejoblot.com/home/default.aspxRI and MA, may be other locations...?HiI apologize in advance that this is not a nationwide deal nor an internet deal.The links I am providing are images of the set available but in a red case with the brand name OLYMPIA on them.I was shopping around for mini offset ratchet driver that can do screwdriver bits and 1/4 socket sets.After looking around the internet, I found an AVG of 10 dollars shipped which I thought was a bit expensive.I went over to the Ocean State Job Lot and found an awesome Olympia Mini Ratchet Set that was marked down to $3.99 from $5.99.I only visited two locations: Dedham, MA and Norwood, MA. Found ratchet sets at both places.These are definitely a steal at $3.99. There are other sets there as well, straight screwdriver ratchet set, and t handle ratchet set but for $5.99.Similar sets at Home Depot and Lowes run between 10-16 dollars. Paying down my CC debt; looking for advice 
 Added on : Friday April 22nd 2011 10:40:45 PM Hello FW, I&apos;ve been a lurker on and off for some time. I&apos;m not nearly as financially savvy as many of you, but I do read and try to understand what I can to try and get a grasp on how to make the most of my money. Like many others, however, hard times have come upon me (for different reasons, though), so I&apos;m here, asking for some advice as to how to handle this situation.C/N: I have ~$7k in high interest CC debt (30%). What can I do to pay this down more quickly?Details:I&apos;m a 22 year old college student. A degree is still a few years away. My parents have been paying my tuition up to this point, but my younger brother will be enrolling next semester, so I&apos;ll be finding my own way to finance my education, as I don&apos;t feel that it&apos;s fair to them that they need to keep paying while I drag my feet.This debt came to be through a combination of poor spending habits and a slew of personal problems (which I can detail if is needed). I&apos;ve curbed the poor spending by creating a monthly budget and sticking to it. The personal problems are still there, but that&apos;s a different discussion.I have a crap job; I manage a fast-food &apos;restaurant&apos;. $12/hr, as many or as few hours as I like, but I&apos;ve been working ~35/week during school. I grossed about $21k last year. I&apos;ll work what I can during the summer if I don&apos;t take any classes. I&apos;m constantly searching for new employment, particularly in a field related to my degree, but nothing has come through yet. I won&apos;t cry &apos;bad economy&apos;, because there are definitely some employers that weren&apos;t interested in me for their openings. My resume isn&apos;t exactly stellar. Most jobs that I&apos;d qualify for would pay less than my current one, which is why I&apos;ve stayed put.Credit karma says my credit score is a 720. It also says I have $10k in savings, which I don&apos;t. Maybe this is an account my parents have with my name on it; I don&apos;t really know. I have two cards; a Bank of America platinum plus something-or-other ($1k limit, open since 06) and a Citi ThankYou card ($7k limit, open since 07). Like I said, interest is at around 30%, so that&apos;s around $200/month I&apos;m losing just paying interest. My only real expenses are rent ($500/mo for now) and utilities (maybe $200/mo in the summer, up to $500/mo in the winter).I have a car; it&apos;s not worth much, and I&apos;d like to avoid selling it if I can (I&apos;m a gearhead, so cars are worth wasting money on, in some respects). I&apos;ve been contemplating going car-less when it warms up enough to walk, until the fall when it becomes too cold to walk anymore. This will save me some money on registration, insurance, and fuel. It&apos;s only worth about $4k as it sits, and if I sold it I wouldn&apos;t be able to replace it with something similar for anything close to that, which (in my head) is why I&apos;m hesitant to sell it. Again, if we need to go in to more detail here, I&apos;m glad to.I see my options as this:1) Find a CC (or several) with BT offers (anything will be better than what I&apos;m paying now) and pay them down as aggressively as possible. This probably wont cover the full balance, I imagine. Close the accounts when finished?2) See if the credit union will give me a personal loan to reduce the interest rate. I previously had a loan at 10%, so that would help out some.3) Ask Citi if they have any programs for assisting in reducing my interest?4) ???Any and all help, advice, flames, or bashes are appreciated.

 Added on : Thursday April 14th 2011 12:40:05 PM My bank (let&apos;s make up a name for them for the purposes of conversation... oh I don&apos;t know... how about &quot;E*Trade?&quot;) is pretty awesome, but they have a nasty habit of posting incoming credits after posting outgoing debits, which maximizes the risk of overdrafting. With linked savings and brokerage accounts, I try to keep a minimum balance in my checking account, so occasionally I&apos;ve run into this. They unfortunately don&apos;t offer overdraft lines of credit and will return a check unpaid rather than letting one&apos;s account go $0.01 negative, but I digress...It seems to me that this kind of manipulation of numbers to push the consumer towards incurring additional fees may also be pushing the law (state unfair business practices suits may be a good start). I&apos;ve sued about a dozen financial companies a la FDCPA/FCRA/TCPA/others in the last 6 years in small claims, state civil, and federal courts, so I have the experience required to file such a suit. I&apos;m trying to find case law on the subject, and so far all I&apos;ve found was a settlement against 5/3:https://www.overdraftsettlement.com/...which may be a good start, but unfortunately when things are settled, the judges don&apos;t rule on the issue or set precident.It would surprise me if this issue was not in the courts many times over, so perhaps some of you have heard of such a thing?--Jon Skil Tool Set: 21pc Ratcheting, 22pc Precision or 20pc 1/4&quot; Drive Set - Your Choice ($3.99) @ Woot

Yes Oakland gardener questions need for permit to sell produce 
 Added on : Friday April 01st 2011 10:41:18 AM City is asking her to comply with zoning for selling farm grown veggies from a small property lot in the middle of the city. Govt intrusion on a fundamental right/money grab ? She certainly is doing it the fatwallet way. Dumpster diving, gardening, and selling excess.Figured finance is a good a forum area as any other to post it.
Novella Carpenter took over a vacant lot on a hardscrabble corner of West Oakland eight years ago and turned it into a working farm of vegetables, goats, rabbits and, sometimes, pigs.

Carpenter milked goats, made cheese and ate much of the produce. She also wrote a popular book, &quot;Farm City,&quot; about the experience and became an icon of the Bay Area&apos;s urban farming movement.

But the future of her Ghost Town Farm is in question. This week, Oakland officials suggested it may need to close. The reason: She sells excess produce and needs a costly permit to do so.

&quot;It seems ridiculous,&quot; said Carpenter, 38. &quot;I need a conditional use permit to sell chard?&quot;

The news stunned the region&apos;s urban farmers and their supporters, who questioned how a fundamental human task that goes back millennia could become illegal.

&quot;It&apos;s incredibly sad that people can&apos;t grow food and sell it to folks,&quot; said Barbara Finnin, executive director of City Slicker Farms, an Oakland nonprofit that runs produce markets and helps people start their own urban farms.
Profit, not personal use

The city planner who visited Carpenter&apos;s 4,500-square-foot plot at 28th Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way said he sympathized with Carpenter, but the rules are clear.

Carpenter &quot;is raising these things for a profit,&quot; said Chris Candell, a planner in the city&apos;s building department. &quot;If you&apos;re doing this for your own home consumption, this would not be applied.&quot;

Though his report is not final, Candell said Carpenter probably has three options: pay for a conditional use permit, shut down the farm, or not change anything and face sanctions from the city.

The permit would probably cost several thousand dollars, Candell said, and Carpenter also would have to pay penalties for operating without such a license as she is now. Carpenter works about 25 hours per week at the farm and takes in only about $2,500 a year, before expenses.

Candell said a complaint about rabbits on the property led to the city inquiry. Carpenter believes the critic was upset because she was making rabbit potpies available for an $8 donation.

Carpenter taught herself to grow food and raise livestock. She went Dumpster diving in Oakland&apos;s Chinatown to feed her pigs and learned how to butcher from top chefs.

&quot;I really like to feel connected to food and understand the stories of where my food came from,&quot; she said. &quot;When I started, I did it to feed myself. Then I realized that in Oakland, people are really hungry. So people in the neighborhood came and picked food.&quot;

But she realized there were other benefits, too.

&quot;A garden in the middle of a concrete jungle is a nice thing,&quot; she said. &quot;The garden has become a community space. It&apos;s like a place of beauty as well as production. If you pick your lettuce, it just has more vitamins. ... We&apos;re told to go consume and just buy food, but I want to empower myself by growing it.&quot;
Crops in the city

Oakland is considered the center of the urban farming movement, with numerous nonprofits and individual farmers devoted to the cause. Sunset Magazine featured Oakland last year as a &quot;town of the future&quot; because of citizens&apos; passion for the movement. Carpenter&apos;s farm was featured in the article.

But zoning regulations haven&apos;t quite caught up, planners and urban farmers say.

A conditional use permit might make sense for 40-acre farms, Finnin said, but not when the farm occupies one-tenth of an acre and beets sell for $2 a bunch.

Candell agreed that the zoning is outdated. But he said the rules nonetheless have to be followed.

&quot;We&apos;ve had (these rules) for 50 years or so, but we&apos;re stuck with them until they&apos;re changed,&quot; he said.

In San Francisco, where similar conflicts have arisen, Supervisor David Chiu and Mayor Ed Lee introduced legislation this week to allow growing and selling of garden produce in all neighborhoods. In Oakland, zoning officials and nonprofits have been working on new rules, which are to be debated by the City Council this year.
Guerrilla gardener

Carpenter said it has all been a learning experience. After starting out as a &quot;squat farmer,&quot; she bought the plot for $30,000 in December. The previous owner sold it to her as a favor.

&quot;It was so great squatting,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t have costs. I was a total renegade doing something totally illegal, but now that I&apos;m a property owner, that&apos;s when they actually come down on me.

&quot;I can&apos;t fly under the radar and be a punk anymore. I have to actually be an adult and deal with these things.&quot;Read more: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/03/31/MNE8... Cooper Tools Cresecent 128 Piece Tool Set ($54.99 compare at $69.99) @ Newegg

Drawn from the original molds that Frodo Baggins&apos; (Elijah Wood&apos;s) ears were drawn from for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, these prosthetics are as authentic as can be.Hand made here at Weta Workshop by Makeup Supervisor Frances Hawker and her team. Made from latex, they can be blended to look like part of your anatomy for your next costume event or convention.These are Frodo&apos;s ears and are slighty smaller than Sam&apos;s ears. They measure 3.1in (80mm) from the bottom of the earlobe to the &quot;top of the tip&quot;.The distance between where your earlobe meets your cheek and where the top of your ear meets your temple is 1.7in (45mm).See the middle image above for more info on how to measure. If your ears are larger than this, you should get Sam&apos;s Ears instead.As the ears are small and light, you can order up to three pairs for the same shipping cost! And why not combine with a Hobbit Scarf by Stansborough for extra authenticity!

Who the f*#$ is F.W. Murnau?Friedrich Wilhelm &quot;F. W.&quot; Murnau (December 28, 1888 March 11, 1931) was one of the most influential German film directors of the silent era, and a prominent figure in the expressionist movement in German cinema during the 1920s. Although some of Murnau&apos;s films have been lost, most still survive. Murnau DVD Box (6 Films/Discs) (1921-1926) - $47.49 @ Amazon Sour Punch Twists, 4-Flavor Variety Pack, 44.48-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2) - $15.08 @ Amazon

 Added on : Monday March 14th 2011 12:40:06 PM An attorney specializing in elder law recently recommended to myself and my wife that we buy a 1% interest in my mother&apos;s home as joint tenants at fair market value as a way to 1) circumvent the medicaid look back provision in the case she needs medicaid in the future and to 2) assure that her home eventually goes to us who are the ones propviding 99% of her care(I have 1 brother but he stays mostly hands off and most everything is left to my wife and me to do). Mother has less than 50K of assets besides her paid off 300K home. She has long term care insurance but only about 18K of income from social security. I have told my brother what we are planning to do and he is not happy with it.
There are alot of additional factors including my brother milking my father for years to support his spending habits, all the while i have been the good little boy and never taken a penny. I am POA for my widow mother and she is all for this deal which would require our paying the taxes and repair costs of her home and allow her to stay there as long as possible. Mom is living at home and wants to remain there and is in relatively good health. 2 questions:
1. to any attorneysoes this arrangement of buying 1% at fair market value really skirt the look back provision of medicaid? This is NC btw.2. If my brother does not agree to this should i still go forward with it as long as my mother who is competant agrees to it? I have just had another conversation with him and promised to him that my wife and i would move in with mom as well. Thanks for any thoughts on this. Chase credit card autopay drafted a day early 
 Added on : Saturday March 12th 2011 10:40:03 PM I called. They said there was a memo that when payments were due on a weekend or holiday that the debits were going to be made the day before. However, the written terms and conditions clearly say &quot;the due date.&quot; Anyway, they are refunding the overdraft fee, but I&apos;m not positive from my conversation with them if this is a &quot;new&quot; thing or an aberation.Just letting others know in case you&apos;re part of the &quot;just in time&quot; money management crowd. I have three years of Chase autopay data, and up until this month&apos;s autopay the debits occurred on the due date or after regardless of whether it was on a weekend or holiday.

EVGA Geforce GTX 460 768MB PCI-E video card $105 AR @Microcenter 
 Added on : Wednesday March 09th 2011 05:41:46 PM I bought this EVGA and the Galaxy version of the same card about a month ago. The EVGA was $165 and I just noticed it dropped to $140. I went back and got it price-adjusted. EVGA has already received and approved the $35 rebate, which as pretty fast as I mailed it less than 2 weeks ago. Galaxy didn&apos;t even receive my rebate yet, at least it&apos;s not posted in their system (same rebate processor).This might be B&amp;M;only as they don&apos;t show up unless you pick a store location.
EVGA GTX460
Galaxy GTX460Gaming performance wise it was a bit of a downgrade from the ATI 5850 that I swapped out for, but it&apos;s OK I&apos;m not really a gamer. What I was after is GPGPU processing of CUDA. I do a lot of MKV conversion, used ripbot264 for a while. On my i7 920 OC&apos;ed to 3.8GHz, I was barely getting 24fps (1:1, one hour&apos;s worth of video takes one hour). Then I tried DVDFab, which has direct CUDA support. The same movie that went 24fps on ripbot264, it went *90fps* using DVDfab letting CUDA do the encoding (decoding set to CPU). For comparison, without CUDA just letting my CPU doing it all it was doing about 50fps in DVDfab. This is a single-pass conversion. I don&apos;t see any difference doing two passes.I prefer the EVGA card which looks like the reference Nvidia design. The Galaxy looks and feels a bit cheesy. I bought the Galaxy because it was cheaper at the time. I&apos;ve been using ATI cards for the past few years (last Nvidia was a 7900GS). The Nvidia driver seems more stable. This is a great card, and for $105 it&apos;s a great value. It bitstreams all HD soundtracks from Bluray movies, and my favorite feature is that all the outputs carry audio. I have two monitors hooked up to this card, one via HDMI to a 46&quot; TV with an AV receiver for movies and occasional game, the other via DVI to HDMI to a 24&quot; for doing other stuff. I can have sound from either or both if they&apos;re both on. The best part is, I can turn the receiver on/off and put my OS to sleep at will and it will always remember my sound/speaker settings. The ATI was a hit and miss, sometimes I had to fiddle or reboot the OS for it to see my receiver&apos;s 5.1 DTS-HD/TrueHD capability.Another FYI, I have a GTS 450 in my other box (replaced an ATI 5450). As far as doing video transcoding in DVDfab, the performance is *identical* with the GTX 460. It was a bit of a surprise and disappointment. I&apos;m guessing the software is not using all that the 460 offers. Bosch PS30-2A 12-Volt Max 3/8&quot; Drill Driver ($99.00 compare at $130.00) @ Amazon

This Deal Has Expired Preparing for the end of QE II 
 Added on : Saturday March 05th 2011 11:40:18 PM It is always good to be ahead of the market ... the latest commentary from Bill Gross is telling ... Treasuries are going upjust like the last bubble you can pretend that the market is smarter than you and you are helpless ... or you can plan&quot;nearly 70% of the annualized issuance since the beginning of QE II has been purchased by the Fed, with the balance absorbed by those old standbys the Chinese, Japanese and other reserve surplus sovereigns. Basically, the recent game plan is as simple as the Ohio State Buckeyes three yards and a cloud of dust in the 1960s. When applied to the Treasury market it translates to this: The Treasury issues bonds and the Fed buys them. What could be simpler, and whos to worry? This Sammy Scheme as Ive described it in recent Outlooks is as foolproof as Ponzi and Madoff until until well, until it isnt. Because like at the end of a typical chain letter, the legitimate corollary question is Who will buy Treasuries when the Fed doesnt?&quot;BillGrossuse this thread to discuss options for reallocating portfolios in advance of the summer sell-off and the spike in interest rates New Manhattan Toy Puzzibits Prehistoric Predators Set Endless Possibilities with 450 Pieces $15 Shipped @ D/S

Quick Install Guide &quot; Ideas for sock-drawered credit cards 
 Added on : Wednesday February 16th 2011 04:40:05 PM Sorry if this has already been covered. Search revealed nothing consolidated.Like many members of this forum, I have a lot of rarely used credit cards. There tidbits of strategies scattered in different threads but nothing seems to be consolidated. I&apos;d like to hear about other possible uses for dormant or seldom used cards.
The popular FW ideas are:
* Small bill cancellations / credits. This has been discussed in detail already here
* Annual/semi-annual purchases to prevent issuer from closing for dormancy. Preserves overall utilization ratios and increases FICO over time via AAOA.
* On cards that report to CB&apos;s, request a soft pull CLI periodically to reduce overall utilization.
* Convert dormant card to something that is useful. Related topic is to convert AF cards into free cards.
* Wait around for specific issuer promos like ... - Citi: Credit protector deals. There was the gas deal, TYP&apos;s Visa GC&apos;s, etc.
- Chase: Offers weird deals like giving Ultimate Reward points for X number of purchases or spending $X when I don&apos;t buy anything for more than $.99 for a few years. A semi-dormant Continental card qualifies the holder for free miles just for enrolling in promos.
- AMX: Small Business Saturday, Maulmart Christmas-time deal and probably several other offers I can&apos;t remember anymore.
- CapOne: Wait around for no fee purchase checks. From my experience, getting the checks generally requires spending a little bit more than the typical bill cancel amount.
Are there other general, issuer-specific or card-specific strategies employed by FW members? Free Sample of OraMoist, Dry mouth treatment- Also Facebook Contest, Rebate

The great thing about it is once you get the e-mails, you don&apos;t have to worry about a bunch of copy-and-paste with silly codes, because the e-mails have a button in them to automatically apply the credit to your Amazon account (assuming you stay logged in on your browser).To streamline the process, simply create an Amazon Gift Card filter folder in your e-mail account, then when you buy the 10 gift cards, open up the first one, click Add to Account, click next e-mail, click Add to Account, click next e-mail, rinse and repeat &apos;til you&apos;ve added all 10.I&apos;m venturing to guess there are very few people here who don&apos;t spend at least $120 on Amazon annually, so this is an efficient way to quickly fulfill your Rewards Checking qualifications every month while not needlessly spending on stuff you don&apos;t want. If someone knows how to automate it so Amazon debits your account 10x each month on its own, please share, but bookmarking that page and spending 5 minutes a month making 10 purchases isn&apos;t the worst thing in the world I guess.Sorry if this has been discovered already or if I&apos;m putting this in the wrong spot; this is my first post here. Hope someone finds this useful. Personal Quest: Taking the FWF Plunge 
 Added on : Monday January 31st 2011 01:40:03 AM I have been a longtime (mostly) lurker, and I love reading FW Finance. I&apos;ve learned so much about general finances, attitudes towards money, and ways to maximize deals - but I know there is still so much more to learn. Having been raised to eschew debt and avoid credit as a sign of someone who is not able to handle their spending habits, it is certainly uplifting to see how instead these can actually be leveraged to benefit rather than hold back, if used properly.Until now, my time here time has been spent watching and learning. Today I hope to jump in and use some of the things I&apos;ve learned. I hope this thread will do 3 things:
be a concrete example to other &quot;watchers&quot; (opposed to &quot;do-ers&quot;) of how, in one year, significant money really CAN be gained by following FWF general philosophy, particular advice, and specific money-making/saving ideasencourage me to regularly think in ways of identifying and maximizing money-making/saving deals, every day and every placeintroduce self-accountability as I work toward my 2011 goal
After some thought, I am setting the following goal: by the end of 2011 &quot;find&quot; an extra $5,000. All proceeds will be put towards paying down a small-to-modest sized debt. For those interested, I am already putting away retirement and FSA money, so after much thought I believe this is the next best use for an extra $5K. I&apos;ve also put some restrictions on myself, to make things more interesting:
all funds must be FW tactic-related to count towards the $5K goal (salary raises, gifts, etc. do not count)FW ideas to reduce current expenses can count towards the $5K goal, but only to a maximum of $1,000 (eating ramen every night does not count, but a FW-inspired way to cut recurring expenses does)the remaining $4K must be new income &quot;found&quot; from FW-relevant tactics
I&apos;ve added a bonus &quot;Reach Goal&quot; of further reducing annual expenses by another $1K in any way possible (FW-inspired or not).
My personal situation involves an adequate emergency fund, the ability to save a portion of my income (income greater than expenses), a stable job, a small amount of free time, and a very short credit history (got the 2% Schwab card right at the end, which has been my daily driver since). I have put some thought into general strategy, but not hours. Right now I expect the following to take me at least half of the way:
milk CC and various account sign-ups for all they are worth (sign-up bonus cash / miles or points to transfer to cash, or to use in lieu of buying airline tickets)transfer all non-essential funds into a rewards checking account (looking for something local, at 4% or better)general aversion (time vs effort/stress) to things like item reselling or churning dollar coins, but may attempt this if unable to accomplish goals otherwise
I have some other ideas, such as approaching the landlord to pre-pay rent for the year at a discount (at a rate better than I can otherwise make), and some ideas involving maximizing my FSA account, but those still need thinking/work. I plan to update this thread every time I reach a milestone of 20% of the way (cash in hand). Feedback welcome, but here I go = ) Yoplait.com Million Yogurt Cup Giveaway - Coupon

 Added on : Friday January 28th 2011 02:40:46 PM Panasonic is clearing their &quot;old&quot; micro 4/3rd DSLR model DMC-GH1 for the new DMC-GH2.Right now they have a combo &quot;special&quot;: DMC-GH1K body + Lumix G Vario 14-42mm lens for $499 on Panasonic.com. If you are an EPP member, you get additional $125 off, for the total of $375 + tax&amp;free ground shipping.DMC-GH1 is a fabulous DSLR. Only about 6mo ago it was selling (and it still does at some stores) for $999+ (albeit with a 140mm lens, which is when I bought one). It has one of the best video recording capabilities of all DSLRs. DMC-GH1 could be hacked (with a modified firmware) to increase video recording bitrate to ~40Mbs, giving one ability to take amazing 1080p footage with continuous focus. Sadly, most of GH1s shipped after June 2010 have this hack disabled, as per this.So if you care about a good DSLR with amazing video, this is the one for you. (Note: new GH2 has a larger sensor, 16MP, and a couple of new tidbits. In my opinion, GH1 is just as good if not better with its 12MP. But you can also order GH2 body at Panasonic for $675, with EPP discount. That camera is on backorder.)Update: for some folks the combo is showing at $350+tax on EPP. My EPP price is still $375+tax.

I was a little reluctant to do this at first as we&apos;re saving for a house, but word is that house prices will continue to drop...Does it make any sense to contribute more to our 401k/403b?

$34 on Amazon How to deal with unfrugal parents? 
 Added on : Wednesday January 19th 2011 04:40:09 PM Sorry for the novel...How I ended up the way I am, I have no idea... I grew up with parents (that even thought they did not spend beyond their means) ended up spending most everything they made. If they had not sold their business when they retired, they would have had no savings other than the house. Often eating out well and expensive cars every 2-3 years. My siblings adopted these habits to the extreme outspending my parents.I am frugal, but (at least in my opinion) not to any extreme. I like eating out every so often, only buy new cars (but they are not luxury and I drive them forever), and buy stuff I like (after finding a coupon or deal for them of course).I&apos;ve been constantly nagged about being too frugal from my parents: keeping my clothes too long, not getting a nicer car, and when we eat out they want to eat at a nice restaurant. In fact, when I got married, I accommodated them by having 2 receptions (one small one for my friends/family and a traditional one for my parents 400 &quot;closest&quot; friends) since it was a once in a lifetime thing.My most recent problem is with my son&apos;s 1st birthday (this is our second child). I wanted to have it at our house instead having a banquet like we did for our first child. That first banquet cost me a few thousand, but because my culture gives cash for gifts, we made about 50%-75% back which I put in my son&apos;s bank account. My parents offered to pay for the 2nd son banquet, but I don&apos;t want them to since they don&apos;t necessarily have much money themselves (in my 30s I probably am worth more than they are. They are retired and if they run out of money, I&apos;m going to have to give them money. In addition, I don&apos;t want to have a banquet because I would like to make it a social event where people can socialize and kids can play and I&apos;m not just treating tables of 10 to dinner. As a compromise I said I would have it catered, but they are still mad about it and are saying they will not attend my son&apos;s birthday. They will have their own birthday party that will be a banquet.So the question is: how would some of you deal with parents that want to make you spend or how you would deal with this situation specifically?Some details that may help:
I am 1st generation asian (others with a similar background might be able to relate). I would value feedback from those folks the most though any other serious suggestions would be helpful.
My parents provide childcare for me and I pay them about 10% below what I would end up paying if I had hired someone else.
I am just about to start a business this year that will cost me about the last 10 years of my savings. This has made me a bit more cognizant of money. Not to mention I have a 2 children worth of expenses.
To be fair and to give a bit of their perspective of things, my parents say our relatives are very generous and I am ripping them off of a dinner, however, my perspective is that they know that it is a catered house party and they can adjust their gifts accordingly if they&apos;d like. Also, they say they will have to do too much work for a house party, but I am getting it catered and having it buffet style.

 Added on : Wednesday January 05th 2011 03:40:04 PM The summary:We hired a photographer to do photos of our newborn. She had a nice portfolio, was generally nice to work with, etc. After two weeks, she sent us proofs of the pictures, and of the 25 proofs, only 2-3 were what I&apos;d call usable pictures (the others had issues with shadows, washed-out color, etc.), and none of the proofs were of a specific pose we&apos;d requested. We ordered copies of the 2-3 decent pictures, then informed the photographer that we weren&apos;t happy with some of the other pictures and asked if she&apos;d re-shoot the pose we wanted. She sent us all of our money back (for the original session plus the pics we&apos;d ordered), and refuses to respond to our calls or emails. Any ideas on what we can do? We just want the pictures we ordered, and our newborn is now too old to be posing for newborn photos with another photographer. I look forward to the requisite bitching, &quot;cool story, bro&quot;, &quot;killer blog post&quot;, and stray bits of useful advice.

Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) at last get married in the season benchmark, &quot;Niagara,&quot; an Emmy-nominated episode (director Paul Feig was robbed!) brimming with hilarious and richly satisfying mental camera &quot;click&quot; moments to treasure. Kathy Bates and Zach Woods are welcome additions to the company as, respectively, Joanna Bennett, the formidable and no-nonsense CEO of Sabre, which purchases the struggling Dunder Mifflin, and Gabe, her intimidated right-hand man. Darryl (Craig Robinson) gets a well-deserved promotion upstairs, Andy (an Emmy-worthy Ed Helms) and Erin (the charming Ellie Kemper) fill the will-they-or-won&apos;t-they void left by Jim and Pam with their sweet and awkward courtship that is rife with drama, and Michael is oddly pleased to learn that (spoiler alert) his new girlfriend is married. Not everything works this season. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) hatches a diabolical plan to sabotage the newly promoted Jim, but it goes nowhere, as do his nonsensical negotiations with Angela (Angela Kinsey) to conceive a child. And a clip episode (&quot;The Banker&quot;) seems like slacking off. But there is no reprimanding the ensemble for its total investment in their characters, whom Joanna rightly calls &quot;some of the loveliest people I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.&quot; Each episode has giddy grace notes (the camera catches Creed moved to tears by an opera aria in &quot;The Lover&quot;) and priceless bits of comic business (Pam turns Borsht Belt comedian in &quot;Body Language,&quot; Joanna gives budding author Toby unsolicited advice on his novel in progress in &quot;Whistleblower&quot;). And for the first time, the season-ending cliffhanger does not involve Jim and Pam, but the series&apos; second most beloved couple. There are two disappointing omissions from this five-disc set. The Halloween-themed cold open has been excised from the episode &quot;Koi Pond,&quot; and the viral sensation Subtle Sexuality webisodes, including the &quot;Male Prima Donna&quot; music video, are not included among the bonus features. --Donald Liebenson

With the various size buds, this should be somewhat noise reducing. It has a short cord, so if you keep your player in a shirt pocket, or on your arm, you don&apos;t have a six foot cord flopping around; use the extension if you need longer.

 Added on : Tuesday November 30th 2010 04:40:22 AM LINK
This appears to be a phenomenal deal for someone looking for a dedicated Internet webserver to host their websites, Internet application, or off-site backups. Through today only, they are running a 15th anniversary promotion of 50% to 70% off of dedicated servers, most running from $38/mo to $100/mo. A dedicated server is your own hardware, not shared by anyone else. Prices shown on their site are with a 12-month prepay option and no startup fee. A 6-month pay option is available, but incurs a startup fee and a slightly higher monthly cost.What makes this deal great is the 10,000 GB/month (10 TB monthly) allowance, which is a big deal for a media-rich website or popular game server. For your Internet website/application to consume 10TB in one month, you would need to use about 32 megabits per second, 24 hours per day for an entire month. If your server has a 10 Mbps uplink port, it will be impossible to exceed your 10,000GB/mo limit.After signup, you are locked in to the server rate, so the rates will not go up for your server. Adding upgrades in the future will cost the same price they are available for today, but your server itself will be locked in to the rate&amp;payment term you signed up for.For help choosing a server, CPU performance scores at cpubenchmark.net show the servers they offer have these benchmark scores (higher=faster):
Dual Xeon 2.8GHz: 921
Dual Xeon 3.06GHz: 886
Core 2 Duo E6600: 1,503
Dual Xeon 5130: 2,645
Xeon X3220: 3,098
Core i7 860: 5,553
While just a ballpark of actual real-world performance, it does show that a Xeon X3220 server can process data about 2x better than the Core 2 Duo E6600 server. Complex websites and game servers will benefit from a faster CPU. Slower CPUs are fine as backup servers, personal data storage servers, and blog websites.Other web hosting companies provide dedicated (private) servers with this much bandwidth allowance for $100 to $1000 per month.

 Added on : Sunday November 28th 2010 05:40:07 PM Sam&apos;s Club free in-store wifi will aid comparison shopping
Sam&apos;s Club is so confident they won&apos;t be undersold this Christmas season that they&apos;re introducing free in-store wifi to allow customers who have smartphones or other web-enabled devices to comparison shop their prices on the spot. The warehouse club chain has long been slagging behind competitors like Costco and BJs when it comes to sales. This latest move is a decisive sign that they&apos;re looking to reclaim lost ground. According to The Wall Street Journal, the free wifi will also help Sam&apos;s Club compete with Best Buy on the electronics front during Christmas. Both retailers are set to go head-to-head on the sale of Internet-connected TVs. In related news, Sam&apos;s Club has re-upped its commitment to offer Plus members private deals based on their individual buying habits. There&apos;s a creepout factor here because Sam&apos;s Club is tracking its members purchases, but the flip side is that you might get some great savings. Black Decker 129-Piece Kit $14.97 @ Lowes

 Added on : Thursday November 25th 2010 08:40:03 PM Disclaimer: long, detailed read - hoping to get some quantifiable advice and would really appreciate some help!Alright guys/gals, it&apos;s starting to get chilly, the tax credit is expiring, and my furnace is acting up ... which is motivating me to replace my water heater and furnace for new models. I&apos;ve done some homework but I need some recommendations on next steps. Any HVAC people in here? Some bits of info on my current situation:1) I bought a condo over a year ago which has a 25 year old gas furnace and gas water heater, both located in the basement and roughly 6ft from the outside. Piping is galvanized steel. Both are near end of life, efficiency is probably pretty bad, furnace is starting to act up and the cost to run a gas water heater during non-winter months is quite expensive.2) I have (estimated) 1200sq ft of livable area and maybe 1400 or so total area if you include bathrooms and closets, over 2 floors + basement. Definitely not over 1500.3) I&apos;m in the Tristate area (OH/KY/IN) so I fall right on the line of the Zone 1&amp;2 crossover: http://www.rheem.com/Products/tank_water_heaters/Hybrid_electric...4) I can&apos;t figure out the model of my current furnace. The only number that was on the label was 518bxx018000maaa and it&apos;s made by Bryant, but Google doesn&apos;t return anything.5) Over the past year I have used:
-Gas: 501 CCF (42 AVG)
-Electric: 7612 kWh (634 AVG)6) My current rates are:
-Gas:Fixed Delivery Service Charge: $ 25.33
Usage-Based Charge: $ 0.03272800 per
Gas Delivery Riders: $8.65
Gas Cost Recovery: $ 0.58539110 per-Electric:Distribution-Customer Chg: $ 5.50
Delivery Charges
Distribution-Energy Chg: $ 0.02212600 per
Delivery Riders: $ 5.51
Generation Charges
Generation Energy Chg $ 0.04234500 per
Rider FPP: $ 19.30
Rider AAC: $ 4.04
Rider TCR: $ 2.86Here you can see why I want to move to an electric or hybrid water heater: I&apos;m paying around $34/month just to have gas active and I&apos;m only using it regularly for 3-4 months. If that leaves me with 8 months of no gas usage, that&apos;s a savings of $270/year right there. While some of this might be eaten up by a higher cost of water heating via electricity, shouldn&apos;t the extra efficiency of current heaters (25 years later) make up for this difference, thereby actually giving me a savings of $270/year or so on water heating alone?7) I spoke with 1 guy so far on the phone who said it was probably a 115,000 BTU model, but maybe 78% or so efficient at the start, and possibly no more than 50% efficient now. It&apos;s probably not that big though. I played around with a calculator (http://www.duke-energy.com/ohio/savings/heating-system-calculato...) and came up with this:Savings: Annual Dollars $170-$280
Lifetime Dollars $3,300-$5,500
kWh 90-150 kWh/yr
Natural Gas (Therms) 130-220 CCF/yr
CO2 1,700-2,800 lbs/yrCost: System Type Forced Air Furnace
Estimated Size 16,900-28,100 BTU
Estimated Replacement Cost $1,700-$2,800
Estimated Annual Energy Cost $400-$700Not sure how to read into this though, and it still doesn&apos;t help me determine what model I need. I&apos;m a little confused looking at this.8) I have ok insulation. All windows are double pane, no areas with noticeable drafts, and a moderate amount of fiberglass in the attic. Condo has units on either side as well with a noise wall in-between, so heat probably doesn&apos;t escape much through the sides. Newer windows would help I&apos;m sure, but don&apos;t know if it&apos;s worth the cost at this point.9) Pics:Furnace&amp;water heater:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/56337873@N02/5207325181/The only tag on the furnace, failed attempt to identify model:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/56337873@N02/5207325119/-----------So, here are my questions:1) How do I figure out how efficient/inefficient my current model is? I need this to come up with a good figure for how much I&apos;d be saving with a new furnace.2) When upgrading furnaces, any gas furnace over 90% Thermal Efficiency/AFUE will qualify for the tax credit, but does it make sense to go for something above 90%? 93%? 95%? 97%? Is the extra cost worth it? (http://www.ahrinet.org/Content/FederalTaxCredits_896.aspx)3) Are the extra features worth the extra cost (single vs. dual stage firing, also single vs. multi vs. variable speed fans)?4) Do the brands matter much? I read it&apos;s not a big deal either way, but the general ones are: American Standard, Bryant, Carrier, Lennox, Rheem, Trane, Goodman.5) It seems to be a bit difficult to do online comparison shopping (or comparison shopping in general) for these things. So far I have found this: http://www.shop.thefurnaceoutlet.com/Gas-Furnaces-95-Efficient-U...
So I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s somewhere in the $1000-1200 range for a 90,000BTU or so 95% multi/variable speed unit, if that&apos;s in fact what I need.6) I hear installation costs vary wildly ... how wildly? How much did you pay for yours? How much am I looking at for extra work (the guy I spoke too said I&apos;d need a new breaker box for the electric water heater and some new PVC piping).7) How long of a warranty is necessary on any of these? Do these warranties have service call charges (like a deductible) or is it no muss no fuss free replacement?8) Since straight up electric water heaters don&apos;t qualify for the tax credit, does getting a hybrid one (electric + heat pump) make sense? It&apos;s a lot more expensive, but you get a discount and supposedly it&apos;s a lot more efficient: http://www.lowes.com/pd_79425-83-GEH50DNSRSA_0__?storeId=10151&amp;N...;Are the savings really that major? Because standard electric heaters are 1/3 the price, and a little less than 1/2 the price when you factor in the rebate. I can also get another $200 rebate just for the furnace through my utility company and up to $400 if I get the hybrid water heater as well (https://www.duke-energy.com/ohio/savings/smart-saver.asp) but it&apos;s still expensive.9) How do I go about comparison shopping? It seems there are a hundred or so HVAC people/companies within a 50 mile radius of me and do I really need to call 20-30 of em?10) I&apos;ll probably stay at this condo for another 2 years at least, maybe as much as 3-4, but I don&apos;t plan to be here too long. I don&apos;t know how life is going to go so it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess, but will replacing these units with new ones increase the value of my condo? That is, will I be able to get a &quot;refund&quot; on some of this investment via selling the condo at a higher price? (if I decide to sell that is, might rent out).11) Is there a way to get a close estimate of how much I would be saving per year with a new gas furnace and new electric water heater?--------If you managed to read this far, thanks! Hopefully this all makes sense. I&apos;ll be happy to provide more info as needed. At this point it&apos;s a little overwhelming and not as simple to do comparison shopping as say through Newegg (where really you just check # of customer reviews and overall score % to find the best items). The clock is ticking so I don&apos;t want to wait too long, but at the same time I want to make an educated purchase decision since this costs a fair chunk of $$.Appreciate any heads up!

 My retirement mess followup... more pics? 
 Added on : Tuesday November 16th 2010 05:40:05 PM Old postSo thought I&apos;d check back in to see if anyone has any opinions as we end 2010My 403(b) to TSP conversion got a bit screwed up since TIAA-CREF said I first had to convert to a rollover IRA before I could transfer... TSP said they were wrong, but oh well. I ended up converting a chunk of the 403(b) to a Roth, and the rest is now in a tIRA with TIAA-CREF. I&apos;m considering either sending that to TSP, or converting that to a Roth too.Currently I have
TSP $31000
$25,000 (Lifecycle 2040)
$6,000 (G Fund)Roth #1 $280009000 (VTI)
5500 (VEU)
4000 (EEM - will probably move this to VWO)
4000 (STHBX - Short term high yield bonds)
2500 (JAGIX - Janus Growth and Income)
2000 (VWO)
600 (IBM)
Roth #2 $5500 (I&apos;ll xfer this to Roth #1 next year if it is up in value, if not, undo the conversion, currently it&apos;s up just a bit)3000 (TRIRX LargeCap Growth Index)
2300 (TRBIX Small-Cap Blend Index)tIRA $10000
6100 (TIQRX Equity Index)
4000 (TRRSX Real Estate Security Fund)
I also have $6800 in a regular brokerage account and about $35,000 in cash (most in high yield checking at 4%), which will be a house downpayment at some point. With a federal job, I think my need for an emergency fund isn&apos;t that vital (have plenty of credit), even if they do furlough us or shut us down.
Sooooo......Do I take advantage of stuffing the tIRA into another Roth before 2011 to take advantage of the deferred tax payments, or do I just put it in the TSP. I&apos;m a bit torn because I really don&apos;t want to work forever and like the idea of being able to withdraw Roth principle penalty free at some point, maybe while I wait of a pension to kick in... but I also could find some pretty fun uses with an extra $3000 next April. My plan was to just do the conversion and hope for really big rally, and if not, reconvert it and send it to my TSP. I feel a little bit better now that I see an eventual home for everything. I plan on selling some of the random bits in my roth #1 (JAGIX is the first thing I ever bought, and I think I just now broke even). Then divy it up between VTI, VEU, VWO, and then maybe some sort of bonds or real estate fund. Everyone keeps saying how great the G fund is in my TSP, but I realize that isn&apos;t so evident in an up market. Any idears? Am I missing anything? Craftsman 54 pc.

RoHS Compliant Seeking advice to resolve sibling&apos;s debt 
 Added on : Wednesday November 10th 2010 11:40:03 PM Hi everyone,I been a long time lurker of this forum and have learned much about personal finance but I am seeking advice to my plan to solve my sister&apos;s credit card debt. The family just discovered that she has $30,000.00 in credit card debt; this was a result of poor vision on our part.
Here are the facts:- 26 years old, single
- Works 20 hours a week as a teller
- No college education, aspiring personal banker (40k salary)
- Rents in-law for $600.00 a month
- No car payments (belongs to parents)
- Owns a cute dog
- 632 credit score (CreditKarma)
- Two credit cards with balances (20k+10k=30k)
- Missed 5 payments on one card and 3 on the other card
- 18 credit card accounts, 9 closed and 9 open
- High spending habits
Here is my plan of action:- Move back home to eliminate the $600.00 monthly rent.
- Sell cute dog (I categorize this &quot;asset&quot; as a recurring cost over time.)
- Increase work hours to 50 hours a week from 20 hours a week. Direct her to obtain a full time salary job as a personal banker with the bank she currently works. While she waits, she can work another job to use her time wisely.
- Open a few new credit cards for a few 0% APR balance transfers to save on interest.
- Create and enforce weekly spending budgets.
- Monitor her spending via online accounts.
Questions:
1. She has been contacted by FIA Card Services to help resolve her debt. - Offered a 5 year plan to pay off the debt.
- Details include only charging a 1.7% interest rate (odd) on the $30,000.00 balance.
- My parents will have to co-sign and state that if she does not pay it off completely in 5 years then it will become my parent&apos;s responsibility.
- Monthly payments are only $600.00.Any advice on this company? After a quick Google search, it is a subsidiary of Bank of America. 2. We all hear and see debt consolidation companies, would these companies be a good idea to turn to?
Thank you in advance for the recommendations. Please let me know if I am missing anything that can help my sister resolve her debt. Natural Nibits ~ for doggies

FYI-I have been doing these &quot;type&quot; rebates for the past 15 years. Sometimes the rebate terms are easy to understand and specific and sometimes they are vague and confusing. When I list a form, I try to describe it as accurate as the wording on the form as possible. I&apos;m often asked; Is this form good in my state? What does the terms here mean? Etc. I am sorry, but on some forms I can&apos;t interrupt the rebate companies meaning any better than you can. For example; The Korbel form below (and others like it). There is &quot;NO start date&quot; on the form. What exactly does that mean? Another is the Redhook and Widmer forms below (also Kona forms). These forms list the BPR states but DO NOT list the NBPR states. Does this mean that if you live in a NBPR state you would be able to do these rebates? Again, I really can&apos;t answear these questions. I can only describe the rebate requirements as printed on the forms. Maybe call the rebate company for the correct answear? What if when calling the CSR really can&apos;t answear your question either or just gives you mis-information? I have found this to be the case MANY times in the past!!! The point is, that if you do these type rebates long enough you WILL be denied rebates. Some for legimate reasons and some not. I just chalk it up to experience and feel &quot;nothing ventured, nothing gained&quot;!Another &quot;problem form&quot; is the Pabst Market Basket form. It seems most are being denied anything more than a $15 rebate. The exact wording on the back of the form is;
Terms and conditions. 1. Send originals only, no copies. 2. Include rebate certificate with dated cash register receipt(s) with qualifying purchases circled. 3. Insure all requested information is filled accurately, legibly and completely. 4. Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of rebate check. Offer good only for residents of FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT who are of legal drinking age. Void where prohibited. Fraudelent submissions could result in prosecution under US mail fraud statues. 5. Maxium of three (3) rebates per individual, family or street address. 6. Offer not available to employees of Pabst or its affiliated companies, agencies, licensed beverage wholesalers or retailers, or members of their immediate families or households. PBR201040 Pabst Blue Ribbon, PO Box 739, Milwaukee, WI 53201.IMO I feel this is NOT a vague or confusing form at all and I have sent three $15 rebates for myself. If I am denied I will be lodging complaints to the proper authorities (States Attorneys Office). Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t! It&apos;s all part of the game!!! 9-18 Pabst UP TO $15 MIR (20% off) your total market basket purchase, excluding tobacco. NBPR and valid in FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT. MAXIMUM OF 3 REBATES PER INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY OR STREET ADDRESS. Purchase between 12-1-09 and 12-31-10. Send this form (no copies) and dated cash register &quot;RECEIPT(S)&quot;.

FYI-I have been doing these &quot;type&quot; rebates for the past 15 years. Sometimes the rebate terms are easy to understand and specific and sometimes they are vague and confusing. When I list a form, I try to describe it as accurate as the wording on the form as possible. I&apos;m often asked; Is this form good in my state? What does the terms here mean? Etc. I am sorry, but on some forms I can&apos;t interrupt the rebate companies meaning any better than you can. For example; The Korbel form below (and others like it). There is &quot;NO start date&quot; on the form. What exactly does that mean? Another is the Redhook and Widmer forms below (also Kona forms). These forms list the BPR states but DO NOT list the NBPR states. Does this mean that if you live in a NBPR state you would be able to do these rebates? Again, I really can&apos;t answear these questions. I can only describe the rebate requirements as printed on the forms. Maybe call the rebate company for the correct answear? What if when calling the CSR really can&apos;t answear your question either or just gives you mis-information? I have found this to be the case MANY times in the past!!! The point is, that if you do these type rebates long enough you WILL be denied rebates. Some for legimate reasons and some not. I just chalk it up to experience and feel &quot;nothing ventured, nothing gained&quot;!Another &quot;problem form&quot; is the Pabst Market Basket form. It seems most are being denied anything more than a $15 rebate. The exact wording on the back of the form is;
Terms and conditions. 1. Send originals only, no copies. 2. Include rebate certificate with dated cash register receipt(s) with qualifying purchases circled. 3. Insure all requested information is filled accurately, legibly and completely. 4. Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of rebate check. Offer good only for residents of FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT who are of legal drinking age. Void where prohibited. Fraudelent submissions could result in prosecution under US mail fraud statues. 5. Maxium of three (3) rebates per individual, family or street address. 6. Offer not available to employees of Pabst or its affiliated companies, agencies, licensed beverage wholesalers or retailers, or members of their immediate families or households. PBR201040 Pabst Blue Ribbon, PO Box 739, Milwaukee, WI 53201.IMO I feel this is NOT a vague or confusing form at all and I have sent three $15 rebates for myself. If I am denied I will be lodging complaints to the proper authorities (States Attorneys Office). Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t! It&apos;s all part of the game!!! 9-18 Pabst UP TO $15 MIR (20% off) your total market basket purchase, excluding tobacco. NBPR and valid in FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT. MAXIMUM OF 3 REBATES PER INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY OR STREET ADDRESS. Purchase between 12-1-09 and 12-31-10. Send this form (no copies) and dated cash register &quot;RECEIPT(S)&quot;.

 Added on : Thursday October 28th 2010 11:40:17 PM It seems a lot of people like these and Big Lots has a refurb&apos;d Dremel version for half retail price.LINK HEREYes, you can probably get one from Harbor Freight cheaper, but people have indicated that the Dremel is better and is variable speed. I don&apos;t own one, so check around if you&apos;re not sure.Ad begins Sunday October 31rst.I pulled some reviews off a previous post:BabyFace said:I used mine the other day to cut off the ends of dry wall anchors that i could neither push in or pull out.. I can&apos;t think of another type of tool to give such a flush cut. The refurb kit (i got mine from woot.com) won&apos;t come with all the accessories such as grouting bits but you can always easily purchase the attachments. Great tool. No worries on cutting your hand or anything of that sort too because it just oscillates back and forth (unless you specifically force the blade into your hand and let it oscillate there, in which case, you are already beyond hope). Dremel is a brand that I already own and trust and between HF and Dremel, even if its a few dollars more, the choice was obvious for me.

Drew2Money said:Good tool. I really like mine. Has saved me a lot of time repairing window sill bases.

augustheat said:I own the HF one and have used the Dremel and the Dremel is more ergonomic and worked slightly better.

FYI-I have been doing these &quot;type&quot; rebates for the past 15 years. Sometimes the rebate terms are easy to understand and specific and sometimes they are vague and confusing. When I list a form, I try to describe it as accurate as the wording on the form as possible. I&apos;m often asked; Is this form good in my state? What does the terms here mean? Etc. I am sorry, but on some forms I can&apos;t interrupt the rebate companies meaning any better than you can. For example; The Korbel form below (and others like it). There is &quot;NO start date&quot; on the form. What exactly does that mean? Another is the Redhook and Widmer forms below (also Kona forms). These forms list the BPR states but DO NOT list the NBPR states. Does this mean that if you live in a NBPR state you would be able to do these rebates? Again, I really can&apos;t answear these questions. I can only describe the rebate requirements as printed on the forms. Maybe call the rebate company for the correct answear? What if when calling the CSR really can&apos;t answear your question either or just gives you mis-information? I have found this to be the case MANY times in the past!!! The point is, that if you do these type rebates long enough you WILL be denied rebates. Some for legimate reasons and some not. I just chalk it up to experience and feel &quot;nothing ventured, nothing gained&quot;!Another &quot;problem form&quot; is the Pabst Market Basket form. It seems most are being denied anything more than a $15 rebate. The exact wording on the back of the form is;
Terms and conditions. 1. Send originals only, no copies. 2. Include rebate certificate with dated cash register receipt(s) with qualifying purchases circled. 3. Insure all requested information is filled accurately, legibly and completely. 4. Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of rebate check. Offer good only for residents of FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT who are of legal drinking age. Void where prohibited. Fraudelent submissions could result in prosecution under US mail fraud statues. 5. Maxium of three (3) rebates per individual, family or street address. 6. Offer not available to employees of Pabst or its affiliated companies, agencies, licensed beverage wholesalers or retailers, or members of their immediate families or households. PBR201040 Pabst Blue Ribbon, PO Box 739, Milwaukee, WI 53201.IMO I feel this is NOT a vague or confusing form at all and I have sent three $15 rebates for myself. If I am denied I will be lodging complaints to the proper authorities (States Attorneys Office). Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t! It&apos;s all part of the game!!! 9-18 Pabst UP TO $15 MIR (20% off) your total market basket purchase, excluding tobacco. NBPR and valid in FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT. MAXIMUM OF 3 REBATES PER INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY OR STREET ADDRESS. Purchase between 12-1-09 and 12-31-10. Send this form (no copies) and dated cash register &quot;RECEIPT(S)&quot;.

FYI-I have been doing these &quot;type&quot; rebates for the past 15 years. Sometimes the rebate terms are easy to understand and specific and sometimes they are vague and confusing. When I list a form, I try to describe it as accurate as the wording on the form as possible. I&apos;m often asked; Is this form good in my state? What does the terms here mean? Etc. I am sorry, but on some forms I can&apos;t interrupt the rebate companies meaning any better than you can. For example; The Korbel form below (and others like it). There is &quot;NO start date&quot; on the form. What exactly does that mean? Another is the Redhook and Widmer forms below (also Kona forms). These forms list the BPR states but DO NOT list the NBPR states. Does this mean that if you live in a NBPR state you would be able to do these rebates? Again, I really can&apos;t answear these questions. I can only describe the rebate requirements as printed on the forms. Maybe call the rebate company for the correct answear? What if when calling the CSR really can&apos;t answear your question either or just gives you mis-information? I have found this to be the case MANY times in the past!!! The point is, that if you do these type rebates long enough you WILL be denied rebates. Some for legimate reasons and some not. I just chalk it up to experience and feel &quot;nothing ventured, nothing gained&quot;!Another &quot;problem form&quot; is the Pabst Market Basket form. It seems most are being denied anything more than a $15 rebate. The exact wording on the back of the form is;
Terms and conditions. 1. Send originals only, no copies. 2. Include rebate certificate with dated cash register receipt(s) with qualifying purchases circled. 3. Insure all requested information is filled accurately, legibly and completely. 4. Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of rebate check. Offer good only for residents of FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT who are of legal drinking age. Void where prohibited. Fraudelent submissions could result in prosecution under US mail fraud statues. 5. Maxium of three (3) rebates per individual, family or street address. 6. Offer not available to employees of Pabst or its affiliated companies, agencies, licensed beverage wholesalers or retailers, or members of their immediate families or households. PBR201040 Pabst Blue Ribbon, PO Box 739, Milwaukee, WI 53201.IMO I feel this is NOT a vague or confusing form at all and I have sent three $15 rebates for myself. If I am denied I will be lodging complaints to the proper authorities (States Attorneys Office). Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t! It&apos;s all part of the game!!! 9-18 Pabst UP TO $15 MIR (20% off) your total market basket purchase, excluding tobacco. NBPR and valid in FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT.

FYI-I have been doing these &quot;type&quot; rebates for the past 15 years. Sometimes the rebate terms are easy to understand and specific and sometimes they are vague and confusing. When I list a form, I try to describe it as accurate as the wording on the form as possible. I&apos;m often asked; Is this form good in my state? What does the terms here mean? Etc. I am sorry, but on some forms I can&apos;t interrupt the rebate companies meaning any better than you can. For example; The Korbel form below (and others like it). There is &quot;NO start date&quot; on the form. What exactly does that mean? Another is the Redhook and Widmer forms below (also Kona forms). These forms list the BPR states but DO NOT list the NBPR states. Does this mean that if you live in a NBPR state you would be able to do these rebates? Again, I really can&apos;t answear these questions. I can only describe the rebate requirements as printed on the forms. Maybe call the rebate company for the correct answear? What if when calling the CSR really can&apos;t answear your question either or just gives you mis-information? I have found this to be the case MANY times in the past!!! The point is, that if you do these type rebates long enough you WILL be denied rebates. Some for legimate reasons and some not. I just chalk it up to experience and feel &quot;nothing ventured, nothing gained&quot;!Another &quot;problem form&quot; is the Pabst Market Basket form. It seems most are being denied anything more than a $15 rebate. The exact wording on the back of the form is;
Terms and conditions. 1. Send originals only, no copies. 2. Include rebate certificate with dated cash register receipt(s) with qualifying purchases circled. 3. Insure all requested information is filled accurately, legibly and completely. 4. Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of rebate check. Offer good only for residents of FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT who are of legal drinking age. Void where prohibited. Fraudelent submissions could result in prosecution under US mail fraud statues. 5. Maxium of three (3) rebates per individual, family or street address. 6. Offer not available to employees of Pabst or its affiliated companies, agencies, licensed beverage wholesalers or retailers, or members of their immediate families or households. PBR201040 Pabst Blue Ribbon, PO Box 739, Milwaukee, WI 53201.IMO I feel this is NOT a vague or confusing form at all and I have sent three $15 rebates for myself. If I am denied I will be lodging complaints to the proper authorities (States Attorneys Office). Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t! It&apos;s all part of the game!!! 9-18 Pabst UP TO $15 MIR (20% off) your total market basket purchase, excluding tobacco. NBPR and valid in FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT. MAXIMUM OF 3 REBATES PER INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY OR STREET ADDRESS. Purchase between 12-1-09 and 12-31-10. Send this form (no copies) and dated cash register &quot;RECEIPT(S)&quot;.

FYI-I have been doing these &quot;type&quot; rebates for the past 15 years. Sometimes the rebate terms are easy to understand and specific and sometimes they are vague and confusing. When I list a form, I try to describe it as accurate as the wording on the form as possible. I&apos;m often asked; Is this form good in my state? What does the terms here mean? Etc. I am sorry, but on some forms I can&apos;t interrupt the rebate companies meaning any better than you can. For example; The Korbel form below (and others like it). There is &quot;NO start date&quot; on the form. What exactly does that mean? Another is the Redhook and Widmer forms below (also Kona forms). These forms list the BPR states but DO NOT list the NBPR states. Does this mean that if you live in a NBPR state you would be able to do these rebates? Again, I really can&apos;t answear these questions. I can only describe the rebate requirements as printed on the forms. Maybe call the rebate company for the correct answear? What if when calling the CSR really can&apos;t answear your question either or just gives you mis-information? I have found this to be the case MANY times in the past!!! The point is, that if you do these type rebates long enough you WILL be denied rebates. Some for legimate reasons and some not. I just chalk it up to experience and feel &quot;nothing ventured, nothing gained&quot;!Another &quot;problem form&quot; is the Pabst Market Basket form. It seems most are being denied anything more than a $15 rebate. The exact wording on the back of the form is;
Terms and conditions. 1. Send originals only, no copies. 2. Include rebate certificate with dated cash register receipt(s) with qualifying purchases circled. 3. Insure all requested information is filled accurately, legibly and completely. 4. Allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of rebate check. Offer good only for residents of FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT who are of legal drinking age. Void where prohibited. Fraudelent submissions could result in prosecution under US mail fraud statues. 5. Maxium of three (3) rebates per individual, family or street address. 6. Offer not available to employees of Pabst or its affiliated companies, agencies, licensed beverage wholesalers or retailers, or members of their immediate families or households. PBR201040 Pabst Blue Ribbon, PO Box 739, Milwaukee, WI 53201.IMO I feel this is NOT a vague or confusing form at all and I have sent three $15 rebates for myself. If I am denied I will be lodging complaints to the proper authorities (States Attorneys Office). Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t! It&apos;s all part of the game!!! 9-18 Pabst UP TO $15 MIR (20% off) your total market basket purchase, excluding tobacco. NBPR and valid in FL, GA, ME, NC, NH, SC, TN, VA and VT. MAXIMUM OF 3 REBATES PER INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY OR STREET ADDRESS. Purchase between 12-1-09 and 12-31-10. Send this form (no copies) and dated cash register &quot;RECEIPT(S)&quot;.

Independently certified to meet applicable standards Norton Online Family (completely free for now) parental control software 
 Added on : Friday October 08th 2010 08:40:14 AM I&apos;ve been asked by a lot of parents lately what parental control software I recommend. Without a doubt - Norton Online Family. The parental controls are amazing, and the software is very intuitive. No software will lock out the bad stuff 100%, but Norton has done a good job making it easy for parents to watch their kids&apos; online habits.I have nephews that have no boundaries. When I gave them their computer, I put this software on it, and any time they do something questionable, I call and let them know I&apos;m watching. Over time, the questionable behavior has stopped. I did this after I caught one 8-year-old nephew searching for &quot;girls gone wild.&quot; Additionally, I can temporarily disable their accounts whenever they do something wrong.Rumors suggest that Norton will likely integrate this software with their Norton product line soon, so now&apos;s the time to sign up (while it&apos;s free). No amount of software can compare to a parent who is actively monitoring their child online, but this software helps whenever you can&apos;t be there. Sanyo Digital MP3 Voice Recorder - $33.99 FS - w/ Expandable SD Card Slot - ICR-FP600D- 
 Added on : Monday October 04th 2010 05:40:12 PM The Sanyo ICR-FP600D digital voice recorder is an excellent choice for business professionals, college students, reporters, conference attendees, and music enthusiasts; providing uncompromising audio recording quality in a sleek, compact design. For work, for school, or for play, it combines important functionality in an easy-to-carry, user-friendly design. It offers MP3 recording and virtually unlimited recording time using removable SD memory cards (SD memory card not included).
High Quality MP3 Recording FormatThe SANYO ICR-FP600D delivers amazing recordings in MP3 format (up to 192k bits per second encoding) with built-in microphone, or when using an external stereo microphone or line input. This convenient, easy-to-use, universal file format makes sharing audio files a breeze there is no special conversion software required. Simply record, download, and attach via e-mail its that easy!Up to 544 Hours of Recording (with optional 8GB SDHC card)
The ICR-FP600D is a high-end digital voice recorder which can be used in numerous settings and environments. Users may choose to purchase high capacity memory cards up to 8GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Cards which provide up to 544 hours of recording time (in LP recording mode). To put this in perspective, a typical college student would be able to record every lecture, from every class, onto one SD card for an entire semester!29 Hour Battery Life (AAA alkaline battery)
With core expertise in the development of energy-efficient electronics design, SANYO provides an industry-leading 29 hours of battery life using a single AAA alkaline battery; a clear advantage to the user when recording key meetings, conferences and other events.Built-in Microphone and External Stereo Microphone Input
The ICR-FP600D has been designed to deliver uncompromising audio recordings at an affordable price. The built-in microphone provides clear, pristine recording of the audio source along with other elements in the recorded space (i.e., natural reverberation, etc). When using an external stereo recording, the user may gain a truer sense of the relative positioning and distance of each sound source to one another.Playback Speed Control + 200% - 50% (MP3 files)
A powerful feature included in the ICR-FP600D is the ability to adjust playback speeds from -50% to +200% speed. This allows users to adjust the playback speed up or down, making it easier to understand and transcribe voice files. Repeat playback mode can be assigned to either a single file, to all files in a single folder, or between two preset points in a single file.Voice Activated System (VAS) Technology
Sanyos Voice Activated System (VAS) technology automatically starts recording when the unit senses sound levels which are above a minimum, user-adjustable, threshold level. The unit will pause a recording when the voice level falls below the minimum, user-adjustable, threshold level. This allows the ICR-FP600D to be set to VAS mode and have audible sounded automatically recorded. It also makes it much easier to assure that periods of silence will not be recorded and that storage space is not wasted.The unit can also be set to AUTO when a recording is made using external equipment. In this mode and while recording, if there is period of silence which lasts two seconds or more, the recording will stop and a file is written to the SD memory card. Then, when a sound is produced once again, it will restart recording as a new, separate file. This allows the user to create separate files based on contiguous sound.Preset Equalizers (EQ)
The ICR-FP600D features a useful set of built-in equalizers (EQs) which allow the user to tailor the sound of the music or other audio content to match to the listeners tastes. These sophisticated built-in EQs include BASS (low tones emphasized), POP (low tones and high tones emphasized slightly), ROCK (low tones and high tones greatly emphasized), JAZZ (mid tones emphasized), OFF (Normal EQ). These options give the user more precise control of the tonal balance of the recorded content during playback.Recording from External Sources
In addition to recording audio using its built-in microphone or external stereo microphone, the ICR-FP600D also allows the user to record to its LINE input from external sound equipment such as CD players, portable players and component stereos. Timer Recording Features
Recording can be started automatically at a designated time. Timer recording allows the unit to enter a standby recording mode until the timer will allow automatic recording to begin.Easy File Management
Managing audio files has never been easier. With folders conveniently named MIC, LINE, MUSIC and DATA, it is easy to locate recorded files based on the recording method used. The MIC and LINE folders can support up to 199 files each. The MUSIC folder is used for transferring MP3 audio or song files from a PC files, making the ICR-FP600D a powerful, portable music player. Up to 500 storage folders can be created with each holding up to 199 files eachREMEMBER - YOU SUPPLY THE MEMORY VIA SD CARDS up to 8 GB - NO BUILT-IN MEMORY (Buy.com offers another Sanyo recorder with 1 GB built-in memory at $29.95)Link Cavalry CAUG25500W 500 GB Hard Drive ($49.99 was $69.99) @ Buy.com

Linkaroo eBay Sellers and Tax Changes New Form 1099-K will debut for 2011 tax year 
 Added on : Monday September 20th 2010 02:40:03 PM eBay Sellers and Tax Changes New Form 1099-K will debut for 2011 tax yearTax time is upon us again, and this year the IRS has a bit of a warning for eBay sellers: next year you&apos;ll be on the hook for the taxes you owe.
Most United States eBay sellers have long known that income generated by eBay sales and PayPal payments is taxable. If you didn&apos;t know this, you should. Conventional wisdom has long held (and the federal government believes), however, that many eBay sellers underreport their online income, assuming that it is either non-taxable or largely under the radar.Enter the 2011 Form 1099-K
Though sellers won&apos;t have to change their filing habits in 2010, a new Form 1099-K for 2011 promises to change income reporting by online sellers. The draft Form 1099-K for 2011 implements payments reporting to the IRS for PayPal and credit card merchants, much as already happens with forms W-2 or 1099-MISC for employees and independent contractors.Starting in 2011, therefore, sellers will be expected to report gross payments via online or credit card payments that coincide with reported 1099-K amounts, then to make adjustments to account for expenses and cash equivalents, fees, chargebacks, refunds, and so on.What&apos;s Reportable
Gross receipts through electronic payment processors (whether purely online like PayPal or involving credit card numbers) received by users of such payment processors. You may be subject to reporting even if you don&apos;t think of yourself as a business, provided you receive payments online via PayPal (or any other similar service or merchant account).
Details and Caveats
As a practical matter, if you&apos;re an eBay seller, this will effect you unless your gross sales are under $20,000 for the year or you receive fewer than 200 transactions. Reporting for small sellers at this level is not required.
Otherwise, if you exceed this volume, you&apos;ll be required to provide tax identification information (SSN or EIN number, for example) to payment processors like PayPal and will be expected by the IRS to account in your return for the amounts reported on your 1099-K form(s).What about 2010?
The 1099-K form wasn&apos;t introduced for the 2010 tax year, so as you do your taxes this year, enjoy the last year you&apos;ll report eBay income as a purely voluntary matter.
