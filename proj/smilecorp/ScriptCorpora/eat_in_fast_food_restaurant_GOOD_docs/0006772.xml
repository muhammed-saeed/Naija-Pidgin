 Who Uses Holy Tea? 
 Watch the Holy Tea online movie and listen to the personal messages from Dr. Miller and his grateful users. 
 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea - formulated by Dr. Bill Miller (Ph.D. Nutritional Science) of Tennessee, USA - is a unique herbal blend of safe, all-natural ingredients designed to gently cleanse the digestive tract and detoxify the whole body. Holy Tea is like a white tea, a green tea, a weight loss tea, and a great-tasting herbal tea - all wrapped up in each unbleached tea bag.

But, most of all, Holy Tea is a healing tea . Remarkable things happen when you drink Holy Tea every day. It is gentle, yet surprisingly powerful as a colon cleanse, parasite cleanse, Candida cleanse, blood purifier, and whole body detoxifier. It acts like a general health tonic and a home remedy for many ailments like the ones mentioned below.

You probably won&apos;t need any more laxatives, stool softeners, high-fiber potions, antacids, allergy pills, acne creams and many other potions and lotions after you start drinking Holy Tea.

The name&quot;Holy Tea&quot;is taken from the traditional name of one of the ingredients, a widely-used medicinal herb known as Holy Thistle ( Silybum marianum ) or Blessed Milk Thistle, and is not intended to imply any religious significance - although grateful users who experienced remarkable health improvements after taking Holy Tea often thank God for this gift of healing!

Some want to call it a &quot;miracle tea&quot;, but this cleansing and slimming tea is really just a special blend of high-quality herbs, tested and refined over time, which produce fast and effective results that no imitator has been able to copy.

 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea may also be used as an element in any Weight Loss Program and is much more effective than Chinese Tea, Green Tea, Wu Long or Oolong Tea, Wu Yi Tea, or South African Red Rooibos Tea. The Persimmon leaves in Holy Tea contain a compound that binds to fat and helps eliminate fat from the body. Other herbal ingredients help the liver burn fat more efficiently.

Just drinking Holy Tea regularly often results in a reduction in the amount of stored fat in the body, and a significant reduction in the size of the abdomen or belly. For some people, the weight loss has been achieved quickly and rather dramatically (see the Testimonials below), but individual results will vary. If you are already thin, don&apos;t worry! Holy Tea will not cause you to lose weight you don&apos;t need to lose.

 When the excess weight is actually from pounds of impacted fecal matter stuck to the inside wall of the colon and small intestine, no amount of dieting or fat loss or exercise can reduce the size of the belly.   But Holy Tea can! 
If you have bloat, midriff bulge, a &quot;beer belly&quot;, a &quot;pot belly&quot;, or a protruding abdomen, then drinking Holy Tea can help you shed pounds and lose inches around your waist, without dieting or changing your eating habits. (See Bulging Bellies below.)

 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea is a safe, mild, all-natural, digestion stimulant and detoxifying health tea. It has a dual action:
(1) As a colon cleanse it is gentle yet more effective than most bowel cleaners, laxatives, and stool softeners.
(2) It&apos;s also a very good-tasting whole-body detoxifier which is simple to use - you just drink 8 ounces of Holy Tea twice per day with meals!

No restrictive detox diet or fasting, no diet pills, no complicated procedures, and no harsh laxatives or cathartics. Just drink your Holy Tea every day. You don&apos;t even have to drink it with meals, but doing so could help provide heartburn relief and a remedy for acid reflux.

Basically, Holy Tea helps your body rid itself of just about anthing that doesn&apos;t belong in there! It helps you get back to the optimum health you were built to enjoy, and the fuller, happier life that goes with it.
 Holy Tea LOOKS like any other herbal tea, but don&apos;t be fooled. Just two of those Holy Tea bags make ONE GALLON or about 16 litres of Holy Tea - an 8-DAY supply! And this is a HEALING TEA. Most people feel positive effects within a week, and often within a day or two!

 Here&apos;s what some users have said about Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea benefits... 

 &quot;I have been on Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea for 12 years, both my husband and I. I had Crohn&apos;s Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome and terrible acid reflux. I won&apos;t miss a day without drinking my tea. I used to have terrible knife-like sharp pains in my stomach from the Crohn&apos;s and IBS, and a great deal of discomfort from the acid reflux. Dr. Miller&apos;s tea has cleared all of this up, and I lost almost 30 pounds as well. My husband lost more weight than I did. I swear by the tea and would not be without it.&quot;
 - Ruth and Billy Hurt, Cedar Grove, TN 

 &quot;Since I began taking Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea I no longer need to take Nexium, and my Acid Reflux is totally cleared up. I dropped from 240 to 185 lbs., and even though I smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day the doctor said he could not believe how clear my lungs are, as if I did not smoke. The Tea is the best health product I have ever taken!&quot;
 - William Griffen, Jackson, TN 

 &quot;Not only did the Tea make me look years younger, I feel years younger too, and have more energy than ever. I tell everyone this is a &apos;must have&apos; product.&quot;
 - Sally May, Jackson, TN (she lost 60+ pounds) 

 &quot;As a member of the medical community, I was quite familiar with the causes, symptoms, and treatments available for Crohn&apos;s. I became much more knowledgeable in this regard as I became a victim of this so-called incurable disorder. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind as to the effectiveness and medical principals behind Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea. I have experienced personally the pain and discomfort that results from Crohn&apos;s and I have also done exhaustive research into the possible treatments and cures. Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea is the only viable solution I am aware of for treating and clearing up this dreaded disease.&quot;
 - Dr. Dennis Read, Jackson, TN 
 

When taking Holy Tea the objective is to regulate your bowel movements to two or three each day in order to keep the toxic waste flowing and not sitting in your digestive system for long. Delaying the passing of this toxic fecal matter may lead to numerous health conditions caused by auto-intoxification  (i.e. absorbing toxins, self-poisoning) and clogging the walls of the intestines and colon with hardened waste from rancid saturated fats, decaying vegetable matter and rotting meat - and all the bad bacteria, fungus, yeast, and parasite organisms which feed on it (some of which excrete their own poisons).

 Cleaning out this fecal matter and intestinal parasites can help reverse many of the conditions listed above, which are often symptoms of auto-intoxification and/or parasite infestation - and can lead to shrinking a bloated belly and shedding excess pounds. 

What would happen if the plumbing pipes in your home had their internal diameter narrowed by a build-up of mineral deposits, finally got clogged up, and then the toilet waste started to back up into your kitchen sink where you washed your food? 

 Something similar is happening in your digestive tract when the food you ingest is not moved quickly enough through your digestive tract. Ideally, our food should pass through the mouth, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (i.e. the colon), rectum, and out through the anus in about 11 to 15 hours, but in North Americans today it is taking 26 hours or more.

 In some chronically constipated people, it is taking up to 70 hours - almost 3 days! That provides a lot of time for toxins to be absorbed into the bloodstream from the decaying fecal matter in the small intestine and colon.

The main function of your colon is to absorb water and electrolytes (like sodium, calcium, and magnesium) from the waste which remains after digesting food, and then pass it directly into your bloodstream. You don&apos;t want your colon to be absorbing toxins and sending them through your bloodstream to all the organs in your body!

Is it just a coincidence that the incidence of gastrointestinal tract diseases and cancer has also increased dramatically since the time when grandparents of the baby boomer generation were eating only healthy, unprocessed foods and unpasteurized dairy products from the farm - and digesting their food and eliminating the waste in about 15 hours?

When your eating habits are not healthy, your colon health will deteriorate and begin to cause more and more health problems that could have been avoided.

It may have been so long since you were eating healthy foods and having regular and normal bowel movements that you may have begun to think that your present bowel habits are &quot;normal&quot;. Here is a list of conditions that actually are normal. If your bowel movements are not like this, then you may be constipated and/or have an unhealthy colon.

 What Is A Normal Bowel Movement? 

 If you eat three meals a day, you should have three bowel movements per day. If you eat two meals a day, you should have two bowel movements per day.

 The bowel movement should start naturally, without any straining or pushing.

 A normal bowel movement occurs rather quickly, taking no more than about five minutes. Having books in the bathroom is a clue that it&apos;s been taking way too long.

 In a normal bowel movement, the stool should have a diameter which is half the width of your wrists. It should not be so large it is hard to pass or causes pain or bleeding of the rectum or hemorrhoids. It should not be long and stringy, or pencil-thin. It should not be composed of small and hard balls.

 The stool should be about the same consistency (density or &quot;thickness&quot;) as regular toothpaste squeezed from a tube. It should not be soft and watery. It should not be hard and compacted, nor cause the toilet to become plugged up.

 The stool should be a medium brown colour and should not contain dark material from old feces (or black material which may indicate bleeding in the upper GI tract or stomach). But it may be slightly colored from certain kinds of foods you recently ate, such as grapes or beets or very dark green vegetables. It should not be yellow or maroon (like burgundy wine) or gray.

 The stool should not have a foul smell if it is entirely composed of the waste from food which was consumed less than 24 hours ago.

 If you pass gas it should not have a foul smell. Smelly farts may indicate that old, decaying fecal matter is stuck to the walls of your intestines.

 The stool should float in the toilet water if everything in it is the waste material from food that has been properly digested. Stool that has become too compacted, hard and dense due to constipation will usually sink. (Note that unhealthy stool that contains too much unabsorbed carbohydrates and the gasses which are produced by intestinal yeast and bacteria feeding on the undigested carbs may also float.)

 The stool should not soil the toilet paper, but should pass out easily and be cut off easily and cleanly when the anal sphincter closes.

 The stool should not contain a lot of mucus. There should not be any small or large worms or other parasites visible inside or near to the stool.

If your bowel movements do not meet ALL the above criteria for a normal bowel movement, then you should STOP thinking that yours are &quot;normal&quot;, that you are healthy, or that your colon and small intestine are in good health.

 Impacted Fecal Matter and Autointoxification 

As the time it takes for food and fecal material to move through your intestines slows down due to irregularity or constipation , this unnatural flow begins to cause problems.

When the lining of the colon (large intestine) or small intestine becomes irritated by bacteria, fungus, yeast, parasites or worms, it will secrete a protective mucus (or mucous) all over the lining. The mucus is somewhat sticky, and particles of passing waste start to stick to it. Similar to what happens when cholesterol sticks to the walls of your arteries and veins, a plaque begins to form on the lining of your lower digestive tract. Doctors call it mucoid plaque .

Slow-moving fecal matter begins to stick to the walls of the small intestine and colon, and starts restricting the flow of waste as it builds up a layer of old feces, mucus, and dead cells. The vegetable and meat materials in that layer of stuck-on waste begin to ferment and rot and release foul-smelling gasses through the mouth and anus, while continuing to release poisonous toxins into vital organs, the bloodstream, and the rest of your body.

 This mass of decomposing material stuck to the walls of your colon and small intestine becomes food for an immense number of bad bacteria, yeast, fungus, and intestinal parasites like amoebae, protozoa, flukes and worms to thrive within the body. 

Strictly speaking, the food and other materials that pass through your digestive tract, including the small and large intestine (colon) is still OUTSIDE your body, separated from your internal organs and bloodstream by the lining of your stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum. Only when it gets absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the stomach or intestines (or through blood vessels under the tongue) does it get INSIDE your body.

But when you have undigested food and fecal matter (feces) moving slowly through your colon, or getting stuck to the lining of the colon, the essential minerals (electrolytes like calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium), some essential B vitamins (which are produced by bio-friendly bacteria in the colon), and water are not absorbed as well. This alone causes all kinds of health problems.

But the bacteria, fungus, yeast and tiny intestinal parasites which live inside the stuck-on fecal matter can enter your bloodstream through the lining of the colon. And the toxins which some of them release can also enter your bloodstream and reach your vital organs and every cell in your body - including your skin (where they can cause skin rashes, inflammation, infections, and body odor) and your joints (where they can cause inflammation, aches, and pains).

Removing the layers of stuck fecal matter using a colon cleanser and detoxifier like Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea helps expel the overgrowth of yeast, bacteria and parasites living in the stuck fecal matter, so they won&apos;t be poisoning your body with the toxins they were creating - or producing excess gas which may have been causing bloating, cramps, and smelly flatulence.

Eating foods rich in fiber and taking fiber supplements can help keep the feces moving and help prevent new layers of mucoid plaque being deposited, but they are not very effective at removing the plaque that is already there - some of of which is hidden inside the many folds and crevices of the colon lining. To achieve a real colon cleansing and remove the parasites, bacteria, fungus and yeast hidden in the layers of mucoid plaque, drinking Holy Tea should help you much more than fiber supplements or laxatives. And it detoxes your entire body too!
 
 Signs of Autointoxification 

 a constantly low energy level; a loss of vitality for no apparent reason needing to sleep more hours than normal; always feeling tired frequent headaches for no apparent reason frequent nasal congestion and colds constipation; irregular bowel movements; hard stools excessive flatulence; discomfort or cramps from abdominal gas; frequent digestive disorders frequently foul-smelling farts and feces constant bad breath (halitosis) recurring skin problems, such as rashes, eczema, boils, pimples, and acne lowered resistance to infections such as influenza allergies or intolerances to certain foods intolerance to fatty foods frequent lower back pain aches and pains that move from one place to another pain in the liver or gall bladder in women: premenstrual syndrome (PMS); breast soreness; frequent vaginal yeast infections

 Parasites 

Over 340 varieties of parasites can live in the human body. Many form large colonies inside the folds within your colon. Others attach themselves to the inner walls of your colon and small intestine.

Click here for more detailed information about Human Parasites - Protozoa, Amoebae, Flukes, and Worms .

 Blood flukes, liver flukes, lung flukes, and their tiny eggs usually enter the human body by drinking water which contains them. Drinking water can also contain the spore stage ( oocysts ) of microscopic parasitic protozoa like Giardia and Cryptosporidium , as well as parasitic amoeba .

Some common intestinal worms (called nematodes ) are pinworms (also called threadworms), whip worms, hook worms, and roundworms. Tapeworms are a type of flatworm related to flukes. Tiny worm eggs or larvae are often found in the muscle tissue of animals and fish which humans eat as food; while others are transferred to the mouth by fecal-oral transmission, i.e. through contact with dirt or surfaces which have been contaminated with fecal matter containing the worm eggs. Pinworm eggs can be carried to the mouth on fingers, clothing and bedding.

 Pin worms often cause a very annoying itch in the anal area, and they are very infectious. The female pin worms lay their eggs at night, coming out through the anus and depositing the eggs on the skin around the anus - and also in pajamas, underwear, and bedsheets. While laying their eggs the worms excrete a substance which creates a strong itching sensation on the skin, so the sleepy victim often scratches the anal area and picks up the eggs on their fingers and under the finger nails, and later transfers those eggs to the mouth - or to the pillows or bedclothes, where they can be transferred through contact to the mouth of another person.

Sometimes the pinworms miss returning through the anus, and will enter and infect the vagina of a woman or young girl.

 Roundworms can grow to be 14 inches long, and tapeworms can typically be 1 to 3 feet in length - and some up to 30 feet! These two can be acquired by eating improperly cooked meat which contains their eggs or larvae. A fish tapeworm like the salmon tapeworm ( Diphyllobothrium dendriticum ) can grow to a length of 33 feet or more, can produce more than a million eggs per day, and can live for 20 years.

 Whipworms are a nasty type of roundworm that injects a digestive fluid into the colon tissue, which turns it into a liquid which the worms then feed upon. It literally eats its human host! Fortunately, they are found only in tropical regions, but tourists can be infected while visiting tropical countries. Whipworms are also found in some areas of the southern USA where outdoor toilets are still in use. They are acquired by skin contact with the whip worm larvae which inhabit grass covered ground that has been contaminated with human feces - usually by walking barefoot.

 Hookworms are like little vampires which feed on your blood and body tissue. Just one adult hookworm is able to drain one-tenth of a milliliter of blood from its human host per day. That means 1000 of them could cause an infected human to lose a tenth of a liter of blood per day, or a liter in ten days. As part of their life cycle, hookworms travel through the bloodstream and into the lungs, where they can cause symptoms similar to asthma or bronchitis, and then eventually cause severe coughing which gets them expelled into the throat where they can travel down through the stomach and into the small intestine.

Some parasites such as flukes, pork tapeworms, Toxoplasma gondii protozoa, and Candida yeast, travel to other tissues and organs such as the liver, heart, and even the brain.

There is a suspected link between parasites in the brain and certain diseases such as schizophrenia (bipolar disease) and encephalitis .

An infection by parasites in the human body is called human helminthiasis .

The most common helminth (parasite) species are:
 Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Ascaris lumbricoides, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, Hymenolepis nana, Onchocerca volvulus, Paragonimus westermani, Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata, Taenia solium, Trichuris trichiura, Wuchereria bancrofti. 

Some helminths which are found worldwide but are less common include:
 Diphyllobothrium latum, Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilocularis, and Taenia solium .

 An estimated 150 million Americans have intestinal parasite infestation, and over 55 million American children have worms. Ascaris Lumbricoides , a large roundworm, is the most common nematode parasite found in humans, infecting an estimated 1.47 billion individuals world-wide.

Five species of parasitic amoebae which are pathogenic to humans are:
 Entamoeba histolytica, Naegleria fowleri (the brain-eating amoeba found in warm freshwater lakes in the southern USA), Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Hartmannella .

Where do these human parasites ( helminths ) live in our bodies?

 Alimentary tract (digestive system): 197 species Cavities, organs and tissues: 107 species Circulatory system (blood and heart): 21 species Skin and tissues: 56 species

 Parasites sap our strength and weaken our immune system. They steal nutrients from the food passing through our GI tract and leave us malnourished and sluggish - even when we eat healthy foods. Some chronic ailments such as allergies, arthritis, and chronic fatigue have been linked to an infection by parasites.

Because the epithelial cells in the lining of the colon lead directly to the bloodstream, tiny parasites (and toxins) in the intestines can sometimes enter the blood and travel to vital organs like your liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart.

 The pork tapeworm ( Taenia solium ) can cause some serious and even fatal medical conditions which are very hard to diagnose because this parasite prefers to reside not in the intestinal tract or muscles of humans, but in the central nervous system, where the larvae can form cysts in the spinal cord and brain, and sometimes the eyes. As the larva grows and the cyst which protects it enlarges, this can produce pressure inside the brain or spinal cord, which can lead to epileptic seizures or other neurological problems such as paralysis. Larval cysts in the eye can impair vision or cause blindness.

 The raccoon roundworm ( Baylisascaris procyonis ) can also cause blindness, brain damage, or death in a human host. Infection occurs by hand-to-mouth transmission of the eggs after touching raccoon feces, touching dead squirrels or chipmunks who were infected by eating raccoon feces, or petting or kissing a dog or cat which has touched the raccoon feces or an infected animal and then carries the sticky, infectious roundworm eggs on their fur or face. Children under age 7 are most likely to be infected because of their curiosity and their tendency to put unwashed hands in their mouth. The Baylisascaris eggs are actually quite resistant to chlorine and household disinfectants.

Flukes (such as liver flukes and lung flukes) and other parasitic nematodes (worms) also migrate to various organs and tissues in the human body.

 Parasite Symptoms 

 Some common symptoms which may indicate the presence of intestinal parasites ( helminthiasis ): 

 lethargy and slow reflexes, feeling tired all the time (chronic fatigue) neither you nor your doctor can figure out why you just don&apos;t feel well depression gastrointestinal symptoms, bulky stools with excess fat in feces digestive problems such as gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea that come and go but never really clear up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) burning sensation in the stomach anemia or iron deficiency ( pernicious anemia ) eating more than normal but still feeling hungry difficulty in losing or gaining weight no matter how you try excessive number of bacterial or viral infections tried a program to get rid of a Candida yeast infection which didn&apos;t help (or it keeps coming back), and you still have cravings for bread, fruit, fruit juices, or alcohol headaches restlessness or anxiety fast heartbeat, heart pain insomnia, multiple awakenings during the night (particularly between 2 and 3 am) bed wetting teeth grinding and drooling during sleep transmandibular jaw syndrome (TMJ) depressed immune system constant coughs and colds joint pain, muscle pain, and arthritis-like symptoms pain in the back, shoulders, and thighs pain in navel area numbness in hands skin ailments such as hives, rashes, weeping eczema, itchy dermatitis, acne, cutaneous ulcers, sores, papular lesions, inflammation or swelling allergic-like reactions with no apparent cause itchiness in ears, nose, and anus food allergies, food sensitivities, environmental intolerance or over-sensitivity (to smoke, chemicals, perfumes, etc.) loss of appetite or strong cravings for greasy foods and sugary foods forgetfulness, lack of focus, lack of clarity in thinking sexual dysfunction in men menstrual cycle problems in women hyperactivity and nervousness in children.
 
Can you see how ridding your body of parasites by drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea may help relieve many of the above symptoms which are caused by parasites?

A medical parasite treatment may require many different parasite medications and pharmaceutical drugs which kill the various species of parasite. Some people prefer to try an alternative herbal parasite cleanse which cleans their colon and digestive tract of parasites and also removes the impacted fecal matter which many kinds of worms and intestinal parasites feed upon.

High enemas and colonic irrigation treatments can help, but they do not reach the small intestine where an intestinal parasite like the Giardia parasite lives and keeps causing diarrhea , gas, bloating, and cramping.

You may find that just drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea is a simple, easy, and comfortable way to help remove all kinds of parasites from your body.

 Bacteria 

The average human body contains about ten trillion individual cells. The body has about ten times that number of microorganisms inhabiting the digestive tract!
These are often referred to as &quot;intestinal microflora&quot; but the word &quot;flora&quot; actually refers to plants. The word &quot;biota&quot; refers to microbial life forms other than plants, so the more appropriate term &quot;intestinal microbiota&quot; is now being used more often to refer to the bacteria in the human gut.

Most of the microscopic organisms in the colon are bacteria, and these bacteria comprise 60% of the mass of the feces (they grow very quickly). About 300 to 1000 different species live in the intestines, but most estimates place the number at about 500 species.

Most likely, 99 percent of the instestinal bacteria are members of only 30 or 40 species, such as Escherichia coli . Over 99 percent of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobic , meaning they do not require oxygen.

The most numerically predominant bacteria in the colon are members of the genus Bacteroides , which are generally helpful in the colon when they ferment carbohydrates to produce volatile fatty acids; but can also become opportunistic pathogens if they enter and infect other parts of the body, such as the peritoneal cavity, when the mucosal wall of the intestine is disrupted by trauma, gastrointestinal surgery, appendicitis, a perforated ulcer, diverticulitis, or inflammatory bowel disease. Bacteroides fragilis is the species found in 81 percent of anaerobic clinical infections, and is often involved in the formation of an abscess whose surrounding wall protects the B. fragilis and other bacteria from antibiotics.

There are more than 36 different species of bacteria that commonly reside in the colon. More than 20 species of bacteria grow in the stool of meat-eaters, and all of them produce highly toxic waste products. 

One you may be familiar with is Salmonella , which is often found in the meat and eggs of poultry, and can produce a seriously debilitating illness which is usually called &quot;food poisoning&quot;. Another is E. Coli which is actually harmless or beneficial in normal small amounts, but unhealthy when allowed to overpopulate in the colon. But one of the strains of E. Coli bacteria releases a toxin which is deadly to humans.

 Carnivore  mammals like lions and cats which eat meat and little else have very short digestive tracts, which helps them eliminate their toxic waste quickly before it can poison them. Felines and canines such as cats and dogs also have a stronger concentration of hydrochloric acid in their stomachs than humans, which helps kill more bacteria and parasites.

The human digestive tract is almost TWICE as long as that of a lion. We need to keep that toxic waste moving out of us as quickly as possible - and that&apos;s where Holy Tea can help!

 Probiotic vs Pathogenic Bacteria 

Without the intestinal bacteria, the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested carbohydrates it consumes because some types of bacteria have enzymes for breaking down certain polysaccharides - enzymes which humans lack. Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches; fiber; and sugars and oligosaccharides that the body failed to digest and absorb, such as lactose and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins.

There are &quot; good bacteria &quot; known as &quot; probiotic bacteria &quot; (bio-friendly bacteria like Lactobacillus acidophilus ) in our digestive tract which help digest the fresh food passing through, but this accumulation of toxic waste allows the &quot;bad bacteria&quot; and fungus organisms to &quot;take over&quot;. This disrupts the delicate balance in our bowels between the bacteria and fungus. Those bad bacteria and fungi are called &quot;opportunists&quot;. They will move in wherever the good bacteria die off and leave some room on the lining of the small intestine and colon.

 Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most important of the lacto bacteria in the digestive tract. It can survive in both acid and alkaline environments and has the potential to inhibit at least 26 different kinds of harmful pathogenic bacteria.

 Acidophilus is found naturally in Balkan-style yogurt and fermented foods such as cultured buttermilk, kefir or tempeh or miso, sauerkraut, and pickles - and is available in capsule form as a Probiotic supplement (which should be taken after using antibiotic drugs that kill off the natural population of probiotic bacteria in your gut). Click here to buy a probiotic bacteria supplement .

The various types of &quot; good bacteria &quot; or &quot; probiotics &quot; live in symbiosis with us and provide many beneficial functions which are absolutely essential to our health and well-being - and even our ability to stay alive:

 Many probiotic bacteria produce enzymes which enable us to digest various types of food , such as carbohydrates and polysaccharides.

 Some probiotic bacteria make natural antibiotics called bacteriocins , which help control or destroy the harmful bacteria . The production of free bile acids plays a role in inhibiting pathogens, since bile salts are toxic to many organisms, including Clostridium botulinum .

 All probiotic bacteria help protect the intestinal mucosa and vaginal mucosa tissues from passing pathogenic bacteria and harmful fungus or yeast infestation - mainly by &quot;crowding out&quot; the pathogens, yeast, and fungus organisms and preventing them from adhering to the tissue where they could grow and spread. Thus the probiotics provide colonization resistance to pathogens. The most notable transient pathogenic bacteria which are inhibited in this way are Salmonella enteritidis , and Shigella flexineri . The organisms which cannot attach to the mucosa lining pass out of the body within the stools - which are comprised of about 30 percent bacteria.

 Some manufacture vitamin K which is necessary for strong bones and the ability of the blood to clot.

 Some probiotics manufacture some of the B vitamins .

 Some prevent toxicity from nitrites added to processed foods.

 Some bacteria aid in the absorption of magnesium . (Asthma and migraines and heart disease have been closely linked to magnesium deficiencies.)

 These probiotic &quot;good bacteria&quot; are essential in digesting the food we eat. For example, the helpful Lactobacillus bacteria produce lactase enzymes which digest the lactose found in milk and dairy products (and may also aid in reducing migraine attacks). Other lactobacteria digest carbohydrates. Without probiotics to digest our foods, we could not get enough nutrition to survive. 

Some other important probiotics are: Bifidobacterium longum , Lactobacillus casei , and Lactobacillus salivarius .

When the food passing through our small intestine is not properly digested and the nutrients are not well absorbed, we will tend to eat even more food in an attempt to get the missing nutrients we need to survive. This is one of the causes of weight gain as we age and build up more and more mucoid plaque. 

These bio-friendly bacteria or probiotics displace those harmful pathogenic micro-organisms (the bad bacteria, parasites, yeast and fungus) that cause constipation and diarrhea (and vaginitis) and do not leave them room to attach themselves and multiply on the inner surface of the colon and small intestine. Those which cannot attach themselves to the lining would normally end up being excreted from the body in the feces, but when the intestines have a build up of mucus and waste material sticking to that lining, it provides a perfect place for pathogenic bacteria, yeast, fungus, and parasites to reside, feed, reproduce and multiply, and produce their poisonous toxins.

 In a healthy digestive system, there should be about 80 to 85 percent bio-friendly bacteria (like Acidophilus and Bifidus ) and only 15 to 20 percent yeast and fungus. 

 In a healthy body, there will be about three pounds of probiotic bacteria in the digestive tract, bacteria which help you digest and absorb the nutrients in your food. There will be about four pounds of good and bad bacteria in the whole body. There should be more individual probiotic bacteria organisms in our gut than there are cells in the lining of the digestive tract!

But today, with all the processed foods we eat, all the alcoholic beverages we drink, and all the antibiotics fed to the animals we eat, the number of probiotic bacteria that survive to do their job in our GI tract is getting less and less. 

 Taking antibiotic drugs kills the good probiotic bacteria along with the pathogenic bacteria. The chlorine and fluorine in tap water helps kill toxic bacteria in the water supply, but can also kill the probiotic bacteria in your GI tract (use a charcoal filter to remove the chlorine from your drinking water). Chemical preservatives in processed foods keep harmful bacteria from growing in the products, but when we ingest those chemicals do they kill the good bacteria which are supposed to be growing in our digestive tract?

 With less of the good probiotic bacteria to protect us, no wonder the pathogenic bacteria, yeast, fungi, and parasites are proliferating and causing so many health problems! Click here to buy a probiotic bacteria supplement .
 
 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea helps restore the conditions in your digestive tract which support the presence and growth of the good probiotic bacteria and make it difficult for the bad bacteria, yeast, fungus, and parasites to survive and spread.

 Fungus and Yeast 

Yeasts

A &quot;yeast&quot; is just another type of fungus organism. Some yeasts are harmless and even beneficial to humans, other yeasts create health problems, and some produce poisons known as mycotoxins (i.e. toxins produced by a fungus organism).

Some beneficial yeasts feed on sugars and produce gas (which is how breadmaking yeast makes the dough rise). Other harmless yeasts cause grains like rye or corn, and starchy vegetables like potatoes, to ferment and excrete alcohol as a waste product (which is how liquors and beers are produced).

A harmless yeast which grows naturally on the skin of grapes will ferment the natural fruit sugars in mashed-up grapes and produce alcohol and carbon dioxide gas, which is how wines and bubbly champagnes are made.

A certain amount of yeast in our GI tract is normal and healthy. Too much of a yeast like Candida is unhealthy, and causes all kinds of problems. 

 Passing more gas than a normal amount (i.e. flatulence or flatus ) is a sign of yeast overgrowth. 

Really foul-smelling farts are a sign that there is also an excess of undigested and putrefying animal meat in your gut. Not chewing your food thoroughly or gulping down food too fast contributes to sending larger bits of undigested food through the colon (the stomach acid cannot contact and break down the center portion of the larger chunks).

 Candida albicans Yeast

 Candida albicans (previously known as Monilia ) is a common microscopic yeast which lives on sugars, and is now thriving in our bodies on all the sugar we consume from so many sugar-laden soft drinks and processed foods with too much sucrose, glucose and corn syrup. Candida also feeds on L-Glutamine amino acid supplements and the natural fruit sugar ( fructose ) found in many healthy fruits.

Nowadays, people who live in the industrialized nations are eating way too many processed foods loaded with refined sugars, saturated fats, MSG, and unhealthy chemical preservatives - and not enough healthy natural foods. Recent research showed that only 55% of the dinners served in homes in the U.S.A. today include even one home-made dish.

 A Candida infestation can even cause your body to crave sugary foods. So you consume more sugar, get fat, and help the Candida grow and multiply.

The Candida  yeast can spread to many parts of the body, and often causes a yeast infection called &quot;Thrush&quot; in the throats of people with compromised immune systems, such as those with AIDS or Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or those who have undergone organ transplant surgery.

 Candida is generally white in appearance, and may be seen as a white coating on the tongue or throat, or as a sticky, thick, white discharge and a &quot;yeast&quot; or &quot;beer&quot; or &quot;fishy&quot; type of odor (often noticed when there is a vaginal yeast infection).

 The more dangerous fungal form of Candida grows as tiny white threads , which can take root in the lining of the colon and other places in the body. These tiny threads can produce microscopic holes in the intestines which allow fluids to leak out of the bowels and into the cavity of the abdomen, creating a disease condition known as &quot;leaky gut syndrome&quot;.

Click on this link to the yeast infections page to open a new window and read about the many symptoms and causes of Candida yeast infections. 

 You will be very surprised to learn how many widespread and very aggravating ailments are actually caused by a Candida yeast overgrowth or the fungal form of Candida - some of which you (or your doctor) would never suspect! Like food allergies, migraine headaches, Attention Deficit Disorder, depression, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, female reproductive system disorders, and over-sensitivity to tobacco smoke, chemicals and perfumes.

Yet medical doctors usually do not look for a yeast infection as a possible cause unless it is an obvious scalp or skin infection, diaper rash, vaginal yeast infection (with a whitish discharge), or the more obvious Thrush (a white coating) in the throat or mouth.

Medical doctors trained to treat symptoms with man-made pharmaceutical drugs (i.e. allopathic doctors) rarely even ask their patients what foods they are eating, because they have very little training in nutrition and the prevention of disease.

On the other hand, naturopathic doctors and homeopathic doctors always look for the root cause of an ailment, and know that the condition of the colon is vital to good health and the prevention of disease. They will often suggest a colon cleanse and detox before trying to treat an ailment, because the ailment is often caused by an unhealthy colon and/or a yeast or parasite infection.

Now, more and more naturopaths, homeopaths, and herbalists are recommending Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea as a parasite cleanse, Candida cleanse, colon cleanse, and whole body detoxifier.

Allergies

 More than 70 different allergic molecules are produced by Candida albicans . Allergens cause symptoms of itching, skin rashes, hives, scalp itch, nasal congestion, cough, bronchitis, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 

It would be wise to do a Candida cleanse before assuming that these allergy symptoms are actually caused by other medical conditions. All too often, drugs are prescribed to treat symptoms, while nothing is done to find the cause of those symptoms. If Candida is the cause, then getting rid of the Candida often results in the conditions just going away.

Female Reproductive System Disorders

 Candida also produces hormonally active molecules. Patients who were treated with anti-fungal medications have reported improvement in symptoms related to the female reproductive system: PMS, cystic breast disease, infertility, and reduced sex drive. From this, one may infer that the conditions were originally caused by a Candida yeast overgrowth in the person&apos;s body.

Other Ailments Caused by a Yeast Infection

It is well known that yeast causes vaginitis in women and diaper rash and thrush in infants. Yeast and fungus are also common causes of other skin infections, including: athlete&apos;s foot, jock itch, anal itching, ringworm, paronychia, intertrigo, seborrhea (dandruff), tinea versicolor, and onychomycosis (which causes fingernail and toenail deformities). 

Yeast infections occur more frequently in people who are diabetic, or have cancer or AIDS. Those with a lowered immune system response are less able to keep the yeast overgrowth under control.

Click here for more detailed information about Yeast Infections .

Fungal Molds

Another common type of fungus that can grow inside the body is a mold (or mould) called Aspergillus flavus  which produces a mycotoxin (i.e. a fungus-produced toxin) called Aflatoxin . The high temperatures used in cooking food can kill the Aspergillus mold, but cannot neutralize any Aflatoxin which it has already produced. ( Aflatoxin is particularly deadly to dogs and birds, and sometimes to humans.)

The Aspergillus flavus mold and its toxin are often present at low concentrations in foods we eat, especially in grains such as corn and wheat, and in peanuts and soy beans. It cannot be controlled, so the U.S. FDA can only limit the concentration of Aflatoxin allowed in human foods to a safe 20 parts per billion.

This mold also grows in damp wood, cardboard, paper, wallpaper, gypsum board, leather, cloth fabrics and dead leaves when conditions are humid (producing a musty smell). It also grows in humidifier water, and in damp basements where its microscopic airborne spores can be inhaled. It can cause serious fungal infections in the lungs ( pulmonary aspergillosis ) and kidneys; and can also cause chronic allergic reactions that appear as headaches, Flu-like symptoms, fatigue, lethargy, and asthmatic conditions.

 Immune Stress Caused by Yeast...
Allergies, Asthma, Chronic Fatigue, Depression, Attention Deficit Disorder, Hyperactivity 

 When the growth of yeast is NOT kept in check by the good probiotic bacteria and the yeast becomes too widespread, the body identifies it as a foreign invader and an immune response is triggered. The immune response can cause fatigue, weakness, feelings of malaise or depression , and flu-like symptoms. 

When yeast ferments foods in the intestines and produces gas, it can cause indigestion and swelling of the belly. In the sinuses and nasal cavities, yeast can also cause swelling, as well as other allergy-like symptoms .

A clinical syndrome known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome or CFIDS has been linked to an overgrowth of the Candida yeast organism. It is not well recognized by doctors, who may not suspect that the underlying cause is a yeast overgrowth triggering an immune response. 

CFIDS can present as a complicated mix of symptoms linked to, or including... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Epstein-Barr Syndrome, Candida Albicans Syndrome, Candidiasis, Monilia, Myalgic Encephalitis, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Disorder, Hyperactivity Syndrome, Hypoglycemia, Asthma, Food Allergy, Allergic Tension Fatigue Syndrome, Chemical Sensitivity, Ecological Illness, and Sick Building Syndrome.

Candidiasis

An overgrowth of the yeast which is normally present in the gut is called Candidiasis - or Monilia (to which the anti-yeast drug Monistat™ refers).

 An excessive growth of yeast is caused by... 

 Taking multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotic drugs for sore throats, ear infections, sinus infections, bronchitis, or urinary tract infections. Antibiotic drugs such as Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, Keflex™, Ceclor™, Bactrim™ and Septra™ kill the bio-friendly bacteria that control yeast.

 Treatments with cortisone types of anti-inflammatory medicines or injections, such as Prednisone , which kill the bio-friendly bacteria.

 Treatments for acne with Tetracycline or other antibiotics which kill the probiotic bacteria.

 Consuming too much of foods that support yeast growth, such as sugar, wine, beer, vinegar, and pickled foods. Refined and simple sugars are the main cause, including white and brown table sugar, molasses, syrup, and honey. Even natural sugars like fructose found in raw fruits, dried fruits, and fruit juices support the growth of yeast.

 Eating too much yeast and grains contained in foods such as breads and bakery products , especially those which contain wheat, rye, or corn.

 Inhaling other fungus spores from mildew or mold (especially in damp basements and water-soaked walls or ceilings).
 
 The average person in North America now has the proper ratio (80/20) of &quot;good bacteria&quot; to fungus reversed - 15 per cent good probiotic bacteria and 85 per cent fungus and yeast! This can be the root cause of many health ailments. Restoring a normal healthy balance of 80% beneficial probiotic bacteria to 20% yeast and fungus can deal with the cause and help eliminate the symptoms.

 Symptoms of Yeast Overgrowth 

 Signs of excessive yeast and fungus overgrowth and a deficiency of the good probiotic bacteria such as lactobacillus include...

 intestinal gas, especially after eating sugary foods (the greater the yeast overgrowth, the greater amount of gas that will be produced) indigestion and/or bloating after meals heartburn / acid reflux disease dry mouth, often with a white coating on the tongue (especially after a night&apos;s sleep) bad breath, belching smelly gas after eating sore throat, white coating inside the throat cold sores and/or canker sores in mouth or on face diarrhea or chronic constipation, loose stools, noticeable mucus in stools itching anus, especially after eating food with high sugar content groin area sticky and wet, with foul odor and itchiness yeast infection such as Candidiasis or Monilia urinary tract infections, especially if not helped by antibiotic treatments food allergies such as sensitivity to milk, wheat, corn or other common foods insomnia fatigue, or continual fatigue which may noticeably worsen after eating bruising too easily, often noticing unexplained bruises cold feet or cold hands joint pain and/or swelling aching muscles, muscle weakness or paralysis, aching bones (symptoms are worse after exercising) Lupus nail-bed infections, infection of the nails by fungus, thick and/or discolored nails athlete&apos;s foot (a scaley, itching fungus infection of the skin between the toes) nasal congestion, post nasal drip, itchy nose chronic sinus infections persistent cough or recurring bronchitis respiratory symptoms: wheezing or shortness of breath, allergy symptoms, sensitivity to chemicals, increasing sensitivity to more and more environmental irritants such as smoke, perfumes, or airborne particles skin disorders: eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, acne, chronic hives or rash, jock itch, burning or tingling or itching skin headaches, migraines, and/or a feeling of fullness, tightness or pressure in the head, dizziness earaches, chronic earaches, ear infections not helped by antibiotic treatments hypoglycemia: shaking or being light-headed or irritable when hungry mood swings, anxiety or crying, acting manic or depressed or compulsive, irritability, hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder, panic attacks in women: irregular menstrual cycle; premenstrual mood disorder (PMS); genital candidiasis producing a thick white vaginal discharge with an odor like yeast or beer or a &quot;fishy&quot; smell, and a redness and itchiness and irritation around the external parts of vagina, and a burning sensation or pain during urination or during sexual intercourse in men: genital candidiasis producing an itchy rash on the penis; prostatitis diminished libido in men and women, impotence in men feeling intoxicated after meals, from absorbing alcohol produced by an overpopulation of yeast fermenting sugars or poorly digested grains in the digestive tract

You can see how ridding your body of the excess yeast and fungus, using Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea , may help relieve many of the above symptoms.

 When these tiny troublemakers spread into the small intestine and fill it with fungus and yeast organisms, the result is incomplete digestion and poor assimilation of important nutrients. The organs and glands are deprived of their nutritional building blocks, and normal systems begin to fail.

Also, when a pernicious yeast like Candida albicans is given room to spread, it sometimes spreads to other parts of the body. Systemic yeast infections are quite common today , and difficult to cure.

A vaginal yeast infection ( Vulvovaginal Candidiasis or VVC) is also known as Candida, Candidiasis , Monilia, or a fungus infection, and is a form of Candidosis . A vaginal yeast infection (VVC) is usually caused by the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida galbrata .

An overgrowth of yeast in a man is called a male yeast infection , and when it occurs in several parts of the body it is known as a systemic yeast infection .

 Cleaning out a yeast overgrowth in your own body could contribute to the elimination of most of the ailments caused by the yeast. (See the list above.)

You could start with a detoxifying cleanse of the colon and small intestine using good-tasting Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea as an effective, natural, yeast infection home remedy. But Holy Tea is much more than an effective colon cleanser and detoxifier - it also helps clear out parasites, toxins, heavy metals, and drug residues from your organs and your entire body, and it helps restore a healthy envirmonment in your colon and small intestine for the probiotic bacteria to grow and thrive and crowd out the bad bacteria, yeast, and fungus.

 Causes of Fungus, Yeast and Toxic Bacteria Infestations 

 The overuse and misuse of antibiotic drugs has been a major contributor to this problem. About $23 billion per year is spent on antibiotic drugs being given to patients in the USA. Sometimes antibiotics are too quickly prescribed to deal with a condition that is actually caused by a virus, fungus, yeast or parasite, against which antibiotic drugs are totally ineffective. (See all the symptoms of yeast and parasite infections above).

Recent research has found that the vast majority of nasal infections are caused by yeast, not bacteria. Yet doctors still routinely prescribe a course of antibiotic drugs for a nasal infection. The antibiotics are totally useless against the yeast, so the nasal infection is not healed; and the antibiotics create other health problems (like those in the long list of yeast overgrowth symptoms above) by killing the probiotic bacteria which naturally keep intestinal yeast like Candida under control. Click here to buy a probiotic bacteria supplement to help restore the good bacteria in your intestines after you have stopped taking antibiotic drugs.

The use of Corticosteroid medications can also increase the risk of a yeast infection.

 When these man-made antibiotics are used, they kill all the bio-friendly bacteria in the gut, but do not kill the yeast and fungus microbes or parasitic worms , which now have less competition for food and growing places, and can take over - particularly the opportunistic yeast, Candida albicans .

We can see this happening in women who are prescribed an antibiotic drug and find that it has killed all the bio-friendly bacteria (which leads to diarrhea ) and has allowed the Candida yeast to spread to their vagina, resulting in a recurring &quot; vaginal yeast infection &quot;. A yeast infection in men can also arise from treatments with antibiotic drugs or corticosteroid medications.

 There are some alternative natural antibiotics like Allicin , an extract from garlic cloves which does NOT destroy all the bio-friendly bacteria, but IS effective against many parasites like Giardia, viruses like Rhinovirus, Influenza B., Herpes Simplex, fungus and yeast organisms like Candida , and bad bacteria like E. Coli  and Salmonella , and the Helicobacter Pylori  bacteria (which is the most frequent cause of stomach ulcers).

If you take an antibiotic drug, be absolutely certain to keep taking it for as long as your doctor tells you, or until ALL of the drug has been used up. If you stop taking your antibiotic just because you start to feel better, you have failed to kill ALL the bad bacteria - and the ones which have survived are the STRONGEST and MOST ADAPTABLE. They will adapt and reproduce and infect you again - and eventually will become immune to the antibiotic drug that once was able to kill them.

This misuse and overuses of antibiotic drugs is how bacteria become immune to the antibiotic drugs and make them useless as a future treatment. One common bacteria, Staphylococcus Aureus (called MRSA or &quot; the super-bug &quot; or &quot; Staph. A &quot; in news reports) has now become immune to ALL antibiotic drugs, and is causing the deaths of many people who get infected during their stay in a hospital and then die of pneumonia or blood poisoning. Doctors tell those with less serious, non-fatal Staph. A infections that they have no treatment and no cure. But Staph. A is still not resistant to the above-mentioned natural antibiotic, Allicin .

 Excess Gas and Flatulence (a.k.a. Flatus or Farting) 

The average healthy person will pass gas about ten to fourteen times per day, producing an average of half a liter of gas - though some people can produce a liter or more if they consume certain foods.

When malabsorption (reduced food absorption) occurs due to certain medical conditions, excess gas in the intestines and excessive flatulence (farting) could be a symptom of these disorders:

 diverticulosis that leads to an overgrowth of bacteria celiac sprue pancreatic disease short bowel syndrome (where part of the bowel was removed by surgery).

Gas is caused by fiber, starch, and some complex sugars which aren&apos;t easily digested in the stomach and small intestine, and which then pass through to the colon. There they are fermented by intestinal bacteria which produces hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulphide gases. The intestinal yeast tend to produce odorless carbon dioxide gas, but the farts can pick up odors from rotting vegetable material and putrefying meat stuck to the walls of the colon (mucoid plaque).

The foul smell of flatus usually comes from various sulphur-containing compounds. The compounds in a typical smelly fart are usually hydrogen sulphide or methanethiol . The &quot;rotten eggs&quot; smell comes from hydrogen sulphide gas, and a &quot;rotting vegetables&quot; smell comes from methanethiol . Yet another sulphur compound, dimethyl sulphide , actually smells kind of &quot;sweet&quot;.

Cauliflower, eggs, and meat are most likely to produce the smelliest farts. Beans produce a greater quantity of gas, but not particularly smelly farts. In general, foods with little fiber produce very little gas.

 Giardiasis , an infection by the Giardia protozoa parasite, can produce the most nauseating farts and belches, along with extremely foul-smelling watery diarrhea . A Giardia infection in the upper small intestine inhibits the absorption of fats, which instead pass through to the colon where the putrefactive bacteria feed on those undigested fats. Decomposing fat has an extremely foul odor, like that of a decomposing dead body.

Another cause of excess gas can be a lack of the enzyme lactase which is needed to digest a simple sugar called lactose or &quot;milk sugar&quot;. In a person who lacks this enzyme, consuming milk and dairy products which contain lactose can leave the dairy foods poorly digested and not absorbed by the small intestine. As it moves through the large intestine it becomes food for yeast and putrefactive bacteria - organisms which produce gases like carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide , or methane . When there is a yeast overgrowth in the colon, even more gas is produced.

People who cannot digest lactose are said to suffer from lactose intolerance . An hour or two after consuming milk or dairy products they can experience uncomfortable cramps and excess gas in the abdomen . This problem is compounded when the use of antibiotics kills the probiotic Lactobacteria which help digest lactose for us.

While cheese, milk, ice cream and frozen yogurt can cause the cramping, regular yogurt does not, because the live bacteria culture which fermented milk into yogurt breaks down the lactose so we can digest it.
 
Some foods which are considered &quot; high flatulogenic foods &quot; (the suffix genic means &quot;creating&quot; or &quot;causing&quot;) are the ones most likely to cause excess gas in the small and large intestine, an uncomfortable or painful &quot;gassy&quot; feeling in the abdomen, and excessive flatus or farting:

 milk, cheese, ice cream, frozen yogurt (not regular yogurt) most beans, such as baked beans, lima beans, pinto beans, navy beans, soy beans (soak beans in hot water for several hours before cooking them, and they will produce less gas) sauerkraut, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, asparagus, radishes prunes, onions, carrots, raisins, bananas bagels, pretzels, wheat germ.

Foods which are moderately flatulogenic include:

 foods that contain wheat and wheat products, such as cereals, breads, pastries potatoes, citrus fruits carbonated beverages, sodas.
 
 Bulging Bellies 

You may have heard the expression &quot; beer belly &quot; or &quot; midriff bulge &quot; used to describe a person with an extended or protruding abdomen. Other expressions are &quot;spare tire&quot;, &quot;pot belly&quot;, &quot;beer gut&quot;, or in Canada: &quot;Molson muscle&quot; (Molson is a popular brand of Canadian beer).

The medical term for this abnormally enlarged abdomen is bloat or &quot;bloating&quot;.

Having too much fat around the mid-section is not the only cause of this enlargement. It&apos;s not beer in the belly that makes it bulge out! Most likely it&apos;s a serious build-up of toxic fecal matter in the intestines and colon that is contributing to a chronic outward swelling of the person&apos;s belly.

Pinch the roll of fat on your belly and the tips of your fingers will feel the harder abdominal wall below it. If the abdomial wall below the layer of fat is protruding and not &quot;flat&quot;, then you have &quot;bloat&quot;.

This condition called bloating is NOT the stomach making the belly stick out, for the stomach is located ABOVE the transverse colon, beside the liver and just under the lower part of the rib cage. The large intestine, also called the colon, runs across the front of the abdomen below the rib cage (the transverse colon) and also up and down each side of the belly (the ascending colon and descending colon).

 Bloat is the COLON (large intestine) expanding due to the impacted fecal matter building up inside. 

There is a reported case of an individual who had their colon removed due to cancer. The diameter of the diseased colon had stretched to 9 inches from the normal 2 to 2.5 inches; yet the orifice through which food was able to pass was smaller than a standard pencil! 

It is said that when the beloved singer/actor Elvis Presley died, the autopsy revealed that his bloated body had about 80 to 90 pounds of impacted fecal matter in his digestive tract!

Byron Raphael, a close confidant of Elvis Presley, said in an interview:&quot;He could barely get up in the morning. Couldn&apos;t sleep at night. Taking so many prescription drugs. They found when he died, he had eighty or ninety pounds of fecal material inside. I believe he&apos;s really dead, because the amounts of prescription drugs he was taking was enough to surely kill him sooner or later. He couldn&apos;t have lived much longer. He was constipated to the point where he would go weeks without going to the bathroom. No amount of laxative would help.&quot;

It was reported that Elvis died of a heart attack while on the toilet. &quot;The King is dead&quot; - and he died on the &quot;porcelain throne&quot;.

The straining to pass hard stools can raise blood pressure and even trigger a heart attack or stroke. One has to wonder if Elvis Presley&apos;s chronic constipation was an indirect cause of his death.

And one might wonder if cleaning out all that impacted fecal matter might have reduced his suffering and added years to his life. If Elvis had Holy Tea it might have given him a weight loss of up to 80 or 90 pounds!

A similar abdominal bloating is said to have occurred with the famous Hollywood actor, John Wayne , who is said to have had 60 to 70 pounds of toxic fecal matter in his digestive tract when he died.

If you have a belly the size of Elvis Presley&apos;s at the time he died, then you probably have about 60 pounds or more of toxic sludge stuck in your gut too!

 Obviously, cleaning out the impacted fecal matter and parasites in your own body with a colon cleanse using Holy Tea could contribute to a slimming of the abdomen and some significant weight loss. It might also save your life. It will certainly improve the quality of your life.

 Going on a diet to lose weight won&apos;t work on the weight you are carrying inside your colon. You might get some results with a colon cleansing diet, but you will get better and faster results with this colon cleansing Holy Tea - without having to change your diet or deprive yourself at all. You just drink the colon cleaning Holy Tea each day until all the impacted fecal matter is removed from your intestines.

 The average healthy person who is not constipated will carry about 5 pounds of fecal matter in their intestines and colon at any one time. Many carry 6 to 12 pounds, but don&apos;t show the visible symptom of bloating because the colon will first drop down internally before it starts to expand outwardly when even more toxic waste accumulates.

 But people who are constipated or irregular can be carrying up to 40 pounds or more of this toxic fecal matter which is continually poisoning their body and organs and...

 providing an environment conducive to the formation of colon polyps and colon cancer cells providing food and shelter for parasites such as worms and flukes, amoebae, bad bacteria, yeast and fungus contributing to many discomforts and diseases of the colon and rectum, stomach ache, acid reflux, skin ailments, food allergies, and premature aging inhibiting the absorption of nutrients and electrolytes and water inhibiting the ability of the colon muscles to contract and move waste out of the body blocking the passage of waste material as it builds up more mucoid plaque causing bloat and adding excess weight that cannot be removed by fat loss diets, fat burner pills, appetite suppressants, or exercise.

 
 Here&apos;s what some Holy Tea users said about weight loss... 

 &quot;I began drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea in September, 2006, and won&apos;t go a day without it now. I saw the results almost immediately, losing 52 pounds between September and December, and this was during the prime weight-gain season of the end-of-year holidays. After having tried pills, shakes, and about everything else you can think of, I am thrilled to have something that actully works and is so easy to stick to and easy to afford. I tell everone who will listen that Dr. Miller can help them.&quot;

 &quot;I have dropped from a size 14 to a size 6 by drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea. I feel better, my skin is the best it has ever been, I have more energy, and I have more self confidence and self esteem. I feel like I look the best I have looked in my entire life. The Tea is great, because you can continue to eat what you like and normally eat, but still lose the weight.

Most people who are aware of the need for a &quot;colon cleanse&quot; do not realize that this layer of toxic waste called mucoid plaque can build up throughout their digestive tract from stomach to rectum.

Getting a colonic , colon hydrotherapy , colon irrigation , or high enema treatment using water under pressure only helps clean out the last 5 or 6 feet , yet does nothing for the 22 feet of the small intestine. Repeating the procedure too often can wash out the good probiotic bacteria before they can repopulate the colon.

Standard enemas can help cleanse the lower part of the rectum and colon, but do not cleanse the upper 4 feet of the colon or any of the small intestine .

High-fiber diets and products like Metamucil™ which contain psyllium husk fiber may help prevent the build up of toxic fecal matter, but they are ineffective in removing the mucoid plaque that has already formed. Drinking Holy Tea can help remove the mucoid plaque and help keep new plaque from forming in your digestive tract.

If you are taking any product containing psyllium husks ( Plantago Ovata ) you need to drink plenty of water , and you should not take more than two tablespoons of psyllium per day. Drinking an inadequate amount of water can cause constipation because the dry psyllium absorbs a lot of moisture as it swells up in the intestines, which leaves less moisture to keep the stool soft. You should not take psyllium if you have diverticulitis or diverticulosis .

You may have seen rather gross-looking pictures of long &quot;ropes&quot; of rubbery fecal matter that have been excreted during a bowel movement after using some kind of colon cleanse product or doing a colonic irrigation. More often that not, these are actually long clumps of psyllium fibre with some stuck-on fecal matter. It&apos;s possible that taking psyllium supplements may cause MORE fecal impaction in the colon than it helps prevent.

Over 800 million dollars per year are spent in the USA on over-the-counter laxatives , which are an irritant and stimulant to the digestive tract. Laxatives help clear out only the most recently digested waste from the colon, but have little effect on the impacted fecal matter stuck to inner wall of the colon.

 The continual use of stimulant laxatives like Cascara sagrada, Senna or Cassia for more than a week can create a dependency when the body&apos;s own ability to move the waste through muscle action (called peristalsis ) becomes weakened by this continued unnatural stimulation. Sometimes the stimulation is out of sync with the natural contractions and interferes with the flow of waste. When the ability of the colon to move fecal matter quickly is weakened, constipation and bloating is the likely result.

 Some harsh laxatives like Cascara or Senna irritate the lining of the colon and intestines and can aggravate existing conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBDs and Chrohn&apos;s Disease. If you must resort to using laxatives for constipation relief, Phillips Milk of Magnesia™ is a safe and mild, non-stimulant laxative.

Drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea could be faster, more effective, and more gentle than most laxatives in relieving chronic constipation and softening the stool - and it does NOT cause bowel dependency. Some Holy Tea users see results the very next day.

 Stool softeners are medications often prescribed to get rid of constipation in chronic and severe cases. Medications like Colace™, Dialose™, Fleet Sof-Lax™ , and Surfak™ are sometimes prescribed on a short-term basis to help soften stools and let them to pass without straining. Too much straining to enable a bowel movement can actually cause hemorrhoids (stretched and distended veins around the anus).

But stool softeners are not a long term solution or chronic constipation cure, and do not really help remove impacted fecal matter. A colon cleanser like Holy Tea not only softens hard stool, but helps remove the build-up of mucoid plaque and parasites in the small intestine, colon, and rectum.

In people who are chronically constipated , the rectum may have been widened and elongated. This allows larger stools to form which are even harder to pass through the anus, and are perhaps painful to pass. It can also create hard stools if the intestines are being deprived of moisture because the person consumes too much caffeine and/or does not drink enough water.

Then the painful straining to complete a difficult bowel movement can produce rectal bleeding (hemorrhaging) and/or those irritating and sharply painful hemorrhoids or piles or anal fissures - and may also contribute to a painful medical condition called Diverticulitis .

The constant straining to pass a hard stool has been known to raise blood pressure and even trigger a heart attack or stroke.

Drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea can help a person avoid those painful conditions by normalizing the bowel movements so that the colon does not absorb too much water and cause hard stools.

 Constipation 

In case you didn&apos;t know... if you do not regularly have a bowel movement at least once every day (unless you didn&apos;t eat any food), then you are chronically constipated - and that is going to create health problems!

 Consider how human babies have a bowel movement shortly after each feeding. They do not have any mucoid plaque in their digestive tract (yet) so the food and waste passes normally and quickly through their GI tract. It is not the recently eaten food that is so quickly coming out the other end, but some food waste products are always coming out as fast as the new food is going in.

That should be a benchmark for &quot;normal&quot;. Are you eliminating waste after every meal - or just once per day? Or once every two days? Three times a day would be healthy, but few of us these days have that healthy a digestive system.

Some people only have bowel movements more than three or four days apart. If you are one, you are severely constipated and should deal with this condition as soon as possible. That toxic waste is poisoning you!

The National Institute of Health published a survey which showed 4.5 million Americans are constipated most of the time, or are constipated all the time. In the USA, over 2.5 million doctor visits per year are made by patients who complain of constipation, and constipation results in 92,000 hospitalizations due to complications caused by fecal impaction.

Constipation is more common with overweight individuals and people over 50. It is so prevalent among the elderly people in nursing homes that most residents are chronically constipated. (If you have an aging parent in a nursing home, introducing them to Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea may help end the constipation, provide numerous benefits to their health, and improve their quality of life.)

 Constipation is basically a slowing down of the movement of food and waste through the digestive system. The degree of movement or motion is called motility . So &quot;low motility&quot; means slow motion. The rate of movement of food through the entire GI tract from mouth to anus and out of the body is called transit time .

Constipation may also refer to the hardness of the stools . The medical term for constipation is fecal impaction , and it refers to feces or fecal matter more compacted and harder than normal.

The longer the waste takes to move through the colon, the more water is removed, for absorbing water and electrolytes out of the undigested waste material and filtering it into the bloodstream is a primary function of the colon. But removing too much water makes the stools hard, and harder to pass out through the anus. 

The stool with low moisture content also becomes more compact, so more fecal matter can accumulate in the rectum before the build up triggers the urge to have a bowel movement.

 In a normal, healthy body, the passing of stools should be almost effortless and should occur at least once or twice every day. You feel the urge, you sit on a toilet, and the stools come out on their own.

 If you are waiting, pushing, and straining to get the stools out, your body is not normal or healthy. It is time to admit this to yourself: &quot;I am constipated.&quot; 

In earlier times when people lived an active life working on farms and ate only unprocessed foods and unpasteurized dairy products, the typical transit time was 15 hours.  Today, with processed foods lacking digestive enzymes, and natural fibers and loaded with refined sugar, combined with a more sedentary and less active lifestyle, in constipated people the transit time of food through the digestive tract is slowing down to 70 hours! 

That increase in &quot;transit time&quot; from 15 to 70 hours means that for several DAYS toxic waste is remaining inside your body , not just for 15 hours or less. Now you can see why you will be absorbing more toxins , building up more mucoid plaque , and suffering from many more diseases than your grandparents ever did. 

This is why gastrointestinal diseases, colon diseases, and colon cancer are most prevalent in the industrialized countries like the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, and Japan.

These are things we don&apos;t normally want to talk about or hear about - but the condition of our colon is vital to our health and well-being .

And when things go wrong, it is often the cause of death. Doctors are familiar with that ancient medical advice from Hippocrates: &quot;Death begins in the colon.&quot; Yet medical doctors who are trained to treat diseases seldom advise you how to keep your colon HEALTHY.

You may not hear people talking about their colons or bowels, but you can easily see the effects of a clogged colon or bowel blockage in all those big bellies and bulging midriffs - and see how &quot;widespread&quot; this problem has become in our modern society.

A &quot;colon cleanse&quot; or &quot;bowel cleanse&quot; is essential to maintaining good health - and contributes to a trim and healthy appearance! In our fast-food society, we are constantly overloading our bodies with the crap we put into them, and we need a way to keep getting it out.

Cleansing your colon and rectum may also be the best preventive measure you can take against the risk of colorectal cancer, pre-cancerous polyps in the colon, and those painful colon diseases known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Diverticulitis, Ileitis, Enterocolitis, Spastic Colon, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which includes Crohn&apos;s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. 

Today, doctors have no known medical cure for Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Crohn&apos;s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis (other than surgery). It looks like prevention is your only option .

Between 25 percent and 40 percent of people with ulcerative colitis eventually need colostomy surgery in which part or all of the colon is cut out and removed. Then for the rest of their lives, they will have a colostomy bag attached to their belly to collect the liquid waste from their small intestine. When they go to the bathroom, it will be to empty out the foul brown liquid from the filled bag.

In the USA, over 100,000 colostomy surgeries are performed each year to remove part or all of a diseased colon.

Medical doctors tend to treat the symptoms of a diseased colon with drugs or surgery, without getting to the real cause of the problem. Has your doctor ever told you how to PREVENT these diseases before they happen to you? 

 It&apos;s really up to YOU to take charge of your health and well-being. Using a complementary therapy such as cleansing your colon and gastrointestinal tract with Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea is a simple, easy, and pleasant way to start.

It looks like you will have to take your health into your own hands if you would rather prevent those diseases than endure the pain and suffering they will cause. The dual-action colon cleanse and whole-body detoxification provided by Holy Tea could be the first step on your road to robust health and a long active life.

Put a cup of good-tasting Holy Tea into your hands and start drinking your way to good health!

 
 &quot;A Man With a Belly&quot; 

I was totally unaware of the importance of colon health until the month when on two separate occasions I encountered people who had their entire colon surgically removed and were doomed to wear a colostomy bag attached to their abdomen for the rest of their life. I never knew such things existed! I was totally ignorant about colons and colostomy bags.

Later that same month I had to watch my new girlfriend&apos;s father die of colon cancer. He was a good man who had immigrated from southern Europe, the strong patriarch of the family who loved him, and &quot; a man with a belly &quot;.

Soon after I met Pappa C., he had told me about this saying in his culture which meant &quot;a prosperous and respected gentleman&quot;, which he was, having owned a drug store (pharmacy) business in the old country. I think it came up because I was developing a belly of my own.

He was a likeable and well-respected man, and he literally did have a belly - a really big one! I saw how he loved to stuff himself at the family dinners attended by all his adult children and their kids every Sunday.

That fateful month his digestive tract became so completely blocked that he could not get down any food. He was a stubborn man, and he refused to see a doctor. Or maybe he was just scared to find out what terrible thing might be wrong with him.

For over a week he lay at home in discomfort while his condition worsened. Finally, the family called for an ambulance and we all followed him to the big university medical center late one Sunday night.

He was quickly taken for emergency GI surgery, where the surgeons discovered massive colon cancer and proceeded to cut out the entire lower part of his digestive tract. Then they installed a connector through his abdomen to attach an external colostomy bag to collect the digestive waste.

That was the third of my colostomy bag encounters. Now, the first two seemed like &quot;omens&quot; of this tragedy about to unfold.

Soon after the colon surgery, Pappa C. seemed to improve and was able to walk and move about. He went home for a few weeks, which were his last weeks with his family at home. Soon he was sick again and was taken back to the GI ward of the hospital, where he declined rapidly. Finally, six weeks after the operation, he died from the cancer that had started in his colon and had spread to other organs.

His wife or one of his children was with him every day. It was so sad to see his wife, four adult children, and three grandchildren having to watch their strong and proud Pappa wasting away, weak and drugged and drooling, in that hospital bed. I am sure it was not the way he would have wanted them to remember him.

When death finally came, it was a relief for both Pappa C. and his loving family. My girlfriend was the oldest of his children, and I was treated like part of this very close family during those final six weeks. I saw him waste away, and I saw their sadness and suffering, and I remember feeling grateful that my own father had died suddenly of a heart attack, not wasting away like this. It had just prolonged the suffering for Pappa and his whole family.

I will never forget that time I watched a man slowly die of colon cancer. It was not the kind of death I would want for myself or anyone. Now I am very much aware of how we must maintain a healthy colon - and how allowing a build up of that toxic fecal matter can be a fatal mistake.

I do not want to be &quot; a man with a belly &quot;. Whenever I see one, I cannot help but wonder if that person will end up like Pappa C.

Unfortunately, recent statistics from the American Cancer Society indicate that 1 out of every 17 Americans WILL become a victim of colon cancer in their lifetime .

Numbers may not make much of an impression, so to get a better sense of the seriousness of these statistics, try this... 

Imagine you are at a major league hockey game or indoor soccer match attended by 17,000 sports fans. One thousand of them would fill the ice rink or playing field. That 1000 is exactly how many of the people in a crowd of 17,000 will one day suffer from colon cancer. Will you be one of them? 

It&apos;s hard these days to avoid over-processed foods loaded with chemicals, drinks laced with caffeine and loaded with refined sugar, and all the toxic pollution in the air and water. But you can do something to counteract their toxic effects ... simply by drinking Holy Tea to help flush the toxins, parasites, and impacted fecal matter out of your body and maintain colon health.

 The primary function of Holy Tea is to gently cleanse the digestive tract of toxic waste material and parasites, restore a healthy digestive system, and reduce the risk of all the ailments that are caused by autointoxification, yeast overgrowth, and parasites. 

Not dealing with this toxic build-up early enough could lead to serious and sometimes fatal diseases like Crohn&apos;s disease, spastic colon, ileitis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, enterocolitis, leaky gut syndrome, and cancer of the colon or rectum.

 Too many people are suffering from very painful conditions and dying horrible deaths that could be prevented by maintaining a healthy digestive system. 

 
 Holy Tea Improves Quality of Life... 

 &quot;I have been drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea for almost 5 years. It has helped me lose over 50 pounds and keep it off, and keep me healthier than I had been for 40 years. I can now travel and enjoy my retirement, where before I did not feel well enough to do so. I am amazed by the results of the Tea for both me and friends I have told about it. One friend of mine, who is 70 years old, has had terrible migraines for the past 10 years, which were about to drive him crazy. After a couple of months drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea, he no longer has the migraines. Some of the results I see with the Tea just baffle me.&quot;
 - Nancy Moy, Chicago, IL 

 &quot;I own and operate an Assisted Living Facility that houses 15 residents. I began drinking Dr. Miller&apos;s Tea about six years ago due to my high blood pressure and blood sugar problems, both of which are health issues that run in my family. I now have no problems with either of those issues, and I have no doubt that the Tea is the reason. 

 After I had been taking the Tea personally for a couple of years, I began to serve it to the residents of the ALF, every one of them. They all won&apos;t be without it now. I&apos;ve personally seen it correct a multitude of health issues in people from their mid 50s to over 90 years old. I have a 90 year old resident who I believe the Tea is the only thing that provides her any hope of a quality of life. If she doesn&apos;t drink the Tea, she is like a sack of bricks. It&apos;s as if the Tea erases 20 years of aging from her. 

 Also, my sister was having health problems and had been told that she needed to schedule surgery for intestinal problems. As soon as she told me, I made sure she was drinking the Tea. She has not had surgery and now has none of the health issues that were prompting the surgery. Her husband was literally dumbfounded by the results. Needless to say, they are avid Dr. Miller Tea drinkers. 

 The Tea works wonders.&quot;
