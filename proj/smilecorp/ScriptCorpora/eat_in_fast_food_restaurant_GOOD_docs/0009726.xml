It depends on the type of restaurant and what kind of equipment they use. For example, some of the greatest demands on energy at a fast-food restaurant could be the ovens at a pizza bakery, the deep freezers and refrigerators at an ice-cream shop, or the fryers at a burger place.

Restaurants are finding ways to increase their efficiency. Kitchens with multiple ovens can be made more efficient by monitoring traffic in the restaurant and operating only the ovens needed to serve the volume of customers at that time. A Burger King in New Jersey is even installing a device in its parking lot that will harvest electricity from the energy of braking cars in the parking lot.
