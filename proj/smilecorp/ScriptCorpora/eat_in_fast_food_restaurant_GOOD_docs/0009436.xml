Cedar Brewing Company: Cedar Rapids&apos; Brew Pub
 
 Helpfulness
 Jewelslover   108 reviews 
If you like local brew pubs this is the place to go, they have the usual wheat&apos;s, ale&apos;s and stouts. There are usually limited time special beers as well. They even brew their own cream soda!

They have good food too. The regular bar and grill type items - salads, sandwichs, etc.

The atmosphere is that of a sports bar, there are lots of tv&apos;s to watch the game on. The restaurant is pretty new and looks nice inside and out.

 Favorite Dish: The chicken fingers were good.

Happy Joe&apos;s Pizza: Happy Joe&apos;s Pizza is Mmmm Good!!!
 
 Helpfulness
 Jewelslover   108 reviews 
Happy Joe&apos;s Pizza has always been a favorite of mine. Mostly because I love the Happy Joe&apos;s Special - Canadian Bacon and Sauerkraut. That&apos;s right - Sauerkraut!!! But they also have your usual pizza&apos;s including taco pizza. They also serve ice cream and pasta.

Bishop&apos;s Cafeteria: Bishop&apos;s Chocolate Ambrosia Pie Mmmmm
 
 Helpfulness
 Jewelslover   108 reviews 
Bishop&apos;s is another one of those restaurants that&apos;s been around forever. I remember eating here as a little girl. They have everything from fried chicken to baked fish to swiss steak to ham, and all of the fixin&apos;s on the side, veggies, and rolls. But what they are really known for are their desserts, and if you love chocolate try the Chocolate Ambrosia pie.

 Favorite Dish: The Chocolate Ambrosia pie has a graham cracker crust, has a thick, sort of whipped chocolate pudding layer on the bottom, then a thick whipped topping layer topped with chocolate shavings. You&apos;ll definately be back for this pie!

Little King: Locals Favorite Sub Sandwiches!
 
 Helpfulness
 Jewelslover   108 reviews 
This place has been around probably longer than I have. It&apos;s a local favorite and probably the best sub sandwich I&apos;ve ever had! The Little King Special is the best.

The restaurant is primarily used by people working in downtown Cedar Rapids for lunch, so has limited hours of business:

Monday through Friday 10:00am-2:30pm.

Bistro on First: Classy Art, Awesome Food
 
 Helpfulness
 mgarver   1 reviews 
This is one of the snazziest that Cedar Rapids has to offer. Located right along the river in downtown, the restaurant has an unassuming face. The bar is beautiful, dim, and cozy; perfect for small chat and intimate pre-dinner drinks. The main dining room features old brick walls, but has funky cutting edge lighting features for all the eclectic Matisse and Picasso style art.
If there is an unfavorable aspect to the restaurant, it is that the menu has remained unchanged in it&apos;s several years of business. Though some consider that a GOOD thing!

 Favorite Dish: The entrees I have had are the mango citrus salmon and the pepper beef tenderloin, and both were flavorful. The chefs there have a great sense of flavor nuances and mix them well...definitely not your hum-drum-run of the mill meat and potatoes that are so prevalent in midwestern towns.
But the best are the creme brulees. Warm, creamy, and sweet, the crust is perfectly reminiscent of toasted marshmellows in its flavor, and of smooth hard candy in texture.

I really like the Tick Tock,...

 natdog   2 reviews 
I really like the Tick Tock, near Daniels Park. It has a lot of atmosphere, and cool pictures on the walls. Also, I&apos;m a big fan of Vitos on 42nd Street, good place to see some friends! Also, go to the Irish democrat.

North Country Steakhouse: Cook your own steak
 
 Helpfulness
 Jim_Eliason   3971 reviews 
This place has a unique concept in that it is set up like a butcher&apos;s shop and you select your cut of meat. From there, they provide marinades and grills for you to cook your own steak.
