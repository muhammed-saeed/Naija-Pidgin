 1950-1959 Life In Columbus/Bartholomew County 
Post by admin on Mar 13, 2005, 11:53pm

Considering I was born in 1952, there&apos;s not alot I remember about Columbus in the 1950&apos;s. Really, to be quite honest here, I was too young to really pay much attention to anything other than the downtown area, and our Center Street neighborhood in East Columbus.

I began school in 1958. This was before preschools and kindergartens and such. I guess the world of education wasn&apos;t as complicated to us all then, so first grade was it.

My first grade teacher was Miss Kangas. Orris Manley was the Principal. There were&quot;patrol boys&quot;in this day and age, and it was quite the honor to get picked as a patrol boy.

I walked to school. It wasn&apos;t that far from the house, but I remember that very first day of school...leaving the house early in the morning...mom stood at the gate and watched me walk down Center Street until I reached Southeastern and turned the corner.

We didn&apos;t have flourescent lights inside the school (since I was in the first grade, I my classroom was in the building on the left, if facing. The one that still stands today). The lights were nothing more than big white globes that hung from the ceiling. WhyI remember that, I don&apos;t know.

Since this was the age of the&quot;H-Bomb&quot;and the Cold War, I don&apos;t ever recall any&quot;duck and cover&quot;drills, but that&apos;s not saying we didn&apos;t have them.

Besides our studies, we had music, choirs, and plays. Quite a few as I recall.

The property was surrounded by a chain link fence and there was a basketball court on the playground in the back of the school.

A friend of mine who attended the old Garfield School at this time told me there wasn&apos;t a lunchroom in the school, and they were bussed over to State Street for lunch.

We lived next door to Russell&apos;s Grocery. They were open, I think, until around 5 or 6 six days a week, and closed on Sundays. In fact, not too many places were open on Sundays back in these days.

About a block and a half on south, the railroad tracks separated our suburban area from farmland. Cornfields ran as far as the eye could see, and there was a small hill on the other side of the cornfield where we went sledding on those snowy days when school was cancelled.

The big thing to have at the age of 9 or 10 or 12 was a bike. A bike was something special to me, as my parents couldn&apos;t afford to buy one for me. But I remember all the neighborhood kids decorating our bikes with paper mache and balloons and parading up and down the neighborhood.

I remember one time the city was repaving Center Street, and I sat up a lemonade stand and sold lemonade one day. I think I made around a dollar and that&apos;s not counting what the lemons or sugar cost, but immediately shut the stand down and headed for Russell&apos;s Grocery to celebrate with a nickel&apos;s worth of Bazooka bubblegum and one of those big strips of taffy they sold back then.

I remember JC. He was a retarded man who lived down from us, and more or less hobbled when he walked. JC was severely handicapped, and slobbered when he tried to talk. He always wore overalls and a dirty white tee shirt. I&apos;d like to say that I was one of the few that didn&apos;t make fun of JC, but regretfully, I did.

Center Street was filled with small modest homes in this time, and looks terribly different from today. The house where I grew up still stands, and is some kind of business today. The yard, where I once played kickball, and cowboys and indians and shot marbles is now covered in asphalt. The trees I used to climb are long gone, as well as the fence I&apos;d climb over to go to my friend&apos;s house and get yelled at.

There was a vacant lot in back of our house. A lone shed stood there, and that was our clubhouse.

It wasn&apos;t unusual to see water pumps sticking up out of front yards on Center Street, and there even remained a few outhouses in back of some of the houses.

Milk trucks made their weekly or daily rounds up and down the street. And remember those little mail carts the mailmen used to drive?

On the corner of Center and State Street was the Jay-C store (where the Salvation Army is, or was).

I read in the obits a couple of weeks past that the owner of Carson&apos;s Flower Shop, which sat next to the old Coffman Drug Store passed away. Coffman&apos;s was the other place some of my money was spent, as well as the old Army Surplus store.

The times that stick out the most these days are those long ago days when we all played on the railroad tracks. I know I told this to some&quot;Uppity People&quot;in Columbus a few years ago, and they turned their noses up like&quot;how could your parents ever let you play in a place like that?&quot;

The railroad tracks hold many fond memories for me. I&apos;d pack a lunch (usually peanut butter and jelly sandwiches) and load them in my trust army backpack, load my canteen with water, and meet my friends at the end of Center Street for a day&apos;s excursion down the tracks. Normally, the trip went as far as the old iron bridge, which still stands, in back of the area where Kirby Risk is today.

I remember how the rails glistened and shimmered in the hot summer sun. I had a small transistor radio that was turned to WIFE or WAKY and our trip was made more enjoyable by the&quot;boss&quot;sounds that came from that little orange radio.

Well...these are just a few of my personal memories of growing up in the 1950&apos;s.

I know many more of you remember this time and it would be nice to hear your memories of growing up in the 1950&apos;s...

Hi Dave, and&quot;Oh, goodie!&quot;1950s! Loved your accounts of your youth. And I remember railroad tracks, and probably I guess you did take your life into your own hands---playing around them!!!! Was fun, tho&apos;, wasn&apos;t it? ;-)

The RR tracks that I frequented were&quot;somehow&quot;around Cummins and the Golden Foundry area, don&apos;t know how they all connected, tho&apos;. For heavens sake, we rode the horses along, and actually right down the middle of the tracks, and it seems to me that there were RR tracks out by the fairgrounds, as well. Can&apos;t picture that the horse I own now would much&quot;cabbage&quot;to me taking him there!!!! It would surely be the&quot;Mad Hatter&apos;s Wild Ride,&quot;and I am too old for that foolishness! ;-)

1950s--Pioneer Days. As I recall, and feel free to correct my&quot;dating&quot;of the event, took place on or near Columbus Day, mid-October. Washington Street was closed and booths set up by civic organizations. Seems the event went on for several days, perhaps a weekend, just guessing on that one.

My dad was responsible for the&quot;game&quot;for one booth, either sponsored by the Lion&apos;s Club or the Saddle Club, and I don&apos;t remember which. AND am sure that the SPCA would never approve the&quot;game&quot;now, and the protests would have been many. Remember how you could throw ping-pong balls into bowls and win a gold fish? Same idea, except you threw an embrodiery (sp.) hoop to attempt to&quot;ring&quot;a duck, a duck that you could take home for keeps!!!! (Hey, Bob, Barkhimer, that is, is that how you got Rudolph? ;-) This crazy&quot;game&quot;became the hit on the street, and everyone was carrying around a duck they had won. So popular was this booth, that soon they ran out of ducks. My dad was out and about searching the farms for more ducks for the booth. A trek he made numerous times to restock! Think he must have hit every farm around to supply the booth.

The Junior Trail Blazers offered pony rides as our fund-raiser. We set up&quot;shop&quot;west of Washington St. in a parking lot, and led our horses so kids could have a ride. Don&apos;t recall how many actual&quot;takers&quot;we had, but know we had a lot of fun waiting for&quot;customers.&quot;Think that was where I perfected my ability to jump onto the horse from the back, just like those cowboys in the movies at the Rio did!

Along those same lines, and about within the same time frame, Cummins held a company picnic for employees at the fairgrounds each year. Jr. Trail Blazers were&quot;hired&quot;to provide pony rides. And we each received a paycheck, if you will, and in a handsome sum, as I recall, from Cummins, for providing our horse and our&quot;leading skills&quot;for the day. The rides were free to employees and families, and we never stopped! Pooped at the end of the day, you bet! I always used my wages to purchase school clothes. One time my horse turned up lame on the day, I cried and cried, and begged and begged to make use of my dad&apos;s horse, to no avail, Daddy did not think his horse was&quot;bombproof&quot;enough for me to handle. And I cried some more----there went my money for clothes that fall!

Thoughts for the day, and I really do need to do something besides&quot;haunt&quot;this site.

Hello to all who are contributing to this board. Ive really enjoyed your posts. I check the board almost every time I log on. If these notes are half as interesting as what Ive been reading, Ill be pleased. Perhaps the following will remind you of something more you can write.

I REMEMBER:

The Second Street bridge over the White River.
The steel Tenth Street bridge over Haw Creek.
Steam engines on the railroads and the water tower near the depot.
The first time I saw a diesel engine on the railroad.
The round house and turntable at the west end of Fourth Street.
The railroad track crossing Washington Street between the Coca Cola plant and Fifteenth Street.
Two railroad tracks crossing Pearl Street, Sycamore Street, Chestnut Street, California Street, Union Street, Grand Avenue, Michigan Avenue, Sixteenth Street, Seventeenth Street, Nineteenth Street, Cottage Avenue, Twenty-Second Street, Central Avenue, Twenty-Fifth Street and US 31. The Pennsylvania tracks went to Shelbyville and the New York tracks went to Greensburg.

The railroad running to Madison.
Westermeiers Hardware at 1015 Third Street at California Street. During the Christmas season, you could operate the train display from the outside, by touching a card that was inside the window glass.
The Schaefer Milling Co.s flour mill at 1014 Third Street.
The Farmers Marketing Plant between Second and Third Streets at the intersection with State Street, and the milk trucks unloading the cans of milk. Was the Valley Lee brand butter in the yellow cartons was produced at that plant?
The Farmers Marketing lockers on the north side of Third Street across from the Vollmer Avenue intersection. You could rent freezer space and it was accessible 24 hours a day.
The crowds at the Eighth Street Ball Park with its concrete grandstand.
Wilbur Pancake kicking the light pole as he performed his first bast coaching duties.
The Pearl Street gym.
The old iron bridge crossing the Flat Rock on US 31A north.
What I think was the first drive-up at Carmel L. Carmichaels Restaurant at 544 Jackson Street and the fish sandwiches they served.
The Red Barn on Twenty-Fifth Street which I think was the first fast food restaurant in Columbus.
The gas pumps with the glass top at Anthonys Grocery and Filling Station at 2032 Indiana Avenue. The glass top was marked and the operator used a hand lever to pump the gas up to the mark for the number of gallons the customer wanted. Then gravity would move the gas into the tank or can.
The Thomas Frances Comfort Childrens Home at Illinois and Cherry Streets. They farmed land along the south side of Illinois west of Gladstone Avenue and east of Gladstone at the current location of Fodrea School. The county highway garage and the new county home were built on land that was farmed by the Childrens Home.
The Farmall Cub the Childrens Home used to take the corn and tomatoes to Morgans Packing Plant.
The County Home when it was located on US 31A South.
A. Tross Department Store.
Pennys downtown and the little metal boxes that ran on tracks so the clerk could send the customers money up to the cashier on the second floor, who would then make the change and send it back down to the clerk.
The public restrooms in the basement of the Courthouse and City Hall.
Three theaters downtown. The Crump, The Mode and The Rio.

The White House.
Goodman&amp;Jester Department Store.
Simmen Hardware Store.
The scales outside F. J. Meyer and Son at 435 Washington Street.
The red fire boxes on street corners.
Sears having only a catalog store.
The shoe shine parlor and hat cleaning store at 419 Fourth Street.
Mrs. Fishers Restaurant and her fish sandwiches and Mr. Fishers Bakery at 317&amp;319 Fourth Street. Around 1953 or 1954 my allowance was $.50 a day and I went there for lunch and got, I think two but it may have been one, fish sandwich and red pop in a glass bottle and stopped in the bakery for a sweet roll to eat on the way back to school, and I had change left!
Montgomery Ward&amp;Company at 538-540 Washington Street.
Krogers at Sixth and Washington and the smell around the coffee grinders.
Bonds DX Service Station on the west side of Washington at Sixth.
The A&amp;P at 620 Washington with parking at 626.
The Standard Food Market at 930 Washington Street.
Thompson Dairy at 1120 Washington Street.
Franke&amp;Son Dairy at 2241 State Street.
Franke&amp;Son Dairy Bar at 2241 State Street. The dairy bar was a restaurant and was located in the front of the building.
Purity Milk Company on McKinley Avenue.
Zaharako Dairy at 718 Pearl Street with the restaurant which was frequented by the school kids at lunch as well as before and after school.
Milk delivered to your door in a glass bottle with the cream on top.
Ice delivered to your home and the four color cards. The card was hung in the window and the color at the top told the route man how many pounds of ice you needed that day. My Grandparents had and used an Icebox in those days.

Oh, my goodness----what memories, EC, and loved every single one!!!!!!!!!! And thank you, as you did answer my prior question about&quot;The Pine Knot.&quot;The minute I saw the names----that was it!!!! I could picture it all in my mind, but the names were just not there.

And really, I do have a life besides sitting at this computer recalling Columbus memories, but whoa, this is so much fun.

You really triggered a ton of other memories for me. And I will have to decide what I want to&quot;tackle&quot;next. Please, please, keep posting, love it!!!

First of all.. .. EC! Thanks for sharing so much!

I&apos;m going to have to take one thing at a time 

 The round house and turntable at the west end of Fourth Street.
 

I&apos;ve heard stories about this, but I don&apos;t ever recall seeing it. A friend of mine told me he took part in tearing all this stuff out.

This is something I sure would like to get a picture of to post to the website.

As best to anyone&apos;s memories, where on 4th was it located? Was it on past Lindsay?

Also, while we&apos;re talking about trains: Two things--

1) I didn&apos;t have the opportunity to&quot;remember&quot;seeing a steam locomotive in Columbus. I remember all the diesels with the Pennsylvania Railroad logo on the side. We called them work engines.

2) When I first got off the train at my duty station in Germany, there, billowing away in full glory, was a steam engine. It was quite a rush for this&quot;kid&quot;of 21, and I stood for a half hour, enthralled and amazed by the site. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by nancystevens on Apr 7, 2005, 8:25am

Well, EC, you gave us so many choices of things to recall. It really is a puzzlement to choose just one. But......

Stadler&apos;s meat packing plant and stockyard.

The plant was within walking distance of Wilson Jr. High, for and with some Jr. High class, we made a field trip there to be shown the plant. Was a ton of fun, as you had time to chat with friends walking to and fro.

Once there------it was a revelation to my eyes and my stomach when I learned about the&quot;skins&quot;on the delicious hot dogs that we roasted over an open fire many times at Saddle Club and Trail Blazer weinie roasts!!!! Yep, they made use of all the body parts, including the intestines! Took me a long time to finally decide to overlook that fact and continue to enjoy the wonderful hot dogs.

Now the butchers there must have still had a lot of &apos;kid&apos; in them yet----these dear souls gave the boys handfuls of eyeballs as&quot;tokens of their visit.&quot;And boys being boys-----en route back to school, they would walk in front of the girls, drop an eyeball, and then step on it! Squish!!! And of course, we&quot;entertained&quot;them with lots of shrieks and screams!!!

While thinking of Stadlers. Mrs, Stadler approached my dad at O&apos;Bryan&apos;s jewelry store and was interested in purchasing a diamond for her husband to be put in a ring. The deal was made and the ring mounted. Remember my dad saying that it was the biggest diamond he had ever sold up to that point.

Knowing my dad as well as I did, I can just hear him telling Mrs. Stadler that her husband should just put it on and wear it, and enjoy it. No enjoyment if one put it in a safety deposit box, wearing it just for special occasions. And wear it, Mr. Stadler did.

Even out in the stockyards, at the gate where the cows were herded through the mud. Oops! Mr. Stadler lost the diamond out of his ring, right there!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mrs. Stadler took it upon herself to march right out into the mud, and search for the diamond through one handful of mud at a time. And yes, she did find it!!!!! I believe she did encourage Mr. Stadler to leave the ring at home if he was planning to oversee the cattle again. 

Have thought of that story over and over in my lifetime being brought up in a jewelry store. Many is the time that a small stone&quot;has gotten away&quot;from my dad, and it was my chore to search for it. Down on my hands and knees searching the floor and the nearby trash can. Much as I hated that chore, I could only thank my lucky stars that I wasn&apos;t searching in the mud like Mrs. Stadler did!

Horses again, and was just recalling this story with a Columbus friend yesterday, as we talked about Brown Co. and the park. The Saddle Club members would rent a stock truck from Stadler&apos;s on a weekend. They would load up, perhaps 20 members&apos; horses and head to Brown Co. State Park to ride the trail system there. Ah, truly a great ride, and one I miss here in So. California.

The drive, as you know, went over hill and dale. My mom always drove a car behind the truck in case of an emergency, and it seems that several of the men actually rode in the truck, sitting astride the slat sides to watch for possible problems with the horses.

Going up one hill, a horse lost its footing and went down. Now that created huge chaos with the other horses. I remember being so scared. For whatever reason, the ponies were loaded last. I was crying and crying for fear that my&quot;Teddy&quot;was going to be hurt through all this commotion. Remember my dad telling me that&quot;Teddy&quot;was a&quot;trooper&quot;and holding up all the rest of the horses while the problem was corrected. Am sure the last thing he needed at that moment was an hysterical daughter!

And Brown Co. stories are left for another day!!!

My History Part 1

Hello again. Ive been working on this for weeks or is it months! You saw my list last week. I wrote that list while thinking about what I could add to this board. Part of that list and what Ill be posting have already been entered by you. However, my memories of those topics may take us down another path. Well see!




I was born during the last quarter of 1941 in East Columbus, Indiana. I spent my early years in East Columbus. The History of Bartholomew County Indiana Volume II states that East Columbus was annexed by the City of Columbus on May 20, 1946. However, it wasnt until a remonstrance went through the court system and the Indiana Supreme Court ruled for the city in 1949, that five-thousand people were added to the population of Columbus.

Were we poor? I dont recall thinking in terms of rich or poor. We lived with what we had. I think everyone did back then. Now dont get me wrong. I knew we didnt live in a big house, but I dont recall thinking I wish I could be rich. Was it my youth or the times in which I was raised?

Sunday was fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy day. Most weeks a live chicken was purchased on Saturday and dressed out by my parents. I can still see the chickens hanging from the clothes line by their feet. I also can smell the feathers after the chicken was dipped in the boiling water. If my brother and I were home, we helped pluck the feathers.

After coming home from Sunday church, my mother began the Sunday dinner. For the rest of us, it was time for the Swing and Sway with Sammy Kaye show on the floor model Philco radio. I can still hear the base rattle the speaker on that radio! Was that sound produced by a bass fiddle? I havent seen anyone playing a bass fiddle in a long time. My father played the piano and the saxophone. I am told that he played in a band, but I dont have any recollections of that band. As I recall, we spent a lot of time listening to music on that radio. Your Hit Parade, Fred Warring and the Pennsylvanians and Spike Jones are a few that come to mind.

We attended church and Sunday school every Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Wednesday evening and a Sunday school class party once a month. Dress on Sunday for the males was coat, tie and hat. The ladies were also dressed for the occasion and that included stockings with the seam down the back. They were sold two in a package, one for each leg. That seam had to be straight and she most likely wore a girdle. The ladies also wore gloves and a hat with a lot of them including a veil and earrings. In those days we didnt see many pierced ears. Her purse hung from her arm, not her shoulder. I believe the first time I saw a purse with a shoulder strap was in the mid fifties when a member who was a Navy nurse, was home on leave.


Did we see advertising in church? You bet. Remember the hand fans with the funeral home names on the back. Those fans were certainly needed on those pre air-conditioned summer days! It had to be very HOT, before we were allowed to remove our jacket.

Saturday suppers were sandwiches. By the way, dinner was the middle meal and supper was the evening meal. Hamburgers and made at home fries were served often. Sometimes, it was sweet rolls and lunch meat. Mom would slice the sweet roll and put the meat and cheese on the bottom half of the roll. She would then put the icing side against the cheese which kept the icing off our fingers. I still have this type of sandwich today. With the sour of the meat and the sweet of the roll its a sweet&amp;sour meal.

Saturday was also the day we were allowed to drink a soda pop. Most meals we drank milk that was delivered to the door in a glass quart bottle. Do you remember shaking the bottle to mix the cream that had risen to the top? Water or cold sweetened tea was another option. Another treat my mother and her mother served at supper was fresh side with wilted lettuce. As I understand it, fresh side is bacon before the meat is smoked. Another evening meal was bean soup, and the beans came in a bag not a jar. Those beans were always soaked overnight and cooked for hours the next day. Other options were meat loaf, and a lot of fried beef, pork and fish. Mom used a lot of Crisco, but I dont recall seeing Lard in the house often. We ate pies and cakes that were made from scratch. The extra pie dough was sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar baked and eaten as a snack. That was a special treat! Some pies and cakes were purchased at stores or bakeries. I certainly enjoyed the three layer chocolate pound cakes and the three or three and one half inch Blue Bird pies. The three layer coconut pound size cake wasnt bad either!

Hi to all, and EC, not only did you take us&quot;down a path,&quot;but gave us the road map! Loved the memories. AND for me, you have clarified a nightly occurance in my life now when you wrote: By the way, dinner was the middle meal and supper was the evening meal. , as every evening I call my mom, now age 93, and in the process ask how her dinner was, and always, ALWAYS, she corrects me, and says,&quot;You mean&quot;supper?&quot;In my head, I thought dinner and supper meant the same!!! I stand corrected by you both. 

At my church, First Christian, I recall the hand fans AND on some of those back rows, the little long handled gadgets that the hearing impaired used. And the dear lady that always sat in front of us with a fur draped around her shoulders, complete with a head (of a mink?) and its beady, glass brown eyes staring right at me! And to keep a young kid quiet, did your mom ever make&quot;twins in a cradle&quot;out of a hankie, to keep you entertained? Yes, a hankerchief was a must, your mom tied your Sunday School money in the corner.

I wish I could be as organized as you, EC, in collecting my thoughts. Mine seem so disjointed in comparison. Your comment about purchased bakery goods sent me down another&quot;path.&quot;Often, in my lifetime, people have asked me,&quot;How in the world did your family afford to have horses?&quot;Know my dad responded,&quot;Well, I don&apos;t have a boat, and I don&apos;t drink.&quot;And that was true.

But in thinking about it, and knowing what the upkeep to have horses today is, I, as an adult, have to add. We&quot;worked&quot;to have them. During the winter Daddy would buy day old bread at Sap&apos;s for a penny a loaf, perhaps filling the whole back seat of the car in one trip. He would toss the bread into the hay mow, and it would freeze, and remain fresh. He used this bread to supplement the horse feed.

The&quot;work&quot;part came probably sometime in November, after the corn had been harvested. Daddy had permission, from the Marr family, I&apos;m sure, to&quot;glean&quot;their corn fields. Armed with gunny sacks, and dressed warmly, as&quot;the frost was definitely on the pun-kin,&quot;we walked the rows of harvested corn searching for the stray ear that had been missed. Not too bad when you started out, but the bag got really heavy before we got back to the car to start another bag. Know that when I convinced my dad to trailer along my horse, I found the job more bearable, with a bag over each side of my horse, the job became a whole lot easier. ;-)

In the summer months the horses grazed in the pasture field and I don&apos;t recall that we supplemented their feed much then. Summer was also when Daddy purchased several ton of hay from a local farmer, brought in several loads, and stored in our hay mow. And always, for several days after a delivery, Daddy would check for&quot;heat&quot;within the stacked hay, fortunately only recall once when we were out in the barn, feverishly moving bales of hay to prevent a fire.

And do you recall, along those same lines, when a barn out in the country would burn----spontaneous combustion was the demon. That was when I learned the meaning of&quot;bucket brigade&quot;as people, from near and far, would come to form a line passing buckets of water to fight the fire. In my mind, I can still see the line of people on the horizon, silhouetted against the blazing barn.

I really must save the rest for another day.

 TEXT My History Part 2

Soda Pop came in glass bottles, and the cost was a Nickel. The Coke brand came in six-ounce bottles and had the name of the bottling plant city in raised letters on the bottom of the bottle. Pepsi and most other brands came in twelve-ounce bottles. Big Red was called Cream Soda and was bottled by Barqs. Barqs also sold Orange and Grape Soda. Those bottles had a checkered pattern in the glass. Was it Nehi that had the bright yellow slightly sour Lemon drink? What was the name of the Chocolate Soda that you had to shake before opening? I still see RC Cola. Its been years since Id seen Double Cola. Last year, I discovered it is being sold in Columbus. Didnt Double Cola give us an extra kick? Also, I think it came in sixteen-ounce bottles.

Did you pour your five-cent bag of Planters Peanuts into your bottle of cola? I did, and the salt changed the taste of the first few drinks. Id seen the big boys doing that. Some of the nuts always stuck to the bottom of the bottle. The big boys tilted their heads back, held the bottle upright, and knocked those nuts off the bottom of the bottle. The first time I tried doing that, I thought I had loosened my front teeth!

If we had the money, we could visit the neighborhood grocery and get a cold bottle of pop from a water filled cooler for a nickel. Before refrigeration the water was chilled with ice. The top of those coolers was hinged in the middle. The customer raised one end of the lid and picked out the brand/flavor they wanted. If they didnt see the desired brand they moved to the other end and raised that lid. If the machine had been filled recently, you could get a warm drink.

An opener was mounted on the front of the machine. A cover was over the opener and had a cup that caught the cap. If that cup was full, the cap rolled across the floor. We hooked the cap in the opener and pushed the bottle downward. Did you ever take a close look at any of those? I dont think the Health Department ever inspected some of the openers I took a look at!

Hostess Twinkies, Cup Cakes, Snow Balls and Banana Flips was a nickel also. With that nickel, we got two Twinkies, Cup Cakes and Snow Balls. Wasnt one of those Snow Balls white and the other pink? At some point in time, the price per package was raised to six cents and then to seven. Speaking of snacks, do you remember Gordon and Chesty potato chips and pretzels?

Refrigeration brought the coin operated machines and that changed the penny price increases. I dont think the machines were ever designed to accept pennies, just silver. Thus, we came to accept the nickel price increase when making a purchase from a machine! They solved the warm drink problem by building coin operated machines with slots that ran from end to end across the top of the machine. These machines had one slot on one end that ran from the front to the back. This slot was on the end where the coin mechanism was mounted. The customer would lift the lid which was hinged in the back and choose his brand, put his money into the mechanism, slide his choice into the dispensing slot which had a cam style arm. If the correct number of coins was in the coin box, the lock was released. As you pulled the drink up, the bottom of the arm blocked the entrance to keep a second bottle from being pulled from the machine at the same time. The opposite end would open for the store employee to reload the machine. If the employees kept it filled, the theory of last in was the last out, the problem of receiving a warm bottle was solved! Engineering to the rescue again!

Remember the Wonder bread ad? These ads said Wonder bread built your body eight ways? The Colonel bread man said if you ate Wonder bread, it built your body eight weird ways! Another bakery brand was Omar. Omar delivered their products door to door. One of my grandmothers used the double loaf Omar bread and she made the best peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. One slice folded over was just the right snack size.

I remember hobos knocking on the back door at meal time. If dad was home, he was served food in a tin pie pan. I dont remember them eating inside, just on the back step. If dad was gone, Mother, my brother and I hid in the pantry! After we installed an inside bathroom, we still had a pantry in the end of the bathroom. Yes, we had an outhouse before we installed the inside bath.

During our early years, our bedtime regime was to get our pajamas on and then have a slice of bread that was broken into pieces, placed in a glass and then milk was poured into the glass. We used a spoon to get the bread and drank the remaining milk. My wife says that she and her brother also had a spoonful of sugar with their bread and milk. In the pre air-conditioned warm summer nights we headed to the front porch swing with Dad, and sang after eating/drinking our bread and milk. I never did understand heat lightening which we saw while sitting on that swing!

When my brother and I were older, nearing our early teen years, we slept in a tent in our back yard most of the summer. The tent was six feet by eight and we used three folding cots. Friends stayed with us often. We had four in the tent if the fourth guy had a cot or some means to sleep on the ground in the center aisle. If it rained, we had damp bedding, however a storm would force us inside. We didnt sleep-in as the dark brown canvas turned that tent into an oven after the sun came up.

The outhouse and a garbage bin were in the back yard next to the alley. The garbage bin was made of cement blocks and was about three feet tall with an opening on the alley side. A metal trash container was inside the bin for garbage from the kitchen. Paper was burned in a burning barrel next to the bin. Coal ashes from the furnace and green garden waste were placed on the floor of the bin. When the truck came, they would shovel the waste from the floor into the truck. In the summer months, someone would spray the bins in an attempt to control the flies and mosquito population. Im thinking the Health Department must have done the spraying. In the fall the leaves were raked into piles next to the street, and then burned. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Hi to all, and here with another memory. (I see that I made it into two. )

Anyone remember the&quot;donkey basketball games&quot;down at the Pearl Street gym? Am fairly certain that these were sponsored by the Lion&apos;s Club.

A truck load of donkeys were brought in, am assuming they were rented for the evening through some enterprising proprietor. They arrived at the site in a big truck with lots of writing on it, advertising the&quot;contents.&quot;Their feet were covered to protect the gym floor. And then the chaotic evening of fun began.

Am pretty sure that Lion&apos;s Club members composed one team, and played against some other organization in town. Know that Liz Hennessey, my next door neighbor and older than me by several years, and quite an artist, painted shirts for my dad&apos;s team. And the design---well, of all things, it was pictures of pin-up girls in various poses!

Tickets were sold for this money making event, and the gym was always packed to capacity. It was surely an evening full of hysterical laughter, as the men attempted to score a basket from the back of a stubborn donkey. Remember laughing til my sides hurt at all the &apos;goings on&apos; on the basketball court. It surely must have been an event fraught with the chance of injuries, but have no recollection of that happening.

I recall that this event went on for several years. And much to my surprise, a similar event was sponsored here in So. Cal back in the late 70s at a local high school. And it was, indeed, as much fun then as I had remembered from my youth.

Sort of along those same lines, does anyone remember Saddle Club members putting on exhibition games of&quot;broomstick polo&quot;out at the fairgrounds? (Might have had some games at the Saddle Club grounds, as well.) For polo sticks, the men used brooms with the bristles cut down very short. It was not nearly as funny to watch as donkey basketball, and definitely seemed to be more dangerous. Know that my dad had to leave a game in a hurry to go to the hospital, as he got hit in the head with a broomstick and had to have stitches as a result.

My History Part 3


I was in High School when I ate my first baked potato. We left school early for a game at Jeffersonville, and had lunch at The Gause Caf which was at 426 Third. We were served a baked potato and I had to watch the guys around me to learn how to eat it! We rode on a Trailways Bus on that trip and coming home the bus was in an accident. None of I-65 was open and we traveled to Jeffersonville on US 31. Around midnight, the driver was passing a slower car and then slowed quickly to stop when he saw the railroad crossing signs for the Madison Branch Tracks. Those tracks crossed the road north of Whipkers Market. When he moved back into the right lane, he hadnt cleared the car he passed and it must have been bumper to bumper as I dont think we waited for the Sheriff or State Police. Needless to say we were a little late returning to the gym that night.

Another late return was when the team traveled in a Lepperd Bus to Rushville and it broke down before we left Rushville for the return trip. They put us in taxies and took us to Greensburg. We ate at a restaurant on the town square while waiting for a bus from Columbus. I think it was where Storeys is located today. The driver of the cab I was in told us his cab was operated with LP gas. Until then I thought all car engines ran on gasoline. The first time I saw a single dill pickle in a sealed plastic tube was on a road trip. I think it was at the New Castle Gym and I bought one during the Dogs game.

In 1957 or 1958 the Harlem Magicians or Globetrotters were playing at Memorial Gym. The coaches told us that practice would be shortened that evening. They must have arrived early, because they came in before the coaches were ready to stop practice. After each practice, the forwards and centers had to touch the rim on the four practice goals along the side of the main court a certain number of times before we could go in and shower. As soon as we left the game floor, they started shooting. Some left their coats on and some dropped their coat on top of their gym bag. They took shots from all over the court. Center court, both sides, it didnt matter. It didnt matter from where they took the shot, most of the time it was RIP! A few shots were missed, but most went through the net without hitting any rim.

I went home, did my homework, ate supper and returned to the gym for the game. My brother has told me that Goose Tatum and Marcus Haynes were in that game. I dont think the show today is much different from that game. Mentioning the shower after practice reminds me about the trainers Hot Rub. The upperclassmen had an initiation ceremony for the underclassmen that involved Hot Rub! If you participated in sports at CHS, youll no doubt remember that initiation ritual.

My first bicycle was a used 26 inch and I must have been nine or ten. My brother and I shared that first bicycle. It was a cold Christmas day and I couldnt wait to ride it. Two blocks from home I turned to the edge of the street to turn around, hit a patch of ice and crashed! I dont think stores sold 24 inch bikes in those days. I remember the Schwinn brand had one model that had a spring on the gooseneck and it would glide over the bumps. I always wanted one of those, but never did have one. When I was older, one of my bikes had a carrier on the back. I had a lot of fun with that as I could do a wheelie easily and stay up for a long time. My friends and I rode our bikes all over town. We rode around the tracks at the Twenty-Fifth Street fairgrounds. We rode to Donner Pool and down Gladstone Avenue almost to 400 South to work putting up hay. We rode near Mineral Springs to squirrel hunt and south of Elizabethtown to the grandparents of a friend to swim in their farm pond. After riding back to town, we needed another cool down! After the Hell Drivers had made their annual appearance at the fair, we would use our bikes to jump ramps and try to replicate their show. After a week of doing that it was time to get our spoke wrenches out and try to straighten our wheels. In the mid fifties my brother and I got our first thin tired bike with gears. It was English made with three gears and hand brakes. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

My History Part 4
When I was old enough to have a paper route, my bike had a big basket over the front wheel. I recall riding West bound on State Street on my way downtown to pay my paper bill and then pick up my papers. When I got in front of The Midway Barber Shop, some fellow opened his car door as I was passing. The Midway Barber Shop was on the North side of State Street across from The Coffman Drug Store. That big basket was nearly as wide as my handlebars and State Street was two lanes at that time so there was not any extra room between passing traffic and the parked cars. Talk about a quick stop! I had it that day. I had a cut on my forehead and my chin where I hit the edge of his door. He asked about me and I was OK, but the door on his new Oldsmobile groaned when he tried to shut it.

The Evening Republican was located at 444 Fifth Street. That address was at the Northwest corner of Fifth and Franklin Streets and we picked up our papers there. The paper was printed in the late afternoon Monday thru Saturday. We paid our bills in the newspaper office until they told the carriers to get a savings account at the bank. After that we paid our bills at the bank.

We were told the time to be there for the press run. I can remember Nick whose name was Willis Hobard Nichols. He was the supervisor of carriers. He had other work as well. I recall him bringing a thin, stiff cardboard sheet with dents in it into that room. Nick placed it in a hollow cylinder. Well it had to be two cylinders as he then opened a valve and ran lead into the cavity. After it cooled somewhat, he removed this sleeve which had the letters, numbers and pictures on its surface. Nick then slid it onto an arbor and lowered a cutter, and using both hands to operate the cranks, he rotated the cylinder as well as moving it sideways. This action made the lead chips fly as he trimmed the round lead cylinders. His cranking cleared the area that became the newspapers margins. When he was finished, he took that cylinder into the press room.

We used the room on the Northeast corner of the building and the press was in a room just West of the room we used. A short time after Nick took his last cylinder to the press room the press started a test run. If Nick didnt come out to make a new cylinder, we knew we could then start to line up to get our papers when the press started again. Herb Hoeltke worked in the afternoons and he got the first papers that came off the press. Those copies were mailed to customers who lived out of town. He loaded his papers into a trailer the paper had attached to a bicycle and took those to the Post Office which was on Washington at Seventh Streets. As we got to the front of the line, we told the press man how many papers we needed. The press left the corner of every fiftieth paper sticking out so the press man didnt need to make a complete count, just the odd numbers! We then took our papers to the large tables and got our papers ready for our routes.

Most paperboys blocked their papers. The papers came off the press folded once from top to bottom as they are today when you buy one at a store or one of the paper boxes along a street. To block a paper we did the following. We put the press fold toward us with the top of the front page down, then using both hands we folded both sides in. You then had a paper in front of you that was one third of the width of the front page. We then folded it three times and then we slipped the top part of the paper into the pocket that was formed when we did the last tri-fold. We then had a rectangular block that had a fold on each side and could be thrown from the middle of the street to the porch on both sides of the street! Without the fold on each side, the paper would try to balloon out and fall short when thrown. If the customer wanted his paper in their street side mailbox, you could slow down and ride by with the blocked paper between your little fingers, open the mailbox with your thumb and forefinger, flip the paper into the box and close the door as you rode past. Sometimes if I hadnt slowed enough Id need to turn around and pass the mailbox the second time. Most of the time I was successful on the first pass!

The second route I passed included Elmer Strietelmeiers DX Service Station at the Southeast corner of State and Gladstone. This was before the newspaper started routes in the country and some of the Hamilton Manufacturing Co. employees car pooled. Their rides picked them up at the DX station and some bought a paper while waiting on their ride. Therefore, I had several customers with one stop. We had to collect each week and Mr. Strietelmeier paid me. I loved making one stop to collect several customers. I also knew when he was open and therefore didnt need to make a second attempt to collect! Yes, I had one of those metal change makers hanging from my belt. I wore it while collecting on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings.

The paper office didnt want the carriers stopping while passing the paper, but that was the only time you could find some customers home. I always had my receipt book and enough change with me so I could collect if I found someone home that had been absent on Friday evening or Saturday morning! When I moved to my second route, I lost a lot of money when I couldnt get all of the customers collected. The paper wasnt any help as we were independent business men! The kid that took that route over never did pay me any of the money that the customers owed me. That money was my profit as we had to pay our bill even when our customers had not paid us.

I was also the sub on a route and was going to take that route over because he had almost twice the number of customers than my old route. I was looking forward to the extra money and knew what I wanted to buy! Well at that time the paper decided that two hundred and thirty some customers were too large and divided the route; so I didnt gain many customers and may have lost a few, but it was near home so I no longer had to pedal across town to collect! I did buy, among other things, a cartridge powered b-b pistol, camera, 22 rifle and saved enough to buy my first car, a 1950 Ford.

That camera came with a flash attachment. Do you remember flashbulbs and blue tipped flashbulbs? Today, I wish I knew where those pictures are. At that time in my life most likely I didnt take pictures of buildings, but I may have accidently taken some! Im sure the Log and Triangle had a photographer on staff and I wonder if any pictures exist that werent used in those publications. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Hi, and EC, so glad you put in the newspaper memories. I have&quot;attempted&quot;to show my girls, in the past, how the newspapers were folded. I came close. Now they can read an&quot;official&quot;account. 

Someone out there recall that the newspaper carriers earned a trip to Washington D.C.? I think that was probably in Jr. High, and I know several went on that trip and think their experiences may have been written up in the newspaper.

Sure loving your memories.

Just some memories from the&quot;Old Days&quot;I enjoy reading from time to time, and thought I would place it here. Margo McCalip Hughey CHS Class of &apos;55


Be honest with whom you are and say what you feel , because those who matter won&apos;t mind, and those who mind don&apos;t matter.

&quot;Hey MOM,&quot;one of my kids asked the other day ,&quot;what was your favorite fast food when you were growing up?&quot;
&quot;We didn&apos;t have fast food when I was growing up,&quot;I informed him.&quot;All the food was slow.&quot;We ate at a place called &apos;at home,&apos;&quot;I explained.&quot;Your Grandma McCalip cooked every day and when Grandpa got home from work at Moonery Tannery, we sat down together at the kitchen table. If I didn&apos;t like what she put on my plate ,I was allowed to sit there until I did like it . That is, if there was any left by then. I had two older brothers and most of the time there was nothing left&quot;I quickly learned to like antyhing and everything!

Some parents NEVER owned their own house, NEVER wore Levis, NEVER set foot on a golf course, NEVER traveled out of the country or had a credit card.
In their later years they had something called a revolving charge card. The cards were good only at Sears Roebuck, or Montgomery Wards. Or maybe it was Sears AND Roebuck. Either way, there is no Roebuck anymore. Maybe he died. No Montgomery Wards ,either.

I had a bicycle that weighed probably 50 pounds, and
only had one speed, (slow). We didn&apos;t have a television in our house then, but my girlfriend, Kay Pankow had one. Her father was the manager for the Gamble Store on Washington Street, and tested everything new that came out It was of course, black and white, and they bought a piece of colored plastic to cover the screen. The top third was blue, like the sky, and the bottom third was green, like grass. The middle third was red. It was perfect for programs that had scenes of fire trucks riding across someone&apos;s lawn on a sunny day.
I was 18 before I tasted my first pizza, it was called&quot;pizza pie.&quot;When I bit into it, I burned the roof of my mouth and the cheese slid off, swung down, plastered itself against my chin and burned that, too. It&apos;s still the best pizza I ever had.

We didn&apos;t have a car until I was 15. Before that, the only car in our family was my Uncle Arthur Ketner&apos;s touring car. He lived in Indianapolis and would drive down once a month on the weekends to take us four girls, and the kids from&quot;The Children&apos;s Home&quot;for a ride. Ford. He called it a&quot;machine.&quot;
I never had a telephone in my room. The only phone in the house was in the living room and it was on a party line. Before you could dial, you had to listen and make sure some people you didn&apos;t know, weren&apos;t already using the line. We had one old lady that loved to listen on other people&apos;s conversations. I realize now she was very lonely, and this was her contact with the world outside her home.
Pizzas were never delivered to our home on 5th and California Streets, but milk and ice were.

All newspapers were delivered by boys and all boys delivered newspapers, or so it seemd.
Movie stars kissed with their mouths shut. At least, they did in the movies at the Rio, and that was very seldom. Touching someone else&apos;s tongue with yours was called French kissing and they didn&apos;t do that in COWBOY movies. I don&apos;t know what they did in French movies. French movies were dirty and we weren&apos;t allowed to see them.

If you grew up in a generation before there was fast food, you may wish to share some of these memories with your children or grandchildren, they need to be aware of your personal History. Growing up isn&apos;t what it used to be, is it?
MEMORIES from a friend:
My Dad was cleaning out my grandmother&apos;s house (she died in December) and he brought me an old Royal Crown Cola bottle. In the bottle top was a stopper
with a bunch of holes in it. I knew immediately what it was, but my daughter had no idea. She thought they had tried to make it a salt shaker or something.
I knew it as the bottle that sat on the end of the ironing board to&quot;sprinkle&quot;clothes with because we didn&apos;t have steam irons.
Myself, I also remember the blue starch MOM used to cook on the stove to dip the clean washed clothes in before hanging out side on the clothesline. All of our&quot;dress clothes&quot;were pressed as this was before the day of&quot;permanent press&quot;. Most clothes had to be pressed with an iron that seemed to weigh 2 lbs when you started and 50 lbs before you finished !! I couldn&apos;t wait to grow into my teens, but then I was old enough to help with the ironing. YUK !!
I had these browsings sent to me, and found I remember thenm all ! MAN, I must be OLD ! How many do you remember?

Head lights dimmer switches on the floor.
Ignition switches on the dashboard.
Heaters mounted on the inside of the fire wall.
Real ice boxes, and the cardboard sign that hung in the window to let the ice man know how much you needed.
Pant leg clips for bicycles without chain guards.
Soldering irons you heat on a gas burner.
Using hand signals for cars without turn signals !!!
Blackjack chewing gum, Wax Coke-shaped bottles with colored sugar water and candy cigarettes we could get at Nagel&apos;s Bookstore on 5th and Washington. Walking to down 5th street to First Baptist Church on Franklin Street, and hoping to step on&quot;the Magic Button&quot;in front of the Chirstian Church to start the bells chiming.
Doing all of our shooping at the A&amp;P;store, on Washington Street , and remembering that we had to carry it home, afterwards.
Soda pop machines that dispensed glass bottles, the Bob-o-link with tableside juke boxes, Home milk delivery in glass bottles with cardboard stoppers. Newsreels before the movie at the Rio Theatret.
My telephone number&quot;5646&quot;through the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s. Do you remember yours ?

Peashooters that shot dried green peas that stung like the dickens if you were hit !
Also watching&quot;the Ed Sullivan Show&quot;from the floor of the Pankow&apos;s living room, the old Victrola that was a treat to crank at my Grandmother&apos;s home on 9th and California, S&amp;H;Green Stamps kept carefully in a book, trying to crack open a frozen metal ice tray with levers that sometiimes sent ice shattering across the kitchen, Roller skate keys that hung from around your neck with an old shoe lace, and wash tub wringers that you cranked by hand before hanging the wet clothes on the back yard clothesline. Then you hoped they blew dry before any birds pooped on them.
I might be old, but those memories are some of the best parts of my life. HOW ABOUT YOU 
=====
&quot;Senility Prayer&quot;...God grant me...
The senility to forget the people I never liked, ( very few) ,the good fortune to run into the ones that I do( in great abundance) And the eyesight to tell the difference.&quot;

Thank you, Lord, for your many Blessings over the years. It has been good growing up in Columbus,IN

My History Part 5


We walked or rode the Lepperd bus a lot. A lot of people walked and rode the bus. Do you remember those small, square nosed buses? Those buses were replaced with the bigger GM style bus and they were Diesel powered. Even after adding the bigger buses, it wasnt unusual to find all of the seats filled. Many were the times I had to stand while hanging onto the rail. If my memory serves, the last bus left downtown at nine at night. The bus may have run later on weekends. I remember seeing the Columbus Process burning while riding the bus home after a basketball game. When I got home I told my parents that it was on fire and I was going to ride my bike over to watch. Im thinking they had three routes and you transferred at 4th and Washington. Im sure one of the routes ran past the Hospital. I rode home from the 25th Street school and it didnt go past the hospital, at least on the way back to downtown. I walked to and from the State Street School and ran when I was older. We werent in the city, but I think the school buses just hauled the kids that lived outside the city limits.

People walked so much that there was a worn path along the North side of Indiana Avenue. If you look closely, you can see the indentation of that path today. My grandparents and two of my uncles never did drive. They got a ride from someone, rode the bus or rode their bicycle. One of those uncles did buy a car in the mid fifties, but his wife did all the driving, as he never got a licence. Not all bicycles had a chain guard and a lot of people wore a spring steel strap that they placed around the leg of their trousers. I always thought it would be neat to have one of those straps. I never did and had to roll my pant leg up when riding a bike without a chain guard.

When I was young todays location of the East Columbus Methodist Church was a pasture for James K. Dickeys horse Betty. The stable/barn was located behind their house at Indiana and Gladstone Avenues. The ONeills at Indiana and Brooks also had a horse, pony and stable behind their house. Mr. Jim Meyers, who plowed our garden, kept his team of horses behind his house at 833 Ross Street. Today, 833 is 251 North Ross Street. I called a fellow that was raised in that area and he said that Jim also had a team of mules. When my folks were adding a room to the house, Mr. Meyers dug the basement using a slip scoop. A slip scoop was about three by three feet and about eighteen inches deep with two wooden handles attached. It was pulled behind the team and after being filled, the team was driven to the area that the dirt was to be stored. The team was then stopped or slowed and Mr. Meyers then tipped the scoop over, and the load was left at that point. He then returned to the starting point, pulled the scoop back, tipped the front down, and filled the next load. This method resulted in wide angled walls, not the square holes we see today. He kept the reins around his neck and used Gee and Haw to turn the team. Today, I couldnt tell you if Gee or Haw was left or right!

Many people raised chickens and had gardens and grapes and fruit trees were in their back yards. I can remember riding my bicycle down the alley and eating apples and pears off the ground. The strawberries from our garden were delicious. Mom would make pie dough and after rolling it out, she would cut it in squares before baking. That would be our strawberry shortcake. I wish I could find a tomato that tasted today like they did when I picked them up off the newspaper-covered garage floor! Have our taste buds changed or have the produce and meats?

Todays location of the East Columbus Christian Church was a pond when I was young. Our group called it, The Swamp and we visited it every Spring and dipped tadpoles and took them home. They never did turn into frogs or toads but we probably did grow some mosquitoes! I can recall Officer ONeill of the city police department, killing a bull at that location. The bull had escaped from the Stadler Packing plant stock yards and was first seen moving Southeast along the Madison branch railroad tracks. Mom had heard about the escape and warned us to stay close to home and keep our eyes open! If you followed the farmers lane past the swamp, you could go all the way to Clifty Creek and we did spend some time there.

We had a basketball goal attached on the South side of our garage. After the old garage was replaced with a new garage, the basketball goal was on the East side and it included a backboard! Until the Optimist Club opened a park behind the # 3 Fire Station on Indiana Avenue, most of the neighborhood games were played at that goal. We didnt grow grass in that area just dust. That dusty area meant less pushing of the reel type mower that I used to cut the grass. After we had a power mower if was a lot less work, after you got the engine started. In those days easy start mowers had yet to be invented. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

My History Part 6

My elementary days were spent at the East Columbus School on State Street which was a Columbus Township School. I assume that my school became a city school after East Columbus was annexed into the City of Columbus in 1949. As Ive said, my brother and I walked to and from school as well as home for lunch. Two of my cousins lived between our house and school. One of our great uncles lived next to them and some days we would get to ride to school in the back of his pick-up truck. His truck was a Dodge and had a spare tire mounted over the running boards between the rear fender and the cab on each side. Two spare tires? Yes, tires were a big problem in those days. Tubeless tires were yet to be invented. Some patched their own tires, but a lot of people took their flat tires to the Harold Trimmell Service Station at 2324 Tenth Street. That location was on the north side of the street just west of the steel Hawcreek Bridge.

While attending State Street the entire school walked together one day each year on Good Friday. We would walk to the East Columbus Church of Christ at 2282 Indiana Avenue and the next year to the East Columbus Methodist at 2162 Ohio Street. After the short service we would all walk back to school. Do you remember The Gideons groups passing Bibles out at school?

Today one of the two buildings that I attended is called the County Annex Building. The older of the two buildings was demolished. That building housed the 4th, 5th, 6th and one room of 7th. Grade. Did your school have steam heat? The radiators in the older of the State Street buildings clanged and banged all winter long! I then attended 8th grade at the Wilson Building on Sycamore Street and my freshman year at Columbus High School at 7th and Pearl. The new building located on 25th Street opened for the class of 1956-1957. With that move the Columbus High School became Columbus Senior High School, a three-class high school and Central became Columbus Junior High School, a three-class Junior High School. The class of 1957 was the first to graduate from Columbus Senior High School and my class, the class of 1959, the first to graduate after having completed all three years in the Twenty-Fifth Street building.

Do you remember the Pearl Street Industrial Building? They had Automobile Maintenance, Drafting, Wood Shop, Metal Shop and Foundry classes in that building. I believe the FFA had classes in that building also. In my class of 1959, the Vocational Auto Class still attended class at the Pearl Street Industrial Building. Do you remember gym class? My class was at 7:30 a.m.! The boys wore shorts and a tee shirt. The girls in gym class were required to wear a green one piece short and top. If the girls class was using the gym that day, we boys were outside or in the pool. I dont know what the gals wore in the pool, but I do know what the boys wore. We werent allowed to wear suits! We went outside if the day was warm and dry. Ill bet that put tremendous pressure on the teachers schedule. That also meant that swimming was done in the middle of winter. Dont forget that after swimming or class and a shower, we had to cross Pearl Street to get to our next class. Did the girls have hair dryers? I dont know, but I remember crossing Pearl Street with my wet head all winter.

Ive stuttered all my life and still do. This caused problems during school. I attended a speech class once a week at State Street School that I think started in third grade. Im in my sixties now but I remember one thing really well about my education. I always liked Social Studies. Some may call it History. In any case this is how it played out. Id always made good grades in that subject. When I went to 8th grade at Wilson Junior High my Social Studies grade dropped to a C. After the first grading period I went to the teacher after class to ask why my grade was a C when all of my tests were As. She said that I didnt participate in class, which I didnt because of my stuttering. So I went back to her after another C at the end of the next grading period. This time her answer was the same. I told her that I had my hand up in class most of the time, but she never called on me for my answer. Her reply was that, If she called on me in class she thought that it embarrassed me AND that it took up time in class! It didnt end there as later the School Board decided to name a new school after that teacher and her sisters. Then in the 70&apos;s my children were required to attend the school thats named after her.

I played some sports in High School and the trainer also taught Drivers Education. I loved that class, studied and made good grades. At some point in time after I had taken that class, the assistant trainer told me that my Drivers Education teacher thought Id cheated on the final test because my score was higher than expected. I hadnt and didnt understand how he could think I had. Years later, my thoughts were why did my teacher think that and why did the assistant pass that information to me. If he thought that, why didnt they ask if I would take the test over! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Did your Mother or Grandmother wear an apron? This may be a heirloom one day, as I don&apos;t recall many ladies wearing these now.

I must confess I have not worn an apron very much.

My grandmother , Olive Cox Meek, who lived at 9th and California, wore one when she cooked and she made the best fried potatoes in a big iron skillet !! It was a treat to walk up California Street sometimes on Sunday to carry foods in for a family Sunday Dinner, or a Reunion at the Holidays. The tables stretched from her dining room in to the living room, and the children set at separate tables from the adults. It was always considered a&quot;right of passage&quot;to be able to sit at the adult table !!
Actually it was much more fun at the children&apos;s table, but none of us would admit it !
Her silerware theory was&quot;If you have a fork, you don&apos;t need a spoon, or vice versa.&quot;Because of this, we always seemed to have enough silverware to go around. There were no plastic ware in these days, and I&apos;m sure she would be shocked now to see some.

She and my Mother, Nellie McCalip, wore the type of apron that had a bib attached to it, and it had a large hole for her head to slip through it, and then strings to tie it around her waist. I can remember mother putting hers on after we walked home from Church, to cook the noon time meal. We called it Dinner on Sunday, and lunch the other 6 days. Have no idea why. It was always Sunday Dinner, and we looked forward to it each week.
Mom made the best fried chicken, once again in an old iron skillet.She fixed mashed potatoes in a pressure cooker. I can still hear that steam whistle blow when the potatoes got hot !! Then she had a hand potato smasher (?) that she used to whip them up nice and fluffy with a big dollop of margarine on the top . YUMMY !!!
I also had a very dear friend Judy Arbuckle&apos;s mom, Lela Eckles, who wore one, faithfully in her kitchen.She baked the best homemade pies and noodles !! YUMM YUMM ! !!

I also have very fond memories of my Aunt Gertrude Rambo, who lived on a farm, near St. Paul, In. I was able to visit her every summer, for tweo weeks, and she used her apron for each of these following reasons.

Hope this brings back a fond memory or two for you .
I don&apos;t think our children today, know what an apron IS ..

The principle use of my Aunt&apos;s apron was to protect the dress underneath, but along with that, it served as a holder for removing hot pans from the wood burning oven. It was wonderful for drying children&apos;s tears, and on occasion was even used for cleaning out dirty ears.

From the chicken-coop the apron was used for carrying eggs, fussy chicks, and sometimes half-hatched eggs to be finished in the warming oven,which was on the side of the stove.

When company came those aprons were ideal hiding places for shy kids. And when the weather was cold, grandma wrapped it around her arms. Those big old aprons wiped many a perspiring brow, bent over the hot wood stove.

Chips and kindling wood were brought into the kitchen in that apron. From the garden, it carried all sorts of vegetables. After the peas had been shelled it carried out the hulls. In the fall the apron was used to bring in apples that had fallen from the trees.

When unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old apron could dust in a matter of seconds, if need be !!!

When dinner was ready, My Aunt Gertrude walked out onto the porch, waved her apron, and the men knew it was time to come in from the fields to dinner.

It will be a long time before someone invents something that will replace that&quot;old-time apron&quot;that served so many purposes.

For those who have the same memories, about aprons, would you please share them,also? I just love the story about Grandma&apos;s aprons.
***********************

How the times have changed...
Grandma used to set her hot baked apple pies on the window sill to cool.
NOW, Her granddaughter&apos;s set theirs on the kitchen counter to THAW , before baking them.
Blessings, Margo

EC,
The bus line that ran past the hospital was either the Orinoco or the Maple Grove. We lived between McClure and Beam Roads on 17th St. and rode the bus everywhere. My dad wasn&apos;t able to buy a car until around 1950. Mr. King was our bus driver, and he would even help Mom carry groceries from the bus to our house. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by EC on Apr 18, 2005, 6:29pm

Gregg G, thanks for the information about the bus route that passed the hospital. Yes, I recall seeing the Orinoco and/or Maple Grove on the route display board above the front windows. Was Maple Grove around the old number two fire house? Ive always assumed the Orinoco traveled Orinoco Avenue.

I rode the East Columbus route most of the time and Im not sure about that route. Ive asked my mother and she isnt sure. I guess, because it was something we did so often, none of the details stand out in my mind today. I believe that I met the bus at Twenty-Fifth and Maple Streets after school or practice. Today, I cant say what route came by but Im sure I asked for a transfer.

I think the East Columbus route came out State Street and turned east on Indiana Avenue. It seems to me that the route continued east on Indiana Avenue to the city limit which was Brooks Street before the mid nineteen sixties. The route then turned north to McKinley Avenue and turned west to Gladstone Avenue. Turning south on Gladstone it traveled the two blocks back to Indiana Avenue, turned west and returned to downtown.

Wasnt the transfer point in front of the Dalton&amp;Payne mens clothing store at Fifth and Washington Streets? Also Im not clear on the number of routes that operated. Was it three, four or five? My mind tells me they passed a certain point each 20 minutes.

Was the cost a nickel or six tokens for a quarter? I have a Leppert token from my mother. Im going to try to scan it. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

My History Part 7


In the forties and early fifties I dont think new automobiles came with a radio from the factory. Mr. Harold Paris operated a business that sold and installed radios in cars. At that point in time radios would only receive the AM bands. The Clear Channel Stations were heard from far away. When FM came along, it was great to cross through a steel bridge without the interference that always occurred while listening to the AM bands. By the way, advertisements that WCSI ran in 1953 had both bands listed.

Until 1953, Dad always traded a used car for a used car. Dads first new car was a 1953 hold over as the 1954 models had been released. In those years and I believe it was September, all of the dealers released the new models at the same time. A few weeks before the showing, the dealers would have a model or two in the show room that they kept covered. Some might leave a tire and the bottom of a hubcap uncovered to tempt the customers!

A group of friends from church and we made a lot of trips to Brown County State Park for swimming and picnics. I recall my parents talking about the need to back up some of the hills in the park. It seems that Charles Zurbrugg had a car that didnt have a fuel pump. The fuel tank sat above the engine and it fed the engine by gravity. Unless you had a nearly full tank, all of the gasoline went to the back of the tank while pulling a hill and the engine would quit.

Our church also had a July Fourth picnic with most members attending. Some of the older high school boys would go out the night before to hold one of the shelter houses. It was a pitch in and included activities such as sack races and an afternoon softball game. I remember walking a lot of the trails and wishing I could afford to take a horse ride. After I had my paper route, I did take one of those trail rides. I was looking around and as I turned back I was kicked on my knee by the horse in front of me. The head of my horse was above the rear of the horse in front of me and I think my horse must have nudged the horse in front. At that point in time, I regretted spending my money on the horse ride! Some of the families, after a lot of visiting, went to the pool before returning to Columbus.

My dad was on a basketball team that played in a league. The games were played at Pearl Street, Petersville and Hope gyms. Im sure there must have been games at other gyms, but I remember those and the trips home setting in the back of the Model-A with a blanket on my lap and waking up when the old car back fired! After the Model-A, I think our next used car was a Nash Coupe.

I remember going with the folks to wash the cars at the ford in the Clifty creek at the east end of McKinley or the ford in the Haw Creek on Rocky Ford Road which was just west of Marr Road. The ford on Rocky Ford Road had a cement bottom. When we got near the bottom of the creek bank, you crossed the normal water level on that cement slab. It seems to me that the drop-off on both sides must have been between one and two feet. I recall dad stopping the wash job and backing off to let traffic cross. Both of those fords were on a gravel road. And to keep the car clean, dad drove slowly when we were finished. At the Clifty Creek ford, if we went up the hill on the east side, we ended up at the intersection of US 31 at todays base road and we were back on a paved road. Bartholomew County had a lot of gravel roads in those days.

Sometime in the 1950&apos;s I got to do something Id like to do again today. A friend of my folks had a red 1940&apos;s Army Jeep that was a Ford brand. Hed fill it up with kids, one in the front passenger seat and four or more in the back. Hed go west on the Youth Camp Road and to the construction site of the high voltage electric lines that cross the Youth Camp Road. We then traversed that construction road to the point that those lines crossed SR 46. In this kids eyes, some of those hills were very steep! He engaged his four-wheel drive while traveling downhill as well as up. Often he would fold the windshield down. In those days I think race car drivers were the only people that knew what seatbelts were! On one trip, we went to the McKinley Avenue Clifty Creek ford and half way across, he turned north and up the middle of the creek. We traveled around one-hundred feet before water began filling the floor. At that time, he turned around and we returned to the ford. Turning east, we continued up the twisting road to the top of the hill that took us to US 31.

One afternoon when we got home from school in 1951, Mom told us Dad was buying a television set from a fellow at work and he was bringing it home that evening. Talk about excitement. We had it that afternoon. He put the antenna in the front yard. It was a used black and white Arvin. The first show I saw was The Howdy Doody Show. It was mostly snowy, but we watched it with pride. After a few days, the antenna was installed on the top of the house and that greatly improved the quality of the picture. In 1953 an appliance store in East Columbus put a television set in the gymnasium at the State Street School for all students to watch the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower. I though that was neat.

I havent searched the web so I cant give you a date, but I remember when I first saw color television. Except for the size, the westerns looked just like they did at the theaters downtown. Then when I saw a baseball game, you could see the dust cloud when the ball was caught by the catcher. That was just like being at the game! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

My History Part 8


In the early fifties the City of Columbus opened the Number 3 Fire House on Indiana Avenue. If I didnt have grass to mow, papers to pass, a ball game or another pressing matter, I was there a lot. I started hanging around before they moved in as each shift came out from the Number 2 Station to remodel the building the city had purchased from Mr. Jim Dickey. The building had been a tire store and the firemen removed the four small overhead doors and installed two large truck size doors. Walls were installed to create a lounge, kitchen, bedroom and apparatus area. The apparatus room was in the middle of the building. The lounge and kitchen sat side by side on the front of the building. The bedroom and bathroom used the back of the building. Each room had a screen door between it and the apparatus room. They built a small opening into the wall that separated the kitchen and lounge as well as the apparatus room wall. That three-way opening permitted the phone to be answered from any of the three rooms. Another opening was built into the bedroom and apparatus room wall. That opening housed a phone also and both openings into the Apparatus room had a sliding screen door. The screens were needed as the apparatus room doors were often open in the summer.

They had a soda pop and candy machines inside the apparatus room and I used those when I had the money. Now as I said, I stuttered so I sat and listened most of the time. Assistant Chief Eret Bud Kline, who after his retirement, was the Mayor of The City of Columbus, told me he stuttered when he was a kid. He suggested that I find a small round smooth rock. After washing the rock, I should put it under my tongue. That controlled my speaking problem for several weeks and then became less effective. A few years later Paul Jones, another fireman at that station, told me that his uncle was in town and if I could get my parents permission, his uncle could hypnotize me to end my stuttering. It worked longer than the rock, but it too began to wear off. Paul told me later that his uncle knew I would need other treatments before his next visit. His uncle thought that perhaps my family could find someone in our area to hypnotize me for those treatments.

A buddy brought his school book down and showed Pauls uncle what his next day test would be over. The uncle read the material while he was hypnotized and the buddy reported later that he made an A on the test!

Do you remember the red fire boxes on the street corners? What about the small boxes inside our schools? Have you ever wondered how those worked? At that time, the fire department had an electrician. His job was to install and maintain those fire boxes as well as the stop lights in town. His stop lights were on city streets. The stop lights on state roads were maintained by the state. That job also included doing electrical inspections within the city. Mr. Charles Miller held that job during my youth. Charlie was also involved with the city band and I believe had been the Fire Chief at some point in time. Now if you attended any of the park shows at the Donner shelter house you may have heard the name of Smoky Joe Miller. Did you know that Smoky Joe was the son of Mr. Charles Miller?

The electrician worked an eight-hour shift and didnt get a Kelly day. Whats a Kelly day you ask? Most members of the fire department worked a twenty-four-hour shift. The shifts changed at seven each morning. After working four days, they got a Kelly day, which was an extra day off. By getting a Kelly day, they still averaged working seventy-two hours per week. It was believed that an Ohio Fire Department Captain Kelly devised the plan to reduce the work week to seventy-two hours. Today most paid departments operate with three shifts and no longer use Kelly Days.

The fire boxes were operated by a single looped line around town. That line was battery powered and was always on. The fire box and the reader/punch head and bell in the stations was spring operated. Each fire box had a wheel mounted inside with a unique number of fingers on the edge of the wheel. Have you seen the Columbus Fire Department History on Davids Historic Columbus Indiana site? Did you see his page with a fire box location that included a number? When a box was pulled, the term for when the box was used, the wheel would go around three times. Each time the flat spring wire that was making a connection with the wheel would drop off the finger, the connection was lost. When the connection was lost, the bell and tape punch at each station would operate. Actually, I believe that a tape machine and bell were installed in the home of the Fire Chief and at the police radio room.

OK, if the wheel on a pulled box had two fingers and three spaces followed by one finger followed by another three spaces, with five more fingers and enough spaces to reach the original starting point, that would be box number 215. Each time the flat spring wire fell, the circuit was broken and the bell and punch head would operate. A paper tape was pulled by a take-up reel along the bottom of the punch head. This tape then traveled along a piece of wood that was painted black, which facilitated seeing the holes that were punched. The bell would ring each time a hole was punched, thus alerting the firefighters that an alarm was being received. By the way, the bell was big and loud enough to wake the crew in the middle of the night. The wheel in the box would turn three times before stopping. The holes would be checked again when the second turn of the wheel was completed. If the number was confirmed as the same as the first they would respond to the location listed on the chart which was mounted on the wall above the tape machine. In this case, the location of Box 215 was Tenth and Jackson Streets.

Do you see a problem there? Actually, there were several. Im sure I never knew all of them but the first to come to my mind was that someone had to wait near the box to tell the first arriving crew where in the area the fire was. This wasnt a problem, if the fire was creating a lot of smoke! Another was when an accident broke a pole or a limb fell on the looped line. A single tap of the bell, other than test times, told the crews that the line had been broken and the department electrician was then called and he went out to find the broken line! His job also included many hours of trimming limbs away from his wire. Another problem was the false alarms! Today, the tracking abilities of 911 have about eliminated that major problem.

The line was tested three times a day. Each station had a switch that would open the line for a single tap / ring. Station number one tested the line at 7:00 a.m., Station number two at noon and Station number three at 6:00 p.m.. Another thing that had to be done was to rewind the spring in the box before returning to the station. After returning to the station, the bell and tape machine springs were rewound.

When radios first came to the Fire Department, the frequency was shared with the Police Department. One firefighter, who had phone duty, stayed behind when a call was answered. He would turn the radio on in the back-up engine and answer the phone as well. That firefighter also called the other station when an alarm came in by phone for their area. You ask, what happened if the phone was out of order or he received a busy ring at the other station? His first option was to trip the test switch and call again. If that didnt work, he had a copy of each wheel of each fire box. He could place that wheel into his master box and initiate an alarm in that matter. Im thinking that master box turned the wheel four times so the tape record would show the alarm was created by the master box.

A base station and tower were installed at Station number one in the mid sixties when the department received a frequency assigned for the fire service. Years after that, newly installed fire boxes sent a radio signal to the tower. Today, I dont believe Ive seen a fire box in years. Id say the fact that most residents have a phone and the reliability of the phone system negates the need for the fire boxes as I knew them.

My mind is full of lessons and funny stories that I saw or heard of while hanging around Station three! Some couldnt be told in this format, but Ill tell about the first time I saw a tape recorder. It was a reel to reel model and about twenty-six inches across by about twenty inches deep. It was somewhere near ten inches tall. I believe it was owned by firefighter Schofield or Bay. Now at that time if an alarm was received by telephone, the call came to station number one and they called the station or stations that would respond to the area of the call. Firefighter Bay, Schofield or both had decided that they wanted to record the sound of a run being made. They called the fellow at station one and told him what they wanted to do. The plan was to record the phone ringing, the answer, the repeating of the address, the doors banging as they made their way to the apparatus floor. Then record the sound of getting their gear on, giving the driver the address, the door opening and the truck pulling out of the station. They had the recorder placed so the microphone could record the sound from both the lounge and the apparatus room. They did get most of those sounds recorded, even the sound of the fire truck doors closing. The battery turned the engine slowly three or four times and then STOPPED. After a few seconds pause, someone was heard on the recording saying S**T. Another plan bit the dust, but they did find that the engine needed a new battery. Better to find out then as at a real alarm! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

BURMA SHAVE SIGNS - - The First Bill Boards !!

How many remember those delightful primitive Billboards that were posted to trees, fences, or telephone poles on County Roads and Highways? I am really suprised that no one had posted them on this site anywhere.
Dave,
We may have to have a seperate folder entitled&quot;Burma Shave Signs&quot;if we stir up enough interest.

OK, people, DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE ONE??
This is where we will start them, and see if you add to mine. I can vividly remember driving to Family Reunion Dinners, in the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s, and looking for these on the way to Gary, or Shelbyville. Surely wish I had been able to save some !! The younger generation surely missed out on a lot, didn&apos;t they? Enjoy, and take time to reminisce.....
*******************
The First Billboards .....
For all our younger Drivers
The following were signs located along highways as an advertising technique back when we&quot;Mature Adults&quot;were much, much younger. While on a long car trip to Indianapolis, Madison, or Louisville, we kept our eyes peeled for them. Because they carried some wisdom and were fun to read, I thought you might enjoy reading them, also:

My History Part 9


Let me talk about traffic when I started driving in 1957. Cruising at that time was from downtown to Frischs Big Boy, on Twenty-Fifth Street, and then the Bob-O-Link Drive-In and back. At some point in time the Dog&amp;Suds was included in that cruising route. Im not sure when the first one-way traffic scheme came about, but I do know its been changed several times since the first implementation. One incident taught me to be very careful after those changes were made. A car full of us was cruising east on Fourth from Jackson to Washington Street just days after Fourth Street had been changed from west bound to east bound. Near the front of the Columbus Bar a fellow carrying a cardboard box walked into the street after looking to the east! When he took a step into the street the driver of the car I was in touched his horn and that fellow threw his hands straight up in the air with the results being that the box he was carrying fell to the street. After we passed, the guys in the back seat said he was standing there looking at his box and the liquid running from it into the street.

On most cruising nights the passengers pooled their money to buy gas. Most times the driver pulled into the station to have a dollars worth put into the tank. However, some nights our group could only muster $0.50! At most stations in those pre self serve days, the night attendant was a student who came out to pump the gas! It was said that Al Betz, who had three two-barreled carburetors on his car, would pull into a station and leave the engine running, then tell the attendant to pump faster as he wasnt keeping up! Some of those cruising had V-eight engines. Most had six cylinders and it was said that some of the six cylinder drivers pulled a vacuum line off in order to make their car lope to give the impression that they had a V-eight, with altered cam, under the hood! In those days the wipers ran off of a vacuum line, so on rainy nights the six cylinder engines didnt sound like a hot engine.

Installing a Porter muffler made the Chrysler brand cars sound good. Adding a glass pack on the rest of other models produced the same results. With those mufflers, downshifting would really make the engines crackle! The young people of those days loved the sound those mufflers produced. The Police Departments didnt!

A friend and another of his buddies were in Seymour, Indiana and were stopped by the police there. Both of these young men were about the same size and the guy driving had a few points on his driving licence. So they swapped their licence before pulling over! They said it was cold out so he left the engine running after pulling over. He was sitting on a small incline so he put the transmission into reverse. With his nervousness, he forgot to take it out of gear when the officer asked him to sound the mufflers. After he backed into the police vehicle, his buddy had points for muffler violation and an accident!

I remember running boards very clearly. One night I was peddling my bike down Illinois Avenue and I could see the lights on the pavement and hear the car behind me. About that time I had a sudden pain on my back. A fellow from school had opened the back door and was standing on the running board and gave me a huge slap as they passed. I dont think Id ever had anything hurt as much. Its a wonder he didnt knock me over.

I was in a barber shop and heard the following story a few years after my experience. The fellow said he was on his way home from his shift at the Stadler Packing Company and he saw his son riding his bike in the center of the street making cars move over to pass. He said he asked the driver to slow down and he got out on the running board and he slapped and yelled at his son as they passed. He then gave his son the what for about his style of bicycle riding. I could relate the pain his son must have experienced. I wonder how much jail time a parent would get for that type of lesson today?

I spent a lot of time waiting in a barber shop. Every couple of weeks a haircut was expected as long hair was not in vogue at that time. A lot of stories were told and I saw a lot of boys get their first haircut. In those days a first haircut was free. I found out that a free first haircut had changed in the nineteen-sixties. I had to pay for the first haircut of my sons. A short time after that, I saw a home clipper set, I read the booklet and learned to cut hair. My barber saved the cost of two free haircuts, but his move cost him many haircuts over the next several years.

In the Nineteen Fifty and Sixtys, Marr Road ran from SR 46, Twenty-Fifth Street today, to St Louis Crossing Road which is Road 800 North today. Wint Lane ran from McKinley to Tenth Streets. To drive northeast of town, from East Columbus, you had to go north on Gladstone Avenue, then east on Tenth Street, then north on McClure to Seventeenth Street, then east to Beam Road which would take you to SR 46. Take a right on SR 46 and you were in the country in just a few blocks. Or you could also get to Tenth and McClure by going north on Brooks and jogging east on McKinley to Lovers Lane.

My History Part 10


Some of my recollections of the railroads in Columbus follow. The Pennsylvania Railroad depot for passengers and freight was at 542 Jackson Street which was behind Leppert Auto Parts, Greyhound Bus Terminal and The Carmichael Restaurant which served some of the best fish sandwiches in Columbus. Now, if you follow this board, youve read the posting from George that states a depot was near Seventh Street. My mind tells me that I remember that move, but I cant see the old depot in my minds eye!

Do you remember the green Railway Express trucks? Werent they the UPS and FedEx of those times? One of my Little League coaches, Chester Lind, drove one of those trucks. Ive checked a 1953 Columbus Directory and it says that the Railway Express was at 630 Jackson Street. This information has zapped my mind, as Ive been thinking that they combined the depot with the freight operation. A Goggle search said that the trucking industry came of age after World War ll. History says that trucking was the start of the demise of the railroads.

The roundhouse was south of the depot at the west end of Fourth Street. A water tower was between the depot and the roundhouse. George and I drove around that area last week and he said that he remembers a coal chute along those tracks. When I was young, I wondered how they got all of the coal into the engine tender. I recall seeing a crane with a clamshell bucket on the boom and I guess it didnt register.

North of the depot, the tracks headed in a north northeast direction into the middle of Jackson Street between Seventh and Eight Streets. Southern Transportation was located on the south side of Seventh, west of Jackson. The west end of Seventh Street was at Brown. Do you remember using that route if the light was red on southbound US 31A? Do you remember that Seventh Street had a jog at both Jackson and Washington Streets? Today, Seventh Street west of Washington Street is aligned.

In any case, Jackson Street north of Eighth had a lane on each side of the street. The Pennsylvania Railroad had a flag man and a small building at Eighth and Jackson Streets. It was small and had a smoke stack sticking out the top. Most people I knew called it the flag man shack! US 31A and SR 46 traffic went thru that intersection. US 31A is now SR 11. The state route for both of those roads turned south on Jackson, then turned west on Third. Before the new bridge, traffic crossed the Second Street bridge.

The Pennsylvania main line ran north to Indianapolis thru Edinburgh, Franklin and Greenwood. The Pennsylvania line also had a spur line running into Camp Atterbury. That spur had been removed years ago. A new spur was installed a few years ago as Atterbury is now a Reserve and National Guard Training Center. While running south to Louisville, it passed thru Seymour, Crothersville, Austin, Scottsburg and Sellersburg.

The Madison branch line crossed Second Street at the east end of the White River Bridge turning east through the switching yard south of First Street. Several tracks crossed Lafayette Street and then turned southeast to cross the Haw Creek behind the Stadler Packing Co. They then traveled along the south side of East Columbus. That line had a spur that crossed Second Street that allowed coal to be shipped to the Columbus Coal Co., which was located at 232 Sycamore Street.

Actuality, that spur was the original route of the Madison branch and crossed Washington on the diagonal just north of Fifth Street. Do you remember the angled building at Fifth and Washington Streets? That walkway was built after the line was moved. I thought for years that the popcorn shop was located on that walk. One of the pictures on this site shows the popcorn and nut shop just north of Smiths Jewelry which faced Washington Street.

The Rushville branch crossed Jackson on the west and Washington Street on the north side of the Coca-Cola Bottling Plant. It then ran east crossing all of the north-south running streets between Washington and including Michigan. I criss-crossed that route a few weeks ago and its really hard to say, as the rite-of-way has been fenced across at a few points and buildings built into parts of it, but it looked to me as if dual tracks ran from Lafayette Street east. I recall seeing cars being unloaded at the Taylor Lumber&amp;Supply Co. at 1425 California Street. Wendels Inc. was located at Fourteenth and Sycamore. Did they have lumber shipped by the railroad also? Its not that clear in my mind as I didnt travel Sycamore often.

I believe three tracks crossed Michigan Avenue between 14th and 15th streets. Two tracks crossed side by side and the third crossed on the diagonal a couple hundred feet south of the other two. That track crossed Fourteenth and Thirteenth Streets before being switched into the New York Central line south of Thirteenth Street. The oldest map I have is dated 1984 and it has the New York Central track stopping at Sixth Street between Reeves and Cummins. Today, I wish I had some of the maps that were in my possession in those years!

The New York Central depot was at 835 Third Street. That location was on the south side of Third Street. The tracks crossed Third Street and California at an angle. The engines backed into the depot as the tracks ended at that point. There were several tracks in that yard and the train blocked traffic several times while uncoupling the cars.

The traffic was blocked again when the cars were connected for the return trip to Greensburg. The tracks ran northeast from the depot on the north side of The Schaefer Milling Co.s flour mill. It continued through Cummins Engine Co. and along Reeves Pulley Company. After crossing Seventh Street they turned north, traveling next to the alley behind Werner Avenue and along the west side of The Golden Foundry and between Morgans Packing Co., and Arvin Industries and then the east side of the True Temper handle factory. There was a spur that ran from that area that crossed Hutchins, Cottage and Central before entering the Arvin Seventeenth street plant on the south side. Was that a New York Central, Pennsylvania Line or shared spur?

North of the handle factory, the New York Central and the Pennsylvania tracks ran side by side as they made their way north-northeast through town crossing 16th, 17th, 19th, Cottage, Central, 25th and US 31. Between US 31 and Rocky Ford Road the New York Central line turned to the northeast with the line crossing the Haw Creek and Marr Road a short distance south of Rocky Ford Road.

The Pennsylvania line continued north-northeast crossing Rocky Ford Road just east of the road that went into Atterbury Air Force Base. It crossed Marr Road at the crook in the road alongside of the Atterbury Air Force Base. The Pennsylvania Rushville line also had a spur line into Atterbury Air Force Base.

When I was hired by Cummins Engine Company in 1959, we crossed the New York Central tracks while going from one building to another. I think the New York Central always used Steam Engines while running into Columbus.

My parents rode the Southwind to Miami in the mid 50&apos;s and it was being pulled by Diesel Engines. The Southwind was a train that ran between Chicago and Miami in the nineteen-fifties. I dont know for a fact, but I suspect it ran for years before the fifties.

The 1949 map of Columbus Mr. Sechrest has posted on his site has many of the railroad routes shown. To see this map, go to his home page and click the More Columbus Indiana Pictures. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Hi, and good morning to all!

Since my return from TX, my life has been a whirlwind of some unexpected&quot;activities&quot;and I surely have a lot of catch-up reading to do on the boards. But, have some memories that have been&quot;triggered&quot;to share----the past as related to the present.

My own family is really quite small, and a family&quot;reunion&quot;has always been accomodated at someone&apos;s home. I do recall, tho&apos;, attending a family reunion years ago with my cousins (the ones I was with in TX) for their dad&apos;s family (my 100 year old uncle) at Donnor Park. There were so many people in attendance, and the amount of food there was literally overwhelming! The food alone took up several tables. Know that was when I was first introduced to pickled eggs with beets. And still a favorite of mine. My week in Texas was as close as I have ever been to a real family reunion since that day in Donnor Park so many years ago.

This past Saturday, I adopted a 1 1/2 year old English Bullmastiff!!!!!!!!!!!!! Altho&apos; I have had it in the back of my head that I wanted to work with a mastiff, in light of the fact that my daugher had adopted one a year ago, who is an awesome dog, little did I really think it would happen so soon. My daugher has trained her dog for therapy work in assisted living places, homes for abused children, hospitals and the like, and I am enchanted, and am working toward that goal with this new addition to my family of critters.

Back in the late 40s, and very early 50s, my dad decided that he wanted a Boxer dog. At that point in time, Boxers were the AKC dog of the year, and very popular and a picture of the winning Boxer was on the cover of Life magazine. Thus, a brindle female Boxer, Tuffy, joined our family. In time my dad convinced my mom that they would raise a litter of puppies-----in the winter, in the house, and I really do not know how he ever convinced her that it was a grand idea!!!!!! Our litter of Boxers was one of a very few available in Columbus. I do think that Bob Barkhimer&apos;s family also raised a litter at about the same time.

Tuffy was a great mother to a litter of seven puppies. Might add here that my mom allowed this litter of puppies to be raised in their bedroom with her prized antique heirloom bedroom set!!!! I know it happened that way, but I have trouble as I can&apos;t believe my mom could have put up with that!!!! We named them after the Seven Dwarfs. The whole point of this story lies in the&quot;cost&quot;of a dog today!!!!! Which I think is outrageous, as the people I adopted my new dog from paid $1499 for him as a wee puppy!!!!

But maybe not!!!!!!!!!!! As it came time to sell our Tuffy&apos;s puppies back when I was in Tom Thayer&apos;s English class at Wilson (can date that, as I wrote an essay about how Tuffy took care of her brood), people were beating a path to our door to purchase a puppy. My dad traded one puppy with a local automobile shop/mechanic/dealership for a brand new set of tires for our &apos;47 Chevy, as well as a complete tune-up and&quot;goings over&quot;on the car, and a little window air conditioner for the car, which you filled with water and then used a little string inside to somehow make that gadget cool the car somewhat. Some one of you guys can surely attach a name to that which I describe.

As the proceeds from the sale of the puppies accumulated, my mom and dad planned a month long vacation to California. From the sale and/or trade of these seven puppies, my folks paid for that vacation-------we paid to board our two dogs for a month, paid for all the gas, lodging, food, film, any and all expenses for the trip. All from the profits of a litter of Boxer puppies.

Hmmmmm!!!!!! Maybe the cost of a purebred dog is not so much these days, after all. And so goes my life, and in case you had not noticed, I always have been, and still am,&quot;a critter person!&quot;

My History Part 11


Have you ever told your kids or grand kids that everything today is just too expensive? Nancy, in her posting on April 28, 2005, talks about the cost of dogs in the current market. I found this record a few weeks ago and typed it into my word processor.

In 1959 after my eighteenth birthday I went to work at Cummins Engine Company. They paid me $1.78 per hour and that included the $.08 bonus for working on the evening shift! Then, I was laid off in August of 1960. In January of 1962 I was called back. After saving all I could, I borrowed my mothers car and took my wife to Florida that summer. It was years later before I owned a car that I would begin to think about taking a trip that far!

The Kentucky Toll Road was the route of I65 and ran from south of Louisville, ending around Elizabethtown, Kentucky. We traveled I65 part of the trip as it was only open in 40 or 50 mile sections.

Total $158.08

Notice the car service at both ends of this trip. In those times, everyone changed their oil, the oil filter and had the chassis lubricated every one-thousand Miles. I felt I needed to get the car serviced before returning it to my mother.

By the way, Circus/Circus was a cafeteria style restaurant. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Car Trip to Florida...
EC ( wish you would join and post your name)

I really enjoyed your message on car expenses to Fl.

I am traveling down in June to watch my granddaughter, Sarah Kapala, (who is Drum Major this year) lead her Concordia, MO Band at the Disney World Parade.

My plane ticket cost me $136.00 which is almost the total cost of your trip! I now plan to try to chart all my expenses and see how they compare. I&apos;m SURE I won&apos;t find Gasoline that CHEAP !

Hi EC, and that trip information was just super interesting. I hadn&apos;t thought about it, but I would almost bet that my mom at least recorded gasoline expenses for that vacation so many years ago. Thanks so much for sharing, it just somehow puts a lot of things into perspective, doesn&apos;t it? Sure appreciate.

Have a great day.

Concerning the Crump Theatre..where we all went to see movies during the 50&apos;s.... 

We have been discussing the Crump in another folder and I thought I might copy it here, as this file seems to ATTRACT more readers.

The Lord works in mysterious ways, sometimes...

When I attended First Baptist Church this morning, I learned the CRUMP Theatre will be open this coming Thursday, May 5th at noon for the National Day of Prayer Service. This is the first time it has been used this way.

This event is FREE and open to anyone. So, if you care to revive old memories, and join me in prayers for our Active Duty Military, please join me there that day at NOON.

Second,

The next Concert at the Crump, will be on Mother&apos;s Day , May 8th at 2:00 p.m. COST IS $5.00 . Music provided by Gary Pugh, and friends..including DALE SECHREST, Terry and Danny Clark. Classic Country, Blues, and Rock Music will be played. ( To Benefit the Crump Theatre.)
What a gift for MOM who probably spent her childhood attending the Crump. Dave, Is Dale one of your relatives Surely must be, not a common name.

I urge anyone that&apos;s interested to attend either or both events !! Will find out more from Rovene Monday. If you are coming let me know, and I will try to chat with you before or after. I&apos;ll be at both events as far as I know now.
I will definitely attend the National Day of Prayer Service , to pray for SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN, and for our VETERANS. Come and join me,please.

My History Part 12

Its October 1957 and Ive just turned sixteen. Wow, and I cant wait. Now I can get my Beginners Driving Permit! Ive successfully passed my Drivers Education Class and will get a discount on my Insurance. After a month of driving with a licenced driver I can take the test for my Operators Licence.

As I stated in Part 4, I had a 1950 Ford that I purchased with my paper route income. It was a Black two-door with a standard three speed transmission and a V-8 Mercury engine and a glass pack muffler. I was ready to DRIVE! I loved driving and the freedom it gave me.

Do you remember Hood Ornaments? My Ford also had a Chrome Strip down the middle of the hood. I removed both! The Chrome Strip was mounted in an indentation the length of the hood. I filled the mounting holes of the Hood Ornament and the indentation with body putty. After sanding the putty and the black paint, I was ready for the rest of the make over.

I borrowed a small air compressor. I believe it was a Speedy Air brand. It didnt include a storage tank, just straight air to the paint gun. I painted it with light gray primer and it was that color when I sold my first car.

Thinking about it today, we must have had some peer pressure as I wanted to lower my car! I went to the Alva Philpot Welding Shop on North Gladstone Avenue. In those days, welding shops were our Blacksmiths. They could and did fix anything! I told Mr. Philpot that Id like to have my car lowered a couple of inches! He told me it was hard to be precise. Well, the short story is that when I left his shop, my car was setting on the frame! The ride felt like I was riding in a log wagon. The seats werent very soft in those days and I was reminded of how my behind felt when riding in my little red wagon.

The tops of my front tires were leaning in four or five inches. Needless to say, my next project was to find some used springs. If I didnt get the springs replaced soon, I was going to wear my tires out and need tires also! A buddy knew of a junk yard in Brown County West of Mount Healthy and they had the needed springs. When one of my axles broke, I learned how to use a piece of paper to check the adjustment of a pair of gears.

Our first car gave most of us the opportunity to pick up some mechanical knowledge. When did the automatic choke appear? I think my Ford had a manual choke! We learned that those chokes and the accelerator linkage had to be cleaned. We learned that a cracked distributor cap would cause the engine to misfire. We set or changed the points. Remember timing lights? I think the first time I found out that a cracked distributor cap could cause misfiring was after Id changed the spark plugs, points and the condenser.

I was able to get a ride after Basketball Practice for a short time before getting my licence and it was a big time saver. I ran a route picking up classmates before and after school. I picked them up at their front door but one friend insisted on my picking him up at the Leppert Bus Stop near his home. I could drop my passengers off and get home faster than the bus ride.

Do you remember the Stop Sign at the top of the hill at Pleasant Grove and McKinley Avenues? Using that hill and its Stop Sign was the shortest route while taking my passengers home after school. My car had a standard transmission and that means it had three pedals, but I had only two feet! When stopping with those transmissions, drivers used the right foot to depress the accelerator and the brake. We used our left foot to depress the clutch. I drove to that hill and practiced moving my right foot from the brake to the accelerator and releasing the clutch in the correct sequence. Without the correct sequence, the engine could stop running when trying to move up the hill! After I was sure I could do that without killing the engine, I took the shortest route home.

Today, I still use my right foot to operate my brake. It bugs the thunder out of me when Im behind someone whose brake lights keep flashing on and off. Its apparent they keep their left foot on the brake pedal as the brake lights come on or off with each small bump in the road!

Didnt we have a City Police Officer to help traffic onto Twenty-Fifth from Maple Streets? After Basketball and Football games we had the assistance of the City Police as well as the CD (Civil Defense) Police. Do you remember those volunteers who were used often? I believe they worked at the Pioneer Day Parades, and the shows at the Donner Shelter House.

Speaking of the Civil Defense, do you remember the observation towers around the county? I can recall seeing one in Jonesville. I also believe another was located in Clifford. Were there others, perhaps at Grammer? The observers who used those towers were trained to identify, by their silhouette, German and Japanese aircraft.

I recall my father having a fire extinguisher that held five or six gallons of water. I understood that extinguisher was provided as part of the CD project. It was a tapered galvanized steel tank about three feet tall. Included was a black hose that was approximately six feet long. The pump which had a T-handle was attached to the middle of the top.

As I understand it, most of the equipment the original East Columbus Fire Department used was supplied by the CD program. After East Columbus was annexed by the City of Columbus the East Columbus Fire Department became know as the Rural Fire Department and covered a large part of Bartholomew County.

Automobiles were quite the&quot;pasttime,&quot;even growing up in the 1960&apos;s. The car that was really popular when I was in high school (1968-1970) was either a &apos;55 Chevy or a &apos;57.
My first car was a corvair. I got better gas mileage with the thing than&quot;oil mileage.&quot;We lived at St. Louis Crossing, and from the house to town, I&apos;d have to hit the closest gas station and put a quart of oil in that lemon. BUT, it was a convertible, which was nice when it was sunny, but a butt-soaking pain when it rained (I think my dad eventually traded it for an old John Deere tractor once I joined the Army).
I made the BIG mistake of driving that corvair to Bloomington one weekend. It did fine on the going, but the coming back! Are you familiar with that rather large hill about 5 miles out of Nashville (driving back towards Columbus)? There&apos;s a small straight-away right before you hit the bottom of the hill, and I knew if I didn&apos;t get up enough steam on the straight, I&apos;d never make it up that hill. Luckily, no cars were in front of me, and when I hit that last turn leading into the straight, I floored it (now, that&apos;s not saying much, considering it took about a day and a half to go from zero to sixty). The speedometer cable had snapped off, so I really didn&apos;t know how fast I was going when I hit the&quot;foothill,&quot;but I hoped I&apos;d built up enough momentum to carry me the rest of the way up it.
When I finally reached the top, I was going about 5 miles an hour.
I had to stop in Nashville and put a quart of oil in it, and once I reached that old Wake Up Station (?) that used to sit right on the outside of Columbus on 46, another quart to make it the rest of the way home.
The Corvair had an AM radio. There were maybe 5&quot;Preset&quot;buttons on the front. You pushed the button and the red line marker jumped from whatever station you were listening to to the one selected.

When did cassettes replace 8 track tapes? I used to carry around a tape player of sorts with me. I had two HUGE speakers I put in the back seat, soldered the wires together, and plugged them into the earphone jack. That&apos;s a word you don&apos;t hear anymore. The radio took 4&quot;D&quot;batteries, and usually drained them in about a half hour because the speaker were so big, and I always played music loud in those days (Huh? What was that you said?)
Between batteries and oil, I could only afford to drive that car on the weekends

I have been trying for years,(with absolutely NO luck),to find someone to help verify something I recall from my youth. From about the time of my 1st birthday (1947) until 1959, we lived at 2919 East 17th Street, between Beam and McClure Roads. Just 3 doors down to our west was Harker&apos;s Garage, and beyond that, on the corner of 17th and McClure, stood McKay&apos;s East Side Market. Some of my fondest childhood memories are of buying penny candy, pop, and baseball cards from McKay&apos;s, and just hanging around Harker&apos;s. They kept their soft drinks in one of those water-filled Coke cases. One of my favorite drinks(after the Barq&apos;s Cream Soda), was a lemon-lime drink called simply,&quot;76.&quot;As I recall, it was only available for a couple years in the Columbus area, and I have NEVER talked to anyone in Columbus,or anywhere else, who remembers the brand.

Hi Gregg! Nice to see you using the board!

I don&apos;t remember that drink, but I sure do remember the coke cooler you mentioned. Russell&apos;s Grocery had one, probably just like it, and man, that water was ice cold! It was refreshing on a hot summer day.

It&apos;s probably just me, but it seems there was a much larger selection of pop drinks back when we were kids. Big Red, Double Cola, Nehi, Orange Crush, and, of course, Coke and Pepsi. Remember when cans first came out, and you had to pull the tab off the can? And also, those 16 ounce glass bottles. What a handfull for a little kid...

For a while, the fad was to put peanuts in cokes, and if I had extra money for a bag, I&apos;d pour them in the coke bottle.

Cokes of any kind were a real treat when I was young. Mom and dad rarely bought them. The drink around our house was mainly grape koolaid, and sometimes homeade lemonade.

Hey Gregg--one of these days, talk about Ernie&apos;s Record Shop! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by Gregg G on May 17, 2005, 8:30am

Dave,
I know what you mean about soft drinks being a novelty. My folks bought Pepsi in returnable bottles by the carton,(6), once a week, so we learned to&quot;pace ourselves&quot;, because there was never any mid-week grocery shopping.
Ernies Record Shop was a really interesting place. Ernie Kerns was my first guitar teacher, and great influence, although I think his musical expertise amounted to staying one lesson ahead of me in the Mel Bay books.
He also did a lot of entertaining around town as a clown. I would guess that he worked some with&quot;Smokey Joe&quot;Miller, and I know for sure that he and a friend of my dad&apos;s, Jack Watson, had a TV show (WTTV,no doubt), called&quot;Blinky and Ernie.&quot;
The record shop carried a good selection of the current chart-toppers. Most were on &apos;45s, but when rock-&apos;n&apos;-roll was in its infancy, record companies were still releasing singles on &apos;78s.
Actually, Ernie&apos;s shop seemed to be stocked with whatever he was&quot;into&quot;at any given time, because for a period he carried a pretty extensive supply of HO-scale railroad supplies.
Ernie Kerns was, indeed, an interesting person, and I regret not having stayed in touch with him after I left Columbus. I read in the Republic On-Line of his passing within the last few years, and I&apos;m sorry that I never took the opportunity to thank him for being my first mentor.

For some of you yung-uns out there, that old toaster that&apos;s been sitting on your grandma&apos;s counter way before you were even a twinkle in your mom and pop&apos;s eyes just might have been&quot;bought&quot;with these:

 

Green stamps were very popular in the 1950&apos;s (and 1960&apos;s too). The stamps pictured above were part of a promotion from the old Standard Grocery stores across the country. As noted on the back, the Standard Grocery in Columbus was at 727 Washington Street. I don&apos;t remember Standard being at this address. In my day, Standard was a couple of blocks further north on Washington (where the Hostess outlet place used to be). I guess when Standard moved, A&amp;P;must&apos;ve taken over this 727 Washington Street address?

I can&apos;t think of any of my relatives that DIDN&apos;T collect green stamps. My grandma had stacks of these books lying around, and when us kids visited, our job was to lick the stamps and put them in the books (believe it or not, we thought we were having fun!)

The way you got the stamps was very simple: the more groceries you bought at the grocery store, the more stamps they gave you.

Besides being used for personal purchases, green stamps were also used in community drives to help buy school busses and fire trucks.

I might be wrong in this assumption, but I don&apos;t think Columbus had a&quot;Redemption Store&quot;where you could exchange the books of stamps for products. S&amp;H;published catalogs, and toasters, furniture, and other household goods were ordered from it, once you saved enough books to&quot;buy&quot;whatever it was you wanted.

For those of you who still have loads of these books lying around, I&apos;m proud to announce they&apos;re still good. If you just happen to have 1,200 books stored away in your attic, they&apos;re worth a whopping one dollar and twenty cents! But wait--that&apos;s not all--you can still get a catalog by calling 800-435-5674. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by admin on May 19, 2005, 1:24pm

Well, I must have been half asleep when I posted the Green Stamp pic and info last night.

After reading the back this morning, apparently, the 727 Washington Street address WAS for a redemption center, and NOT Standard Grocery (brainfreeze).

So, it must have been very close to Sears.
Just for the heck of it, I&apos;m going to check my 1962 phone directory to see if they show any listings for an S&amp;H;redemption center here in Columbus. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by chsclassof55 on May 19, 2005, 3:06pm

Dave,
That picture of the S&amp;H;catalog popped out at me this morning. I am sure they had a Redemption Store at one time in Columbus, as my Mom was able to redeem her books, for some items we could not afford to buy.
I remember distinctly the horrible tasting glue they had on the backs of those stamps! YUUKKK!! The redemption store is active and now online, soo if you have any books laying around, I would love to take them off your hands.

There was also a yellow stamp book, in competition ,but I can&apos;t remember it&apos;s exact name.
DOES ANY BODY KNOW ?

I think we got most of our stamps from the grocery store, and the gas stations. Of course, back then the gas station attendant cleaned your windshield, checked your oil, and asked if there was anything else he could do for you. That&apos;s how I met my husband...which is another story for later. Enough for now... time for some one else to join in. Blessings, Margo Class of &apos;55 Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by george on May 19, 2005, 8:51pm

Margo, If my memory is correct the yellow stamps where Top-value stamps and was a Kroger stamp. The Kroger store at that time I believe was in the 25th street shopping center, also the redemption center was located in the center also. I do remember when the Kroger store was downtown, that has been awhile. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

I hope your class reunion goes off with no snags, and it is hoped you get a good turnout.

I don&apos;t know about other reunion committees, but it seems to be very difficult to find those classmates that are no longer with us. I did a special tribute to those who have gone on to greater rewards at my 35th reunion last Saturday, but I also know there are many more than I was able to find out about.

How do other reunion committees handle this, and keep on top of it?

Our Class of 1970 was listed as the largest that ever graduated from Columbus High School. Figures state there were 768 of us. We had about 150 turn out for the reunion Saturday, and considering that our&apos;s was only for one evening, I don&apos;t think the turnout was too bad. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

How many of you had your radio tuned to Bouncin Bill Baker in the late 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s to WIBC? Friday night, a TV newscast reported that he had died. Ive been checking the papers since and found this information by searching the Indianapolis Star online this morning.

Charles William Bouncin Bill Baker 77, former WIBC-AM morning drive disc jockey and voice talent passed away on Friday, August 12, 2005.

I recall tuning in on the way to school each morning. I never did dance, but I went to a sock hop once at Columbus Senior High School. Bouncin Bill was doing his DJ routine that night. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by admin on Aug 14, 2005, 12:32pm

EC, I mentioned the&quot;Indy In The 50&apos;s&quot;program on WFYI a few nights back. Included in this special was a segment on Bouncin&apos; Bill Baker, with airchecks from his show, and a short interview.
I&apos;m sorry to hear he&apos;s passed on.
From what the guy interviewed said about Bouncin&apos; Bill, he was crazy, and from listening to his show, he certainly created quite a few colorful characters that interrupted him constantly.
By the way, the special was for a fund drive for the PBS station, and if you pledged $80, you got a dvd of&quot;Indy In The 50&apos;s.&quot;The dvd contains more items than what was shown on tv. Someday, it would be nice to have a copy of it. I missed about the first 5 minutes, but did manage to tape the rest of the show, both on the vcr and the computer.

August 26, 1955 - Ed Sullivan, popular host of the Toast of the Town Revue, was booked as one of the top attractions for the Columbus Junior Chamber of Commerce Auditorium Series.

August 28, 1955 - Local Barbers Union No. 557 approved a proposal to raise the price of haircuts for adults to $1.25.

September 2, 1955 - A gasoline price war, which began along major highways in southern Indiana, spread to Columbus with local motorists paying two cents less per gallon that they had paid the week before.

After reading EC&apos;s posting, I had to comment on one thing that he mentioned and tell a little story, too.

In EC&apos;s posting, he mentions having the milk delivered to the house and shaking the bottle to mix the cream back in.
About three weeks ago, I went to work and got into a conversation with three other guys in the office. Bare in mind that none of the four of us was born before about 1965. This will be important in a minute... We all decided that we were thirsty. We went to the building&apos;s break room and each bought one of those little cartons of milk (for those who used to listen to WCSI in the morning for the school lunch menu, that would be&quot;one half pint of milk&quot;, sorry, I can&apos;t type in a southern accent ) As each of us retrieved our carton of milk from the machine, the first thing that each person did was to give the carton a good shaking. I noticed it when I did it and then watched to see if others did it also. Sure enough, all four of us did. I mentioned that I cannot remember a time when milk was not homogenized and neither could any of them. However, everyone of us had been engrained with this habit somewhere along the way.

His story also says that Union Starch, or at least the Reddi Starch brand was bought by the Simoniz Company of Chicago. Simoniz went bankrupt in the early 1960&apos;s. He then says that Union Starch was sold to Miles Laboratory in 1966. The article states that Union Starch was founded just after 1900.

I remember this company well !! They hired me before I graduated from High School in 1955. I worked with Edna Hawley in the printing department, and also sorted mail. Pennant Syrup was another of our products. I surely remember the Marshmallow Creme as we ran many promotions on that product, also.
I went from 25 cents an hr at the Root Beer Stand to an incredible $3.75 hr to start !! My father was sick with Cancer and that salary was all that support our family, during this time. Mother stayed home to nurse him, and the younger sisters were still in school. Strip Malls In Columbus Indiana 
Post by admin on Oct 7, 2005, 10:57am

EC and I have been sharing some thoughts regarding the first&quot;mall&quot;in Columbus. If I can take the liberty of speaking for EC, as well as myself, we have determined the 25th Street Shopping Center was the first strip mall in Columbus.

Now, I&apos;m not so sure of that.

I recently paid a visit to East Columbus, and checked out the buildings on State Street, west of the corner of State and Hege. There&apos;s a small strip mall located on that particular corner.

Without any documentation, I now believe that this area could possibly have been Columbus&apos; first strip mall.

I am very familiar with this area of town, considering that it was my stomping ground back in my younger days. I cannot remember what was in the building farthest west, but on the corner was a clothes shop. At some point in time, I think I remember a shoe store around there somewhere, but I could be confusing it with the clothing store.

Was the old Army Surplus in that corner building? Something tells me it was.

If you drive around back of the building complex, you will note that most of the structure is made up of concrete block, but then, note the building farthest west. You will see an old brick structure jutting out from the top. It appears that this part was the original building, and the rest was built around this structure.

I have a picture of the A&amp;E grocery in the west buildling, but I&apos;m not sure of when the A&amp;E occupied this spot. I don&apos;t remember it from my own childhool (1960&apos;s), which probably places the picture being taken sometime in the 1950&apos;s.

With EC&apos;s help, I think we have come to the conclusion that the Kroger Store (where Aldi&apos;s is today) moved into that area around 1956.

But something in my mind&apos;s eye tells me that the strip mall on State Street preceded this one.

George? EC? Nanc? Any others out there that remember this State Street strip mall prior to the 25th Street Shopping Center? Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

If you drive around the back of this building today, you can still see the old brick from the original building.

Would the row of shops across 16th Street from, and just to the west of the Nugent home, qualify as a strip mall? They are probably nearly the same age as the shops on State Street. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

They would have been singing during the late 40&apos;s and all of the 50&apos;s. Other members were Harold Huffman, and Floyd Stader. I can&apos;t think of the other gentleman&apos;s name.

Post by george on Oct 7, 2005, 8:33pm

Margo, The 16th street mall was on my paper route and that would have been from late 1945 to 1949. It ran from the conner of 16th and union a drug store on that conner if my memory is correct east to Parkers grocery store on the east side of the alley. The state street mall goes back to 1953 that I know of, my wife&apos;s family moved to Hinman street that year and they shopped at the A-E grocery. A Mr. Rex Greathouse had the surplus and shoe repair store. I went on the Columbus Fire Dept. in 1958 and the A-E grocery delivered grocery&apos;s to all the fire stations for several years.

Gregg, I don&apos;t know why it wouldn&apos;t. I&apos;m taking some liberty here, possibly, with the definition of&quot;strip mall,&quot;but in all actuality, I cannot think of any reason why it couldn&apos;t be classified as one. It may not be as large as the 25th Street shopping center, but yet, it does (or did) contain several businesses.

Maybe it was built before the one on State Street...

I always wondered how a city the size of Columbus in the 1950&apos;s could support 3 theaters and a drive in. It makes more sense for the 1940&apos;s. No television, and radio as a major form of entertainment. But, the theater offered something more to the 1940&apos;s public.

TV&apos;s beginnings in Columbus began in 1949. By the end of that year, there were two stations you could watch, if you had a TV set (channel 6 and channel 4). By 1954, channel 8 began it&apos;s broadcasting.

I&apos;m sure that TV played an important role in this. Hollywood hated TV when it first became popular. Some movie star&apos;s contracts forbid the actors to have anything to do with TV.

The&quot;Golden Age Of Hollywood&quot;was on its decline and died in the 1950&apos;s, so the problems that faced the Mode were very real, indeed.

I wonder why they decided to close the Mode instead of the Rio? Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

The BOB-O-LINK was a great place to meet friends or take the family out to lunch or dinner. I lived on 15th Street not far from the restaurant and the&quot;Link&quot;was part of my paper route during 1954-1956. I had a paper rack inside the glassed walk-in entrance selling the Louisville Courier-Journal paper. It was always a busy place and the sandwiches were great. The paper I delivered was kind to me during the many contests they sponsored in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. I won many trips and a paid vacation once to Miami Florida for a whole week because of the number of new papers I had sold. I recall many school clubs and sports teams would dine at the link. After football and basketball games it seemed to have a gathering appeal to a lot of fans. I do remember it was there before my routes started, so George may be right that it was opened in the 1940s.

When Blockbuster moved in to the old Bob-O-Link, they renovated that building, didn&apos;t they? I wasn&apos;t living in Columbus at that time, but it doesn&apos;t appear they tore the old building down and built a new building in that spot.

With CVS planning on rebuilding that entire corner, any traces of the old Bob-O-Link will be entirely wiped out. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

I believe that the BOB-O-LINK was sold to the Waffle House chain several years ago, and not long ago was sold to Blockbuster. The original building had been added on to in the back. If my memory is correct the original owners was a family by the name of Baierlein and they lived across the street from the BOB-O-LINK on the corner of 25th.St. and Griffa Ave.

I just talked to Bennie Stott about Bob-O-Link. He&apos;s in the same antique club that I am in. He worked there, as a young man, shortly after it opened. Here&apos;s what he recalls:

Bob Barline (and I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s spelled correctly) owned the land prior to going into the Navy. When he returned from the Navy after WWII, he opened the Bob-O-Link. This was prior to St. Rd. 31 being built through the city. Bennie thinks it was about 1948. Bennie worked there until he, himself, went into the Navy.

If any of you are familiar with Bennie Stott, he has a long-time restaurant connection to Columbus. Even now, he cooks and bakes for Sadie&apos;s Restaurant almost every day.......and he&apos;s supposed to be retired!! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

I&apos;ve always had a fancy to own an old Coke machine. My brother had one back many years ago. It was one of the water cooled ones, and when he had to sell it, I just didn&apos;t have the money for it at that time.

One thing I&apos;ve managed to hold onto all this time is an old SEEBURG jukebox that I traded for a waterbed back in the 1980&apos;s. It&apos;s still in great shape today, but needs some work. It&apos;s not an early model. I place it sometime in the late 1960&apos;s. It will play either 45&apos;s or albums. I notice that replacement parts sometimes appear on EBAY, and one of these days, maybe I can get it repaired.

I was a big fan of David Lynch&apos;s Twin Peaks, back in the 1990&apos;s, and the same jukebox that sat in the Double R Diner is the same one sitting on my back porch. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

I&apos;m sure someone else will be able to fill in more details, but I do recall there being a teen&quot;dance party&quot;type TV show, possibly originating on WTTV. It seems that I saw Bobby Helms as a guest once. He performed one of his early recordings, entitled,&quot;Tennessee Rock-&apos;n&apos;-Roll.&quot;It is one of his more obscure songs. It may have even preceded&quot;My Special Angel&quot;, which received world-wide acclaim. Not to drift too far off topic, but Martinsville&apos;s Bobby Helms pretty-much had the world by the tail at one point. His&quot;Fraulein&quot;set all sorts of records for time on the charts and number of weeks at the #1 spot. Of course,&quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;has become a perennial favorite. I think that with some savvy management, Bobby would have established himself a spot of much greater stature in musical history.

Gregg, Bobby Helms was a part of WTTV&apos;s TV show called Hayloft Frolic, and it did precede his big hits. Fraulein was a HUGE hit for him (on the C&amp;W;charts), and peaked on the Billboard Top 100 Pop Charts on October 21, 1957 at No. 36.

Jingle Bell Rock first hit the Billboard Top 100 Pop Charts in 1957, and pretty much re-entered the charts around Christmas time for the next 5 years.

My Special Angel hit number 7 in 1957.

The Hayloft Frolic was one of the first shows on WTTV, but I don&apos;t have an exact date when it aired.

That was nice of the Republic and David Sechrest to place the article about Jerry in the media and historical site today. Jerry was given many opportunities for full scholarships in 1956. One of which was the second basketball recruitment class of the Air Force Academy. He had numerous college scholarship offers including The Citadel Military College of South Carolina, in Charleston. Jerry chose the Citadel and loved every minute of his tenure as a student and basketball player. He played basketball for Norm Sloan the famous Indiana Basketball Hall of Famer/ All-Star (1984/1943) and former Florida and North Carolina State Coach of many years (winning the NCAA at NC State). Jerry graduated from the Citadel in 1960 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force. He devoted a career to the Air Force for 26 years and achieved the rank of full Colonel (0-6). The major highlights of his career included the position of Deputy Executive Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force at the Pentagon, under Dr. John McLucas during 1974-1977. Later, he became the Base Commander of Hanscom Air Force Base, Boston MA. His final position was Base Commander of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida during 1983-1986. He retired from the Air Force in 1986.

 Boys Club of Columbus Indiana (1940s and 1950s) 

Submitted by: RER to Richard for placement.

The Boys&amp;Girls Clubs of America began in 1860 in Hartford Conn. It was developed to help boys and girls to have a place to go and provide positive alternatives and directions in life. One hundred years ago in 1906 several Boys Clubs decided to affiliate. This was the marking of the nationwide movement. In 1931 it was actually named the Boys Clubs of America. The mission of today is to enable young people that need assistance, to reach their full potential as a productive, caring responsible citizen. The Clubs were and are a safe place to learn and grow and have an ongoing relationship with caring adults and professionals.

 Columbus in the 1940s and 1950s had a Boys Club on the corner of 5th Street and Franklin. Across the street from the Club was the ole Republican Newspaper building and couple doors after that the Rio Theater. During those days the Boys Club had indoor games, billiards and outdoor basketball goals etc. Many Columbus kids went to the Club daily. We lived on 5th and 502 Union (now a Cummins parking lot) and not a long walk to the Club, Rio and our school the Lincoln on 2nd and Franklin.

Today Columbus Boys and Girls Club is located in the Foundation For Youth building at 405 Hope Avenue. Back in the early 50s the Boys Clubs had national competitive sports such as Billiards, Broad Jumping, Pull ups, High Jump, Yard Running Dashes, other track functions and Basketball for various ages. According to the information I received the Boys Clubs had National Sectionals and Regional in Terra Haute Indiana.

In 1951 and 1952 the National Sectional and Regional at Terra Haute had a vast amount of Columbus players. Many of them were highly recognized in the nationals and many were later to become stars in grade school and high school sports in Columbus Indiana. Here follows are the results of the 1951 and 1952 sports and billiard results by name.

 Boys Club State tournaments&amp;Banquets 1940s&amp;1950s 

The Club&apos;s Basketball Championships were held in Indianapolis and some were played in Cincinnati. As said before the Sectional and Regional plays were held in Terre Haute Indiana. The Boys Club Director was Paul Lemon and Leo Burns was also part of the program&apos;s administration. Mr. Paul Lemon transported many members and players in his personal covered pickup truck. Paul would feed the members and players hot dogs and candy bars during the trips.

Those programs had year end banquets, held in a large room, in a borrowed room in the police station. The police station was across the street from the Boys Club and the Republican Newspaper. Awards such as trophies,ribbons and national patches were given out at the banquets.
 
Additional Information About The Club: 

Inside the the Boys Club on the second floor was a basketball court with a low ceiling. Players could shoot the ball and bounce off the ceiling. Also, ping pong was available. My brother joined the Club around 1947. This activity was many years before Bill Stearman arrived in Columbus. It seems Mr. Paul Lemon was a big leader amoung the town kids in those days. The Club was a quality place for kids in the 40s and 50s to play, develop, and have fun.

 &quot;Hawcreek The Early Income Driver&quot; 

Well, starting in 1950 when we moved to 15th Street there wasn&apos;t many jobs for kids less than double digits in age. The Golf Course (owned and operated by Mr. Sharp) near the hospital was only a couple miles from my house. Walking or biking to Hawcreek and to the Columbus Indiana Hospital Bridge on 17th was not much of an effort.

As I discovered the beds and banks of Hawcreek from US 31 (near Bob-O-Link) back to Stadler&apos;s Meat Packing Bridge on State Street many golf balls and clubs were found in the creek. I guess I discovered that I could sell the balls to golfers mostly at the Hawcreek Bridge on 17th near the hospital. I sold balls in the very early 1950s for anywhere from 10 cents to 25 cents for an exceptional ball. I found in the woods edging the course layouts; lost balls and in the creek beds many times more. I suspect I had hundreds of recovered creek balls and some from the wooded areas.

The reason most balls ended up in the creeks was that the 8th hole tee off was across Hawcreek and up toward the 17th bridge. I would watch golfers from far away (off the course) hit and splash the creek water and hit more balls until success came about. One time I recall a man that got so upset with his inability to go over the creek he took his clubs and bent the shafts and threw them into high watered (at that time) Hawcreek.

Well, most golfers never tried to retrieve their creek balls. They would either try another ball or place one on the fairway after they walked across the steel bridge that arched across Hawcreek. One year much later the creek flooded and tore the metal bridge down. They replaced it with a rope type swing bridge.

I guess I had this golf ball sales income from 1950 through 1955. I also had a paper route starting in the early 50s. I never went past the State Street Bridge because Stadler&apos;s Meat Packing Company wasn&apos;t the most pleasant smell in the world; and I didn&apos;t care to get near that place and the polluted creek water. Walking the creek beds for several miles was an adventure in itself. Many interesting objects and Indian Arrow heads were found at times. Snakes and I walked in different directions when encountered. I always carried a 2 iron golf club to ward off any snakes or other critters. Sometimes I would see a fox or two and squirrels/rabbits of course.

I understand that in later years the course became a city course and Mr. Sharp I guess retired. In summary Hawcreek provided that income to me when I wasn&apos;t even ten years old. Not only did it provide me the extra money but the fun adventures and the exploring was priceless. I guess I didn&apos;t need a computer game (no computers then) to entertain me, but down to earth good fun as a kid in Columbus.&quot;Our Gang Shows&quot;had nothing over my friends and me. Maybe, there were a lot of educational lessons walking the Hawcreek beds and banks. A lot of thinking and amusement for hours daily in the summer months

This might be posted in the wrong folder, as I&apos;m not sure when the PSI building on Central was built, but I believe this picture shows the building under construction. At first, I thought it might be the 25th Street Shopping Center, but it sits too far away from 25th Street to be that.

You&apos;ll notice in the foreground the football field. I think this is the high school. The old fairgrounds is in the background. Also note National Road and the lack of anything!.

In viewing the picture, you&apos;re looking east. North to your left and south to the right.

Post by rer on Jun 25, 2006, 3:26pm

David, I think you are right about this picture. This is really an early picture. As you said the fairgrounds in the back with two oval dirt race tracks. There were two tracks just like the picture reflects. The football field I remember that only a few houses were in the back area like this shows.

I notice the the housing development wasn&apos;t developed parallel with the football field. Bill and Margaret Stearman lived in the future development 2692 Meadowlark Lane, which was the second street back from the long portion (parallel) of the football field. Prior to that they lived in a house on 25th street not far from Donner Park.

Also, US 46 is undeveloped and future Sap&apos;s donuts isn&apos;t in the picture, nor is Mahan Ford (I think it was Mahan not sure here). This picture has to be very early 1950s it seems, but not sure on this one.

I know the Central High School football teams practiced down US 31 A next to a baseball stadium in the 40s and part of the very early 50s until students transferred from Central to the new 25th Street High School.

Let&apos;s see I went to Central my Freshman year and then finished my last three at 25th Street High School. I suspect this picture was taken maybe between 1953 and 1956, but not sure. Good picture and memories.

David, Id like to comment on your post of June 25, 2006 at 3:22 p.m. in the Columbus Indiana in the 1950&apos;s thread.

I think it is the High School Track and Football Field in the lower right and the Fairgrounds near the top of your picture.

I think the dark/black street between the track/football field and the field on the north side of it would be 27th. Street. Now, the white street above/ next to the football field on the east would be Maple Street. I think the construction near the left middle (north of 27th. and east of Maple Streets) would be the location of Columbus Village Apartments. The field north of the football field is the location of the Northside Middle School and was built in 1961 - date from A Look At Architecture Columbus Indiana.

Now looking at this side of the fairground race tracks, do you see the angled lines? I believe that would be the two railroad tracks that went to Shelbyville and Greensburg Indiana. Now look at the property this side (west) of those tracks. That property has three 90 degree sides and the back side is angled with the tracks. I think that is the location of what was the district office and garage of Public Service Indiana. Notice the large parking lot on the south side of the building. At one time a lot of people were employed in that building. Also, customers could and did pay their bill at the front desk! Central Avenue was a two-lane road in those days and its hard to see in this picture!

O.K. everyone, whats your take on this GREAT picture? When Dunlaps built the new lumber yard near there arent the fairgrounds next to the property between the two properties? Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by rer on Jun 25, 2006, 4:57pm

Hi Richard...you are right on the money. I have studied this picture for the last half hour or more and now I am sure you and David are correct. That was the Railroad that went past the Fairgrounds toward Shelbyville and Greensburg.

If you go the opposite direction of that Railroad you go back across 25th, Central and then finger webbings of parking places and various tracking to industrial places. It continued on down to the old Canning Factory, Golden Foundry, Arvins, Cummins and linked up through the main center of town to Jackson Street. It went into Cummins two ways, one swing out from 2nd Street across State Street in front of Westermeir&apos;s Hardware past the gain elevator and into Cummins.

Anyway what a great picture and many bike and walking memories awakened again.

Ok...here&apos;s what I thought when I first posted that picture:

 

I don&apos;t see Central Ave., and it might NOT have run north of 25th Street when this pic was taken.

That place I cannot identify appears to be the centralized place that might have built all those homes just east of the high school? Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by admin on Jun 25, 2006, 6:35pm

I think my marking for that possible location of 27th Street is just a little too far north. I know if you&apos;re travelling from Home to Central on 27th, it jogs.

I think 27th Street would eventually be just south of where I marked it on the map.

In blowing the original picture up, it does appear that there&apos;s some kind of road running in front of PSI. Whether it&apos;s dirt, gravel, or asphalt, I can&apos;t tell... Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

I cropped the original aerial photo in order to get it to fit on the message board without pushing the boundaries way out.

If you want to view the original photo, follow this link:

 http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org/maplepsi.jpg 

This untouched photo does a good job of showing the 25th St./National Road area before ANY development whatsoever. NO Eastbrook Plaza. NO Lincoln (Hamilton) Center. NO development at all along National Rd. from just about at the high school on down.

Check this link. This is the first page, thats posted in the 1952 Columbus Log sports section.

At the bottom of that page is a picture of two boys working on the new track. The writing also says that the football squad will have a new and beautiful football field to play on next year, thanks to the Junior Chamber of Commerce. The Junior Chamber of Commerce sponsored several fund railing projects, including Pioneer Days.

 &quot;Men&apos;s Barber Shops 1940s and 1950s&quot; 

Well, in the very early 1940s my dad would take my brother and I to the Clyde&quot;Red&quot;Donica Barber Shop on 10th Street not far from intersection of Hutchins Ave and close to the old Golden Foundry.

Because WWII was ongoing and GI Burr cuts seemed popular, that was what we both got for many years at&quot;Reds.&quot;I think another reason was the GI cut lasted longer before the next cut, and perhaps the family budget dictated it. Keep in mind money was tight also in the 1940s coming out of the depression years of the 30s. So I guess I let&quot;Red&quot;cut my hair until about 1953 or so. Then he moved to Garden City from 10th Street, and I only went there once.

Also, briefly off and on I got a haircut at 418 5th Street at Polly&apos;s Barber Shop two doors down from the Rio Theater. This was probably also in the late 40s or a couple times in the fifties.

My final barber in Columbus was a grand ole man on Washington Street. Leonard Brumfield of&quot;Brumy&apos;s Barber Shop&quot; at 304 Washington Street close to the Court House same side. I ran around with his son David a lot in high school.

Leonard the barber had a shoe shine stand inside his place and periodically I would get my shoes shined for about a quarter I guess. I think the super nice man that shined shoes part-time was Marion. Marion had his own business but Leonard and him had been best of friends for many years and Marion showed up on Fridays and some Saturdays.

Leonard introduced me to the&quot;Flat Top&quot;haircut in lieu of the GI burr. I really felt like a champ sporting my waxed flat top in the summer and at school during the remainder of the 1950s. The Flat Top was easy to maintain as was the ole GI. Many younger kids sported that cut for many years, and I suspect some still do.

 &quot;Columbus Hatchery (Poultry) 1950s&quot; 

Located in 1953 was the Columbus Hatchery. Once owned and operated by Water Hungate. I knew Walter and his family well because they lived down the street on 15th Street not far from the Columbus Hospital.

His business was located at 335 Franklin Street for several years. During special events and Easter weekend Walter would color young chicks in various colors and sell to the local people for the interest of there young children. As a young kid at times I would drop in his store looking for one of their sons, that I adventured with at times around Clifty Creek and Hawcreek.

The store wasn&apos;t the most pleasant odor but what do you expect if you are in the business of hatching eggs and selling chickens to the local farm community. I recall the light system inside his establishment that produced enough heat for the hatching. The Hungate family provided among other competitors, a resource of poultry for farmers to sustain the chicken food chain for many years.

Other Hatchery or Poultry businesses in 1953 included:

--Robinson Poultry at 204 Jackson
--TheWadley Co. Poultry at 237 1st Street
--Fivecoats&amp;Denny Poultry at 227 2nd Street
--Brownie&apos;s Poultry 919 23rd Street
--Carter Hatchery&amp;Poultry at 313 Franklin Street
--AA Poultry Market at 1936 Gilmore

Bob,
Do you remember the business at one time being called,&quot;Hungate and Dibble?&quot;That may have been in the late 1950s. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by rer on Jul 4, 2006, 11:32am

Gregg, I sure don&apos;t remember that name Dibble. Maybe a city directory in the late 50s would show that. I only recall Hungate because I knew them and what they did in life. Interesting though, maybe another business was merged or formed.

 &quot;Early 1952 through Maybe 1955&quot; 

Bixler Lumber Company was located at 1350 Jackson Street. My brother worked part-time and myself at times unloading and stacking lumber from railroad cars (summer months) into Bixler warehouses. Mother worked at Bixler&apos;s as an accountant for maybe 2 to 3 years. Bixler was located directly behind the Coke Cola Plant and as I remember the railroad track went parallel to the side of the Coke plant back into the Bixler yard and on down into the Jackson Street areas.

Tom Bixler was the owners name and he also built several houses in Columbus during the 1950s.

 &quot;J.C. Gosnell Died In Texas Sunday July 9, 2006&quot; 

J.C. was a good friend to many people during and since his Columbus High School days. He played basketball for coach Bill Stearman, and the team mates are listed in this Historical Site under Columbus High School Basketball in the fifties.

J. C. was among the Bulldog team that played the last season game in the old Pearl Street Gym during the 1953-1954 season. After that season the Bulldogs moved to the new gym. That season&apos;s record was 21 wins and 6 loses. He played guard for the Columbus Bulldogs and was a great team player, that is for sure.

 For more details go to Richard&apos;s posting today under obituaries.

Reference post # 137, page 10, in the 50s section, I questioned the identity of the very short man in the city administration photo. 1951. While in town, visiting with Sharon Talkington Renner, she also knew this gentleman, agreed that he was in Lions Club with our dads, and she thought his name was &apos;Howard.&apos; A search at the library, in a city directory of 1950, I believe, wella, the answer.

Sharon said &apos;Howard,&apos; I thought &apos;Mac,&apos; and I believe this puzzle is solved-------------Building Inspector, Howard McKenney.

Ah, to solve and answer the questions. My brain is in overdrive!

 &quot;Hambone, Hambone Where You Been ? Around The World and Back Again&quot; 

 

The Hambone is a black culture rhythmic of slapping hands; chest, legs and foot heal stomping to a distinct sound. Bo-Diddley introduced later sounds of the modernized Hambone in his music and songs in the 1950s. Songs such as&quot;Hey Bo-Diddley, and Hey Little Girl in the High School Sweater.&quot;

The Hambone was created by enslaved Africans in North America to communicate in lieu of native African drums. They found ways to make rhythms with tambourines, body music such as hand clapping, body and thigh slapping also called&quot;Pattin Juba.&quot;

So, you say so what? Well, in Columbus starting around 1953 my brother and a super nice black named Raymond Pennybaker had a summer job to paint all the wooden football bleachers and lockers in the gym. During this period Mr. Pennybaker taught my brother the Hambone. After, that it was history for many Class members from 1953 through 1956.

My brother taught me and many of his Class Mates how to Hambone, including black man Tommy Hogue. He said that during lunch periods he and several athletes would gather at the Pearl Street Gym (l1953-1956) and learn and practice the art of Hambone. The best results of this art is if you wear tight blue jeans and have leather healed shoes for the extra beat from the foot. The slapping is performed on the legs and chest areas, using the front and back of the hands.

Anyway, many of the students learned to Hambone and on one occasion at a 1954 Columbus High School Convocation (or Convo) at the Pearl Street Gym my brother and Tommy Hogue demonstrated the art of Hambone. The local paper (The Evening Republican) at the time placed a picture of both in action, which follows below.


 

History brief of Hambone please go here:

 http://worldartswest.org/main/discipline.asp?i=44 

Background beat and Bo-Diddley go here:

 http://www.bobshannon.com/stories/Bo.html 

Of course being my brother taught me, I continued the Hambone through my high school days until 1960. However, I have never stopped the Hambone routine. I guess you could say I have been doing it for over fifty years now. When I lived at Myrtle Beach South Carolina I met the ever famous Bo-Diddley himself. He and his band played at the Beach Club throughout the summer months of 1961 through 1965 or so.

One night with a bunch of friends during a break I demonstrated my Hambone to Bo-Diddley and he was surprised that I could do it so well. He then asked me to do a little routine with his guitar backup. So, I did a couple minutes with his band and finally left the stage. It was a fun trip being around Bo-Diddley each time he came to Myrtle Beach.

Today, I have been teaching my grandson how to Hambone, but he is only 5 at this time. I hope to be able to get him polished up before I get too far along in age. My son does it also, but doesn&apos;t practice enough to keep fresh on the beats. I have had a lot of fun with family and friends over the years with the Hambone skills. Thanks, to Raymond Pennybaker that started it all in Columbus Indiana.

Bo-Diddley played on the Ed Sullivan and Tennessee Ernie Ford television shows in the 1950s. I have many more stories of the Hambone, but not in this segment of the Columbus Indiana Historical pages.

 Columbus and Korean War-- Camp Atterbury/Bakalar Air Force Base
1950 through 1954 

This is the time-line from the logs at Camp Atterbury for the period above sited.

 July 27, 1952 - Several sightings of &apos;flying saucers&apos; in the Columbus Indiana area led the Air Force to set up a reporting station at Atterbury Air Force Base.

 May 27. 1953 - The first Hoosier Prisoner of War (POW) Home ! On May 8 at 10:20 a.m., Atterbury Air Force Base was the scene of a special&quot;Welcome Home&quot;Ceremony. Air Force AlC William A. Hillycord, a native of Columbus, Indiana, arrived here on his last lap of a trip that brought him from a North Korean prison camp. AlC Hillycord was the first Indiana man to be returned home.

 Oct 11, 1954 - Atterbury Air Force Base renamed Bakalar Air Force Base Columbus, Indiana.

 &quot;Columbus Baseball Merchants Team Played Camp Atterbury Soldiers&apos; Teams in the 1952 and 1953 Seasons&quot; 

Coach Pete Burns of the Columbus Merchants Baseball team reported in another historical web site, that Columbus lost both games in 1952 and 1953 seasons to the Camp Atterbury Soldiers Team. The scores are shown as follows:

 The 1952 Season Results /The 1953 Season Results 

Columbus 1 Atterbury 13 / Columbus 2 Atterbury 3

Columbus 0 Atterbury 9 / Columbus 4 Atterbury 18

Note: It was said to me that the Camp Atterbury teams had a few Major League players on their teams. Well, I guess that proved to be tougher for the Columbus Merchants to beat them. Bottom-line the troops at Atterbury won 100 % of the time. One game between the two teams had over 1200 people watching the game.

 &quot;Part Two: My Hawcreek The Early Income Driver&quot; 


During my very early 1950s walking the Hawcreek banks on both sides (at different days or weeks) I discovered a hot bubbling discharge coming from the ground in the woods. The discharge was steaming and very hot and grayish in color. The location was in the golf course left woods, about 50 to 75 yards as you tee off toward the 2nd hole at that time.

This discharge had caused a huge area to be like quick sand because of the constant heat, steam and bubbling of liquids and chemicals, I assumed.
It wasn&apos;t possible to retrieve lost golf balls or any other objects within the area described. I always tried to figure out what caused it and could only conclude that a pipe must have been placed from Arvin&apos;s Industry, under the golf course fairways into the woods near the creek.

The assumption was that Arvins was disposing of hot something into the woods and creek. Additionally, on the hospital side of the 17th Street Bridge was a discharge pipe I concluded that maybe it was coming from the hospital buildings. Then of course further past the State Street bridge was Stadler&apos;s Meat Packing Company. It goes without saying that the creek was probably used to dispose of liquids from the plant.

Well, with all these assumptions and thoughts going through a very young boys mind at least I had enough sense not to catch and eat fish from Hawcreek. Keep in mind I was around 9 through maybe 12 exploring Hawcreek and many other creeks and locations.

The most interesting discovery I every made at Hawcreek was one year I found this enormous sized sponge mushroom growing on a small island like place, in the middle of the hot, steamy discharge area. The Sponge mushroom was a challenge to reach without stepping into the quick sand like grayish muck; but I retrieved it. The brown top sponge portion was about the size of softball in diameter.

I was probably around 12 at that time and thought; this can&apos;t be good to eat with all the hot, steamy, grayish muck all around. Anyway, I took it home to show my Mom and Dad. I told them the story, but I insisted to them that we were not going to cook this one in butter and eat it. Of course we didn&apos;t cook it or eat it; it went in file thirteen so to speak.

From, Hawcreek 25th Street near the ole Bob-O-Link all the way down to the State Street Bridge (near Stadler) was spotted with large and small water holes. When the rain was less off course the pools were smaller in some cases and full of trapped fish and snakes. During flooding of course I stayed home and didn&apos;t go to the creek until it dried up somewhat.

I fished in Hawcreek but never cleaned them or took them home because of the run-offs I suspected by the three locations described above. I had great times with friends exploring the banks, the full distances. The income was always available because the creek and woods stayed full of lost golf balls, for resale at the 17th Street Bridge.

Post by nancs on Aug 12, 2006, 4:49pm

Hi Bob, and for some time now I have been going to post my &apos;Hawcreek&apos; memories, but seems like I&apos;ve just had way too many irons in the fire here of late.

Until your first Hawcreek posts, I really never gave a thought about from whence Hawcreek came. (Google Earth did come in real handy when this thought crossed my mind.) I really didn&apos;t!!!!! I &apos;knew&apos; Hawcreek like the back of my hand from 10th St. to over by Stadler&apos;s. Knew all the best &apos;hideouts,&apos; where to avoid the quick sand, where it was safe to ford, the areas to avoid that were inhabited with water moccasins, the best sand bars, places to avoid as hobo type folks sometimes frequented some spots.

Hawcreek would flood, and totally consume our shared pasture field, (just south and west of Hawcreek 7th St. Bridge in the 40s/early 50s, now all Cummins), and you could literally have fished out my folks&apos; bedroom window during the spring floods. It was always my &apos;job&apos; to &apos;clean up&apos; the pasture after the water went down to get rid of the broken glass, tin cans, and other things that might have presented a danger of injury to the horses. Man, it was a great day when an old metal laundry tub remained as the waters receded and with a rope attached I had my horse dragging it around to carry all this junk, made it much easier for me. Never ever gave a thought to why I would also find golf balls!!!!!! Nor was I enterprising enough to realize any cash for my finds!!!!! 

And Bob, in regards, to &apos;something nasty&apos; being dumped into the creek. On more than one occasion, the creek in our pasture, and I suppose over by Saddle Club Grounds, would be lined with dead fish. Can&apos;t say that it happened often, as I can only recall a few times that we kept the horses stabled until my dad felt that the creek water was safe for them to drink again. I only remember my dad saying that &apos;something must have been dumped&apos; in the creek to pollute it. And knowing my dad, my guess would be that he did try to find the source of the problem, but..................I never really thought a great deal about that.

Most of the time, it seemed that the creek was &apos;clean.&apos; Altho&apos; know I was never allowed to just wade in it, as there was always glass in the creek bed just waiting &apos;for a bare foot.&apos; I always had to wear either old rubber boots, or old shoes to wade across to catch my horse on the other side. And I surely never caught a fish from it, with my stick pole, string line, and a safety pin hook. At the Saddle Club Grounds there was a hand pump, but that water was not fit for human consumption. Not that it was probably labeled as such, but just a fact that everyone knew.

Your Hawcreek posts sure gave me food for thought. Thanks for sharing.

Just an FYI, in the 1940s thread, my reply # 36, includes several photos of the 7th St./Hawcreek area, that I refer to.

 Part Three:&quot;My Hawcreek Experiences and Early Income&quot; 

Great, experiences Nanc and you too enjoyed the adventures of the creek. Sorry, you didn&apos;t cash in on selling your golf balls at 17th Street bridge or on the course. The creek was very clean for a long period after the heavy rains and some floods. I recall the banks got higher from the golf course bridge all the way to Stadlers.

The banks were lower the opposite direction from the golf bridge. I think the golf creek crossing bridge was about a half a mile to the 17th Street bridge. The Club House (owned by Mr. Sharp at the time) was in low creek country so to speak. Then winding on around parallel to the water system building and baseball fields, and past the present ice skating rink was also lower banks. However, I found more snakes and wild animals from 17th Street bridge to the 25th Street bridge.

What a great time and experience. I suppose one day I&apos;ll write about my Clifty Creek adventures and some hunting trips when I was sitting under a shag bark hickory tree when a red fox walked by me. That is another story later.

Does anyone remember&quot;Bill&apos;s Self Serve&quot;? It was a meat market located on 25th and Beam Road. I believe it would have been in business around 1948-1950 time period.
My father, Billy Cooper, owned this store and I am trying to find any information or memories of this store. I just recently found my brother, after 35 years, and he is the one who has
provided most of this information for me. We are now trying to do some family research together. If you remember this place at all or have any information on it or my father please reply.

Thanks in advance,

PS- does anyone know if I can go to the court house records to find information on an old business?

Welcome Malynda, to the message boards.

During my recent trip back to Columbus, I found that the Records Dept. of the county offices to be a great source of info. From the way you wrote, I am guessing that you are &apos;somewhat in the area.&apos; The ladies in that department were great in helping me locate info. Surely worth the effort to offer your question and see if you get any leads.

As well as, I found the Cleo Rogers Library in Columbus, another great source of info. Not only are the old newspapers available on micro-film (there is another word for it tho&apos; ;-), but cross directories as well. I was amazed at the info that the librarian came up with for me.

Good luck with your search. Trust me, it will be a lot of fun, and one little clue will lead to many more. Just fascinating. Enjoy.

And stick around these boards, as many people are out there posting memories. It is amazing the info that appears.

NOTE: I didn&apos;t move to 15th Street until 1950 at a single digit age. Beam Road was not totally developed from 17th Street to US 31 until 1952 or so. It was a dirt road for a short time. I don&apos;t recall a meat shop called Bill&apos;s Self-Service, but do remember The Self Service grocery above, and perhaps at the same location you described.

Good job, Bob, and I keep forgetting that I have a 1951 phone directory. I will eventually scan and post the ad I found for &apos;Allen&apos;s Self Serv,&apos; as you mentioned. In the meantime, this is the contents of the ad.

 Allen&apos;s Self Serv

Malynda, I would think that armed with some of this info you would be able to find additional info in the cross directories that are availabe in the library, going back two or three years. There are a few missing volumes, but think that you could probably find out where your father lived, as well as who his neighbors were.

Then, think I would post that kind of info here, on the off chance that someone reading the boards might have lived in your dad&apos;s neighborhood. And you just might be &apos;off &apos;n running&apos; on additional leads.

Good luck, will read with much interest how your search unfolds. Keep us up to date.

Wow Nanc, that was fast and great ! Here is additional information Malynda may be able to use in her hunt. The following are names and addresses of families that lived next to Bill&apos;s Self Serve meat market in 1953. Hope, these names might help in your search. Keep in mind that if you contact them, some may be older or you may be talking to their children. We are talking 56 or 57 years ago here. Good Luck ! Here are the names:

Hmmmmm, Bob, with your posting of names---------I recognized one, I&apos;m sure: William Fox, and since I have been &apos;removed&apos; from Columbus for &apos;lo, so many years,&apos; other than the Bob-o-Link, was the only &apos;landmark&apos; I could recall. But with the mention of William Fox, I do remember where they lived.

These folks were friends of my parents, and had a son, I believe, several years younger than me---------almost think that in my mom&apos;s &apos;treasures&apos; there is a photo Christmas card of this family, and if such is the case, I may eventually be able to produce the son&apos;s name.

Gee whiz, Malynda, now I am as fascinated with your search as you probably are. Gosh, this is fun!!!!!!!!!!!!

Somewhere on this board someone posted their comments about having worked at a Bowling Alley as pin spotters. Todays local newspaper The Republic Looking Back column has the following information from this date in 1956.

Austin Miller the owner of Miller Bowling Lanes which was located at 2000 National Road announced the end of using pin boys. Fully automatic pin-setters were being used for the first time in his alley. Re: Bill&apos;s Self Serve 
Post by Malynda Lucy on Aug 15, 2006, 10:52am

YEAH!!!!

Thanks so much to everyone for all the help and inspiration!!

We are definitely on the right track. William Fox was definately a neighbor and is actually my brother&apos;s uncle (he is my half brother so the Fox family is not my relation but his). I know that he said that his uncle lived just down from the store a couple of houses.

I will have to take a trip to the records and see what all I can find. I am about 2-2.5 hrs north of Columbus but I may be able to get there in the next few weeks.

I can&apos;t wait to share this with my brother! Until I met my brother (who is 25 years older than me) I never even knew anything about a store. This is so neat!! He has really shed some light on my family history.

Finding my brother and learning about my father has definitely been a highlight I will never forget!

Thanks again to everyone and I will keep you updated on my findings,
Malynda

PS- my father, Billy Cooper, was from Hope, Indiana but lived in Columbus for sometime.

OMG, Malynda, the world just gets smaller every single day!!!!! Of all the names, and only one that I recognized, and to be &apos;sort of family of yours.&apos; That has to be a real WHOA!!!!

Went out to feed my horses, as they were thinking &apos;their mommy&apos; had forgotten them this morning!!!! And as I cleaned corrals, decided I&apos;d look for the photo Christmas card when I was finished with that chore.

And wella, the second envelop I looked in produced not one, but two cards. Wife: Mary, Husband: Bill, Son: Michael. The one of Michael as a baby was dated 1951, so am guessing his birthdate would have been in that year.

Just checked the Columbus Logs on the website homepage, and there is a &apos;Michael Fox&apos; in the 1969 Log. With a birth year of 1951, would guess that is probably the right &apos;Michael.&apos; (I just typed in a search on the homepage of Michael Fox to come up with that info.)

I did check &apos;Google Earth&apos; to confirm my thinking on where these folks lived, and I was on target on that, so think it is all jelling.

Got a ton to do today, but will scan the two Christmas photo cards and that ad, and post them here eventually.

This is surely, an &apos;oh, my.&apos; And YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fun isn&apos;t it????

______________________________________________

I remember that well, when the pin-setters lost their jobs to the automatics. I went and bowled at Miller&apos;s many times off and on during pin-setters days and after. I walked into the back once and watched the pin-setters in action. Downtown main had another small bowling alley, but I forget where it was but they kept pin-setters in action longer and I don&apos;t think they ever went automatic. They closed in some unknown year.

Gosh, Bob, I&apos;m not that much older than you are, and you are far more enterprising that I was!!!! You mean you didn&apos;t get a job setting pins??? Out here in CA, we had a high school PE class-------bowling. And were transported by bus to the local bowling alley for &apos;a bowling class.&apos; All girl class, and you had to take your turn setting pins. And in looking back, I only remember that it was fun to set the pins, through perhaps more mature eyes now, it probably wasn&apos;t all that safe a task!!!!! Don&apos;t suppose the school systems of today would be much willing to take on &apos;that liability.&apos; As it was rather a scare when some &apos;ding-a-ling&apos; let go of a ball, headed it down the alley, and you weren&apos;t out of the way yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Not a Columbus memory, just one of the 50s.

 &quot;From The Columbus Jive Kennel to The Whiteland Barn To Dance&quot; 


Well, in and around 1957 through 1959 the pressure relief valve was not the Columbus Jive Kennel&apos;s ping pong, juke box dancing and cards; but the Whiteland Barn dance hall.

On Sunday nights when everyone was supposed to be studying for classes the next day at Columbus High School, I was dancing with the ladies at the Whiteland Barn off North US 31 above Franklin Indiana. Rock and Roll spin records, and live bands, plus&quot;Bouncing Bill Baker&quot;from WIBC Indianapolis radio hosted in those days.

Song Like:&quot;Come Lets Stroll, Stroll Across The Floor&quot;...........and.......&quot;Let&apos;s Twist Again, Like We Did Last Summer&quot;....&quot;Hey Bo-Diddley&quot;...........&quot;Come With Me to the Sea, To the Sea Of Love&quot;............&quot;Get a Job, Sean, Na Na, Yep, Yep, Yep&quot;.......&quot;Yackety Sacks, Yackey, Yack, Yackety Yack&quot;.........and on and on.

You say, Bob you should be ashamed of yourself for sneaking out of the Jive Kennel on Sunday nights, and not putting your nose in those books for the next day. Well, I did and I don&apos;t regret anything I did in my younger days, because I had fun and was adventurous to say it bluntly.

I wasn&apos;t a trouble maker kid, just a kid that enjoyed life and had a lot of great friends. The word party.............well where is it and I am there?

All of this didn&apos;t hurt me in life and my future had plenty of time to catch up to me, not me catching up with it. I loved to dance and that has carried throughout my whole life. Anyway, the Jive Kennel was a great place for kids to gather, but the Whiteland Barn on Sunday nights couldn&apos;t be beat.

Well, once the future caught up with my pace I became an outstanding student in College and my life endeavors; which was a big change from my&quot;go, go ways&quot;of high school. So, my method of life&apos;s direction has been a trip, rewarding and of course fun

 &quot;The Jive Kennel a Canteen For The Teens of The 1950s&quot; 

During the 1950s the Jive Kennel was a place during the week that kids could visit and meet friends, converse and enjoy the entertainment. The Jive Kennel had ping pong tables, pool tables, card tables, juke box, space to dance, telephones and a soda jerk area for candies and bottled pop.

Many Columbus High School students would come and go from the Kennel and use it as a meeting place for get togethers and dates even. Many of the students would bring their books and even study at the Jive Kennel. It was open every night that I could remember, but Fridays, and Saturdays (if no sports games) was busy nights.

The Jive Kennel was a clean, stable, safe atmosphere for kids to hang-out at. I don&apos;t recall much of any problems or disturbances during my fours years of exposure. It was next door to the Crump Theater on 3rd and Franklin. Many times on Saturday I would just walk from the Kennel to either the Crump or Mode Theaters.

Good memories for many young kids in those days.

Hi to all, and to any, like Malynda planning to do research. And how I wish that I had been &apos;swift enough&apos; to make a more detailed list of questions--------as once you get &apos;into&apos; some of this, a jillion different directions to search pop up, and you tend to overlook some of your original questions.

For one, Malynda, since you know where your dad is buried, take the info off the headstone, and &apos;fly&apos; with some of that. Knowing the date of his passing, and you can probably find his &apos;obit&apos; in the newspapers that are available at the library. I know that a couple of obits that I researched produced &apos;chapter and verse&apos; of info/stories that I wanted to confirm.

I am not big into genealogy, but love to hear and find out about &apos;the old stories&apos; that I have always heard about family members, and folks within the community that I knew, or knew about.

I can&apos;t resist adding my two cents worth. Maylynda is my 1/2 sister and she&apos;s taking about my dad too. I remember the Self Service Grocery cause I was in it during my first few years living there. Dad built the grocery in about 1948 and sold it in about 1950. It was Bill&apos;s Self Serve during that time. Kay Mfg and Eads Service station were across the street.
My grandfather Carl Fox bought the&quot;triangle&quot;as defined by 25th St., Beam Rd. and US 31. We built 3 houses along 25th street. We lived in one Bill&amp;Mary Lou Cooper (and me). My uncle Bill Fox (Mike is my cousin) lived in one and Gene Misner lived in the third house. Fiesbeck bought our house when we moved. The store was on the corner of Beam and 25th.
We sold the land to the the folks that built the Bob-o-Link (Bob Beirline ?) and later the Columbus Motel.
It became Allen&apos;s Self Serve when we sold the store. Any photos from the time would be great.

I remember those pictures of my cousin Mike like they were yesterday. He was born in 1951 so the date on the first one is correct. He still looks like the second picture. I called him and told him he&apos;d better get online and defend his honor. I&apos;m sure he has pictures of me that I&apos;d rather not see posted.
I also asked my friend at the Republic to see if he could scare up some pictures or ads from Bill&apos;s Self Serve.

Bob (or anyone else),

Where was the Whiteland Barn located? Is the building still standing? I drive to Indy everyday (I69 0r US31) and vaquely think I&apos;ve seen faded signs for the Whiteland Barn off in the distance. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by rer on Aug 17, 2006, 8:00am

Ricky, the Whiteland Barn was located at Whiteland Indiana past Franklin. The barn was two stories and off US 31 on the right side going toward Indianapolis. I would say it may have been 1/2 mile off the road but you could see it in the 50s. I think in those days it was sorta in the country not in the main stream of the town, but not far off US 31.

I have no idea if it is still around. The dance floor was on the second floor of the barn. I think and I may be wrong here, but on Saturday nights it was country and western and Sunday nights it was all rock and roll music and dance.

It would be interesting to see a picture of an old sign. If you stop at a store in Whiteland and ask an older person, they may recall the place.

Barn dance
By: SHERRI CONER
Daily Journal staff writer
Article :

March 6-7, 2004


It had such a plain name: Whiteland Barn . Not surprising for a dance hall surrounded by cornfields on a country road. And yet, 40 years later, mention of Whiteland Barn stirs sweet memories for early rock n roll lovers.

Every Sunday evening, bobby-socks-wearing girls like Mary Ann Powell of Whiteland dressed in sweaters, full skirts and oxfords to enjoy an evening of dance music at the barn. Some girls rode to this Whiteland legacy with their boyfriends in souped-up GTOs,
Mustangs, Impalas and even a few Corvettes. Powell drove a two-tone green 1954 Ford.&quot;There were a bunch of us that just loved to dance,&quot;Powell says.&quot;A favorite dance at the time, she says, was The Stroll.&quot;

Big names performed on the elevated stage upstairs in the barn beside a 90-by-60-foot hardwood dance floor.&quot;When Jerry Lee Lewis appeared there in 1961&quot;, Powell was in the audience.&quot;He really didn&apos;t sit and play the piano, Powell says of Lewis.&quot;He jumped and moved around and kinda climbed all over the piano.&quot;Mike McCart of Greenwood was also in the audience that evening when Lewis pounded&quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;on the ivories.
&quot;He&apos;d take his right leg and stomp on the piano keys while he was playing it at the same time,&quot;McCart said.&quot;Nobody else could excite the crowd like he did.&quot;

On another occasion, McCart drove his red 1966 Ford Fairlane 500 to Whiteland to see Fats Domino croon his famous&quot;Blueberry Hill.&quot;Linda Wirey of Franklin&quot;begged and begged and begged to get to go&quot;when The Kingsmen
appeared at the barn in 1968, Wirey&apos;s senior year of high school.
Wirey and her friend Karen Threlkeld won their parents over so they could dance to a live version of&quot;Louie, Louie.&quot;Neil Sedaka, Dionne Warwick, Bo Diddley, The Drifters and even a young, pre-fame Johnny Cougar later known as John Mellencamp performed in this barn in the middle of nowhere.

Don Hohlt, 69, of Indianapolis was the man behind the music and dance mania.&quot;The first night we opened, in 1958, we charged 75 cents. We had 72 boys and three girls,&quot;Hohlt says with a laugh.&quot;I&apos;ll never forget it if I live to be 100.&quot;

This two-story, flat-roof barn on the Hohlt family farm did not start out as a hot spot for rock &apos;n&apos; roll, Hohlt says. For a few years before World War II, Hohlt&apos;s father hosted square dances in the barn. Whiskey bootleggers hung around outside the entrance.&quot;But when the war broke out, gas was rationed,&quot;Hohlt says. And that was the end of square dances.&quot;

A few years later, Hohlt&apos;s father tried another business venture. This time, he turned the barn into a bingo hall.&quot;They&apos;d have 900 to 1,000 ladies in there playing bingo,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;Then they were raided one night. And that was the end of bingo.&quot;When Hohlt returned from serving in Korea in 1957, his father&apos;s health was failing. Family finances were dwindling. In desperation, Hohlt and his mother unsuccessfully reopened the barn for square dances.

&quot;Here&apos;s where the luck came in,&quot;Holt says.&quot;Somebody suggested teen dances.&quot;So Hohlt contacted a top DJ for the era, Bouncin&apos; Bob Baker at WIBC. Hohlt paid Baker $50 to spin 45s&quot;single-song records&quot;at the barn. Hohlt also invited area bands to perform. Keith Phillips, then a resident of Edinburgh, and his band Keetie and the Kats became frequent performers at the barn. Every week, Phillips drove his fire-engine-red, five-window custom 1931 Ford coupe to Whiteland. Band members initially wore white and black corduroy shirts, hand-stitched by Phillips mother, Gladys Phillips, now 92, who still resides in Edinburgh.&quot;Back then, instrumentals were a big deal,&quot;says Phillips, who today resides in Washington state.&quot;A hit didn&apos;t have to have words to be a hit.&quot;One popular request of the time was an instrumental called&quot;Apache.&quot;&quot;It was a must-play every Sunday,&quot;Phillips says.&quot;First thing you know, we were having great big crowds,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;Cars would pull up with eight or 10 kids in them.&quot;Then came the call from Jerry Lee Lewis&apos; agent in Tennessee.&quot;That&apos;s when Jerry Lee married his cousin and nobody would hire him,&quot;Hohlt says. Taking a risk that Lewis&apos; agent was correct, that Lewis was on his way back to the top of the music business, Hohlt agreed to pay Lewis $650 to perform. Then Hohlt rented a piano for Lewis to play.&quot;He practically demolished that piano,&quot;Hohlt says with a laugh.&quot;And the kids went crazy.&quot;

Rita Marcum, 56, of Mooresville, was a frequent patron at Whiteland Barn. Her boyfriend was a drummer and singer in a local band called The Impalas. She was known to wear a two-piece, white, fringed mini-dress with matching go-go boots, says this grandmother of two. She danced in a black cage with orange and lime green spray paint on the bars.&quot;With the black lights, it kinda accented the white fringe,&quot;Marcum says with a laugh. The mood in the barn was electric, Phillips says.&quot;I&apos;m telling you, the barn was major. There were 1,300 people coming around on a Sunday night. It became a thing. It was&quot;Be there or be square.&quot;It was incredible.&quot;

A photographer roamed through the crowd, aiming his camera at young people as they socialized near the downstairs concession stand or danced near the band. Hohlt displayed the photos inside a glass case.&quot;If your picture was there, you got a free pass for the next week. And you got the picture,&quot;he says.&quot;Before the night was over, all the pictures would be gone.&quot;

Alcohol was not allowed on the premises. Off-duty law enforcement officers and a few Whiteland firefighters provided security. With more than 1,000 teen-agers crowded inside one structure, people might envision hassles.&quot;But there were very few fights,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;They&apos;d be over before they got started
good.&quot;He recalls only three fights in the years he and his band played at the barn, Phillips says.&quot;And one of them was me,&quot;he says.

In 1965, Whiteland Barn was suddenly running out of steam. Phillips had moved on by then. His Keetie and the Kats band traveled the Midwest. Living first in New York and then California, Phillips entertained in nightclubs around the country.
Puzzled, Hohlt saw Sunday evening be-bopping dwindle every week.&quot;It just seemed like it happened overnight,&quot;Hohlt says. Phillips told Hohlt about a British rock &apos;n&apos; roll band, new to the music scene in the United States but sure to change the face of entertainment.&quot;I had never heard of the Beatles before,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;But Keith said,&quot;They&apos;re gonna be huge, Don. There won&apos;t be any more dancing.&quot;And he was absolutely right. Concerts took over.&quot;Six months later, Hohlt stopped mopping the dance floor in the barn.

Two years after that, Hohlt&apos;s family home next door to the barn caught fire.

 &quot;Whiteland Barn&quot; 

Ricky Berkey, what a great article you put in about the Whiteland Barn. I assume that was from a paper in Franklin, Whiteland or the Indianapolis Star in 2004.

It was historically written in sequence of several years of events, and correlated with what I had mentioned in my short brief on the barn. The Whiteland Barn was a clean, fun place to gather on Sunday nights and dance with the&quot;record spin jockeys&quot;and live bands. I left Columbus and Indiana after 1960 and lost track of the Barn, but always had fond memories of it&apos;s place, in younger entertainment.

My replacement for the Whiteland Barn was the Beach Club at Myrtle Beach for many years after the Barn experience.

Thanks for putting the informative article here to see.

 I can&apos;t resist adding my two cents worth. Maylynda is my 1/2 sister and she&apos;s taking about my dad too. I remember the Self Service Grocery cause I was in it during my first few years living there. Dad built the grocery in about 1948 and sold it in about 1950. It was Bill&apos;s Self Serve during that time. Kay Mfg and Eads Service station were across the street.
My grandfather Carl Fox bought the&quot;triangle&quot;as defined by 25th St., Beam Rd. and US 31. We built 3 houses along 25th street. We lived in one Bill&amp;Mary Lou Cooper (and me). My uncle Bill Fox (Mike is my cousin) lived in one and Gene Misner lived in the third house. Fiesbeck bought our house when we moved. The store was on the corner of Beam and 25th.
We sold the land to the the folks that built the Bob-o-Link (Bob Beirline ?) and later the Columbus Motel.
It became Allen&apos;s Self Serve when we sold the store. Any photos from the time would be great.

The picture below was taken August 17, 2006. The building is located on the southwest corner of 25th Street and Beam Road in Columbus, Indiana.

Peters Plumbing, Heating&amp;Air Conditioning is located in that building now. Their yellow page ad states that theyve been serving Columbus since 1957.

My thinking is that this is the building that would have housed Bills Self Serve. Perhaps a member of this board could stop at Peters to see if they have any old pictures of this building. To me, it seems to be the correct size to have been a Self Serve.

While looking at the lack of parking in front of the building remember that in those days the road was two lanes. Today its five lanes if you count the turning lane in the center!

Bob,

That article was from the&quot;Daily Journal&quot;printed in Franklin, the local paper for Franklin and the immediate surrounding area. Incidentally that paper is also owned by the Brown family who have published the&quot;Republic&quot;in Columbus for generations. I pulled that column from a rock &apos;n&apos; roll forum but I&apos;m wanting to check out the actual paper or microfiche to see if there was a picture accompanying the article. And speaking of Jerry Lee Lewis: there is a CD recording on the imported&quot;Bear Family&quot;record label of a live concert which appears to be partially recorded at the Barn:

 

Below is an an online review of this CD from amazon.com:

 &quot;I saw this show live !, April 24, 1999
Reviewer: A music fan
I saw this show live at the Whiteland Barn in Whiteland Indiana on a Sunday night sometime in 1961or62.The&quot;Barn&quot;was the hottest thing going at the time. Because Indiana was a&quot;dry&quot;state on Sundays and we always stocked up the night before for the dance I met for the first time,Jerry Lee,and a girl he introduced as his sister;Sherry Lee.we drank whisky for awhile talked and laughed around.Then it was show time.It was one of the best concerts that I have ever seen. The play list contains some of the best tunes of the period, the energy of jerry lee that night was pure insanity.If you want to hear the killer on top of his game,buy this CD and turn in up real loud.&quot; 

What I love about history is not the&quot;important stuff&quot;that makes it into the textbooks but the trivial everyday things that people actually experience and start to forget as our brain cells dissolve. Thats what is so important about forums like this to preserve the recent past before it is forgotten. I&apos;m fascinated to know what used to be at any particular location and how the streets and buildings evolved over a period of time.

 &quot;Your Early Morning Vitamin Pill From 1956 through 1969.....Bouncin Bill Baker....Disc Jockey of WIBC Radio, 1070 on Your AM Dial&quot; 

Riding or driving to Columbus High School or work, from 1956 through 1960 always involved the king of radio early in the morning. He played all the popular tunes and the top 40 daily. He was a trip (so to speak) with his humor, and vocal presentation to entertain people, either going to school or work. It seemed like lots of Columbus folks listened to Bouncin Bill most mornings.

Bouncin Bill perform live at many high school dances, dance halls and the Whiteland Barn also. He always annouced that he was&quot;your early morning vitamin pill.&quot;

In 1969, he retired from WIBC to found Broadcast Productions of America, an audio and video production company. In 2004,&quot;Bouncin&apos; Bill&quot;was inducted into the Indiana Disc Jockey Hall of Fame.

He died at age 77 in August 2005 leaving many memories and sorrow to many artists and fans during the years sited.

Just wanted to email a BIG thank you for taking your time and effort to put up the picture of the building my father once owned. I really appreciate everyone&apos;s help with this and I know that I will eventually find something with the name or picture of it etc.

I believe my brother is having someone at the newspaper check to see if there are any ads etc.

Also, I may contact the current owner of the building to see if there are any old photos like you mentioned.

Thanks so much and God bless,

 &quot;When Did It All Start and End For Columbus High Senior Cords?&quot; 

 

Well, I don&apos;t know the beginning or ending history of the Columbus High School senior corduroys (cords), but can speak about them during the period of 1955 through most of the 1960s. During my brother&apos;s years at Central and the Pearl Street area, he wore just plain light yellow cords and many other seniors wore painted cords. During my time at the 25th Street school, many students also wore the painted yellow senior cords.

During late year 1958 I painted my own cords above (not the greatest artist that is for sure) and many other fellow students&apos; cords. In fact students that I ran around with in Franklin Indiana asked me to paint their skirts and pants. I only charged mostly for the paint tubes that were used because it cost almost $6 or $7 in paint to complete the skirt or pants. The ink was indelible from tube pens bought at the Nagel Book and Art store on Washington Street.

In my days, a Junior during the last week of their Junior Class was allowed to wear the cords only the last week of that school year. I guess this was a tradition so to speak.

Senior cords were worn traditionally on Fridays, but some wore them daily and some everyday. I recall a couple guys wore them and never washed them; which is a story to be left out of here. I washed mine weekly !

As I said I wasn&apos;t a good artist but got by with painting as many as I could for other students. One of the best painters in school was classmate Terry Galbraith. He had such wonderful creativity in his art work, and other young guys like Bill Hawkins, and various ladies from art classes. Some had professionals do the paintings. I am pleased for memories that I did mine and some others.

Does anyone know the full history or starting and ending of this former CHS tradition ? I understand today it no longer walks in the school halls.

 Bob&apos;s Cords...the waist isn&apos;t what it used to be. LOL

 
 UPDATE: Received word from a 1969 grad that his class still had some cords that were painted. He believes his class was the last to paint cords . Also, Richard posted at #90 pictures of pants/skirts painted from Sadie&apos;s Family Dining under 1950s. The men&apos;s pants at Sadie&apos;s came from Peru Indiana High School and the skirts looks like Columbus.

 &quot;From A Columbus High School Class Of The Middle 1950s Through The 1969 Class, The End of Painted Cords&quot; 

Unless someone else comes forward, I was told this afternoon from a guy in Texas that he thinks the 1969 Class was the last to paint Senior Cords.

It&apos;s sad that tradition sometimes can&apos;t maintain itself. I notice even in the Armed Forces that newer rookie members have had urges to change many traditions. I don&apos;t like the constant traditional changes because I kinda like to preserve history somewhat. Maybe, the high school will revive the pants and skirt tradition someday.

In 1988 my son wore my Columbus High School Senior cords pant during his senior year one day in North Carolina. It was a special day to dress up different; so he wore my 28 year old pants. Today they are 47 years old and the fabric is in remarkable shape and sound. The only draw back is the waist has shrunk and I can&apos;t seem to get them on because of it. Ha, ha, ha......

Anyway, it was interesting to be involved with a tradition that went on for almost 15 years in Columbus.

 Let us think here.........they say things over 100 become antiques and if my son keeps them until they are 100 then they could be on the television show, Antique Road Show. They would be worth..........well, a...........probably.......a...........nothing.

Re: the painted cords. For the life of me I can&apos;t recall any of the boys in my class (I graduated in 1953) ever painting their cords. I remember the light yellow cords that a lot of them wore but sure do not recall any painting. The school was mighty strict about a lot of things during my four years, so its very possible that this came about after 1953. I will get out my Logs for my four years in high school and see if I see any painting on any of the pants but I have serious doubts if it was going on during this time.

Re: painted cords. I have looked through my 1953 Log and I did not see a single pair of painted cords, so I don&apos;t think this was anything that took place during my four years at CHS.

Thanks Babs ! I think we have now determined it probably started around 1955 or so. We know the 1955 Class had them and the last know was around 1969, unless someone else comes forward with new information. The previous information about the senior cords has been modified. Richard just found these web sites at David&apos;s other Historical Web Site and they show a bunch of skirts and pants. Enjoy these pictures of the cords (just key on these three sites for view):

Re: painted cords. I will inquire of some of my classmates if any of them recall the painted cords, but for the life of me, they do not stand out in my mind. If anyone comes up with a memory that our Seniors did wear them, I will gladly rethink my original opinion. Not a single boy in my 1953 Log had anything painted on their cords. There were also a lot of regular dress slacks so I guess a lot of guys&quot;dressed up&quot;to have their picture taken. You don&apos;t see too many jeans even in the year book; a few here and there but most of the fellas are pretty much in nicer clothes. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by rer on Aug 24, 2006, 4:03pm

I have some people saying cords may go back further, but can&apos;t confirm yet. The Logs may not be the sole source of verifications. I am starting to believe that the plain yellow cords may have been a precursor to the painted yellow cords. Maybe, others will come on-line and recall something. I was verbally told today that they think 1954 had painted cords. Interesting, adventure if nothing else. We now know for sure that 1955 was big into painting yellow cords. We also know other schools were either doing it or copied Columbus in fashioned cords. This is just a Historical endeavor to maybe put the subject to rest somewhere down stream.

Yes Nanc
Charlie was a member of our 1955 Class. He displayed his cords at our Reunion. Quite a guy !! Surely enjoyed seeing him and his wife at our 50th Reunion last year.
As for the Senior Cords. I did not have my pair on display July 15th as they had been lost in several of our family moves. I wore a poodle skirt that day.
Painted cords were very popular in 1955. I painted a skirt for myself and also one for a girlfriend Betty Hollenbeck. Enjoyed wearing them to school and so glad someone posted the pics from our 1955 Log. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 Rock&amp;Roll Music and Stars 1957 

 

Dick Clark&apos;s American Bandstand was an ABC television show in 1957, and Dick and American Bandstand had a huge impact on the music business, dance and sales. Elvis continued to rock&amp;roll, and Ricky Nelson, Paul Anka, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the Everly Brothers all made their debuts. It was a great year for music again.

Hey, Bob, love the &apos;collection&apos; of song hits. Gad, do you hear me humming..............................?????, actually we have a number of tapes of these oldies that we play in the car. And CDs to play here at home. Thanks to a special message board person!!!! Along with Garrison Keillor tapes, from Lake Woebegon escapades!!!!! What about &apos;Jambalaya,&apos; wasn&apos;t that popular in, maybe 1950, or 1951???? Editing here: Love the internet, for sure, the date was 1952, and Hank Williams, Sr. the artist. Just an interesting little side issue here: I have a therapy dog, an English Mastiff, and we make visits to hospitals, AND my dog&apos;s &apos;girl friend&apos; is a dog co-owned by Hank Williams, Jr., and goes to the Super Bowl and on tour with him, as a &apos;protection dog.&apos; Makes for a small world, I guess. 

And I guess one of my all time favorites, &apos;Well, I never felt more like singing the blues.......................&apos; and let&apos;s face it, ANYTHING Patsy Cline will work!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, work, that is, if you want to dissolve me into tears rather quicky!!!!!!!!!!!!! Think &apos;Honeycomb&apos; about falls in the same category. With a USMC &apos;redo&apos; of the words, that was pretty funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &apos;It&apos;s a heck of a life, and it ain&apos;t very funny, how I joined the Marine Corps to make some money................&apos; Any takers here for that &apos;instant recall?&apos; 

Isn&apos;t it &apos;interesting&apos; how certain songs will trigger specific memories, and times of the past????? Let&apos;s face it, &apos;Rock Around the Clock&apos; will definitely make the bod want to dance!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks for the memories. Special times with special people. It still means so much, and will always hold a most special spot in my heart.

 Hum, Hum, Hum...Tap, Tap......... 

 

As I was posting the music by different years, I heard this faint cracking and humming coming from my four speakers. Then, I found out it was Nanc tapping her feet and humming, she said.

Yes, you can read all the song titles slowly and mentally develop pictures of your wonderful younger days. I can search through many of them and place myself at the beach, in a certain state or event, and even a dance place.

Anyway it is refreshing to be able to recall the good days of music and the relationship and impact it had on many of our lives.

I hold the song&quot;Cherry Pink and AppleBlossom White&quot;close to my heart. That was Bill and my song. Doggone it ....I can&apos;t recall the trumpet soloist that played it !! Can some one help me out ? I can remember we would get a hot fudge sundae at the DQ here in Columbus and then drive to Seymour to get another one as this played on Bill&apos;s radio in his 48 black Chevy Coupe. For a while he would keep the spoons lined up on the sun visor until we collected too many of them. Oh such special memories !! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Your song:

Scroll down at this site and look at Eddie Calvert that played that song solo in 1955:

 (1) http://www.45-rpm.org.uk/dire/eddiec.htm 

 (2) http://www.homestead.com/LadyChess/Trumpeters.html 

 Herb Albert and Perez Prado also played it . I think Margo is right either Perez Prado or Herb Albert played it mostly.

NOTE: His popularity can be assessed from the success of his records which included two number ones, &apos;Oh Mein Papa&apos; followed more than a year later by &apos;Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White&apos;.

Ok this is addictive !! I had to get back up and cruise the net until I found it. The trumpeteer who made it famous was Perez Prado.

Bob...... look on your list of top songs for 1955 just above. I found that list AFTER I had spent way too much time researching it. However for some reason Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass sticks in my mind. Thanks for helping me out.

Finally located it on the net and you may click here to listen to it. BOY !! Does this version sound Extremeley Tinny ! I surely don&apos;t remember it sounding like this !!!

Thanks Bob,I have been trying to remember the name of that store for at least 10 years now.The place was barely bigger than a one-room apartment,yet jammed to the gills with records.In the 60s there were two releases of LPs,stereo and mono.And LPs took up lots more room than CDs.But this little place did a good job of stocking the happening tunes.
When i was a little older,I heard that a better selection of records could be had at Circle Records in Naptown (at the Circle,natch).And it was true,but Circle Records was not any bigger than Berry&apos;s,it was just more clogged with product.To this day theres nothing I like better than cluttered,dusty record stores.But theres only a few left.
I got my first guitar at Tom Pickett&apos;s,next to Pasquale&apos;s.But I liked the record selection better at Berry&apos;s.There was another record store in the 25th St shopping center next to Tommy Thompson&apos;s hobby shop.I remember the little room they had where you could listen to a 45 before you bought it.Aw man those were the days.

 Record Stores Of The 1950s 

Well Marksix I am pleased after 10 years you got the name of Berry&apos;s Record Store back. I bought many 45s and 33s in that store during my younger days. Another record shop and now I can&apos;t remember it&apos;s name.

 LOCATION BUT WHAT WAS IT&apos;S NAME ? 

The location was across from the Jive Kennel on 3rd Street corner. Next door was the Belvedere Hotel then the Gause resturarant. I remember buying records at a very young age after leaving the Crump Threater. I think it was on the corner of 3rd and Franklin. The 1953 directory says 434 3rd was Associated Sales (Real Estate), but I think they must have closed and briefly a record store was opened. I don&apos;t recall the store staying open for a prolonged period though.

Thanks Marksix now I can&apos;t remember...........ha, ha, ha.... Nice seeing you posting on the board Marksix we need all the memories we can muster up. Whoooow.........no that isn&apos;t senility, just 50 years ago or so.

Drum roll here------------Let&apos;s hear it for Elvis!!!!! Surely one of the performers that we all remember. Think my favorite Elvis song is &apos;Don&apos;t Be Cruel.&apos;

And there are Elvis impersonators by the score, and many do believe that he &apos;is in the building&apos; somewhere, perhaps singing, &apos;I ain&apos;t nothing but a hound dog.&apos;

At this time I would like to introduce my favorite Elvis impersonator and his &apos;groupie girlfriend.&apos;

 

This is a hoot---------my favorite Elvis impersonator is my own English Mastiff, Brutus. With his &apos;girlfriend groupie,&apos; we make visits to local (in CA) hospitals, assisted living facilities etc. to visit patients and their families, and spread good cheer. I should add here, that our therapy dogs are welcomed in the hospitals, as research shows that their visits do much good for patients. We are welcome in all areas, including CCU, ICU, ER, pediatrics, the burn unit, etc.

We have found that dressing our certified therapy dogs (certified w/TDI) in costume is guaranteed to bring a smile to a face. I can&apos;t begin to tell you how many times they have had their picture taken &apos;impersonating Elvis&amp;Co.&apos; &apos;Elvis and his girlfriend&apos; have &apos;been in the building&apos; at the recent Critical Care Nurses Convention down by Disneyland, as well as the Home Show in August, and a recent function in Fullerton. Additionally, just for kicks &apos;on Route 66,&apos; I took &apos;my Elvis&apos; to a local Cruise Night of vintage cars during &apos;Elvis month in August.&apos;

Being serious here, for just a sec, training and working with a therapy dog is ever such rewarding volunteer work. When I was in Columbus in July, I did check around a bit, and actually found that no certified dogs were making visits to Four Seasons, as an example. If you are interested in a truly wonderful experience, check out information on THERAPY DOGS INTERNATIONAL, or visit my local chapter&apos;s website, THERAPY DOGS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

You will be truly blessed for your efforts.

The picture of Elvis and his girl friend is adorable!

There are no dog therapy groups in Columbus that I&apos;ve heard of but recently the Republic ran an article on two ladies that I seem to recall lived in Seymour and they are part of a Therapy Group from there. It shouldn&apos;t be too difficult to get a local one going if anyone is interested. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Reference Post #123...The picture in question I believe David was wondering where Central was or if it even went North of 25th Street. Yes, it did, it went out to what is Rocky Ford and made two curves on out to the air base. The PSI building would be right on Central, as it is today, even though the street is hardly wide enough to see. The group of buildings that he also questions I believe would be the early Dunlap apartments. They are still there, just South of Krogers and you enter off of 27th Street.

Bob,
That was Ernie&apos;s Record Shop, owned by Ernie Kerns. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by nancs on Sept 10, 2006, 9:57am

 On &apos;phonograph record stores&apos;: In my 1951 and 1952 phone directories, I find: Hinkle Music House located at 306 3rd St. and Pennington Music Co. at 1903 Central Ave. No ads in the directories, just this information.

As I thumbed through these phone directories, it is always a &apos;surprise&apos; to find something that my mom felt was worthy of being saved. This search came up with a &apos;brochure&apos; titled &apos;Welcome to Columbus,&apos; and one section truly does relate what I was perhaps trying to say the other day in a post I made in the &apos;Trivia thread.&apos;

 .......the People of Columbus--such people , one of several sections within the brochure, with a publish date of about 1951, read on:

 Ask any newcomer about Columbus and right off he&apos;ll start talking about its PEOPLE long before he gets around to mentioning its 94 different industries, its rich farming area, its fine schools and churches and its recreation centers.

What one feels about the PEOPLE of Columbus is sort o&apos; hard to define. You can&apos;t measure it by tape or scales. It&apos;s the imbedded flavor of many generations of Hoosierdom where people have worked out their own destinies, and in doing so have learned to work and live and laugh and cry together.

Not the sort of friendliness you learn in rule books. It&apos;s just there, in the hearts, in the open howdy-dos, in the neighborly, informal chats, in the small clumps on street corners and in the groups at the neighborhood auctions.

Housewives swap rhubarb pies for blackberry jelly over back yard fences. The corporation president sits in a Sunday school class taught by a factory foreman. Sidewalks downtown on Saturday nights are a sight to behold! Farmers, factory workers, teachers, preachers, bankers and their wives and children and their cousins and their uncles and their aunts all are there. And they&apos;re all having a wonderful time.

In Columbus folks notice it when you get a new suit; ask about the kid who broke his arm falling from a cherry tree; miss you when you miss church; top your fish story with a taller one. Generally, they&apos;re the sort you hit it off with from the time you&apos;ve moved in, got up your curtains, and made your first trip to the neighborhood grocery .

 RIGHT ON!!!! I really think this section &apos;says it all,&apos; I really do. It is this sort of atmosphere, that truly does make one&apos;s hometown roots go so deep. Makes you proud, doesn&apos;t it, to recall your &apos;Growing Up in Columbus?&apos; And perhaps, in a way, one of the reasons that this message board is such a success. IT&apos;S THE PEOPLE.

Post by babs on Sept 10, 2006, 10:41am

Nanc,
Yes I am very proud to have been lucky enough to be born and raised in Columbus, Indiana. Also extremely happy we returned here 6 years ago. They say&quot;you can&apos;t go home&quot;but that is not true because you certainly can, especially if the hometown is one such as Columbus. The people do make the difference and having lived in seven different states and having traveled all over the world, let me tell you there is no better place to live than our wonderful United States. People in Columbus are extremely friendly and caring. Strangers speak and smile at you on the street, workmen on the top of a new home being constructed will wave at you as you pass by, garbage men wave as they leave your development after having picked up your garbage and on and on I could go. People do make the difference and I am not sure if it&apos;s Midwestern hospitality or just what but there is something here that makes you&quot;feel at home&quot;. When we are out and about I don&apos;t see all that many people I know but I do see smiling and friendly faces and it most definitely is a wonderful place to live.

 Record and Phonograph Store 

The 1953 directory shows the following music company at 1903 Central Avenue:

Pennington Music Company
(Phonographs)
Owner: Russell G. Pennington

 Note : I remember Hinkles&apos; Music House well. They sold musical instruments of all types. Record stores started opening and closing more when Rock&amp;Roll music started. I don&apos;t remember if East Columbus had a record store, but Richard would possibly remember.

 Gregg, the Berry Record Shop was listed in the 1960 Columbus High
School Log, back pages at the address I mentioned. Now there was a record shop between the Dairy Queen and the the A&amp;W;Becker&apos;s Root Beer place during 1958 and 1960, which later became a vacuum cleaner store. Then I left Columbus forever, until this board. I remember the name you mentioned, but remember this; I was a few years difference than you. Your brother Terry and I had the same exposure of years. Erie&apos;s Record Shop I do remember well, but Berry&apos;s was a big name in my days also.

I also, remember one that sold old and new records near the corner of 17th and Central. I remember buying the record called&quot;Book of Love&quot;by Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers from that store. This was open around the middle fifties, I suppose.

During my high school years (1968-1970), Tom Pickett&apos;s record shop was located just east of the Dairy Queen on 25th Street (between the Dairy Queen&amp;the high school). I don&apos;t know if Tom had a music store anywhere else prior to this location, and I&apos;m uncertain when his shop on 25th Street opened. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 Phonographs and Records - Dealers listings in the 1953 Columbus City Directory. 

1. Pennington Music Company 1903 Central Avenue.

My recollections are that the Pennington Music Company supplied/leased Juke Boxes to many locations in Columbus at this time. The 1903 address was the first house north of nineteenth street on the east side of the street. The store sat on the back of the lot in a garage sized building.

In the name listing section in this directory, it lists Bernard Pennington as President of (Music Co.). His wife Alberta was a clerk at Sears. Bernard and Alberta are listing as living at 3436 Central Avenue. It lists Russell G. and Wife Ruth as living at 1903 Central Avenue and employed at Pennington Music Company. Mrs. Marjorie Pennington is listed as a clerk at Pennington Music Company and living at 1815 Chestnut Street.

Bob said he purchased Book of Love from that location. Ive purchased a few records there in my time! I think everything they had was used as they would keep the Juke Boxes in town filled with the newest, latest hits and place the older hits on sale at quite a nice discount!

David,
Ernie&apos;s Record Shop was on 3rd St, directly across from the Crump Theater. Tom Pickett&apos;s first music store was on the SE corner of 8th and Washington. He sold instruments and gave lessons, be he didn&apos;t sell records at that location. I started playing guitar in 1956 and took lessons for 2 years from Ernie Kerns at the 3rd Street store. After Tom moved to town, I took lessons from him for a couple years, and I began teaching for him during my 9th grade year. When we moved to the 1126 25th Street location, between One Hour Martinizing and Pasquale&apos;s, we added the record department. I still have scars on my hands from assembling all those wooden record display boxes with a straight-bladed screw driver,(they tend to slip!) In response to a comment of Bob&apos;s, on a trip to Columbus a couple years ago, I went with my cousin to pick up a repaired vaccuum cleaner on 25th St., and I&apos;m pretty sure that was in the old Berry&apos;s House of Records store.

Hey Gregg! Nice to see you on the boards! I hope this summer has been a good one for you, and you haven&apos;t had to travel too much!

Thanks for the info regarding the music stores. I remember the very first record I ever bought: Simon&amp;Garfunkel&apos;s Sound Of Silence. I bought it at Murphy&apos;s.

Was Hill&apos;s Department Store around in the late 1960&apos;s? Maybe I&apos;m thinking of Shoppers Faire. Anyway, there was another place I used to buy albums, and I was thinking it was Hill&apos;s, but probably not!

I first discovered Tom Pickett&apos;s store when I started high school in 1968. I bought many 45&apos;s there.

I remember I&apos;d heard a song on the radio, but didn&apos;t catch the name of it. I went to see Tom. I said,&quot;Tom, I want to buy this new song that&apos;s out, but I don&apos;t know the name of it.&quot;Tom asked,&quot;How does it go?&quot;And I sang,&quot;Dee--Dee--Dee--Dee--Dee--Dum--Dum--Da--Dee--Dee--Dee--Dee--Dee--Dum--Dum--Da--Dum--Da--Dum...&quot;Tom said,&quot;Oh, that&apos;s Pictures Of Matchstick Men by the Status Quo.&quot;

I bought the 45 that day! I still have that 45. It&apos;s around here somewhere.

Thanks Tom! (And thanks for not laughing at my terrible singing!). I know he got a kick out of that

 THANK YOU ..THANK YOU ..THANK YOU !! 

TO TIM AND DOROTHY C.

I played your CD in my computer just now and was overwhelmed to hear the voices of Max Andress; Gerald Quillen; Chuck Richardson; Bill Stearman; Miss Murray and Miss Lyster and all the Students I remembered. Some of these have passed on and it is such an honor to hear their voices again.

 YOU HAVE MADE MY DAY !! 

Isn&apos;t it funny I can type the men&apos;s first names but the ladies are so engrained in my mind I automatically typed Miss as that&apos;s what we always called them. Of course we called the men teachers MR. but getting to know some of them very personally after graduation it was much easier to use their first name.
Does anyone know which Nursing Home Judson Erne is in ? Wouldn&apos;t it be great as a group to go visit him and say&quot;THANK YOU&quot;for caring about his students so much !!

Sad to say we do not have that type of respect in our current classrooms in Columbus. We in the 50&apos;s would never dare to call our teachers&quot;teach&apos; or use profanity in the classrooms !

You are correct,the&quot;Music Box&quot;was next to Tommy Thompsons Camera and Hobby store.As opposed to the other mentioned record stores,it was a lot bigger and more modern with more room to walk around.As i recall it probably opened during the years I was going to Northside Junior High,I guess around 65-66.
And referencing another question,Berry&apos;s Records was the little (I would say tiny) place between Becker&apos;s and the Dairy Queen.If it turned into a vacuum cleaner store,it would be after my time in the area.
In the section on the website of phone book ads from the 60&apos;s,there is an ad for Tom Picketts music center which has a picture of my friend from youth Billy Fisher,playing his Fender Jaguar and noting that he won an award,and that he was taught by Pickett.

As I posted &apos;Columbus Winter Wonderland&apos; photos, I found this photo, which is truly kind of a &apos;duh,&apos; as what silly person, probably me, would take a picture of someone taking a picture. 

However, I include it, as this area of Columbus has so vastly changed since this photo was taken in 1951.

 

If you drive on Cottage from 7th St. to 6th Street, the homes of my youth on the west side of the street remain. The ones on the east side of the street are now Cummins. This photo is taken behind those homes on the east side, and you can visualize the area, as they &apos;start&apos; at the first alley south of 7th St. The big 2 story home on the left was the Doty sisters residence. With Fulk&apos;s mill being on beyond that at the end of 6th Street. The home on the right side was Mrs. Kollmeyer&apos;s house.

As I run across these kinds of photos of places that no longer exist, I do get a little sad, as my &apos;past&apos; is truly gone. Only what I can remember and share with others.

 &quot;Hay Rides Of The 1950s&quot; 

Well, the first hay ride I went on was around 1953 with my lady friend at the time. It was a wooden wagon and full of fresh hay. Two horses pulled the many kids throughout the fields and through a water ford, and around the giant Columbus farm lands.

It was always fun because we all would talk, joke and sing songs together and become closer in friendship with all. The rides seemed to be at dawn and last for a couple hours. The wagon master was normally the father of the sponsor of the Hay Ride.

I went to school friends hay rides, and church rides. I suppose they still have them today. If not what a great time a young person is missing. I guess I went to a least six in my early young days. All were around Columbus and the county.

Technically, my &apos;hay ride&apos; memory belongs with the Jr. Trail Blazer section, but since &apos;info&apos; is here, will go with this thread.

My thinking says that the Jr. Trail Blazer hay ride, of my memory, was a late fall evening, as we were all dressed quite warmly. Am not certain who the &apos;wagon master&apos; was. In this case the wagon was pulled by a tractor. And Bob&apos;s description of the &apos;event&apos; would coincide with my memory, up to a point..............

As I recall, my dad followed the wagon in a car, not really quite sure why, have a thought or two, but.....................As the tractor and the wagon loaded with Trail Blazers &apos;chugged away down the country roads,&apos; all of a sudden----------------the tractor and the wagon &apos;parted company!&apos; With the wagon heading off the side, right into a ditch. It truly was a miracle that there were no serious injuries, as the wagon became quite tangled up in the barb wire fence. Know that at least one guy, who did get some scratches in his gallant efforts to protect the &apos;damsal cowgirls aboard&apos; was called a &apos;hero&apos; as he did keep several from being seriously hurt with the barb wire strands. Thanks LOJ, did you have on your white cowboy hat for this event???

Happy trails to you.

 &quot;Hawcreek The Early Income Driver&quot; 

Well, starting in 1950 when we moved to 15th Street there wasn&apos;t many jobs for kids less than double digits in age. The Golf Course (owned and operated by Mr. Sharp) near the hospital was only a couple miles from my house. Walking or biking to Hawcreek and to the Columbus Hospital bridge on 17th was not much of an effort.

As I discovered the beds and banks of Hawcreek from US 31 (near Bob-O-Link) back to Stadler&apos;s Meat Packing Bridge on State Street many golf balls and clubs were found in the creek. I guess I discovered that I could sell the balls to golfers mostly at the Hawcreek Bridge on 17th near the hospital. I sold balls in the very early 1950s for anywhere from 10 cents to 25 cents for an exceptional ball. I found in the woods edging the course layouts; lost balls and in the creek beds many times more. I suspect I had hundreds of recovered creek balls and some from the wooded areas.

The reason most balls ended up in the creeks was that the 8th hole tee off was across Hawcreek and up toward the 17th bridge. I would watch golfers from far away (off the course) hit and splash the creek water and hit more balls until success came about. One time I recall a man that got so upset with his inability to go over the creek he took his clubs and bent the shafts and threw them into high watered (at that time) Hawcreek.

Well, most golfers never tried to retrieve their creek balls. They would either try another ball or place one on the fairway after they walked across the steel bridge that arched across Hawcreek. One year much later the creek flooded and tore the metal bridge down. They replaced it with a rope type swing bridge.

I guess I had this golf ball sales income from 1950 through 1955. I also had a paper route starting in the early 50s. I never went past the State Street Bridge because Stadler&apos;s wasn&apos;t the most pleasant smell in the world and I didn&apos;t care to get near that place and the polluted creek water. Walking the creek beds for several miles was an adventure in itself. Many interesting objects and Indian Arrow heads were found at times. Snakes and I walked in different directions when encountered. I always carried a 2 iron golf club to ward off any snakes or other critters. Sometimes I would see a fox or two and squirrels/rabbits of course.

I understand that in later years the course became a city course and Mr. Sharp I guess retired. In summary Hawcreek provided that income to me when I wasn&apos;t even ten years old. Not only did it provided me the extra money but the fun adventures and the exploring was priceless. I guess I didn&apos;t need a computer game (no computers then) to entertain me, but down to earth good fun as a kid in Columbus.&quot;Our Gang Shows&quot;had nothing over my friends and I. Maybe, there were a lot of educational lessons walking the Hawcreek beds and banks. A lot of thinking and amusement for hours daily in the summer months.

Bob 
 


Bob, today all nine holes of The Greenbelt Golf Course are located between tenth and seventeenth streets on both sides of The Haw Creek. In the fifties that course was known as the Columbus Golf Club!

For those who are new to Columbus, the Columbus Golf Club was west of the Haw Creek on land that now holds the two Doctors office buildings near Hawcreek Avenue. The small white building on Lincoln Park Drive was the Pro Shop and Maintenance Building! On the east side of the Haw Creek the old course ran from seventeenth to fifteenth. On the west side of the Haw Creek it ran from seventeenth to tenth as it does today. Playing required you to cross seventeenth street twice.

Today the course has a bridge near both the tenth and seventeenth street bridge and I believe both are constructed of pressure treated lumber. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 &quot;My Adventures of Clifty Creek Around 1955&quot; 

 


Well, as I told in a previous Hawcreek adventure I roamed about the land all over Columbus as a young boy. Many times walking and sometimes riding my various bikes. This adventure was all walking from our home on 15th Street to the starting reference point of the Clifty Bridge on US 31.

First, I walked many miles from our home across the back fields that paralleled US 31 to the bridge hunting rabbits and sometimes a squirrel or two. Back in those days there was no development of businesses; from the present White Castle Hamburger building (17th&amp;US 31) to the joining of 10th Street. In fact 10th Street ended at US 31 at that time. The area today of an extended 10th Street consisted of more farm fields, and hunting areas for my adventures of course.

Many days I would go to the bridge with my single shot 22 rifle and just practice shooting at bottle caps, coins or fish in the water. Some days I would just take a fishing pole and fish most of the day. The water during those days seemed clean and not polluted so to speak.

On the hill going toward Clifty School on the creek banks a good friend lived in a house and I would stop by there and talk at times. During the colder fall days I took my 16 gauge shotgun for hunting along the creek banks for rabbits or squirrel, according to the season that was in. In those days it seemed the creek banks were clean of debris and trash and just nature&apos;s course was displayed. Now, today I don&apos;t know how it looks but hopefully it has maintained its natural beauty.

One special year around 1955 I was squirrel hunting, and I had walked approximately two or three miles past the Clifty School. I found this nice wooded area that had hickory trees and they were full of nuts. Well, I sat down under the biggest one and it was early in the morning and very chilly. As I sat under the tree I noticed a red fox about 200 feet away walking in my direction.

Well, I had my double barrel 16 gauge shotgun in my hands, so I didn&apos;t move. I thought surely this fox can see or smell me and will probably change directions and bypass me. As I stayed without motion with my gun safety off and finger on the trigger, it got very tense (at least on my part).

Now, that red thing (fox that is) never changed directions and my blood pressure probably went to stroke level, but I was young and the body took it well. He walked with his nose in the ground within 6 feet of me and never looked up at me. Now, I still didn&apos;t move but would have shot him with both barrels if he had attacked, but he didn&apos;t so he departed without buckshot and I departed when he disappeared.

I have tried to reason since that time why he ever walked that close to me and didn&apos;t acknowledge I was there. Oh, well he lived longer, and I saved two buckshot shells and maybe a medical bill for my parents.

Further, down that same road not far was my Aunt Jean and Uncle Al. They were such sweet old folks and I would stop and visit them at times during my real long walks down the Clifty Creek. The creek ran on the back side of Uncle Al&apos;s farm and further on down going toward Petersville area I guess.

Well, I hope I didn&apos;t bore you with my&quot;Red Fox&quot;story but it is a true adventure I had down near the old Clifty Creek areas. After, re-reading this story I might better check my blood pressure again.

Hi dear friends, I take in some of the latest postings when I can. I love the memories y&apos;all post. Many I can relate to so very much.
Some time ago, EC made a comment about remembering the old 2nd Street Bridge over White River. I wonder if some here remember the building of the 3rd Street Bridge? Following is a clip from my memories about the dedication of that bridge.

I remember the dedication of the Third Street Bridge. When, in 1950 or 51? There was quite a crowd on hand and the mayor or governor was there to cut the ribbon. They were on a platform of some kind in the middle of the bridge, maybe a truck bed. I was on the sidewall watching and the wind was just hard enough to keep the ribbon out of their reach. I reached it from where I was and pulled it over until they could get a hold of it. Somehow I was omitted from the chronicles about the bridge dedication. Oh well, so goes life.

hi bob
just read your fox story, and the memories came roarring back. We used to ride horses around Clifty a lot.

Then like a shot out of the blue, something else hit me. You were rather young then just as as Sharon, Nanc, James K and I plus several others used to ride all over the county almost and our parents never worried about us, remember? We could go anywhere we wanted (mostly) without fear. We could walk back and forth to the midnight show at the crump and the only time we were scared was when we had to go in front of the haunted house between California and Chestnut on third street. Great fun! You know we pretty much had the run of the whole town back then.

We never locked our doors and I don&apos;t even remember if the car doors had locks.

by the way, my husband&amp;I go down to the river sometimes now and get clams and just like the indians he makes buttons and conchs. I already make a bunch of Indian Jewelry but it just became authentic indian. Today I received my acceptance in to the Cherokee Tribe as I am a true half breed. Howabout that. Native American and German, What a combination!!!

Then came the accordion lessons that I took as probably a 6th grader, riding the bus to Washington School with the heavy accordion in tow, that is the name of that building, right? And later on, a very nice, patient lady who lived on Caldwell tried her hand at teaching me more piano. Perhaps in all these attempts, a little bit rubbed off, as I can play the organ, not well, but one would recognize the song.

 &quot;Customizing Cars In The 1950s Was A Trend and Fad In Columbus&quot; 

 1955 Chevy Bel Air Sample 

First, of all I didn&apos;t have a car when I lived at home in Columbus; because of the afford-ability wasn&apos;t there. But, many guys and friends had customized automobiles. Customizing was when they took the car and altered the body outside and inside to their individual needs or desires.

Some would make new rear tail fins and chop the tops and make a convertible. Most had louder tail pipes down the side and lots of chrome on the body. Some were just plain without much chrome.

One thing in Columbus was they all named their vehicles by hand painting a fancy name on both sides of the rear fender fin. Some had small pictures with the name.

The customized cars would cruise the streets at night and weekends showing their vehicles. Most of them were really beautifully done. Some hired professional painters to paint and trim their machines.

A great change in body design followed the 1950s because customizing was being felt by the Big Three Automobile giants in the nation.

Some harmless gangs and clubs in Columbus had the whole membership driving customized vehicles. Some wore ducktail hair sytles, with the shirt collars up like Elvis. Sometimes they were called the greasy&apos;s, but all were nice guys.

 COMMENT: Does anyone out there have old pictures of Columbus Customized Vehicles ? It would be nice to see some of the old ones from the fifties or later.

This is a &apos;Columbus car&apos; that in 1956 made its way to Southern California with its Columbus owner. I do believe that it might be the second car owned by this &apos;Knight of the Road.&apos; The paint job was awesome, Candy Apple Red, and great care was taken so that no dust marred the surface of this &apos;52 Ford. Think that a large part of the &apos;custom&apos; took place under the hood, as it &apos;could really move out.&apos; Might add that this photo was taken at my aunt and uncle&apos;s &apos;then home&apos; about a block from the &apos;now Crystal Cathedral.&apos;

 

My lips are sealed!!!!! I may well be snatched bald headed for this post. BUT, just had to do it.

I believe the car pictured by Nanc is a 1954 Ford, not a 1952. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Bob,
This might be telling some tales that shouldn&apos;t be told, but I remember a few times&quot;parking along a country lane, in a field and even on a road that ran North of the air base&quot;so these would be a few additional places that a&quot;guy would take his gal&quot;back in the good ole days! 

I can&apos;t be the only one who ever did something like this! If anyone will admit it, parking and necking was a pretty fabulous way to end a date! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Babs, you are right and I did that on numerous dates, at favorite locations as most may have done. I will add a few to the list including your location mentioned which I used also.

Okay, &apos;Knight&apos; in shining armor,&apos; not many arguments will this &apos;paperbag princess&apos; concede to, but since I can&apos;t find a photo on the internet to back me up, I bow to your judgement of dating &apos;the Ford,&apos; to be a &apos;54. So how much was the grill altered???? Did note that you didn&apos;t argue with the fact that it was fast!!!!! Sounded pretty awesome, too, as I recall!!!!!!!!!

 &quot;The Greasy Duck Tail or Duck Ass Haircut Of The 1950s&quot; 

Elvis Presley influenced a long grease packed, combed back down the sides haircut. This was not just in Columbus, it was nationwide. They were referred to as the&quot;Greasers, Greasy&apos;s and Reeb&apos;s&quot;in Columbus and throughout the nation.

They flipped the collars up on their shirts and jackets and let a cigarette loosely hang from the lips. They thought they were cool and bad, but not really. Many of them were wimps and had customized cars or some called them rods.

 Here is a picture sort of like one of them: 
 (actually the hair was longer that this picture) 

 Unknown Guy Here

The shirt was not alway unbuttoned this much. But the hair was greasy and combed back and packed with grease.

__________________________________________

 Here is a brief overview of the&quot;Greasy&apos;s&quot;and their Duck Ass hair styles:
 
The Ducktail was a haircut style popular during the 1950s. It was also called the Duck&apos;s Ass, Duck&apos;s Butt or simply D.A. (DA). The actual name was the Duck&apos;s Ass, but propriety called for the name Ducktail to be used in mixed company.

Other than the poodle skirt, no other symbol of the 1950s has captured the imagination and endured so well.

 The combing technique: 

The style required that the hair be combed back around the sides of the head. The end of a rattail comb was used to make a central part at the back of the head, resembling to many, the rear end of a duck. In addition, the hair on the top front of the head was deliberately disarrayed so that untidy strands hung down over the forehead.

The ducktail hair style contributed to the term&quot;greasers.&quot;To accomplish this look, lots of hair grease was required to hold the hair in place. This was still the era of hair creams, so it only required an increase in the amount to make hair remain in the desired style. This was before the era of hair sprays, and, of course, real men did not use sprays anyway.

To insure that the hair was just so, the male frequently touched up the DA many times during the day by running his greasy comb through it.

 Additional aspects of the Duck Tail style: 

The rear collar of the shirt (or jacket) was turned upward. Cigarettes (a mandatory accessory) were carried in a rolled up shirt sleeve, thus putting them on obvious display and baring the arm. Low boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets completed the wardrobe.


Bob (no I didn&apos;t do that)

 OH, NO, Bob!!!!! You may reach 500 posts in just a few, but............ you do NOT have &apos;permission&apos; to stop posting. A bunch of drumrolls are due, but only to encourage you to continue on.

Just in case, Bob, that you &apos;thought&apos; you had run out of ideas of things to post---------------go back to page one of the 1950s thread and read through ECs long list of &apos;mini-memories.&apos; There is enough &apos;food for thought&apos; within them to keep us all going for a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, for all of us , ECs lists are just priceless.

Was just emailing with a friend the other day about the value of this site. What lies within our own memories and personal &apos;archives&apos; is as valuable in the way of the history of Columbus, as big contributions by &apos;well known&apos; folks in town to other organizations. This site is such a &apos;grass roots&apos; effort to preserve Columbus history, and it continues to be of such value because each one of us takes the time to post.

To Bob, and everyone else, we are so lucky to have this site, put together by David Sechrest, to post our memories. We are &apos;touching the future.&apos; It must be preserved, and we all must continue. Am sure that &apos;we&apos; are the envy of many other towns and cities that do not have this kind of &apos;vehicle&apos; at our fingertips.

What we have to share is the writing of a Columbus history, a collection of memories that is priceless.

A drumroll for Bob, and a &apos;spirit song&apos; to rally him on to the next level.

To Bob&apos;s request for photos of customized cars, I add the following, protecting the &apos;innocent&apos; as best I can. 

Having a clean car was of prime importance and probably still is the case , and usually took a good part of the weekend to accomplish. 

 

It is my opinion that the grill of the 1954 Ford, standing corrected, of course, that I posted in another message must have been altered somewhat. In what way and with what, I surely can&apos;t say. Any input from the wise and knowing authority??? 

 

Enjoy. BTW, notice some nice dice on the rearview mirror, as well as the &apos;Knights of the Road&apos; plaque.

 &quot;The 1950s Girl&apos;s Dress&amp;The Appeal From Some Guys&quot; 

The girls liked pleated skirts showing the ankles, with Bobbie Socks and Oxford Shoes. As a result many of the guys became admirers of the girl&apos;s ankles. Cashmere and Lambs Wool Sweaters were vogue. My brother bought his girl friend a cashmere sweater for 18 dollars one Christmas.

That was not cheap in those day, and men&apos;s Pendleton shirts were nice but too itchy, sitting in the classroom.

Many shopped on the circle in Indianapolis at Christmas time and that was a treat or highlight. It was the big city with all the glitter and lights.

 &quot;1950s Trip To Indianapolis (Nap Town) Was A Special Deal&quot; 

I and my brother remember going to the Indianapolis Circle theater as a special treat. Then we had hamburgers at the Tee Pee Restaurant on the way out of town.


At the High School Basketball Bulldog&apos;s successes (during the state tournaments) we went to Morgan&apos;s Restaurant and the Tee Pee in Nap Town.

Now how many remember that statement ?

How many remember the Tee Pee or Morgans ?

 &quot;A Dark Cloud Hung Over Columbus In 1955&amp;1956&quot; 

A couple of the Columbus Greaser&apos;s were know as the members of the local&quot;Chain Gangs.&quot;The Chain Gangs wore the Ducktail haircuts, tight blue jeans, boots and had a looped chain hanging down from their belts. They thought they were cool and tough. They really didn&apos;t create that much trouble, but you didn&apos;t go looking for a fight with them.

This was all before drugs entered the City of Columbus. The Columbus Police Department kept them in check for the most part. The police department assigned officers to watch the Jive Kennel, the Olympia Dairy on Pearl Street and many of the teenage hangouts.

Other towns and cities around Indiana had similar Greaser&apos;s and Chain Gangs. There are several Evening Republican Newspaper articles about these former hoods in the 1956 papers.

 &quot;Guys Extra Nice Dress For Dates and Special Things 1954-1956&quot; 


Starched shirt collars, cuffs and even the button holes. Guys did wear pink starched long sleeved shirts with cuff links. Some wore the shirts under V neck sweaters long sleeve and some sweathers without sleeves.

They further topped it off with charcoal flannel or cords (pegged at bottom) pants. And to give the real&quot;in look&quot;they wore white or dirty buck shoes. And oh yes, some did turn up their starched collars in this attire.

I guess this might sound a little like the movie Saturday Night Fever . However, John Travolta dancing was better than anyone I have every witnessed. He sure learned it well for that movie.

 Note: Dressing sloppy and holes in clothing was never the&quot;in thing.&quot;These 1950 through 1960s had class and pride about dressing. They keep their shoes shined too and clothes up to pair.

This picture scan comes from something I found at the Library while doing some research on our Television history.

 

The caption reads as follows:

 Away We Go --A five room tile residence, one of the homes in the way of the new Hawcreek Boulevard project, gets a new location. The residence, owned by Mr. And Mrs. Walter Sanisteban, is now being settled in its new location, facing onto what will become Hawcreek boulevard. The house was moved on top of I-beams, railroad toes, and four 16 x 16 timbers, each 50 feet long. It made its journey without a crack in the exterior tile, travelling the 170 feet from its former location at the east end of 8th Street to north of 8th Street, where it is being relocated on a new full basement to face the west.

I forgot to jot down the year, but the date is July 31st. Since it was stuck in with other pages from 1954, I think that&apos;s the year. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by nancs on Nov 2, 2006, 6:47pm

David, here is a view of those homes that were moved, there at the east end of 8th Street, and just &apos;above&apos; the Saddle Club Grounds. I can&apos;t be 100% certain just which of the three it is. In looking, I think that it was the one to the most west, or next to the alley. I know that Libby Skaggs lived in one of those houses, and I &apos;thought&apos; the one nearest the alley. Think that Libby&apos;s mom&apos;s maiden name began with an S, but the name mentioned in what you posted doesn&apos;t look quite right, and I believe her grandparents owned the house. Altho&apos; when I &apos;sounded it out&apos; that is probably the name, and as a kid, I simply didn&apos;t know how to spell it. The house that remains now on that side of the street, along Hawcreek Blvd. was north of the alley that came out at 10th Street and ran east of Short Central. Sue Ann McClure lived in that house.

AND that is all probably about as &apos;clear as mud!&apos; Adding a thought, and oh, how I wish I could dash to the library and check-------I think Libby&apos;s grandparents lived on 10th Street back in the early 40s where Central deadends. east side of the alley. Janet Sewell might have lived in that house later on.

Interesting list of dentists in town---------am wondering why Doc Turner was NOT listed in the &apos;53 directory. In my &apos;51 and &apos;52 phone directories he was listed as being in the Bassett building, no address, just the building name. And was in that location, upstairs in that Washington Street building for many prior years.

AND I thought that he married his lady friend of long standing sometime prior to us moving in 1952. Additionally &apos;thought&apos; that they built a home up near the corner of Washington and 25th Street. Can&apos;t quite get this all straight in my head. Will do a little checking on my own, anyone else with input?

Dr. Charles A. Seal at 603 Jackson Street was our family dentist starting around 1950 or so. He operated out of an old white house on the corner of Jackson. Today that location has been landscaped with a park looking decor.

I can remember those horrible drill sounds and periodic nerve hits. The drills in those days were belt driven not like the high speed air drills of today. He was a very likable man and was always operating on time, which is uncommon today.

As its been some time since Ive included this disclaimer, Ill repeat it here. Gregg and I have determined that not all business locations are listed. I generate these lists by using the Classified Business Directory in the Columbus City Directories that I have access to. Gregg knew that a tavern named Harolds existed in the Columbus of his childhood.

I checked the street guide and Harolds is indeed listed in that guide.

It appears that the listing in this list was a paid list and not all Businesses of that type were listed!

Thanks Richard for the &apos;trucking listings.&apos; And to think I was just sure that seeing a list of those would answer my lingering thoughts.

I honestly thought that Art Givens had to do with some kind of trucking business. I can so picture the concrete block building out in East Columbus, exactly where I am not sure. Can also believe that Saddle Club held some functions in that building as well. Sort of remember playing hide and seek amongst the trucks inside the building.

The other trucking question------last name PING, think that the folks that had that outfit lived perhaps on Short Cherry, off to the right as you were going east up a little hill on Irwin Dr. there along Hawcreek.

AND maybe these are 1940s memories. Oh, my!!!!

Copied from Bob Lanes memories
Does anyone remember the building of the 3rd street bridge before the 2nd street bridge was demolished? I remember the dedication of the Third Street Bridge. When, in 1950 or 51? There was quite a crowd on hand and the mayor or governor was to cut the ribbon. I was on the sidewall watching and the wind was just hard enough to keep the ribbon out of their reach from the truck bed or platform they were standing on. I reached it from where I was and pulled it over until they could get a hold of it. Somehow I was omitted from the chronicles about the bridge dedication. Oh well, so goes life.

When I was in the army I was stationed in Chicago at the Meat and Dairy Hygiene School when the Chicago Auto Show was on in January 1954.

I saw all of the new 1954 auto&apos;s plus several cars of the future with these Dodge&apos;s and the Chrysler Thunderbolt and Buick had a sharp car there they called the Wildcat. These cars would be beautiful today. The year before Cadillac had brought out the new Eldorado and Buick the Skylark and Oldsmobile the Fiesta. Beautiful cars.

Seems like all of the future planning went out the window and people seemed to want the smaller cars like today with all of them looking alike.

Just thought you might like to see some of car designs we had 52 years ago.

 This information is from The Looking Back Column in todays Columbus newspaper from 1957. 

From Columbus Comment: the downtown retail district must continue to improve if Columbus is to hold its position as the leader in southeastern Indiana. There is a good chance that the city during 1957 will see the greatest expansion of its neighborhood shopping centers yet. The center on twenty-fifth Street with the new Kroger supermarket as the central unit is expected to boom. There is every reason to believe Columbus will continue to grow and it is up to the downtown area to keep pace. Attractive shops, up to the minute merchandise, good service and increased parking facilities are keys to the march of progress.

End of todays article.


This is the second time weve had confirmation that the twenty-fifth Street Shopping Center was opened in nineteen fifty-six. You will find more about this Shopping Center in the Shopping Plazas within The growth of Strip Malls in Columbus Board, and the 25th Street Shopping Center Categories.

Notice the above 1957 article includes much of what is being said today! The downtown retail district must continue to improve if Columbus is to hold its position as the leader in southeastern Indiana. There is every reason to believe Columbus will continue to grow and it is up to the downtown area to keep pace. Attractive shops, up to the minute merchandise, good service and increased parking facilities are keys to the march of progress. Attractive shops, up to the minute merchandise, good service and increased parking facilities are keys to the march of progress. I suspect that much of the same is being said about your city.

Note the comment about increased parking facilities in the 1957 article! Todays paper announced that Columbus is going to build an eight and one half million-dollar parking garage downtown. However, the bond request could be as much as nine and one half million! It will have 400 to 450 spaces on four levels and include six thousand square feet of retail space.

Notice the 1957 term Supermarket. Today they use Superstore! How many blocks do we walk to get into the box stores of today?

Good Service is in the 1957 article! Where do we get service today? The box stores today install 95 check out lanes, then have one or two open! Why do they use display space for check lanes thats never used? How much time did we spend waiting to check out this past shopping season?

If you can find someone to ask a question about a product, do you feel youve learned any new information?

 Real electronic revolution came home in trunk of car 

By Bud Herron - Publisher of The Republic.


WHEN Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs unveiled his new iPhone last week, a cry of&quot;revolutionary&quot;arose from techies coast to coast.

I suppose, in a culture with the attention span of a humming bird on crack, the new do-it-all phone seems&quot;revolutionary.&quot;(It is a word that we even used to announce the new Hardee Monster Burger, which I assume may revolutionize our need for coronary bypass surgery.)

While I am sure the iPhone is quite&quot;evolutionary&quot;and wonderful, it certainly is not revolutionary to anyone with a life perspective that stretches back further than 1990. Some of us have seen&quot;revolutionary,&quot;and it didn&apos;t come in colors to coordinate with our jogging suits.

One of the earliest revolutionary devices I can remember came down Seminary Street in Hope one sultry August day in 1950. It was in a brown box about the size of a casket and was sticking out of the trunk of my dad&apos;s aging Plymouth.


 Neighborhood event 

It was revolutionary enough that the whole neighborhood came out to see it, and little children ran cheering along side the car as it passed the sawmill and headed toward our driveway.

Inside the box was a 10-inch Arvin television, perched atop a mahogany cabinet. It was the second television in the history of mankind to arrive in the town of Hope. And there it was, in the living room of our little two-bedroom house at the corner of Seminary and Union.

Dad was a production worker on the&quot;television line&quot;at Arvin Industries and had been helping assemble the&quot;revolutionary&quot;devices since 1948 - more than a year before Indiana even had a television station.

We all knew Dad would have to have one, even though his hourly wage could not support such a purchase. He was a&quot;techno-junkie&quot;half a century before the word was coined.

The day the TV arrived was among the two or three most exciting moments of my life (just slightly behind my wedding night and the day I won a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in the philharmonic raffle).

 Anticipation 

Neighbors filled our living room, and those unable to find a place to stand pressed their noses to the screen door and windows. Dad, assisted by my Uncle Louie, began the installation process about 10 a.m.

About 7 p.m., Dad made the final trip down the ladder from the roof, where he had installed an antenna pointed toward Indianapolis. (In my memory, it was just slightly shorter than the Hope water tower.)

He attached the antenna wire to the back of the television and turned the power knob. The little screen hummed and slowly began to brighten. My sisters and I - sprawled out on the couch from the exhaustion of the just-completed nine-hour drama - sat straight up in anxious anticipation.

&quot;What kind of an exotic show will appear, all the way from distant, mysterious Indianapolis?&quot;we wondered.

In a few seconds, wavy lines were dancing back and forth as Dad twisted a row of knobs one way and then the other in a desperate attempt to create a picture. Suddenly we could see something, although we weren&apos;t sure what it was because the image was flipping rapidly, top to bottom.

Finally the flipping stopped and there on the tiny screen was a flapping American flag. A voice said,&quot;We are now ending our broadcast day. Ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem.&quot;

&quot;Everybody on your feet,&quot;Dad shouted.

The whole bone-weary family arose at his instruction. We stood with our hands over our hearts and sang as&quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;blared from the television.

You want revolutionary? That&apos;s revolutionary. Eat your heart out, Steve Jobs.

 &quot;We Remember Well The First Television Set In 1950&quot; 

After reading Bud Herron&apos;s article today, I emailed my brother and he responded and so I began to brainstorm my memories with his about our first television experience in Columbus. Here, is about what we both recall in 1950 after we moved into our new home on 15th Street:

The very first television was a black&amp;white Capehart Model. Our Dad bought it at a store just off of 6th Street and Washington. The test pattern when you turned it on was an Indian Chief pattern. We believe that one station was from Indianapolis and another from Bloomington Indiana.

We had some rabbit ears as an antenna, but had to erect a tall metal tubular type antenna on the roof. There were very few families with televisions in the early 1950s, but Dad was eager and Mom too to have a television. Cost in the 1950s was very high considering the value of money then. I think they were over $250 and up as reflected in the below commercial.

We would all gather in our living room on special nights and events to watch what was programmed. The family and sometimes many friends would gather to watch live wrestling with wrestlers named Gorgeous George, Little Beaver and many more. Of course you could tell even then that the wrestler&apos;s faked a lot of stuff, but became more practiced and realistic.

On Saturday nights we watched Ted Mack Amateur Hour which was derived from a radio show in the 1940s. Many future stars were cast on his one hour shows. Several years later the Ed Sullivan Show came on Saturday nights around 8:00 PM.

We would usually have popcorn (stove popped) and sodas for treats, sometimes cool aid. A few years later Mom started making homemade pizza for our snacks. We watched shows like Howdy Doody and Uncle Bob. Also Cecil The Seasick Sea Serpent and his Beanie Boy. Westerns like the Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy movies. There was also Flash Gordon in the early movies and Sky King on Saturdays. The Nelson Family was also popular and later son Ricky Nelson singing as the family grew older before us on the sets.

During the 1950s TV trays became vogue. Also, the TV dinners were popular. We, would stay glued all day long on weekends eating on trays and popping corn. It brought kids indoors to be with parents more during the special events. Around midnight the station would sign off with the national anthem and a test pattern would come on and then a loud fuzzy sound, and then it was over.

Television in those days were vacuum tubes instead of transistors and circuit boards. When a tube burned out it was over until you had a television service man come and repair it. Here is a sample 1950 Capehart Television advertisement:

 

 Closure : Now Bud Herron you were right on, when you said&quot;that was Revolutionary.&quot;

What year did the Columbus furniture company sale take place ? I read it sold out in the 1940s. What year did it close totally ?




Note: A Post Office that is only 35 years old is nothing compared to a 1910 Post Office that is really old. The 1910 Post Office is almost 100 years old and the 35 year old is absolutely young and not attractive. The Commons is out of date compared to the nice old history of the real Columbus of the past. I was born and raised in Columbus and if I still lived there things would be reported and told different than I have read on this board in some respects.

Post by rickyberkey2 on Jan 15, 2007, 11:33pm

Well, I personally think the 1970 Post Office building and The Commons are both attractive and significant as architecture. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s&quot;better&quot;than any older buildings but I think it&apos;s historically representative of the 1970&apos;s downtown development that was going on all over the country. Towns and cities everywhere were trying bold ideas to keep their downtown retail from fleeing to the shopping center and malls. It hurts me though to see all the pictures of what was torn down to make way for these modern structures.

It distresses me that there is little organized opposition when historical buildings are being torn down. There was barely a whimper of protest over the decision to tear down Central School. It will soon be gone. That old 1910 building by the second street bridge will soon be gone. Even though many dismiss it as an eyesore...I&apos;ve always kind of admired it as I drove into downtown.

 &quot;Just My Opinion Of The Present&quot; 

As a many years distanced former resident of Columbus and born and raised there, I have a different perspective of my home of the past. Many old buildings were torn down to build a Commons Mall building that isn&apos;t that attractive, and has no history connected to it. Progress at times is a regression of time . Conversely, Charleston South Carolina is a prime example of good preservation of history and buildings.

A few years ago I wrote an article in the Columbus Republic Paper about the old Central High School and why the city should not destroy it, but who am I ? The history slowly gets destroyed because of supposed progress, but if you and anyone were born , raised and attended the school, the thoughts are different.

Oh, I know most of the folks that went to the Old Central High School are either gone now or so old they don&apos;t remember much. My grandmother, two uncles and many friends taught at that school and my older brother and I went there; so the memories are different than many of today.

The Commons Mall is nice but not truly a Columbus Historical Site to many and not that attractive. Sure, famous people put it together, but look at the historical buildings that were torn down to put a mostly glass walled building in. I have never been impressed by the building nor the contents. I would have much rather preserved what they destroyed than what was created.

I appreciate that many never looked at what was torn up and was not aware of the history. Most younger folks look at the now, and guess of the past, when history is changed somewhat.

 Anyway, I like true history not a concoction of maybe it was this way or that, but factual.

 Comment: This was the cardboard top that was fitted into the top of the glass milk bottle. As you can see Compton served Columbus, Franklin, Shelbyville and Edinburg Indiana.

 

Notice the 3 digit phone number. This may be before 1950s. I think it may be 1940s with 3 digits. Many phone numbers in the 1950s were 4 digits.

 Barn dance
By: SHERRI CONER
Daily Journal staff writer
Article :

March 6-7, 2004


It had such a plain name: Whiteland Barn . Not surprising for a dance hall surrounded by cornfields on a country road. And yet, 40 years later, mention of Whiteland Barn stirs sweet memories for early rock n roll lovers.

Every Sunday evening, bobby-socks-wearing girls like Mary Ann Powell of Whiteland dressed in sweaters, full skirts and oxfords to enjoy an evening of dance music at the barn. Some girls rode to this Whiteland legacy with their boyfriends in souped-up GTOs,
Mustangs, Impalas and even a few Corvettes. Powell drove a two-tone green 1954 Ford.&quot;There were a bunch of us that just loved to dance,&quot;Powell says.&quot;A favorite dance at the time, she says, was The Stroll.&quot;

Big names performed on the elevated stage upstairs in the barn beside a 90-by-60-foot hardwood dance floor.&quot;When Jerry Lee Lewis appeared there in 1961&quot;, Powell was in the audience.&quot;He really didn&apos;t sit and play the piano, Powell says of Lewis.&quot;He jumped and moved around and kinda climbed all over the piano.&quot;Mike McCart of Greenwood was also in the audience that evening when Lewis pounded&quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;on the ivories.
&quot;He&apos;d take his right leg and stomp on the piano keys while he was playing it at the same time,&quot;McCart said.&quot;Nobody else could excite the crowd like he did.&quot;

On another occasion, McCart drove his red 1966 Ford Fairlane 500 to Whiteland to see Fats Domino croon his famous&quot;Blueberry Hill.&quot;Linda Wirey of Franklin&quot;begged and begged and begged to get to go&quot;when The Kingsmen
appeared at the barn in 1968, Wirey&apos;s senior year of high school.
Wirey and her friend Karen Threlkeld won their parents over so they could dance to a live version of&quot;Louie, Louie.&quot;Neil Sedaka, Dionne Warwick, Bo Diddley, The Drifters and even a young, pre-fame Johnny Cougar later known as John Mellencamp performed in this barn in the middle of nowhere.

Don Hohlt, 69, of Indianapolis was the man behind the music and dance mania.&quot;The first night we opened, in 1958, we charged 75 cents. We had 72 boys and three girls,&quot;Hohlt says with a laugh.&quot;I&apos;ll never forget it if I live to be 100.&quot;

This two-story, flat-roof barn on the Hohlt family farm did not start out as a hot spot for rock &apos;n&apos; roll, Hohlt says. For a few years before World War II, Hohlt&apos;s father hosted square dances in the barn. Whiskey bootleggers hung around outside the entrance.&quot;But when the war broke out, gas was rationed,&quot;Hohlt says. And that was the end of square dances.&quot;

A few years later, Hohlt&apos;s father tried another business venture. This time, he turned the barn into a bingo hall.&quot;They&apos;d have 900 to 1,000 ladies in there playing bingo,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;Then they were raided one night. And that was the end of bingo.&quot;When Hohlt returned from serving in Korea in 1957, his father&apos;s health was failing. Family finances were dwindling. In desperation, Hohlt and his mother unsuccessfully reopened the barn for square dances.

&quot;Here&apos;s where the luck came in,&quot;Holt says.&quot;Somebody suggested teen dances.&quot;So Hohlt contacted a top DJ for the era, Bouncin&apos; Bob Baker at WIBC. Hohlt paid Baker $50 to spin 45s&quot;single-song records&quot;at the barn. Hohlt also invited area bands to perform. Keith Phillips, then a resident of Edinburgh, and his band Keetie and the Kats became frequent performers at the barn. Every week, Phillips drove his fire-engine-red, five-window custom 1931 Ford coupe to Whiteland. Band members initially wore white and black corduroy shirts, hand-stitched by Phillips mother, Gladys Phillips, now 92, who still resides in Edinburgh.&quot;Back then, instrumentals were a big deal,&quot;says Phillips, who today resides in Washington state.&quot;A hit didn&apos;t have to have words to be a hit.&quot;One popular request of the time was an instrumental called&quot;Apache.&quot;&quot;It was a must-play every Sunday,&quot;Phillips says.&quot;First thing you know, we were having great big crowds,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;Cars would pull up with eight or 10 kids in them.&quot;Then came the call from Jerry Lee Lewis&apos; agent in Tennessee.&quot;That&apos;s when Jerry Lee married his cousin and nobody would hire him,&quot;Hohlt says. Taking a risk that Lewis&apos; agent was correct, that Lewis was on his way back to the top of the music business, Hohlt agreed to pay Lewis $650 to perform. Then Hohlt rented a piano for Lewis to play.&quot;He practically demolished that piano,&quot;Hohlt says with a laugh.&quot;And the kids went crazy.&quot;

Rita Marcum, 56, of Mooresville, was a frequent patron at Whiteland Barn. Her boyfriend was a drummer and singer in a local band called The Impalas. She was known to wear a two-piece, white, fringed mini-dress with matching go-go boots, says this grandmother of two. She danced in a black cage with orange and lime green spray paint on the bars.&quot;With the black lights, it kinda accented the white fringe,&quot;Marcum says with a laugh. The mood in the barn was electric, Phillips says.&quot;I&apos;m telling you, the barn was major. There were 1,300 people coming around on a Sunday night. It became a thing. It was&quot;Be there or be square.&quot;It was incredible.&quot;

A photographer roamed through the crowd, aiming his camera at young people as they socialized near the downstairs concession stand or danced near the band. Hohlt displayed the photos inside a glass case.&quot;If your picture was there, you got a free pass for the next week. And you got the picture,&quot;he says.&quot;Before the night was over, all the pictures would be gone.&quot;

Alcohol was not allowed on the premises. Off-duty law enforcement officers and a few Whiteland firefighters provided security. With more than 1,000 teen-agers crowded inside one structure, people might envision hassles.&quot;But there were very few fights,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;They&apos;d be over before they got started
good.&quot;He recalls only three fights in the years he and his band played at the barn, Phillips says.&quot;And one of them was me,&quot;he says.

In 1965, Whiteland Barn was suddenly running out of steam. Phillips had moved on by then. His Keetie and the Kats band traveled the Midwest. Living first in New York and then California, Phillips entertained in nightclubs around the country.
Puzzled, Hohlt saw Sunday evening be-bopping dwindle every week.&quot;It just seemed like it happened overnight,&quot;Hohlt says. Phillips told Hohlt about a British rock &apos;n&apos; roll band, new to the music scene in the United States but sure to change the face of entertainment.&quot;I had never heard of the Beatles before,&quot;Hohlt says.&quot;But Keith said,&quot;They&apos;re gonna be huge, Don. There won&apos;t be any more dancing.&quot;And he was absolutely right. Concerts took over.&quot;Six months later, Hohlt stopped mopping the dance floor in the barn. There was no need to pop corn or buy soft drinks anymore.&quot;The Beatles shut down the old teen-age dancing business,&quot;he says.

Two years after that, Hohlt&apos;s family home next door to the barn caught fire. Hohlt&apos;s collection of memories. years of photographs, autographed by every musical group ever to perform at the barn were destroyed.&quot;It was a wild run,&quot;&apos; Hohlt says of the land where Whiteland Raceway Park now operates.&quot;I never will forget it, as long as I live,&quot;Holt says.&quot;It was a stroke of luck. And it was fun&quot;

In looking through the 1951 phone directory found this interesting tidbit, rather &apos;buried&apos; within the Yellow Pages. (Will scan this another time!)

 Be Considerate of Your Party-Line
Neighbor----
The Golden Rule is the best rule on
party lines. Keep your conversations
brief so that the other fellow will have
a chance. 

AND another:

If you share a party line, you are making it possible for others to have service.......So, share the line with your Telephone Neighbors.

And one more:

Be considerate of your party line neighbors-----don&apos;t talk longer than necessary----leave intervals between calls----release the line immediately in case of an emergency.

Didn&apos;t most of us have a party line? Know my family did!!! And to further shorten &apos;conversations&apos; when my folks/my dad had their home built, the phone was placed in a nook in the hallway so there was no place to sit and chit chat with a friend!!!! HOWEVER, as I headed toward teenage years, I discovered that the phone cord would &apos;just reach&apos; if I&apos;d slide down the wall, and sit on the floor!&apos;

 _____________ ________________ 

 We Didn&apos;t Get A Phone Until After 1950 That I Remember 

I do remember initially that phone party lines were common, but we didn&apos;t have a party line long. It wasn&apos;t a good system because others could listen to your conversations. We finally had a black wall phone in the kitchen over the clothes drier around 1952 or a little before, not sure on this one.

Interesting was my Uncle Mark that lived on a farm near the Franklin Airport in the early 1950s. He had the old antique crank type with mega phone and would wind it up and the operator would come on and ask Mark where he wanted to call and the lady would plug him in for the call. I was amazed that it still worked and he gave me the phone and I tried it, and yes she came on and I was convinced it worked. In the 1940s and 1950 the operators sat at a switch board with a zillion wires to plug in calls. Hello, can you hear me know ? Maybe, that is where the phrase for commercials really developed. Funny, and interesting to think about the progression of the old phone system.

Clothes drier----Gosh, when I lived in Columbus we had a &apos;solar clothes dryer.&apos; First, a rather long section of our side yard was &apos;equipped with&apos; about 6 wire lines attached to T posts at each end. AND that is where we had to hang the clothes to dry, OUTSIDE. Before the task of hanging out the freshly laundered clothes, done in the basement on a wringer type washer, you had to take a damp cloth to &apos;wipe&apos; down the lines of any dirt that accumulated since the previous &apos;wash day Monday.&apos; Often the lines would sag with the weight of the wet items and you had to use a pole, or several poles to hold the lines up. Most often my mom used &apos;regular&apos; clothes pins, ones without the &apos;spring.&apos; At some point later on, she did have some &apos;spring clothes pins.&apos; Clothes pins were &apos;stored&apos; in a cloth bag that would hang on the lines and could be moved down the line as you hung the clothes.

During periods of inclement weather, our basement was equipped with clothes lines and it took quite a period of time to get the clothes dry, and those drying clothes did generate a rather unique, not so fresh, a smell.

It was a really big day in our household when my mom got a more compact &apos;umbrella style&apos; clothes line. It took up much less yard space, and you could pretty much stand in one place to hang out the laundry, as this &apos;umbrella&apos; would swivel around.

Monday was &apos;wash day,&apos; and Tuesday was &apos;ironing day.&apos; Before the days of steam irons and aerosol type sprays, you dampened the items to be ironed, and yes, using a soda pop bottle with a &apos;salt shaker top to sprinkle the items.&apos; My mom would carefully dampen the items and roll them up, thus distributing the &apos;dampness&apos; throughout the item.

Might add here, it was at least 1964 before I, personally, ever had an automatic clothes dryer. However, even with the convenience and &apos;Bounce&apos; we can&apos;t begin to match the aroma of clothes dried out in the sunshine.

 Reference 5th Street&amp;Washington Photos Again 

Wow, I like the other half of the photo and guess what was playing at the Rio Theater on the raining afternoon at 3:40 PM per the jewelry store clock ? I enlarged the photo again and a movie starring Marilyn Monroe was being shown. Now I could only read the top line of the Rio sign and couldn&apos;t figure out what the other lines said. Anyway, I researched and this picture is 1956, so the Rio could have been showing her 1955 or 1956 films. In 1955 she had movies called Golden Dream and The Seven Year Itch. In 1956 she had the movie Bus Stop. 

Also, in the expanded picture Nanc posted the triangle building housing the jewelry store and popcorn shop. These probably were the only businesses in the building. I don&apos;t believe there were any businesses on the back side of the triangle building.

The vehicles on the street included newer 1955 or1956 olds, 1955 Fords, 1953 Chevy and a 1940s something parked next to the telephone pole by the jewelry store. A Nash may be behind the old 1940s vehicle.

Great picture !

The movie being shown at the Rio: Seven Year Itch , &apos;also Cartoon.&apos;

Note the barber pole under the S in &apos;Anderson&apos;s.&apos; AND in/on the building just west/left of Anderson&apos;s is what I think is----a sign indicating that there is a public telephone there.

To the east/right of the Rio is the Irwin building. Think that is what it is called.

Thanks truly goes to Richard for providing this picture.

He really knew how to build hand finished wood working as a an art that is lost today on the prefab fast built with no detail world we are in now. He helped my dad restore the house my grand prents moved into in the 60s. His daughters still live in the Columbus area. Also I remeber so well walking to the Cummins Bookstore in the early 70s to buy a sporting news to keep up with the NFL and the Reds. The smell of the store and the creeky floors had charm that is unforgettable and provides great memories lost on kids today growing up in the WalMart era. My mom worked at Shoppers Fair and had so many funny storeis from there because of the crazy place it was. Midnight madness sales and burger chef next door. Going to Rexhall Drugs in Columbus Center for Topps baseball cards in wax packs, cello packs and rack packs. Going to Danners 5&amp;Dime for Hot Wheels cars with my grand mother and eating lunch there at the Trolley Stop. I still have an electril I bought at Danners when I was 8 and it still works great. It cost me $9 back in the 60s and it has out lasted several drills I have bought since. I really miss Columbus. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 Columbus Consolidation Of Grade Schools (elementary) In The 1950s&amp;The Effects On Sports At The Next Level (CHS) 

First of all Richard&apos;s summary was interesting and answered some of my thoughts somewhat about the grade school system and consolidation.

I remember Columbus High School (CHS) coaches such as Bill Stearman and Max Andress (later Mayor of Columbus) talking about the effect that the mid-1950s school consolidations would impact the&quot;feeder system&quot;of athletics. I was a young guy in grade school coached in baseball, basketball and track under Clifty Coach Robert Rouse (principal). He too expressed concern that CHS sports years out could see a slump in experience, and talented kids at the next level.

The many grade schools had all these sports except football. I recall county track meets for grades 7 and 8 as well as basketball tournaments. The feeder system was shorter with less players trying their skills at various events. Junior High wasn&apos;t sufficient to continue the pool of large number of talented kids. Intramural sports helped somewhat but that was also limited.

There were great CHS teams downstream but Coach Stearman was somewhat concerned about the impact. Of course he put education ahead of sports as good leaders do. I am only saying this because historically there was some immeasurable effect.

Then many years later two high schools were in Columbus. Columbus North and Columbus East High schools had another impact on all sports at all levels. However, it was necessary to house all the students to maintain a quality education. The feeder system was diluted in half, so to speak. However, there have been many successful football, track, swimming and basketball teams since that split or addition.

In summary, consolidation of schools probably insured the proper numbers of students per teacher which was a plus; thus insuring a quality education. The creation of two high schools had a very large impact on sports competition state wide and diluted the talents into two houses. The sports feeder system was somewhat strained and less numbers of kids played sports.

 Columbus Consolidation Of Grade Schools (elementary) In The 1950s&amp;The Effects On Sports At The Next Level (CHS) 
 


My brother talked to me about the early 1950s in relation to the above. He states that he doesn&apos;t remember any 5th and 6th grade teams. Further, he said only the Boys Club had teams and the Twenty-fifth Street School had one team consisting of all kids of many grades.

Many of the Columbus factory worker&apos;s families commuted from other Southern Indiana towns or townships. There were many farm folks that commuted and some didn&apos;t move because of the lack of low cost Columbus housing in those days, possibly. Hence, they may have lost many potential excellent players.

Additionally, he expressed that maybe many kids preferred to work and buy cars instead of playing sports. He thinks Coach Stearman still tapped the boys that had talent and never lived in Columbus. He couldn&apos;t recall any guys that had exceptional talent that didn&apos;t play (feeder system or not).

He thinks the coaches and the town did the best they could with the smaller population and talent. He stated you need the&quot;big horses&quot;year in and out to be competitive on a statewide basis. That is the bottom line he said.

Finally, he spoke of the talented kids playing today. He said more talented guys are playing today because of the two high schools in Columbus, and of course the town population has more than doubled.

 Trimmel Tire Shop 
 Located on 10th Street before you cross Hawcreek 

The Trimmel tire shop was on the backside of the city golf course within 200 yards or so from the 10th Street Hawcreek Bridge. It was a small little building that Mr. Trimmel had and he sold recapped tires and did tire patching. The place was sort of a messy area, but what do you expect it was a tire repair place.

The 1953 directory lists it as Harold Trimmel (gas station) 2324 10th Street.

Mr. Trimmel was a very nice man and my Dad used his shop for recaps (normal in those days) and tire repairs. My brother and I also used Trimmel&apos;s after we started driving vehicles.

My recollections are that the Pennington Music Company supplied/leased Juke Boxes to many locations in Columbus at this time. The 1903 address was the first house north of nineteenth street on the east side of the street. The store sat on the back of the lot in a garage sized building.

In the name listing section in this directory, it lists Bernard Pennington as President of (Music Co.). His wife Alberta was a clerk at Sears. Bernard and Alberta are listing as living at 3436 Central Avenue. It lists Russell G. and Wife Ruth as living at 1903 Central Avenue and employed at Pennington Music Company. Mrs. Marjorie Pennington is listed as a clerk at Pennington Music Company and living at 1815 Chestnut Street.

Bob said he purchased Book of Love from that location. Ive purchased a few records there in my time! I think everything they had was used as they would keep the Juke Boxes in town filled with the newest, latest hits and place the older hits on sale at quite a nice discount!

 8th Street Ball Park 1950s 
 Located on 8th Street from Flatrock River going East to Brown Street. Also, called US 31A. 

This ball park was parallel to the river and next to the ball park was the practice and game football field for the Columbus High School (CHS) teams. During extreme rains and flooding the fields would get overrun by the river flows.

As a very young guy, my family attended many softball and baseball games at the 8th Street Park. The Columbus Merchants or other teams would schedule games there during the spring and summer. They had bleachers behind home plate that had many rows upward. A stand was available for pop and various other candies and popcorn.

Many times the balls were hit over the side fences, fouled into the 8th Street road and near the river. During games many kids would retrieve fouled balls over the fences and return them to the umpires and support team staffs. Players normally had uniforms of some type, but I can&apos;t remember the team names.

Large crowds normally filled the bleachers supporting the team of choice. Night lights were installed to allow the late evening games. Most of the players were of course local workers of various backgrounds. High team spirits were always prevalent and cheers were the norm.

Near, by the field were two oil companies and a small refinery. As you departed the field and headed East on 8th Street you would drive over the railroad tracks between Brown Street and Jackson. If you drove west of the ball park a few miles you would end up at the Columbus Drive Inn outdoor Theater.

Many, Columbus folks played at the ball park well before Lincoln Park was built. Additionally, many former CHS players played and practiced on the old 8th Street football field. I remember the fields were still being used in 1957 for Central Junior High School.

The fields near old Flatrock River provided the City many years and hours of entertainment for sports minded people in the earlier days of Columbus.

 The Jive Kennel was located at corner of 3rd and Franklin Street. The building still stands today. Behind the Jive Kennel was the old first Lincoln School cornered on 2nd and Franklin Street. The Jive Kennel is believed to have closed, sometime during the 1960s.

That address you mentioned at 727 Washington was not the site of a Standard Food Store but it was a redemption center for S&amp;H;Green stamps....where you would take your sack of filled up books and get that new toaster! It was there in 1961 and probably a few years around that time frame. Its that building past the old post office where Brad&apos;s Furniture is today.

 For some of you yung-uns out there, that old toaster that&apos;s been sitting on your grandma&apos;s counter way before you were even a twinkle in your mom and pop&apos;s eyes just might have been&quot;bought&quot;with these:

 

Green stamps were very popular in the 1950&apos;s (and 1960&apos;s too). The stamps pictured above were part of a promotion from the old Standard Grocery stores across the country. As noted on the back, the Standard Grocery in Columbus was at 727 Washington Street. I don&apos;t remember Standard being at this address. In my day, Standard was a couple of blocks further north on Washington (where the Hostess outlet place used to be). I guess when Standard moved, A&amp;P;must&apos;ve taken over this 727 Washington Street address?

ou can still get a catalog by calling 800-435-5674.

First, name rings a heavy bell, and of course second name is another joint business adventure that families established throughout Columbus. Here are some more of the Eddy businesses during the 1950s and 1960s:

 Eddy Oil Company located near White River deep downtown

 Eddy Gasoline Stations located off State Street, Central, Garden City, Edinburgh, Hope and North Vernon.

 Dixie Cream Donut&amp;Coffee Shop (Eddy&apos;s) located on State Street

 Eddy Appliance Store 1731 State Street

 Bray&amp;Eddy Supply (electrical appliances) Located at 1867 State Street

 Eddy TV&amp;Appliance Store located around 605 Washington Street in the 1950s.

 The Bray&apos;s and Eddy families contributed much to Columbus businesses for many years. They provided many services, and products. Additionally, many family members provided the excitement in sports through local baseball leagues and organized high school sports. Lastly, both names are great families of faith, principle and just down to earth great people!

This &apos;quote&apos; comes from the 1950s thread, page 1, and back when I was just a &apos;guest.&apos; And over two years ago!!!!!!

 Quoting from that post:
1950s--Pioneer Days. As I recall, and feel free to correct my&quot;dating&quot;of the event, took place on or near Columbus Day, mid-October. Washington Street was closed and booths set up by civic organizations. Seems the event went on for several days, perhaps a weekend, just guessing on that one.

My dad was responsible for the&quot;game&quot;for one booth, either sponsored by the Lion&apos;s Club or the Saddle Club , and I don&apos;t remember which. AND am sure that the SPCA would never approve the&quot;game&quot;now, and the protests would have been many. Remember how you could throw ping-pong balls into bowls and win a gold fish? Same idea, except you threw an embrodiery (sp.) hoop to attempt to&quot;ring&quot;a duck, a duck that you could take home for keeps!!!! (Hey, Bob, Barkhimer, that is, is that how you got Rudolph? ;-) This crazy&quot;game&quot;became the hit on the street, and everyone was carrying around a duck they had won. So popular was this booth, that soon they ran out of ducks. My dad was out and about searching the farms for more ducks for the booth. A trek he made numerous times to restock! Think he must have hit every farm around to supply the booth. 

Buried deep within the boxes of treasure my mom has saved, I found this photo.

 

In identifying, can&apos;t do much------lady in light coat with one big button, may be Rose McKain. On the right by the D in the sign, a man with a cowboy hat, may well be Ralph Talkington, and the lady just to his right, I think, his wife, Edna.

Note the sign for Pony Rides. And the lady on the right with goldfish and bowl in hand.

The lady in the front, left side, looks like Miss Mildred Murray to me. Much younger than any pictures I have in my year books, but this sure looks like her to me. She taught English at CHS, was in charge of the Senior play and sponsor of one of the girls&apos; clubs. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 Comments Made In The Year 1955 
 These have to be comical and interesting to read 

 
1955 Cadillac

 
 &quot;I&apos;ll tell you one thing, if things keep going the way they are, it&apos;s going to be impossible to buy a week&apos;s groceries for $20.&quot;


&quot;Have you seen the new cars coming out next year? It won&apos;t be long before $2000 will only buy a used one.&quot;


&quot;If cigarettes keep going up in price, I&apos;m going to quit. A quarter a pack is ridiculous.&quot;


&quot;Did you hear the post office is thinking about charging a dime just to mail a letter?&quot;


&quot;If they raise the minimum wage to $1, nobody will be able to hire outside help at the store.&quot;


&quot;When I first started driving, who would have thought gas would someday cost 29 cents a gallon. Guess we&apos;d be better off leaving the car in the garage.&quot;


&quot;Kids today are impossible. Those duck tail hair cuts make it impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be wearing their hair as long as the girls.&quot;



&quot;I&apos;m afraid to send my kids to the movies any more. Ever since they let Clark Gable get by with saying &apos;damn&apos; in &apos;Gone With The Wind,&apos; it seems every new movie has either&quot;hell&quot;or&quot;damn&quot;in it.


&quot;I read the other day where some scientist thinks it&apos;s possible to put a man on the moon by the end of the century. They even have some fellows they call astronauts preparing for it down in Texas&quot;


&quot;Did you see where some baseball player just signed a contract for $75,000 a year just to play ball? It wouldn&apos;t surprise me if someday they&apos;ll be making more than the president.&quot;


&quot;I never thought I&apos;d see the day all our kitchen appliances would be electric. They are even making electric typewriters now.&quot;



&quot;It&apos;s too bad things are so tough nowadays. I see where a few married women are having to work to make ends meet.&quot;


&quot;It won&apos;t be long before young couples are going to have to hire someone to watch their kids so they can both work.&quot;


&quot;Marriage doesn&apos;t mean a thing any more; those Hollywood stars seem to be getting divorced at the drop of a hat.&quot;


&quot;I&apos;m just afraid the Volkswagen car is going to open the door to a whole lot of foreign business.&quot;



&quot;Thank goodness I won&apos;t live to see the day when the Government takes half our income in taxes. I sometimes wonder if we are electing the best people to congress.&quot;


&quot;The drive-in restaurant is convenient in nice weather, but I seriously doubt they will ever catch on.&quot;


&quot;There is no sense going to Lincoln or Omaha anymore for a weekend. It costs nearly $15 a night to stay in a hotel.&quot;


&quot;No one can afford to be sick any more; $35 a day in the hospital is too rich for my blood.&quot;


&quot;If they think I&apos;ll pay 50 cents for a hair cut, forget it.&quot;

Hello to all!. First let me tell you a bit about myself, so you will know my stay was a short one. My name is John (jack) Knox. My dad was in the air force, and I guess stationed at Camp Attaberry. We lived in Columbus for 4 years, this was about 1953 to 1958, but it was filled with memories that might be more befitting for 100 years! We lived in 3 different places while there. The 1st place, well it was a white house (now how many white houses can there be in Columbus?) 2 story, where all 3 of us kids slept upstairs. The garage was detached and a bit behind the house. Mom had a little strip garden along the house where we might sometimes pull up goodies to munch on. Cannot recall where it was located, except our street kind of jogged to the left and went on. At the jog to the left of the street I think my mom had a friend she call sis Brumfield (?) who later moved to a new subdivision. My mom was a nurse and worked at the Hospital where my brother was born. We moved from there to 16th and Union north/east corner, brick house with a big porch. This was the center of the universe as far as I was concerned. We had our milk delivered in a little metal box on the steps, which also would hold my school books, if I saw something that just had to be checked out, before going in. I guess I should say here how old I was, I went to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade at Saint Bartholomew school. My best friend in the world, which at that time was 3 square blocks, was Jackie Penser (?) who lived across the street on union. We would, and did, go just about any place. I remember one time Jackie told me he had saw some big boxes at this store, and that we needed to get them! The store was maybe a couple of blocks to the west of us, maybe an appliance store, so we dragged them home, and made a fort!

Jackie went to the school down the street from us. I think it was on 17th. Now I have read a lot of boards here. Took me about a week, but from reading gazillion posts, I think it was McKinley. I came back in 2002, when I retired, and found the school was apartments or condos. You know leave a place for 40 years and come back, and darn if it hasnt changed! I was looking for a place to finish off my life in, but land just cost too much, so settled in Arkansas.

Most things were still there though, the house I lived in, well all the houses were still there, but different people living in them. I remember the Haunted house on 16th and Home. I think it took up the whole block. I say haunted, because at the time it had a fence with weeds, trees, bushes, mingled in with it. That and my big brother TOLD me it was haunted. I never, never walked on that side of the street!

I remember my 1st set of roller skates, still had the key till this last move, and the side walk. The side walk around my block was, well lets say not the best for roller skating, fun to skate, had 3 built in jumping ramps. I sit here trying to think of just how many times I donated skin and blood to that sidewalk, before I could jump those uplifts in the concrete. I also got my 1st bike thereit liked the rose bushes!! No matter what I did, it always ran right into them! Well I guess it got tired of doing that, and one day decided to stop, and then I was ready to try seeing the rest of the world. I had already seen every branch, and thorn of them rose bushes!

Donners park had a summer program, one time (one of many!) where they had a watermelon eating contest and such. I did not win that, but I did win the best-decorated bike. My brother and sister helped me decorate it, and it won! I got to lead a procession of kids on bikes all over the place. I learned how to swim there. I learned that the merry go round ring (I have read of others who remember this one) was fun, just as long as you could hang on. One time I go to going real fast, and flew off. Once was enough of that! I attended many a show there, one I remember was a magician. He wanted me to stick my hand in his little guillotine yeah right! I must have made 2 dozen potholders.

The house we lived in on union was kind of small, but I guess that was what my father could afford. It got even smaller when my little brother came along! I remember watching TV, Mickey Mouse, Spin and Marty, and on Friday nights.. the Friday night fights, dad liked them. There was a furnace in the basement and every once in a while the door to it would fall, or blow off, and dad would have to go down and put it back on. I remember when dad planted shrubs, or something along the wall of the porch, and put fresh fertilizer on them, oh the smell!! I remember the neighbor on the corner right across from us was a bounty hunter, or so I was told. He would take me out in the country and let me ride his horses. I remember one summer I wanted to have some money, so I grabbed the lawn mower and went door to door. Well I got one customer. A nice little old lady, with a yard where the grass was 3 foot high. Well I got $1 for about 4 hours work, not to bad for a 3rd grader. I went home and crossed the street to the drug store, and got 2 milk shakes. Still had 50 cents left, gave that to my dad. I remember the barbershop just down 16th; use to get a stick of gum if I sat still for him.

My older brother use to take me fishing at haws creek. For years I use to call it Hawk creek, till one day my brother said, hawk creek, where was that? Oh well, it was fun no matter what you called it. I never remember catching fish there, just crawdads. Now I do not know if it was just my young mind, or the creek sure has changed, but it sure is a lot different now.

I remember buying records from a man who lived, ok now remember this is from the memory of a 3rd grader, on 17th or 18th, home to maple??? I think he sold them out of his garage? I bought Honeycomb, and others there. I remember going to one movie, my sister had to baby-sit me, so she had to take me along. What a date that was for her, guess I owe her one. I remember the basement, I think of the courthouse, had like a museum in it? It was kind of a strange place to me.

Now for some of the high points. I remember the first girl I kissed, Cecilia Page. It was winter, and we had built a snowman in her back yard. Well we got behind the snowman and it happened. No bells rang, no fireworks, but I liked it just the same. I use to roller-skate with her in her basement. I remember sitting down and talking to her dad one time, not sure at all what we talked about, but it seemed like hour. It could have been he wanted to know a bit about this boy who was spending some time with his daughter. I guess I was ok, cause he let me come back again. The 1st house we lived in had an out-house. We did not use it as we had indoor plumbing, but could not understand who would have use something like that. Later in life, in Vietnam, I would have used it; it would have been down right nice! I remember one time I was coming home from school on my bike, I was late and using all the shortcuts I knew. I came flying out of an alley, and ran right into a car! I managed to somehow pull one side of the rear bumper off. The poor guy was so concerned that I was ok, and paid no attention to the fact his bumper was hanging off. I remember one time at school; a kid (I think his name was Robert) hit me. I took off after him and he crossed the streetin the middle of it. Now you know the crossing guards are there for a reason, but reason had fled, and was nowhere to be seen. Well the next day, both of us were escorted to Mother Superior. She did listen to our story, as to why we did not use the crosswalk, then got out the paddle. Now the next thing that happened sure did seem strange to me, but saved my skinny little behind. She found out my older brother was in this school, so she sent for him to watch as I got the paddle. When he got there she took the time to explain to him just why I was going to get my hide ripped off. He said no way. So we stood there and watched Robert get his. I wish I could remember what I was feeling at that point, but I left hating that woman. The next day my dad had to come to school to talk to Mother Superior. We sat there and dad listened to what I had to say, and what she had to say. He said, you are not going to paddle my son for defending himself. I guess she did not remember my dad was in the military and had a slightly different point of view on things. Well I never did get the paddle, but for some reason, they flunked me, had to redo the 3rd grade. By this time my mom was sick with cancer, and dad got transferred to March AFB in Riverside Ca. to see if the desert would help, so I Mother Superior never got a second chance to wail on me.

The last house we lived at was south of union and 16th. I dont remember where, but it was close to the railroad tracks. I remember my older brother was playing baseball with a bunch of the guys, and one of them, slid, or fell, and sliced his arm open on a piece of glass. I think that ended the ball playing there. We were not there long, as we moved to Ca.

Being an air force brat, we moved a lot. Mom did not do any better in Ca, so the doctors told dad she might as well be near her kin for the remainder. We moved to Chicago, and stayed there till Mom passed. Then dad got orders for Japan. Spent 3 years there. So many times people ask me, where are you from? I tell them the United States, but grew up in Columbus Indiana. That seems to answer their question, but leaves me wanting. I wish I HAD grown up there, but the time I did spend there sure set the form for how I did grow up. I have returned to visit twice, once in 74, and then when I was house hunting in 2002. Each time I saw changes, each time I felt sadder. There is one thing I can say, Columbus can change all it wants, my memories still stay the same. To all the folks whom I grew up with and lived by, I say Thank You, Thank You for the happiest time of my life. John Knox

Welcome and thanks for that vivid memory of your short time spent in Columbus. Those are the kind of memories we try to record here so future generations (their will always be a few who care ) will be able to explore the past.

Hi John/Jack,

And I have to second Ricky-----welcome to the boards, and your memories of Columbus are wonderful.

You mentioned &apos;Sis Brumfield,&apos; and that sounded so familiar, and I know that several of us went to school with Brumfield kids at Garfield and in East Columbus. I just couldn&apos;t put the lady that I knew living in the area that you mentioned. But maybe she did during the years that you mentioned, as I had moved by then to CA.

Yes, to the barber shop on 16th Street, Gene Chapman (father of Karen Chapman Barkhimer, and her brother, Ronnie) was a barber there. The Chapman&apos;s lived in that general area, and the Barkhimer family almost right across the street from the barber shop.

You mentioned &apos;haunted house,&apos; does anyone else think that might have been the Nugent home, now a bed and breakfast???

Loved your Donner Park memories. I hope that Katia Hatter catches them, as she (a current director in Parks/Recreation) is seeking Parks/Recreation memories to include in an upcoming celebration. As a gentle reminder, Katia would love to hear from anyone that can contribute memories, such as John included. Send her an email: khatter@columbus.in.gov

Special in my heart, were John&apos;s comments about Haw Creek, having grown up almost right along its banks on 7th Street.

Columbus is recognized, sort of, as being-------Different by Design. I can&apos;t help but think-------going beyond the architecture to which I believe those three words refer-----Columbus is &apos;different,&apos; yes, some of it may change, but for so many, our roots go deep in Columbus, and perhaps that is part of what makes it different-----------the memories that we hold dear and are such a part of our lives----------was that by &apos;design&apos; or just because Columbus was such a wholesome place to live?

To all------------Take a moment, take a memory walk through your past, and share here on the boards--------yes, Columbus is different, and ever so special, by design of the memories that we hold dear.

Hi Nancs, It was so nice to have stumbled on this site. I am not sure what I was looking for, but I found it, or maybeit found me? Sis Brumfield that I mentioned, may, or may not have lived by us. It is just a ghost of a memory, of someone mom knew who lived down the street. I am kind of sure, whom ever it was moved shortly after we moved into that house, and we did not live there long, maybe 6 months. Then we moved to the house on Union. I do know that Sis lived in; well I would have called it, a real nice neighborhood. I think it was just built, and on the east side. You know I have read about folks not getting a car right away, but I am sure dad had one. He would have had to get to the base. He was flying a lot back in them days, on C119s, so not sure how we got around, as I do not believe mom drove. I was sitting here letting the mind go back to those days of yesteryear, I remember making little pies. The thing was round, and hinged, with long handles. We would take two pieces of bread, spoon in some pie filling, clamp it shut and trim off the crust. Then just put it over a burner of the stove, and in a bit pie! I do not remember drinking much soda pop, lots of water, and a lot of time from a hose, maybe from some one out watering their lawn. I cannot imagine being out today, and stopping by some one you do not know and asking to get a drink from their hose. I got to thinking of all the other placed I have lived, and as much as Columbus has changed, it is nowhere as bad as where I lived in CA. They took and tore down about 1 mile of homes, both sides of the street, and made an industrial complex. Homes, schools, stores, all gone. I did come back to Columbus in 2002 and drove by the house on Union, and they were having a porch sale. Well I thought, are these folks still as friendly as back then? I went up to them, and explained I use to live there. Well come on in and look around they said. Yup still as friendly! I brought my movie camera in, and filmed the inside. I sent a copy to my brother and sister, how did you manage to get this they asked. I said I walked up and said HI. A town is just a bunch of buildings with people, what makes the town what it is, is the people. I think in this case, the people live on, the town can, and does change, but the people are the same. I miss my little drug store on union, I once saw it pictured in National Geographic, wish I had save that one. As for the haunted house, I do believe it is the bed and breakfast you mentioned. When last I was there it was all cleaned up. Still made me kind of, well scared. Some memories I guess I just do not want to let go of, special I guess. Well got to get back to clearing trees for the garage extension. Jack Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 Jack, you have to know Richard, who posts on the boards, just an awesome guy, and he came to our &apos;rescue&apos; and promptly furnished a photo of &apos;our remembered gadget.&apos; Thanks, Richard. 

Oh, my, yes, indeed, I remember that gadget, and what an innovation it was. When my family moved to California in November 1952, we sold out in Columbus, almost &apos;lock, stock, &apos;n barrel&apos; and all that remained of our &apos;life with horses in Columbus,&apos; was our two horse trailer. It was in that trailer that we brought all our belongings to California!!!!!!!!!!!! Very much looking like the Beverly Hillbillies, I suspect. And within, the things my mother managed to get packed, was, indeed, that little sandwich/pie maker. Wasn&apos;t it wonderful????? In my family, during Columbus days, we most often made grilled cheese sandwiches.

Now, I am not really certain just where or when I first knew about &apos;a snipe hunt!&apos; And it well may be that it has its roots in my Columbus memories. However, my real memory of a &apos;snipe hunt&apos; lies in my &apos;grown up life,&apos; camping in Southern California. I just looked up &apos;snipe&apos; in the dictionary, and truly it did NOT reference &apos;snipe&apos; as I know it to be. To conduct a &apos;snipe hunt,&apos; one needs to gather up a bunch of &apos;the unknowing,&apos; better done in the dark of the night on a cool summer beach, or up in the mountains among the trees, or could just be done in your neighborhood, there are mountain snipe, beach snipe, city snipe, country snipe-----------arm everyone with a pot or a pan, and a spoon, so as to be able to make enough noise to chase the &apos;snipe&apos; from their hiding spots. Those little critters are really hard to find, I might add. As the leader, you go far and wide, looking for a &apos;snipe.&apos; During the hunt, it is really fun to have a co-leader, who sort of slips away from the big group, heads back to the camp site, and when the group returns empty handed, announce that they had caught a &apos;snipe&apos; and it was all prepared and ready to be cooked over the open camp fire, a treat for all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, made in that little pie maker transported all the way from Columbus to California. Consequently, in my family and within our circle of friends, that little pie maker is known &apos;as the snipe cooker.&apos; Bob/Karen B., if you are reading this--------remember the &apos;snipe hunts&apos; at Doheny on the beach???? Know our kids do, for sure!!!! 

I will reveal NO more about &apos;snipe.&apos; However, I suggest that if you are not familiar with that delicacy, that you get yourself busy and talk to an old timer, and yes, I guess my age bracket qualifies---------------get their story, and sometime, yet this summer, conduct a &apos;snipe hunt.&apos; You are guaranteed a lot of good fun and laughter, as well as making lasting memories for others!!!!!

You made me smile, Jack. Thanks for the memories.

Oh Nancs I am so sad! I am still reading all of the different posts, and I am realizing just how much of Columbus I missed! It is like getting a hour free spree in a candy store, only to find out when it was donethere were 4 floors, and I only got to 1. Snif, sniff. Well so be it, the small part I did get to experience sure was wonderful!! Hey as long as I got you here, ha ha, am I missing something in the way of the boards? Is there a general board, you know just to kick things around now, with out hitting on the listed topics? I plan on being there for the 2008 get together! I am planning on spending a week there, and just going to all the places I am reading about, well the ones still there. I noticed there is someone pulling listings out of a phonebook; wonder if they have residential listings also? I will have to go back over the posts and see who it was, and send them a message. I hope they give enough advanced warning to the next get together, so I can find a place to stay!! I think I might spend 2 or 3 days in the library going over records to see who married who, who is still ling in town, and such. I found out the school I went to Saint Bartholomew, is not run by the nuns anymore. Well back to the reading! Jack Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Hello and welcome Jack,
My husband was stationed at Bakalar AFB, which is what the base&apos;s name would&apos;ve been during the time frame you mentioned. He was there from 1955 through 1959, so I wonder if he and your dad might&apos;ve crossed paths. Don (my husband) flew in the C119&apos;s as an instructor.

You have good memories of a small town and you are so right it was a great place to live. I was born in Columbus, spent all of my childhood here, married a serviceman and moved all over but eventually returned to my Columbus roots about 7 years ago. Columbus was indeed a wonderful place to grow up in and its also a great place to live now.

Just fyi our next Historic Columbus Indiana Celebration is scheduled for next April (date slips my mind right at this moment) but so you can begin your planning you should mark that on your calendar. I will get back to you on the date.

Regarding your comment on&quot;residential listings&quot;, yes, one of our members has some Columbus city directories for how far back I&apos;m not certain but he could certainly assist you in locating where certain folks lived at that time. He found an address for me of one of the homes my grandparents owned up on Central Avenue. Richard is the man you need to contact for this information and he is one of the administrators of this site so you can either send him an email or a personal message through the boards.

Again welcome and we are so glad to have your aboard. Have a great day and we look forward to meeting you in person at our next&quot;celebration of Columbus&quot;.

Hi Babs, My dad was either an E6 or E7 last name Knox. I remember he would be gone for a few days at a timesometimes. One of my sisters memories is dad bringing home some of the guys from the base, I guess after a night of drinking, and having my mom patch them up. Sis told me one time a guy had got tossed out a second story window. Mom drew the line in the dirt on that. I guess they guys had to go to the base hospital then. That also meant a report being made. My sister told me my dads drinking days ended shortly after that, something about a frying pan. She said it made the weirdest noise. In our house there was only one boss, and she ran it with an iron fist, ah, skillet? There is something to be said about running a house on love, if you got it you deserved it. I got it only once, had to do with a bar of soap, and my mouth. Now you might be thinking, ah swearing, but no, lying. I kissed a girl, thought no one saw. Mom asked me what I was doing, said nothing, she said, and boy I remember this, I will ask one more time. I said, nothing, and she grabbed my arm and into the bathroom we went. When she was done, which was 2 or 3 minutes longer then I wanted, she helped me Ha Ha Ha, clean out my mouth. When my face was dry, she gave me a big hug, and kiss, and said, no more lying. . I think it took 2 days to get the taste out of my mouth. I never did lie to mom again. I remember one summer the base had a day set aside for a base picnic. It was the 1st time any one ever said to me, eat all you want. I did. Did not sleep well that night. I also remember when my little brother was born. My older brother and I were fishing at haw creek, and I asked him what is that building over there he said it is the hospital. I said where mom is? He said yup. I remember walking across a plowed field and looking into the windows. Sure enough there was my mom. She started laughing, and then brought over my brand new brother to the window for me to see. I looked a bit waved, and went back to fishing. That hospital sure has changed, but then again so has haw creek.

Hi Jack,
Do you know if your dad was a&quot;crew chief&quot;? I asked Don and he did not remember the name but the base was pretty crowded with a lot of new officers when Don got there so think it was about all he could do to keep up with all his friends.

Oh I got a terrible spanking, my brother too, one time for just calling each other&quot;a liar&quot;. That was something my folks did not tolerate at all was lying of any type. I remember we were not very old and had been playing out behind the garage in our sandbox. Don&apos;t remember what happened but as we were called in for supper, something was brought up and we both started denying it. I called my brother a liar and he called me one and man did my dad light into us. Off came his belt and we got the spanking of our lives. Don&apos;t think either of us ever called each other a liar ever again. I don&apos;t ever remember having my mouth washed out with soap but think my brother did one time. One time was all it took, I&apos;m sure.

Actually I think parents who really&quot;parented&quot;back in the&quot;good ole days&quot;raised a better breed of kids than some of the parents today. Times are too easy, not many kids are held accountable and no respect for either parents, teachers, policemen or anyone. If an adult told you to do something we listened and you better believe we did it.

Is that a picture of you and your dad?

You mention kissing a girl and then lying about it. I remember my first kiss; we were playing post office at a party for the basketball team and when you were called into the closet to get a kiss, most of the boys kissed you on the cheek (we were pretty young at this time and in grade school). Well this one boy&quot;planted one on me&quot;right in the kisser and I was not ready for that so I hauled off and socked him a good one right in the eye. He came out of the closet holding his eye and of course all the other kids laughed at him and asked him what happened.) I suppose if I had liked the boy it might&apos;ve been different but we were awfully young.

Keep on posting Jack; everyone will enjoy your memories and you cause the rest of us then to think of more memories of our own. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by jack on Aug 6, 2007, 10:11pm

Hi Babs sorry for the delay in responding, but have been working on the garage extension. I think my dad was a crew chief. I know in Japan he was, but on the ground in aircraft maintenance. I agree with our parents setting down the rules, and then enforcing them. I know if I had tried to do the same I would have been in jail. Do you know at their school the teachers actually asked the kids if they were spanked, or punished in any like manner? Then if they said yes they called the authorities. I had a hard time raising them in a socially acceptable manner. We had a similar kissing game, but we did not play it until 4th or 5th grade, spin the bottle, and we did not leave the circle. If I remember correctly it was a quick peck, but on the lips. Nine months after leaving Columbus we were living in Chicago, and though it was a big city, things were still safe enough that we roamed where we wanted. Cannot imagine do that now, there or anywhere. My kids still say yes sir, or yes mam. I have noticed when I pay for something in a store, and I say thank you sir, or mam and they are young, I get some strange looks. I think we can blame all the quick changes on the space program, too much, too fast. There was no time to adapt. Oh well they are just as much to blame as anyone else.

Post by babs on Aug 7, 2007, 4:56pm

We were either in the fourth or fifth grade too; maybe the game was not post office but I do remember we went into a closet. I never did like that kid after that game! I know we played spin the bottle and post office.

My dad ruled with&quot;an iron fist&quot;and a good strong belt! You better not sass him or even look like you were thinking about it. I remember one time, I was in high school and something was said at the dinner table, I got upset and got up and went into the bathroom and was brushing my hair. I ended up throwing the hair brush into the tub I was so peeved and my dad almost took the bathroom door off its hinges as he stormed into the bathroom. He grabbed hold of me and he shook me till my teeth rattled and I&apos;ll never forget his words to me.&quot;Don&apos;t you ever raise your voice to your mother again?&quot;(Hey I never raised my voice or said one word, I was just mad and threw the hair brush...but he knew I wanted to say something. Needless to say I never threw another hair brush or anything else.) You did not give my dad even a bad look or you would get it. He was one tough cookie and at almost 94 is still just as tough. In his eyes I&apos;m sure I&apos;m just a little kid yet!

Having said all of this, it didn&apos;t kill me to be raised by strict parents. I got spankings maybe I didn&apos;t deserve but sometimes I didn&apos;t get some I did deserve. I&apos;m like you I still respect my elders, I still say&quot;yes, mam and yes, sir&quot;, I obey the laws, and sometimes wonder what the next generation of kids will turn out to be with all they are given and no discipline. Teachers can&apos;t lay a hand on kids anymore or they better not. Don&apos;t know if the space program had anything to do with any of this, but I can sure say whoever came up with the idea that the kids ruled the family and&quot;were in charge&quot;got something wrong. Kids are not in charge and because so many parents have let them think they are we&apos;ve got a generation of spoiled young people who think the world owes them&quot;everything&quot;. Its not true kids! You gotta get out there and earn it!

Give me the&quot;good ole days anytime&quot;....but maybe that is showing my age? Suppose? I don&apos;t care, I&apos;m glad I was born and raised in Columbus and yes, glad even that I happened to be born into a strict family where when my dad said&quot;jump&quot;, we asked&quot;yes, sir, how high?&quot; Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

It turned out to start with Andrew Sisters, then went to Disneys: When you wish upon a star. All stopped, eyes closed, I was laying on the front room floor, 9 years old watching The Mickey Mouse Club. I could see it as if I was there. Song finished, eyes opened, and darn if they werent wet.

Jack and Babs,
I saw all the talk about the base. My dad, Bill Cooper, was a local pilot and flew in WWII, also an instructor but in P-51s. He used to refer to the Air Base as Atterbury Army Air Field because that&apos;s what it was during the war. I think it became Bakalar during the early &apos;50s and remained such until closing in the &apos;70s. My uncle, Bill Fox was one of the local Columbus guys that helped the base museum get started and made some of the models on display there.

My father-in-law was Warren Baldridge and was a pilot at the base from 1961 until the base closed and then he moved to Grissom in Peru where he continued to fly and was the budget officer for the 434th. My mother, Mary Lou Cooper, also worked at Bakalar and also trasferred to Grissom and worked for the 434th. The both retired in the &apos;80s.

I grew up in Columbus and Hope and lived there until the early &apos;80s. Some of your memories really take me back to my growing up years.
Jim Cooper Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by babs on Aug 29, 2007, 12:33am

Hi Jim,
Yes, the Air Force Base was originally called Atterbury, which I think was always confusing, since the Army base was also Atterbury. Exactly when it became Bakalar I&apos;m not sure, I worked there in 1955 and it was Bakalar at that time, so sometime previous to that would&apos;ve been when the name was switched.

Lots of fond memories from those days. I met my husband at Bakalar and he flew in C-119&apos;s at that time as an instructor for the reserves. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 Trimmel Tire Shop 
 Located on 10th Street before you cross Hawcreek 

The Trimmel tire shop was on the backside of the city golf course within 200 yards or so from the 10th Street Hawcreek Bridge. It was a small little building that Mr. Trimmel had and he sold recapped tires and did tire patching. The place was sort of a messy area, but what do you expect it was a tire repair place.

The 1953 directory lists it as Harold Trimmel (gas station) 2324 10th Street.

Mr. Trimmel was a very nice man and my Dad used his shop for recaps (normal in those days) and tire repairs. My brother and I also used Trimmel&apos;s after we started driving vehicles.

Bob 
 


Actually Harold&apos;s last name was Trimnell (not Trimmel) and he was, indeed, a character. My Dad, Ralph Hinds (who was the Texaco consignee in Columbus from 1943 through 1975) owned the little building where Harold had his business. It was always a total jumble of tires, tubes, valve stems, oil and grease cans, pop bottles, Harold&apos;s old cigar butts, and what-have-you. But if you went in there and asked him for the most obscure item you could think of, he could walk right to it! Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Hi Texaco,

Thanks for your additional information on the Trimnell (Trimmel) tire place. I also typed it wrong from the directory. Well, I guess I had two wrongs, and thanks to you it is now right. The 54 year old Columbus Directory apparently had the spelling wrong. Here is a segment quote of the 10th Street 1953 directory:

I received an e-mail from a reader of this message board about the 1956 attendance at The Jive Kennel.

The comment I received was, that he and his brother attended in the fall of 1956. He stated that the Jive Kennel always had a good group in attendance and Pete Burns and Glenn Line, members of The Columbus Police Department, was always there.

He also wanted to remind everyone that in the 1950&apos;s the Memorial Gymnasium was filled with 8,000 fans for each game. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 What Were These Buildings Used For? 
 They may have been on East Jackson Street in early years 

 Comment: Richard sent me this picture a few weeks ago thinking it might have been the building for a certain business. However, we determined it wasn&apos;t the building for the one we had discussed. So, does anyone know the history, usage and location of these buildings. I can&apos;t read signs on my computer.

The building with the sign is 335 Jackson - The Sportsman Bar in 1965 and 1966. That must have been at the start of the Commons demolition. That part of the block is now inside the Commons Mall but may soon be a regular street again when they do the renovations. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

I keep an Excell file with business on various streets over the years and plug in new info now and then when I have time to spend with a directory. In 1938-39 ... 335 Jackson was Shorty&apos;s Lunch room (that would have been Shorty Sr.!). In 1957-59 it was something called Rice and Rice and in 1963 it was the Elbow Benders Office (bar).

Ricky that is interesting that it was Shorty&apos;s Lunch Room during 1938 and 1939 (probably even before 1938). If this is the Shorty that makes tenderloin sandwiches (presently next to Cummins) then it shows how long he has been around. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by george on Oct 29, 2007, 8:40pm

Bob.... the lunch room on Jackson St. was Shorty&apos;s Lunch Room, little Shorty&apos;s dad&apos;s place. Little Shorty.... Marion Prather, the son worked there while going to High School and shortly there after along came WW2 and Shorty was called to serve.
Shortly after the war Little Shorty open a lunch room on the corner of 6th. and Wilson St., the dinner was located where his parking lot is today, he lived in a house that is now the present Shorty&apos;s Lunch Room.
That area was on my paper route and I delivered his first paper there, and for about three years after that, the year would have been 1946. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by rer on Oct 29, 2007, 8:57pm

Well, George you delivered papers at Shorty&apos;s house in 1946 and we lived at 502 Union (now a Cummins parking lot) during that period. Shorty&apos;s place was only a block away, but I don&apos;t remember any of that because I was a little younger. My brother would remember that much better. We moved from there in 1950 and I don&apos;t recall much about Shorty&apos;s until older age. Next door to our house was Bob Welmer and his family. You may have delivered papers there and even our house.

I have been to the present Shorty&apos;s for lunch a few times over the years to eat (of course) tenderloins etc. I understand he still sits on his stool and greets the customers each day. Shorty&apos;s Dad&apos;s place I have no memory because that was before my days, but it was interesting what you said about little Shorty learning the business and working there as a younger boy and man.

Bob.... my route was on the east side of Union St., it started mid block between 5th and 6th. St., I remember the first house was a brick and around 1949 or 50 it was taken down for a parking lot.
Something of interest, when Shorty&apos;s was on Jackson St, Jackson St. was US 31 and the old 2nd St. bridge was on that route,......much less traffic !!!!!!. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by rer on Oct 29, 2007, 10:18pm

George you missed our house by only maybe 3 or 4 houses. We were on the corner of 5th and Union. Interesting to relate that far back. I had a Louisville Courier Journal route in the area we moved to, out past the hospital during the middle 1950s.

I wrote about it a little in other posts herein a couple years ago it seems.

Ricky....Shorty is now 83 and still going pretty strong, he arrives at the lunch room at 2:30 am to start getting breakfast going, he is usually out of there by 1:30 pm, a long day for a man of 83, but that has always been his life.
You are correct about his first lunch room, it was an old wooden box car, but with some remodeling it looked pretty respectable. It was located on what is now his parking lot, he lived in a house that was located were the present lunch room is located. At the time he first opened there were houses on both sides of Wilson St. from 6th to 7th St., Reeves parking lot was in the future.
Shorty has always rode motorcycles and has several at his home and still rides them, in his younger days he raced cycles. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Bob,

Can you tell me anything else about the Crump-Lucas building on Washington Street? Both those names are in my family tree. I&apos;m sure it has some connection, and have run across the building&apos;s name somewhere in my family history research, but don&apos;t know how/why it is named that.

Hi Rhonda,

No I can&apos;t but you have sources in Columbus that can maybe fill in the unknown details. I might suggest that the Court House history records of the building owners be reviewed, the library on 5th has loads of history and maybe the BCHS boxes of memories and records could find something.

Another, source would be to contract some of the local Crump family members, that still live in Columbus and some have businesses on Washington Street. Even Harry at the Republic paper might know, He might research the paper&apos;s vast storage files of Columbus building history.

Lastly, Nanc, Richard, George and David may know or some of the readers on the board here might be able to contribute to your question. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

Hi, Rhonda, and be assured, I don&apos;t know-------------but will direct you to the &apos;home page&apos; of the Historic Columbus site------and I know that I seem to tend to forget about that collection of really wonderful history-------------On that page, David has compiled a great deal of &apos;Crump family&apos; history. Don&apos;t know if from that you might either find what you are looking for, or perhaps a name that you could use to further your search.

Good luck.

 The following information is part of, The Looking Back column in todays The Republic. 

1982 - A fleet of trucks valued at more than one million dollars was auctioned at Bakalar Municipal Airport from the closed Courier-Newsom Trucking Company.

1957 - Mayor Fred Owens announced that Columbus would add 135 spaces in off-street parking. He acknowledged that this addition would not solve the parking shortage. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

 &quot;When Did It All Start and End For Columbus High Senior Cords?&quot; 

 

Well, I don&apos;t know the beginning or ending history of the Columbus High School senior corduroys (cords), but can speak about them during the period of 1955 through most of the 1960s. During my brother&apos;s years at Central and the Pearl Street area, he wore just plain light yellow cords and many other seniors wore painted cords. During my time at the 25th Street school, many students also wore the painted yellow senior cords.

During late year 1958 I painted my own cords above (not the greatest artist that is for sure) and many other fellow students&apos; cords. In fact students that I ran around with in Franklin Indiana asked me to paint their skirts and pants. I only charged mostly for the paint tubes that were used because it cost almost $6 or $7 in paint to complete the skirt or pants. The ink was indelible from tube pens bought at the Nagel Book and Art store on Washington Street.

In my days, a Junior during the last week of their Junior Class was allowed to wear the cords only the last week of that school year. I guess this was a tradition so to speak.

Senior cords were worn traditionally on Fridays, but some wore them daily and some everyday. I recall a couple guys wore them and never washed them; which is a story to be left out of here. I washed mine weekly !

As I said I wasn&apos;t a good artist but got by with painting as many as I could for other students. One of the best painters in school was classmate Terry Galbraith. He had such wonderful creativity in his art work, and other young guys like Bill Hawkins, and various ladies from art classes. Some had professionals do the paintings. I am pleased for memories that I did mine and some others.

Does anyone know the full history or starting and ending of this former CHS tradition ? I understand today it no longer walks in the school halls.

 Bob&apos;s Cords...the waist isn&apos;t what it used to be. LOL

 
 UPDATE: Received word from a 1969 grad that his class still had some cords that were painted. He believes his class was the last to paint cords . Also, Richard posted at #90 pictures of pants/skirts painted from Sadie&apos;s Family Dining under 1950s. The men&apos;s pants at Sadie&apos;s came from Peru Indiana High School and the skirts looks like Columbus.

 My History Part 4
When I was old enough to have a paper route, my bike had a big basket over the front wheel. I recall riding West bound on State Street on my way downtown to pay my paper bill and then pick up my papers. When I got in front of The Midway Barber Shop, some fellow opened his car door as I was passing. The Midway Barber Shop was on the North side of State Street across from The Coffman Drug Store. That big basket was nearly as wide as my handlebars and State Street was two lanes at that time so there was not any extra room between passing traffic and the parked cars. Talk about a quick stop! I had it that day. I had a cut on my forehead and my chin where I hit the edge of his door. He asked about me and I was OK, but the door on his new Oldsmobile groaned when he tried to shut it.

The Evening Republican was located at 444 Fifth Street. That address was at the Northwest corner of Fifth and Franklin Streets and we picked up our papers there. The paper was printed in the late afternoon Monday thru Saturday. We paid our bills in the newspaper office until they told the carriers to get a savings account at the bank. After that we paid our bills at the bank.

We were told the time to be there for the press run. I can remember Nick whose name was Willis Hobard Nichols. He was the supervisor of carriers. He had other work as well. I recall him bringing a thin, stiff cardboard sheet with dents in it into that room. Nick placed it in a hollow cylinder. Well it had to be two cylinders as he then opened a valve and ran lead into the cavity. After it cooled somewhat, he removed this sleeve which had the letters, numbers and pictures on its surface. Nick then slid it onto an arbor and lowered a cutter, and using both hands to operate the cranks, he rotated the cylinder as well as moving it sideways. This action made the lead chips fly as he trimmed the round lead cylinders. His cranking cleared the area that became the newspapers margins. When he was finished, he took that cylinder into the press room.

We used the room on the Northeast corner of the building and the press was in a room just West of the room we used. A short time after Nick took his last cylinder to the press room the press started a test run. If Nick didnt come out to make a new cylinder, we knew we could then start to line up to get our papers when the press started again. Herb Hoeltke worked in the afternoons and he got the first papers that came off the press. Those copies were mailed to customers who lived out of town. He loaded his papers into a trailer the paper had attached to a bicycle and took those to the Post Office which was on Washington at Seventh Streets. As we got to the front of the line, we told the press man how many papers we needed. The press left the corner of every fiftieth paper sticking out so the press man didnt need to make a complete count, just the odd numbers! We then took our papers to the large tables and got our papers ready for our routes.

Most paperboys blocked their papers. The papers came off the press folded once from top to bottom as they are today when you buy one at a store or one of the paper boxes along a street. To block a paper we did the following. We put the press fold toward us with the top of the front page down, then using both hands we folded both sides in. You then had a paper in front of you that was one third of the width of the front page. We then folded it three times and then we slipped the top part of the paper into the pocket that was formed when we did the last tri-fold. We then had a rectangular block that had a fold on each side and could be thrown from the middle of the street to the porch on both sides of the street! Without the fold on each side, the paper would try to balloon out and fall short when thrown. If the customer wanted his paper in their street side mailbox, you could slow down and ride by with the blocked paper between your little fingers, open the mailbox with your thumb and forefinger, flip the paper into the box and close the door as you rode past. Sometimes if I hadnt slowed enough Id need to turn around and pass the mailbox the second time. Most of the time I was successful on the first pass!

The second route I passed included Elmer Strietelmeiers DX Service Station at the Southeast corner of State and Gladstone. This was before the newspaper started routes in the country and some of the Hamilton Manufacturing Co. employees car pooled. Their rides picked them up at the DX station and some bought a paper while waiting on their ride. Therefore, I had several customers with one stop. We had to collect each week and Mr. Strietelmeier paid me. I loved making one stop to collect several customers. I also knew when he was open and therefore didnt need to make a second attempt to collect! Yes, I had one of those metal change makers hanging from my belt. I wore it while collecting on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings.

The paper office didnt want the carriers stopping while passing the paper, but that was the only time you could find some customers home. I always had my receipt book and enough change with me so I could collect if I found someone home that had been absent on Friday evening or Saturday morning! When I moved to my second route, I lost a lot of money when I couldnt get all of the customers collected. The paper wasnt any help as we were independent business men! The kid that took that route over never did pay me any of the money that the customers owed me. That money was my profit as we had to pay our bill even when our customers had not paid us.

I was also the sub on a route and was going to take that route over because he had almost twice the number of customers than my old route. I was looking forward to the extra money and knew what I wanted to buy! Well at that time the paper decided that two hundred and thirty some customers were too large and divided the route; so I didnt gain many customers and may have lost a few, but it was near home so I no longer had to pedal across town to collect! I did buy, among other things, a cartridge powered b-b pistol, camera, 22 rifle and saved enough to buy my first car, a 1950 Ford.

That camera came with a flash attachment. Do you remember flashbulbs and blue tipped flashbulbs? Today, I wish I knew where those pictures are. At that time in my life most likely I didnt take pictures of buildings, but I may have accidently taken some! Im sure the Log and Triangle had a photographer on staff and I wonder if any pictures exist that werent used in those publications.

Oh yes and the White Castle Hamburgers. I miss them living on the East Coast. They don&apos;t have White Castles in this State. However, when we go to Knoxville TN and Columbus IN we get the hamburgers like the old days, and suffer the remainder of the day of gas. Wish we had some of those greats. We don&apos;t like the frozen White Castles sold in our stores here.

 Bob Schiller Oldsmobile Salesman Before Gorden Wilson Owner of Oldsmobile 
 216-218 Jackson Street (behind Courthouse) 

First, I knew Bob Schiller and his family pretty well because my mother worked as an accountant at the Oldsmobile dealership, and later for Gorden Wilson&apos;s Olds. The Schiller family lived on the corner of Central and 17th Street in a brick house. The house last time I was in Columbus is now used as a business of some sort. Janice Shiller was a fine girl and like you I didn&apos;t want them to move out of town. When the Schiller&apos;s moved they gave their Cocker Spaniel dog to us. It was a blond cocker named Sandy. The dog was the last cocker in our family when I left home for the world endeavors. After the Schiller family moved I don&apos;t recall every hearing from them.

 Hello to all!. First let me tell you a bit about myself, so you will know my stay was a short one. My name is John (jack) Knox. My dad was in the air force, and I guess stationed at Camp Attaberry. We lived in Columbus for 4 years, this was about 1953 to 1958, but it was filled with memories that might be more befitting for 100 years! We lived in 3 different places while there. The 1st place, well it was a white house (now how many white houses can there be in Columbus?) 2 story, where all 3 of us kids slept upstairs. The garage was detached and a bit behind the house. Mom had a little strip garden along the house where we might sometimes pull up goodies to munch on. Cannot recall where it was located, except our street kind of jogged to the left and went on. At the jog to the left of the street I think my mom had a friend she call sis Brumfield (?) who later moved to a new subdivision. My mom was a nurse and worked at the Hospital where my brother was born. We moved from there to 16th and Union north/east corner, brick house with a big porch. This was the center of the universe as far as I was concerned. We had our milk delivered in a little metal box on the steps, which also would hold my school books, if I saw something that just had to be checked out, before going in. I guess I should say here how old I was, I went to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade at Saint Bartholomew school. My best friend in the world, which at that time was 3 square blocks, was Jackie Penser (?) who lived across the street on union. We would, and did, go just about any place. I remember one time Jackie told me he had saw some big boxes at this store, and that we needed to get them! The store was maybe a couple of blocks to the west of us, maybe an appliance store, so we dragged them home, and made a fort!

Jackie went to the school down the street from us. I think it was on 17th. Now I have read a lot of boards here. Took me about a week, but from reading gazillion posts, I think it was McKinley. I came back in 2002, when I retired, and found the school was apartments or condos. You know leave a place for 40 years and come back, and darn if it hasnt changed! I was looking for a place to finish off my life in, but land just cost too much, so settled in Arkansas.

Most things were still there though, the house I lived in, well all the houses were still there, but different people living in them. I remember the Haunted house on 16th and Home. I think it took up the whole block. I say haunted, because at the time it had a fence with weeds, trees, bushes, mingled in with it. That and my big brother TOLD me it was haunted. I never, never walked on that side of the street!

I remember my 1st set of roller skates, still had the key till this last move, and the side walk. The side walk around my block was, well lets say not the best for roller skating, fun to skate, had 3 built in jumping ramps. I sit here trying to think of just how many times I donated skin and blood to that sidewalk, before I could jump those uplifts in the concrete. I also got my 1st bike thereit liked the rose bushes!! No matter what I did, it always ran right into them! Well I guess it got tired of doing that, and one day decided to stop, and then I was ready to try seeing the rest of the world. I had already seen every branch, and thorn of them rose bushes!

Donners park had a summer program, one time (one of many!) where they had a watermelon eating contest and such. I did not win that, but I did win the best-decorated bike. My brother and sister helped me decorate it, and it won! I got to lead a procession of kids on bikes all over the place. I learned how to swim there. I learned that the merry go round ring (I have read of others who remember this one) was fun, just as long as you could hang on. One time I go to going real fast, and flew off. Once was enough of that! I attended many a show there, one I remember was a magician. He wanted me to stick my hand in his little guillotine yeah right! I must have made 2 dozen potholders.

The house we lived in on union was kind of small, but I guess that was what my father could afford. It got even smaller when my little brother came along! I remember watching TV, Mickey Mouse, Spin and Marty, and on Friday nights.. the Friday night fights, dad liked them. There was a furnace in the basement and every once in a while the door to it would fall, or blow off, and dad would have to go down and put it back on. I remember when dad planted shrubs, or something along the wall of the porch, and put fresh fertilizer on them, oh the smell!! I remember the neighbor on the corner right across from us was a bounty hunter, or so I was told. He would take me out in the country and let me ride his horses. I remember one summer I wanted to have some money, so I grabbed the lawn mower and went door to door. Well I got one customer. A nice little old lady, with a yard where the grass was 3 foot high. Well I got $1 for about 4 hours work, not to bad for a 3rd grader. I went home and crossed the street to the drug store, and got 2 milk shakes. Still had 50 cents left, gave that to my dad. I remember the barbershop just down 16th; use to get a stick of gum if I sat still for him.

My older brother use to take me fishing at haws creek. For years I use to call it Hawk creek, till one day my brother said, hawk creek, where was that? Oh well, it was fun no matter what you called it. I never remember catching fish there, just crawdads. Now I do not know if it was just my young mind, or the creek sure has changed, but it sure is a lot different now.

I remember buying records from a man who lived, ok now remember this is from the memory of a 3rd grader, on 17th or 18th, home to maple??? I think he sold them out of his garage? I bought Honeycomb, and others there. I remember going to one movie, my sister had to baby-sit me, so she had to take me along. What a date that was for her, guess I owe her one. I remember the basement, I think of the courthouse, had like a museum in it? It was kind of a strange place to me.

Now for some of the high points. I remember the first girl I kissed, Cecilia Page. It was winter, and we had built a snowman in her back yard. Well we got behind the snowman and it happened. No bells rang, no fireworks, but I liked it just the same. I use to roller-skate with her in her basement. I remember sitting down and talking to her dad one time, not sure at all what we talked about, but it seemed like hour. It could have been he wanted to know a bit about this boy who was spending some time with his daughter. I guess I was ok, cause he let me come back again. The 1st house we lived in had an out-house. We did not use it as we had indoor plumbing, but could not understand who would have use something like that. Later in life, in Vietnam, I would have used it; it would have been down right nice! I remember one time I was coming home from school on my bike, I was late and using all the shortcuts I knew. I came flying out of an alley, and ran right into a car! I managed to somehow pull one side of the rear bumper off. The poor guy was so concerned that I was ok, and paid no attention to the fact his bumper was hanging off. I remember one time at school; a kid (I think his name was Robert) hit me. I took off after him and he crossed the streetin the middle of it. Now you know the crossing guards are there for a reason, but reason had fled, and was nowhere to be seen. Well the next day, both of us were escorted to Mother Superior. She did listen to our story, as to why we did not use the crosswalk, then got out the paddle. Now the next thing that happened sure did seem strange to me, but saved my skinny little behind. She found out my older brother was in this school, so she sent for him to watch as I got the paddle. When he got there she took the time to explain to him just why I was going to get my hide ripped off. He said no way. So we stood there and watched Robert get his. I wish I could remember what I was feeling at that point, but I left hating that woman. The next day my dad had to come to school to talk to Mother Superior. We sat there and dad listened to what I had to say, and what she had to say. He said, you are not going to paddle my son for defending himself. I guess she did not remember my dad was in the military and had a slightly different point of view on things. Well I never did get the paddle, but for some reason, they flunked me, had to redo the 3rd grade. By this time my mom was sick with cancer, and dad got transferred to March AFB in Riverside Ca. to see if the desert would help, so I Mother Superior never got a second chance to wail on me.

The last house we lived at was south of union and 16th. I dont remember where, but it was close to the railroad tracks. I remember my older brother was playing baseball with a bunch of the guys, and one of them, slid, or fell, and sliced his arm open on a piece of glass. I think that ended the ball playing there. We were not there long, as we moved to Ca.

Being an air force brat, we moved a lot. Mom did not do any better in Ca, so the doctors told dad she might as well be near her kin for the remainder. We moved to Chicago, and stayed there till Mom passed. Then dad got orders for Japan. Spent 3 years there. So many times people ask me, where are you from? I tell them the United States, but grew up in Columbus Indiana. That seems to answer their question, but leaves me wanting. I wish I HAD grown up there, but the time I did spend there sure set the form for how I did grow up. I have returned to visit twice, once in 74, and then when I was house hunting in 2002. Each time I saw changes, each time I felt sadder. There is one thing I can say, Columbus can change all it wants, my memories still stay the same. To all the folks whom I grew up with and lived by, I say Thank You, Thank You for the happiest time of my life. John Knox

IT JUST DAWNED ON ME THAT THE JACK KNOX HERE REFERS TO HIS OLDER BROTHER ROBERT, THERE IS A PICTURE IN THE MCKINLEY SCHOOL PORTION OF THE BOARD THAT I POINTED OUT PEOPLE LIKE ME JACK HINKLE, GEORGE HAMILTON. DOUG EMIG.
JILL BAKER AND OTHERS I THINK MAYBE JACK KNOX OLBER BROTHER BOBBY KNOW IS RIGHT BEHIND JACK HINKLE AND A LITTLE LEFT



 Quote: 
 
 Hello to all!. First let me tell you a bit about myself, so you will know my stay was a short one. My name is John (jack) Knox. My dad was in the air force, and I guess stationed at Camp Attaberry. We lived in Columbus for 4 years, this was about 1953 to 1958, but it was filled with memories that might be more befitting for 100 years! We lived in 3 different places while there. The 1st place, well it was a white house (now how many white houses can there be in Columbus?) 2 story, where all 3 of us kids slept upstairs. The garage was detached and a bit behind the house. Mom had a little strip garden along the house where we might sometimes pull up goodies to munch on. Cannot recall where it was located, except our street kind of jogged to the left and went on. At the jog to the left of the street I think my mom had a friend she call sis Brumfield (?) who later moved to a new subdivision. My mom was a nurse and worked at the Hospital where my brother was born. We moved from there to 16th and Union north/east corner, brick house with a big porch. This was the center of the universe as far as I was concerned. We had our milk delivered in a little metal box on the steps, which also would hold my school books, if I saw something that just had to be checked out, before going in. I guess I should say here how old I was, I went to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade at Saint Bartholomew school. My best friend in the world, which at that time was 3 square blocks, was Jackie Penser (?) who lived across the street on union. We would, and did, go just about any place. I remember one time Jackie told me he had saw some big boxes at this store, and that we needed to get them! The store was maybe a couple of blocks to the west of us, maybe an appliance store, so we dragged them home, and made a fort!

Jackie went to the school down the street from us. I think it was on 17th. Now I have read a lot of boards here. Took me about a week, but from reading gazillion posts, I think it was McKinley. I came back in 2002, when I retired, and found the school was apartments or condos. You know leave a place for 40 years and come back, and darn if it hasnt changed! I was looking for a place to finish off my life in, but land just cost too much, so settled in Arkansas.

Most things were still there though, the house I lived in, well all the houses were still there, but different people living in them. I remember the Haunted house on 16th and Home. I think it took up the whole block. I say haunted, because at the time it had a fence with weeds, trees, bushes, mingled in with it. That and my big brother TOLD me it was haunted. I never, never walked on that side of the street!

I remember my 1st set of roller skates, still had the key till this last move, and the side walk. The side walk around my block was, well lets say not the best for roller skating, fun to skate, had 3 built in jumping ramps. I sit here trying to think of just how many times I donated skin and blood to that sidewalk, before I could jump those uplifts in the concrete. I also got my 1st bike thereit liked the rose bushes!! No matter what I did, it always ran right into them! Well I guess it got tired of doing that, and one day decided to stop, and then I was ready to try seeing the rest of the world. I had already seen every branch, and thorn of them rose bushes!

Donners park had a summer program, one time (one of many!) where they had a watermelon eating contest and such. I did not win that, but I did win the best-decorated bike. My brother and sister helped me decorate it, and it won! I got to lead a procession of kids on bikes all over the place. I learned how to swim there. I learned that the merry go round ring (I have read of others who remember this one) was fun, just as long as you could hang on. One time I go to going real fast, and flew off. Once was enough of that! I attended many a show there, one I remember was a magician. He wanted me to stick my hand in his little guillotine yeah right! I must have made 2 dozen potholders.

The house we lived in on union was kind of small, but I guess that was what my father could afford. It got even smaller when my little brother came along! I remember watching TV, Mickey Mouse, Spin and Marty, and on Friday nights.. the Friday night fights, dad liked them. There was a furnace in the basement and every once in a while the door to it would fall, or blow off, and dad would have to go down and put it back on. I remember when dad planted shrubs, or something along the wall of the porch, and put fresh fertilizer on them, oh the smell!! I remember the neighbor on the corner right across from us was a bounty hunter, or so I was told. He would take me out in the country and let me ride his horses.

 Wake-Up....Ok...All Awake? 
 Go Back In Memory To The 1950s or 1960s 

Here is a picture that Richard took the other day on 16th Street. Now there has been discussion about what businesses were in these buildings during the 1950s? Well, I will offer only two items that I remember and were discussed. What do the Old Timers and maybe even younger folks remember about these place?

 My memories (long building): 

(1) The furtherest long building there was a Drug Store that had a delivery service.

(2) There was a Barber Shop and I was getting a haircut in one of the chairs when the radio announced movie star Grace Kelly had just married the Prince of Monaco. (See Grace&apos;s bits below) 

(3) Now what do you folks remember about these buildings?

 

 Grace Kelly Bits: She was a Hollywood Star during the early 1950s. Some of her movies included High Noon (western) 1952, The Country Girl 1954, and To Catch A Thief 1955. She became a Princess when she married the Prince of Monaco in 1956. She died in a vehicle accident in 1982. I didn&apos;t remember this information until Richard sent me this picture and several of the board members started to discuss it. That is really wierd to recall that from just a simple picture.

Jack:

Great job and research on the 16th Street layout! You win the prize of the word &quot;Fantastic&quot; . You sure knew your way around that area for sure. The only thing I can add is I rode my bike and walked those walks many times to and from 15th Street to Washington Street areas. The Chapman Barber Shop was the chair I was getting my haircut in 1956 when the radio announcement came on. Then shortly after that in 1956 I would get all my haircuts at Brumy&apos;s Barber Shop, addresss 301 Washington Street. Dave Brumfield&apos;s dad gave great flattops during that period. Also, at Brumy&apos;s Marion Smith gave great shoe shines for that date later if you weren&apos;t wearing tennis shoes. LOL

Not far from that 16th Street a few blocks behind Dr. Bruce Hart&apos;s house was Morgan Packing Plant. Normally, either walking or riding my bike I would go from the house down 17th Street to Donner Park and sometimes from Donner Park to the downtown areas, but return many times down old 16th toward home on 15th Street past the hospital area. Good memory Jack keep on &apos;trucking&apos; my friend.

 Comment: Jack that was only 52 years ago this year of 2008. 

 Try This Picture Now ya&apos;ll (as they say in the south):

Okay----------my recollections of that general area, remembering that I started my &apos;jaunts&apos; to Donner Park and the swimming pool from over by Hawcreek and 7th!!!!!!!!!!

Some times we rode our bikes along that RR track by Golden Foundry, and other times, we cut across the big field, where the circus would set up, as there were paths through there, to make our way to 16th St. and on to the park.

Being as how I am older than Bob/RER and Jack, my circle of friends included Bob Barkhimer, and I might just be snatched bald headed, but.....................Bob is even older than me!!!!!!!!!! Just by a bit, tho&apos;. Remember you&apos;re my good bud and Karen won&apos;t let you be mean to me. 

Back in those late 40s&apos;, Bob had a duck who made residence in his backyard. Now Rudolph had quite a &apos;disposition,&apos; and frankly I have been chased around the yard by that crazy duck!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rudolph was just out and out mean! As I recall there was the alley that ran to the east (N-S direction) of Bob&apos;s house, as well as one that ran in an E-W direction. Think that, according to Bob&apos;s recent verification, Gene Chapman&apos;s (Gene was/is Bob&apos;s father in law) barber shop was at one time right there across the alley from his house to the east. Bob additionally mentioned that at even another time Mr. Chapman had a shop over on 17th St.

As to the &apos;new&apos; photo, and not to reveal too much, that big building, more in the background, is of historic value, and a close look and you will see a fairly recently added historical marker. Rhonda deserves all the credit for that one. All beautifully documented on the message boards. Check out on the message boards--------------INDUSTRY-----Orinoco Furniture Company.

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO THE WATER TOWER
THE SOLUTION TO THIS NEXT PICTURE ACCORDING TO ME IS AS FOLLOWS
SECOND PICTURE IS PEARL&apos;S CAFE AND ARVIN&apos;S BLDG 

Elm Street begins
Pennsylvania&amp;Big Four Rail Road crosses
Orinoco Avenue ends

1702 Pedrick&amp;Company Inc. (Plumbers)
1710 Arvin Industries (Orinoco Plant)

THE CAFE WAS CALLED PEARLS CAFE
THOSE WHO REMEMBER PEARL GREENLEE WAS CLIFF GREENLEE&apos;S MOTHER
ACROSS THE STREET IS WHERE ARVINS BUILDING THEN THEY HAD SEVERAL AROUND TOWN
JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE ARVINS WAS PEDRICK&apos;S PLUMBING
PEDRICK WAS THE PERSON WHO UNDERTOOK THE EXPERIMENTAL TANNING PROCESS THAT I MENTIONED IN ANOTHER POSTING IN THE MOONEY TANNERY SECTION
FURTHER TO THE LEFT WERE THE RAILROAD TRACKS FOLLOWING WEST ACROSS THE TRACKS WAS STEWART&apos;S BARBER SHOP AND NEXT TO THAT WAS OWEN&apos;S MARKET

PEARL&apos;S CAFE WAS ON ORINOCO WHICH WAS AN ANGLE STREET THAT MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN TWO BLOCKS LONG. ORINOCO WENT BACK TO 16TH STREET, ACROSS THE TRACKS AND BACK WEST THE GREENLEE FAMILY LIVED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GREENLEE&apos;S WAS THE BRIERLY FAMILY. GENE BRIERLY HAD SAP&apos;S DELI-BAKERY ON WASHINGTON ST AND LATER GENE&apos;S RESTUARANT IN EASTBROOK PLAZA
I WAS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH HIS DAUGHTER SHARON AND THERE WERE TWO YOUNGER TWIN SISTERS.
MY MOTHER AND PEARL AND BILLIE SHRADER AND IM NOT SURE WHO THE 4TH WAS, PLAYED BRIDGE REGULARLY THEY ALSO BOWLED TOGETHER AT THE BOWLING ALLEY ON 4TH STREET DOWNTOWN.
CLIFF AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER JERRY WERE BOTH GOLFERS
CLIFF&apos;S SON ADAM WAS THE QUARTERBACK ON THE &apos;89 TEAM THAT WAS RECOGNIZED ALONG WITH THE &apos;59 TEAM THE NIGHT THE FOOTBALL FIELD WAS NAMED FOR COACH ANDRESS.
I HOPE NO ONE IS OFFENDED BY MY NAME DROPPING MY PURPOSE IS TO MAYBE GET MORE PEOPLE TO ADD TO THE HISTORY.

I WAS READING THIS BY RER AND THOUGHT I WOULD ADD MY TWO CENTS WORTH TO IT
I NOW KNOW WHY I COULDNT FIND THOSE GOLF BALLS BE CAUSE RER BEAT ME TO THEM. HAWCREEK WAS A HAANGOUT FOR ME SOMETIMES, IN THE 60S WHEN I WAS WORKING AT THE BANK I PLAYED A LOT OF GOLF AT THE CITY COURSE.
MARSHALL SHARP WAS THERE WHEN I WAS SNEAKING ON THE COURSE AT HOLE NUMBER TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 17TH FROM THE CLUB HOUSE PLAY A COUPLE OF HOLES BEFORE WE GOT CAUGHT THAT WAS IN THE EARLY 50S. WHEN I PLAYED THERE IN THE 60S I WAS THE CLUB TREASURER FOR A FEW YEARS.
MARSHALL SOLD ME MY FIRST SET OF BEN HOGAN CLUBS AND GAVE ME A FEW LESSONS. MARSHALL HAD DECIDED TO TAKE OUT MOST OF THE TRAPS TO HELP SPEED UP PLAY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A WISE DESCISION FOR THE COURSE.
THE COURSE HAD PROBLEMS BECAUSE MOST OF THE FEES ALWAYS HAD TO BE USED TO REPAIR THE BRIDGE AT THE 8TH TEE.
DURING THAT TIME THE MAJORITY OF THE BOARD DECIDED TO LET MARSHALL GO. THE BOARD HIRED ANOTHER PRO
MARSHALL WORKED AT THE HOOSIER SPORTING GOODS STORE AFTER.

 &quot;Hawcreek The Early Income Driver&quot; 

Well, starting in 1950 when we moved to 15th Street there wasn&apos;t many jobs for kids less than double digits in age. The Golf Course (owned and operated by Mr. Sharp) near the hospital was only a couple miles from my house. Walking or biking to Hawcreek and to the Columbus Hospital bridge on 17th was not much of an effort.

As I discovered the beds and banks of Hawcreek from US 31 (near Bob-O-Link) back to Stadler&apos;s Meat Packing Bridge on State Street many golf balls and clubs were found in the creek. I guess I discovered that I could sell the balls to golfers mostly at the Hawcreek Bridge on 17th near the hospital. I sold balls in the very early 1950s for anywhere from 10 cents to 25 cents for an exceptional ball. I found in the woods edging the course layouts; lost balls and in the creek beds many times more. I suspect I had hundreds of recovered creek balls and some from the wooded areas.

The reason most balls ended up in the creeks was that the 8th hole tee off was across Hawcreek and up toward the 17th bridge. I would watch golfers from far away (off the course) hit and splash the creek water and hit more balls until success came about. One time I recall a man that got so upset with his inability to go over the creek he took his clubs and bent the shafts and threw them into high watered (at that time) Hawcreek.

Well, most golfers never tried to retrieve their creek balls. They would either try another ball or place one on the fairway after they walked across the steel bridge that arched across Hawcreek. One year much later the creek flooded and tore the metal bridge down. They replaced it with a rope type swing bridge.

I guess I had this golf ball sales income from 1950 through 1955. I also had a paper route starting in the early 50s. I never went past the State Street Bridge because Stadler&apos;s wasn&apos;t the most pleasant smell in the world and I didn&apos;t care to get near that place and the polluted creek water. Walking the creek beds for several miles was an adventure in itself. Many interesting objects and Indian Arrow heads were found at times. Snakes and I walked in different directions when encountered. I always carried a 2 iron golf club to ward off any snakes or other critters. Sometimes I would see a fox or two and squirrels/rabbits of course.

I understand that in later years the course became a city course and Mr. Sharp I guess retired. In summary Hawcreek provided that income to me when I wasn&apos;t even ten years old. Not only did it provided me the extra money but the fun adventures and the exploring was priceless. I guess I didn&apos;t need a computer game (no computers then) to entertain me, but down to earth good fun as a kid in Columbus.&quot;Our Gang Shows&quot;had nothing over my friends and I. Maybe, there were a lot of educational lessons walking the Hawcreek beds and banks. A lot of thinking and amusement for hours daily in the summer months.

I think that I &apos;covered&apos; the golf ball issue elsewhere on the boards with Bob/RER, and when I found them in our pasture along Hawcreek was NOT enterprising enough to &apos;cash them in.&apos; 

Jack, you mentioned---------Marshall and Herb Sharp........am thinking that they are older, by some, than I am, and grew up in a house on the west side of Cottage, south of 7th St. IF I have the right family-------------there were actually several kids, boys all, I think, in the family, and their mom would stand on their front porch and called their names in order, often stopping at the one that she wanted at home. Again IF, this is the right family, they had a &apos;red colored dog, with a white tip on its tail,&apos; named &apos;Tippy,&apos; and neighborhood rumor amongst the little kids had it that the dog was part fox----------------and we all high-tailed for home if Tippy was out roaming the neighborhood.

I only tell that, on the off chance that a Sharp family member might read the boards, and find that little &apos;tale&apos; of family interest.

I had to laugh several times today when Nanc and Jack were referring to their experiences at the now City Golf Course (Hawcreek) back in the early 1950s. Well, I guess you had to get up pretty early to beat me to the creek and course woods. I went there in the summer early after my Courier Journal paper route that included all the houses back from the 17th Street bridge, Bob-O-Link entrance rack and all the houses in that whole area. After my morning golf ball searches I would go to Donner Park, downtown Washington Street areas, just stay home or maybe go fishing at Clifty Creek. I had some regular golf ball customers and they would call me at home and meet me for sales at the 17th Street bridge at times.

If I hadn&apos;t beat Jack to the course, I suppose my income wouldn&apos;t have been as good. (laughing) Further, if I had see Nanc on her horse she might have asked me what I was doing in the creek beds picking up goff balls and creek disposed clubs. This might have given her the idea of sales. (laughing here). It is entertaining to mesh and combine these three stories of the Hawcreek experiences and the golf course.

I do remember seeing a horse or two at times, but didn&apos;t have a clue that 50-58 years later we would be talking about Jack, Bob and Nanc at the same areas. Sorry, my friends but my &quot;S&quot;Corporation business (smiling)was already established and running well. (laughing again) Between, the money from my paper route and selling golf balls I could go to Donner Pool and buy a few candy bars and cokes at times and even take in a movie at the Crump, Mode or Rio. Thanks for your memories and the merge of all these experiences at a time we didn&apos;t even know each other.

Post by jdhinkle on Feb 13, 2008, 3:57pm

I DECIDED TO ADD MY LITTLE MEMORY NOTES HERE IN HOPES IT WILL INSPIRE OTHERS TO ADD THEIR MEMORIES. AFTER I READ THIS OVER IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS ABOUT ME WHICH IT IS BUT ITS MORE ABOUT MY BEING PROU TO HAVE GROWN UP IN COLUMBUS

MY MEMORIES START IN 1947, I ATTENDED KINDERGARTEN AT MCKINLEY IN THE MORNINGS. AFTER SCHOOL I WALKED TO 2327 CALIFORNIA TO MY BABY SITTER&apos;S HOUSE. I REMEMBER WALKING UP HOME AVENUE WITH SUCH FOLKS AS VIRGINIA VAN NORMAN THE BUTLER GIRLS LINDA AND JANE AND ANOTHER NAME FROM THE PAST JACK QUERY(SP).
I REMEMBER WE WEREN&apos;T POOR BUT WE JUST DIDNT HAVE ANY MONEY. MEMORIES INCLUDE WE GOT 1952 CHEVY IN 1955, A 1955 CHEVY IN 1958. WE GOT OUT FIRST NEW TV IN 1955 UNTIL THE WE HAD A 12 INCH ARVIN CONSOLE IT HAD THE BEST LOOKING SNOW BACKGROUND.
I HAD TWO OLDER BROTHERS RONNIE AND JERRY AND I THEREFORE KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND BECAUSE OF TAGGING ALONG WITH MY BROTHERS AND THEIR FRIENDS. SINCE MY MOTHER AN FATHER WERE DIVORCED SO MY MOM WORKED. I TENDED TO PLAY A LOT IN THE OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH CONSISTED OF MCKINLEY SCHOOL, DONNER PARK AND POOL, THE RAILROAD TRACKS WERE JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY AND LATER I EXPLORED THE WILDS OF THE HAWCREEK AROUND THE CITY GOLF COURSE.
THE NICE THING ABOUT COLUMBUS WAS IT WAS SMALL SO SINCE WE DIDNT HAVE A CAR UNTIL 1955 WE HAD TO WALK EVERYWHERE.
I LIVED ON THE CORNER OF 18TH AND CALIFORNIA ST WHICH WAS A GOOD CENTRAL LOCATION FOR EVERYTHING.
DURING THE FIFTIES I WENT TO SCHOOL AT MCKINLEY AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING LOTS OF IMPORTANT COLUMBUS PEOPLE.
THE COLUMBUS PARKS SYSTEM WAS A GOOD PART OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I LIKED PLAYING ALL SPORTS AND GAMES.
IN THE EARLY 50&apos;S I WENT TO LINCOLN PARK WITH MY BROTHER JERRY TO WATCH HIM PRACTICE FOR HIS MIDGET LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM. I WAS SITTING ON THE BENCH WATCHING AND JERRY&apos;S COACH ASKED WHO WANTED TO VOLUNTEER TO BE THE CATCHER. I LOOKED AROUND AND NOBODY SAID ANYTHING SO I RAISED MY HAND AND THE COACH SAID TO PUT ON THE GEAR. AND THATS HOW MY SPORTS CAREER STARTED.
FOR THE REST OF THE DECADE I PLAYED BASEBALL FROM MIDGETS THRU HIGH SCHOOL AND FINALLY ON THE AMERICAN LEGION POST TEAM.
MY SUMMERS WERE BUSY BETWEEN BASEBALL, TETHERBALL AND SWIMMING WITH A SATURDAY JAUNT DOWNTOWN TO THE MOVIES AT THE RIO THEATER . I REMEMBER IT WAS 17 CENTS ADMISSION BOTH POPCORN AND CUP OF COKE WAS A NICKEL EACH.
MY SCHEDULE WAS PRETTY FULL. ALTHOUGH I DID FIND TIME TO EXPLORE RAILROAD CARS, PLAY IN A COAL PILE OR TWO AND HANG OUT AT HAWCREEK.
DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF DONNER POOL I WAS ABLE KNOW AND COMPETE WITH SOME OF THE BEST SWIMMERS COLUMBUS HAS EVER KNOWN. I HAD STATED ONCE THAT I WAS ON THE UNDEFEATED FOOTBALL TEAM IN 1959 I ALSO WAS ON THE SWIMMING TEAM THAT WON THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP THAT YEAR.
I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT I WAS A MORAL CONTRIBUTER BUT NOT VERY GOOD COMPARED TO THE OTHERS ON THE TEAM. IALWAYS MADE THE COMMENT THAT WHEN I WAS A SENIOR AND I THINK JOE SHEEHY WAS IN THE 7TH OR 8TH GRADE HE BEAT ME REGULARLY IN 100 FREESTYLE
I CAN STILL REMEMBER GOING TO LAKESIDE IN LOUISVILLE WITH CLAUDE AND WAYNE THOMPSON AS WELL AS JOE BOVA AND KEN MCDERMOTT. I ALSO REMEMBER SWIMMING WITH CHARLIE SCHUETTE WHEN HE WAS TEACHING HIMSELF THE BUTTERFLY STROKE.
AS I MOVED THRU THE BASEBALL SEASONS I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH MAX ZIEGLER. HE WAS SPECIAL IN MY LIFE BECAUSE HE WAS A BETTER CATCHER AND BATTER THAN ME AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A PITCHER. BECAUSE CATCHERS WERE HARD TO COME BY I HAD TO CATCH RATHER THAN PITCH SO MAX WAS MY SAVIOR.
MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY KNOW THAT WHEN THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL OPENED THE OLD HIGH SCHOOL BECAME THE CENTRAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS ALL THE 8TH GRADERS AT THE VARIOUS SURROUNDING SCHOOLS WERE TO COME TOGETHER AS ONE. FOR ME THIS A SMALL PROBLEM BECAUSE I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE THE BASKETBALL TEAM. THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THIS WAS THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT I MET UP WITH GRAHAM UPDIKE. YOU ALL WOULD REMEMBER HE WAS THE STAR RUNNING BACK FOR THE UNDEFEATED TEAM. WE SPENT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AS IF WE WERE BROTHERS. WE ARE STILL REGULARLY IN TOUCH.
DURING MY GROWING YEARS WE WENT TO SEE THE COLUMBUS MERCHANTS PLAY AT THE 8TH STREET BALL PARK. THE LAST YEAR BIRD WELMER WAS THE MANAGER SOME PEOPLE MAY REMEMBER THE CONCESSION STAND. MAYBE SOME REMEMBER ME AS ONE OF CONCESSIONEERS. BIRD WOULD COME PICK ME UP AND WE WOULD GET THERE EARLY AND GET THE ICE IN THE BINS AND POP THE POPCORN TO GET READY FOR THE GAME. I KNOW PEOPLE PROBABLY REMEMBER THE WRITE UP JULIAN PEIRCFIELD DID ON THE MERCHANTS.
THAT REALLY BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES. ONE HIGH LITE I REMEMBER I GOT A BASE HIT OFF OF BILL SMITH WHEN I PLAYED ON THE AMERICAN LEGION TEAM.

SINCE WE DIDNT HAVE A CAR MY GRANDPAS CAR WAS OUR MODE OF TRANSPORTATION AROUND TOWN. HE ALWAYS HAD A CHRYSLER HE HAD ONE OF THOSE THAT YOU COULD DRIVE IN AUTOMATIC OR STICK SHIFT.
OF COURSE WE KIDS OF THE 50S WERE THERE FOR THE CLASSIC CAR TIMES. THE 55 FORDS AND CHEVYS THE 57 CHEVY AND THE INTODUCTIONS OF THE CORVETTES AND THUNDERBIRD.
A BIG YEAR FOR ME WAS 1959 DURING THAT SUMMER I GOT TO GO TO THE FELLOWSHIP OF CHRISTIAN ATHLETES ANNUAL TRIP. WE WENT TO LAKE GENEVA WISCONSIN. I GOT TO CENTER THE BALL TO FRAN TARKINGTON AND FOULED OFF A COUPLE OF BOB FELLER&apos;S SLOW BALLS. PAUL DIETZEL WAS HOT AT LSU AND TOM LANDRY WAS ONE OF THE FEATURED SPEAKERS. FROM THERE WE STOPPED IN CHICAGO AND ATTENDED THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR GAME WHICH WAS THE FORERUNNER TO THE SUPERBOWL.
FOR A GUY WHO HADN&apos;T BEEN OUT OF TOWN BEFORE IT WAS QUITE A SUMMER.
THEN TO TOP THAT WAS BACK TO MY SENIOR YEAR AT COLUMBUS HIGH AND THE YEAR WAS 1959... Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by jdhinkle on Apr 11, 2008, 9:48am

ALTHOUGH I WAS A CITY BOY FOR THE MOST PART I DID HAVE SOME FARM EXPOSURE IN THE 50&apos;S.
MY GREAT UNCLE MELVIN CRIPPEN HAD A FARM EIEIO.
HIS FARM WAS NEXT TO THE CRUMP ESTATE ON MARR ROAD
I REMEMBER FOLLOWING UNCLE MELVIN AROUND DURING THE DAY AND WATCH HIM MILK THE
COWS. I REMEMBER BOSSY AND CHERRY WERE TWO OF THEM.
AFTER MILKING A COW HE WOULD TAKE THE SHINY BUCKET OF MILK ACROSS THE BARNYARD TO THE PUMP HOUSE HERE HE WOULD PROCESS IT.
HE WOULD PUT SOME IN THE GLASS BOTTLES TO USE IN THE HOUSE.
THE REST WOULD BE POURED INTO THOSE MILK CANS THAT NOW A DAYS ARE USED TO HOLD
UMBRELLAS. HE KEPT THOSE CANS IN A BARREL OF COLD WATER UNTIL THEY WERE FULL.
THEN HE WOULD LOAD THEM IN THE FORD PICKUP AND WE WENT DOWN TO THOMPSON&apos;S DAIRY TO UN LOAD THEM. IT WAS QUITE A EXPERIENCE FOR A 10 YEAR OLD TO WATCH THAT OPERATION. YES HE LET ME MILK ONE OF THE COWS A FEW TIMES BUT MOSTLY I TRIED TO KEEP OUT OUT OF THE KICKING RANGE OF BOSSY.
ALL IN ALL I THINK I WAS A BETTER CITY BOY I WAS A LITTLE INTIMIDATED BY COWS AND CHICKENS.

BY THE WAY I RECEIVED THE TWO RECORDINGS FROM DAVE SUBLETTE THE OTHER DAY.
WHEN I LISTENED I FOUND THAT MY SHORT SPEECH WAS A LITTLE LACKING.
THE VOICES OF COACHES STEARMAN, ANDRESS AND BARROWS BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES.
DO YOU REMEMBER LARRY HOUCHINS HE SANG ON THERE.
WHEN I LISTENED TO THE 59 RECORD IT WAS NARRATED BY ROGER CALLAHAN. THERE WAS A LITTLE SKIT ON IT WITH LARRY DAVIS AND JANEY COPPOCK. MOST PEOPLE KNOW LARRY DIED IN A PLANE CRASH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
I REMEMBER A WILD RIDE WITH LARRY IN HIS BLUE THUNDERBIRD, WHEN HE DROVE ME BACK TO COLUMBUS FROM BLOOMINGTON BACK IN 1961

I RECEIVED AN E MAIL FROM RICHARD ABOUT THE DEATH OF JUSTIN KING THIS BROUGHT SOME GREAT MEMORIES OF MINE DURING THE FIFTIES.
FIRST I REMEMBER TRAVELING TO INDIANAPOLIS TO THE 16TH STREET SPEEDWAY ACROSS FROM &apos;THE SPEEDWAY &apos; THAT WAS WHERE JUSTIN DID SOME RACING.
TO THIS I WOULD ADD THAT BEING A YOUNGSTER IN COLUMBUS THE INFLUENCE FROM CUMMINS,ARVINS AND HAMILTONS WAS VERY POSITIVE IT ALSO ALLOWED US TO ENJOY A SATURDAY AT THE RIVERSIDE AMUSEMENT PARK A FREE RUN OF THE PARK PROVIDED BY THE CORPORATIONS TO ALL FAMILIES AND RELATIVES. OF COURSE THIS WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE KINGS ISLAND CAME INTO EXISTENCE.
THE FUN OF RIDING TO DOGEMS AND THEN RACING TO THE EXIT TO GET IN LINE TO TRY TO RIDE AGAIN
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A PONY RIDE ACROSS FROM THE ENTRANCE AS WELL AS LITTLE RAIL CARS FOR US YOUNGENS. THE MILL SHUTE THE MOTORBOATS THE ROLERCOATERS AND THE FUNHOUSE. THEM WAS THE GOOD OLE DAYS Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

THERE WAS ONLY ONE BOWLING ALLEY ON 4TH STREET THAT SERVED EVERYONE WITH 8 LANES
OVER THE NEXT YEARS THERE WERE THREE AND THEY ALL THRIVED
I REMEMBER WATCHING MOM BOWL AND REMEMBER NORMA BRODFEUER AND HELEN STONER WERE AMONG THE BEST IN THE LEAGUES THEN. I HELP MOM FIGURE THE AVERAGES FROM WEEK TO WEEK.
I ALSO WATCH DAVE SCOTT BOWL TWO 800 SERIES IN A THREE WEEK PERIOD

 This &apos;quote&apos; comes from the 1950s thread, page 1, and back when I was just a &apos;guest.&apos; And over two years ago!!!!!!

 Quoting from that post:
1950s--Pioneer Days. As I recall, and feel free to correct my&quot;dating&quot;of the event, took place on or near Columbus Day, mid-October. Washington Street was closed and booths set up by civic organizations. Seems the event went on for several days, perhaps a weekend, just guessing on that one.

My dad was responsible for the&quot;game&quot;for one booth, either sponsored by the Lion&apos;s Club or the Saddle Club , and I don&apos;t remember which. AND am sure that the SPCA would never approve the&quot;game&quot;now, and the protests would have been many. Remember how you could throw ping-pong balls into bowls and win a gold fish? Same idea, except you threw an embrodiery (sp.) hoop to attempt to&quot;ring&quot;a duck, a duck that you could take home for keeps!!!! (Hey, Bob, Barkhimer, that is, is that how you got Rudolph? ;-) This crazy&quot;game&quot;became the hit on the street, and everyone was carrying around a duck they had won. So popular was this booth, that soon they ran out of ducks. My dad was out and about searching the farms for more ducks for the booth. A trek he made numerous times to restock! Think he must have hit every farm around to supply the booth. 

Buried deep within the boxes of treasure my mom has saved, I found this photo.

 

In identifying, can&apos;t do much------lady in light coat with one big button, may be Rose McKain. On the right by the D in the sign, a man with a cowboy hat, may well be Ralph Talkington, and the lady just to his right, I think, his wife, Edna.

Note the sign for Pony Rides. And the lady on the right with goldfish and bowl in hand.

As I sort through the many bits and scraps of papers, etc. that my mom has saved, well, I never cease to be amazed. And in the same breath, finding a treasure does make a &apos;bad day&apos; turn into something special.............

 Total net for the stand and pony rides: $ 1089.07 

Just my comments and observations from the above accounting. One------I did remember that the &apos;Win a Duck&apos; Saddle Club booth was SO popular that there was a lot of scurrying around to provide enough ducks. Two-------------seemed to me that the Trail Blazers that &apos;sold the pony rides&apos; made a significant contribution to the proceeds. Anyone remember what we charged per ride----------in 1951 &apos;money&apos; it could not been too much, and perhaps why I remember being really pooped after my stint leading my horse around.

This was surely a trip down Memory Lane for me.

Jack:

Great job and research on the 16th Street layout! You win the prize of the word &quot;Fantastic&quot; . You sure knew your way around that area for sure. The only thing I can add is I rode my bike and walked those walks many times to and from 15th Street to Washington Street areas. The Chapman Barber Shop was the chair I was getting my haircut in 1956 when the radio announcement came on. Then shortly after that in 1956 I would get all my haircuts at Brumy&apos;s Barber Shop, addresss 301 Washington Street. Dave Brumfield&apos;s dad gave great flattops during that period. Also, at Brumy&apos;s Marion Smith gave great shoe shines for that date later if you weren&apos;t wearing tennis shoes. LOL

Not far from that 16th Street a few blocks behind Dr. Bruce Hart&apos;s house was Morgan Packing Plant. Normally, either walking or riding my bike I would go from the house down 17th Street to Donner Park and sometimes from Donner Park to the downtown areas, but return many times down old 16th toward home on 15th Street past the hospital area. Good memory Jack keep on &apos;trucking&apos; my friend.

LATER THAT DECADE DICK THE BRUISER CAME INTO FAME

 



I MET DICK AT THE STANDARD STATION AT 31 AND WASHINGTON ST
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT GRUFF VOICE WAS FAKE UNTIL A MET HIM

 
 
 

 Dick the Bruiser: I remember watching The Bruiser rassle on WTTV Channel 4 in the 1960&apos;s. I was riding shotgun with a friend of mine back in high school. It was dark out and we were (if I remember correctly), stopped at 10th and Gladstone. This was before the city changed that part of town and rerouted the east west streets. Anyway, Jack and I were stopped there for some reason and this BIG caddy pulls up next to us and the guy rolls the window down. He asked us how to get to the Boy&apos;s Club. Although it was dark out and we couldn&apos;t quite see the driver, we knew immediately who it was from the voice.

I think I might have mentioned this before, but Dick&apos;s unmistakable voice was from a throat injury while playing professional football. I know the information&apos;s on the What Columbus Indiana Watched On TV webpage. I&apos;ll have to go back and refer to it again.

I looked for old clips of Dick The Bruiser on YouTube a few months back, but all they had were matches from the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s. I was hoping to find some that had Chuck Marlowe interviewing him. However, Dick lived in Indianapolis, and there was an interview with both he and his wife at his Indy home. It looks like whoever put it on has taken it off. I think the interview was 1985.

All those names I remember during the early black and white television. Our family and friends would rotate houses each week to watch all these guys. Dick the Bruiser and all the other names were a big events for each week. Now, I recall it started looking a little phony even at my young age, but we all kept watching the matches. David I think you are right on the Chesty Potato Chip commercials. I never have been to a live match. Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s

AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN COLUMBUS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE 40S AND 50S
WAS A PLACE CALLED THE 8TH STREET BALL PARK

I KNOW IT WAS THE HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELD BRFORE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT IT WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR OTHER TIMES AND EVENTS

THE COLUMBUS MERCHANTS BASE BALL TEAM USED IT
I REMEMBER GOING TO A SEMI PRO FOOTBALL GAME THERE

THE YEAR THE CUMMINS DEISEL RACE CAR WON THE POLE POSITION 1952
THEY DISPLAYED THE CAR THERE

WHEN I WAS A CUB SCOUT WE HAD A JAMBOREE THERE ONE YEAR

 


I ADDED A PICTURE OF THE GRANDSTAND THAT WAS MAINLY FOR THE BASEBALL GAMES

ANOTHER SUBJECT I THOUGHT WOULD BE A GOOD MEMORY IN GROWING UP IN COLUMBUS
WAS THE NEARNESS AND INFLUENCE INDIANAPOLIS HAD ON OUR LIVES,

BACK IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS SPECIAL TO GET TO GO TO INDIANAPOLIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

ONE WAS THE FREE DAY AT RIVERSIDE AMUSEMENT PARK
BECAUSE MY MOM, AUNT, UNCLE ALL WORKED FOR THE MAJOR COMPANIES WE GOT TO GO THERE EVERY SUMMER FOR JUST A STAMP ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND
I REMEMBER MANY OF THE RIDES PLUS JUST OUTSIDE THE FRONT ENTRANCE THEY HAD A PONY RIDE AND A LITTLE SCOOTER RAIL RIDE WHERE YOU WOULD RIDE AROUND ON TRACK BY PEDALLING WITH YOUR HANDS

OF COURSE THE DOGEMS WERE POPULAR WE WOULD RUN TO GET IN A CAR TAKE A RIDE AND THEN RACE TO THE EXIT TO GET IN LINE AGAIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO RIDE TWICE IN A ROW.
THE ROLLERCOASTER AND THE FLASH ALONG WITH THE MILL CHUTE WERE VERY POPULAR ALSO
THE ONE RIDE THAT INTREGED ME WAS THE ONE WITH THE ROUND UNITS THAT YOU WOULD SIT IN FACING ANOTHER PERSON AND AS IT WENT AROUND YOU WOULD MAKE IT ROLL HEAD OVER HEALS

GREAT MEMORIES FOR YOUNG KIDS Re: Columbus Indiana In The 1950&apos;s 
Post by nancs on Aug 21, 2009, 10:13am

I am posting this along with Jack&apos;s &apos;Indianapolis&apos; memories, altho&apos; my memories would lean more toward the 40s.

Yes, for sure, a trip to Indianapolis in my youth, late 30s through very early 50s, was a BIG, BIG deal.

I remember one trip, was to take my &apos;baby doll&apos; to the doll hospital for &apos;repairs.&apos; It was a cold winter day, Mom had my doll just tucked under her arm, no blanket, maybe some clothes, and that was it. Now this baby doll, which I do still have sitting in my dad&apos;s little rocker in my living room, truly did look like a baby. I can so remember the stares my mom got, and one woman actually stopping us, being somewhere in the vicinity of the Circle, and telling Mom, &apos;That is NO way to treat a baby in this weather.&apos; Explanation followed.

The department stores----------Block&apos;s being one that I recall............and the elevators. For the young folks reading these boards--------------the elevators &apos;back in the day,&apos; had an operator. Usually, as I remember, a smartly dressed lady in a uniform. To announce the elevator she would click a little gadget, say, &apos;Going up. Ladies wear, lingerie, children&apos;s department, shoes, etc.&apos; Today, when I &apos;note&apos; the right age group about to board our self serve elevators-----------I sometimes make a clicking sound, announce, &apos;Going up, etc.&apos; That is always bound to bring a smile to someone&apos;s face, followed by conversation as we &apos;go up,&apos; and has been a good day brightener, particularly when I &apos;pull that&apos; in a hospital. Try it some time. generates some smiles.

More in my junior high and early high school days---------------one trip to Indianapolis was to purchase me a pair of white bucks and a &apos;bunny bag.&apos; Seems that in Columbus, they simply didn&apos;t have, or were out of my size. That was a really exciting trip for me.

When I was a freshman at CHS, Columbus played Southport, a traveling game for us. My cousins lived in Southport, so this was quite a deal to get to go to an out of town game. My folks took my friends and me to that game, and the neat part------------I was allowed to stay til Sunday with my aunt and uncle, and my two older boy cousins, who were like the brothers/siblings I did not have. Just too, too cool. Back my folks and friends went to Columbus, and I got to go to Southport&apos;s after game sock hop with my cousin, a tall blonde good looking senior...........................Now that was the cat&apos;s meow, and something really special.

That same weekend, and something I had never done before-------------my cousin and I rode the bus into Indianapolis-----------that being a big deal, as I had only ever ridden the local Columbus busses-----destination to go to the movies at a theater on the Circle------------with all of its many bright lights. Name of the movie escapes me, but about some women going west in covered wagons. The other movie that I recall seeing, with my parents-----as a little girl, heaven forbid-------------I believe it was called &apos;The Outlaw&apos; with Jane Russell, as the star. This was the &apos;uncut&apos; version, something that would be a &apos;nothing now,&apos; but &apos;quite out of line in the late 40s. too sexy for back then.&apos;

Who else has memories, David is right, don&apos;t leave it to someone else to post a memory, you add one.

 Graham Motor Company, Inc. 1950s 
 Later renamed to Graham/Todd Motors 

 

 Brief: Dynaflow was the trademark name for a type of automatic transmission developed and built by General Motors&apos; Buick Motor Division from the late 1940s to the mid 1960s. The Dynaflow, which was introduced for the 1948 model year only as an option on Roadmaster models, received some severe early testing in the M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, which were built in Buick&apos;s Flint, Michigan assembly plant during World War II.

The Dynaflow was an inherently inefficient design due to its sole reliance on the torque converter in normal driving. .

In 1953 Buick redesigned the Dynaflow, calling it the Twin Turbine Dynaflow. The converter now incorporated two turbines but only a single stator, which resulted in better efficiency, especially at highway speeds, as well as a higher level of performance. Buick also incorporated a variable-pitch stator in 1955 for greater flexibility. While these changes improved the transmission&apos;s overall performance and efficiency, the Dynaflow still was no match for other designs that utilized three element converters with automatic shifting.

In 1964, the Dynaflow was discontinued

The photo of the old strip center and the newer building was located not far from McKinley School. My GrandMother would go to the Grocery located in the old center. ( She liked the Monarch canned goods. ) The newer building housed a variety/ pharmacy store.
I believe the grocery was named Parker&apos;s Grocery. ( There was also a Parker&apos;s Drug Store at 4th. and Washington. )

marksix, nanc and george, thank you all.

thanks to marksix, I did find it in and around Edinburgh, but once it hit the Atterbury boundary, it disappeared. I know that Richard picked up the old interurban track line from Google maps or Google earth, but given what Atterbury has done to the land in and around that area, it&apos;s probably hopeless to even attempt to catch a glimpse of the old road.

I guess I&apos;ll have to go up to the Antique Mall in Edinburgh and pick up a pre-1942 state map(?)

I may be repeating since i haven&apos;t read everything, but one great memory is the old Murphy&apos;s (woolworth, aka little dime store)downtown at Christmas. When you walked in the door they had a display of santa over the stairs. It was animated and he was shaking his finger at a little girl and boy in their PJ&apos;s and they were nodding their heads up and down.
Remember how the hardwood floors squeaked from people walking around and the sounds of candy being poured onto the scales when it was being sold? Those glass candy displays were beautiful. Oh and the roaster with the peanuts! Yum! Re: 1950-1959 Life In Columbus/Bartholomew County

Being 71 sure memory is much older. Forget things easily. Example, what year moved from Mount Vernon, Indiana.
Seems after school year ended in 1955. Found my photo in 1955
year book at Mount Vernon. Not in 1956.
Sure attended last year at 7th. St. and first at Columbus Senior high.
First thing was the smells from the Tannery and Stadlers. Living on 3rd St. half way between the two places. Gave us a front row
sample of both.
Remember hated leaving a bunch of good fellows and dear friends. And losing my best girl. The Ohio river. She was my friend and playground.
Leaving Mount Vernon left the odor of the Hominy Mill and the ditch. The ditch was a parting line between rich and poor there.
It had a very strong aroma of sewage.
A visit this summer revealed as in Columbus, town had changed and grown.
Columbus;
Great finds. Columbus had a skating ring and Donner pool. And.
7th. gym had a pool. Recall swim coach was quick to grab me for the swim team. Swimming the Ohio was what we did on hot summer days. He soon became disenchanted with me. Could swim for hours but had no interest in getting in a hurry about it.
Band room was it another building. Could get outside for a while
going to practice.
New school was big but not homey as was 7th, street.
Someone here mentioned G.C. Murphy. Began working there while attending 7th. St.
Loved the smells. Always able to con the gals out of candy and peanuts. Earned $.65 per hour. WoW. Big money.
Always stopped by the Greeks before walking home. Learned while in Mount Vernon the Greeks there were related to Zaharakos in Colmbus. More later. Machine has a problem.
