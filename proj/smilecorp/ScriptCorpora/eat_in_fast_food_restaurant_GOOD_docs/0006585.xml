Are you a member here just to have these endless
discussions?
You have made your point. It&apos;s all a joke according to you.
Then why discuss it at all here.
There are plenty threads where you can dicuss things
with smart people, what a waste of time to
discuss here if you think it&apos;s all BS.
I know I am a lunatic, but I stick to this thread and
I am not bothering people elsewhere.
(really folks, this one is getting a bit eh...err...errr
how can I put it politely......errr.....eeerrrr......)

I thought I just maintained it wasn&apos;t a joke and have apologised for initially making a jokey comment.

I don&apos;t think it&apos;s all BS, but surely you don&apos;t want people to accept what you say without any questioning whatsoever? I brought up some valid questions about your interpretations which you still haven&apos;t answered.

I do not think you&apos;re a lunatic, I think you truly believe what you post here, and have done some substantial study into the backgrounds of these stories, but does that mean I can&apos;t ask questions?

DETROIT (AP)Miguel Cabrera and the Detroit Tigers have reached a preliminary agreement on a $152.3 million, eight-year contract, according a personal familiar with the deal.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract was not yet final. The third baseman must pass a physical before the agreement can be finalized.

Cabreras average salary of $19,037,500 will be the fourth-highest in the major leagues behind Alex Rodriguez ($27.5 million), Johan Santana ($22,916,667) and Manny Ramirez ($20 million).

Detroit acquired Cabrera from the Florida Marlins during the winter meetings along with pitcher Dontrelle Willis.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (UPI) -- A 22-year-old woman&apos;s Egyptian theme won The Washington Post&apos;s Sunday Source diorama contest involving peeps candies this year.

The Post said its annual contest drew 800 submissions, but when the dust cleared and the yellow, sugar-coated marshmallow candies began to harden&quot;The Tomb of King Peepankhamun&quot;was declared the winner.

Created by Laura Sillers,&quot;Peepankhamun&quot;used peeps and various household items to create a diorama inspired by the ancient Egyptian tombs.

She told the Post she was inspired to create the unusual art, which included peep-inspired hieroglyphics, by a recent museum visit.

&quot;I&apos;d been to a really great Egyptian art museum in Chicago a couple months ago, and it just seemed like fun, a good possibility for drama and lighting,&quot;she said.

If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,
Would you hear my voice come thru the music,
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

Its a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken,
Perhaps theyre better left unsung.
I dont know, dont really care
Let there be songs to fill the air.

Ripple in still water,
When there is no pebble tossed,
Nor wind to blow.

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty,
If your cup is full may it be again,
Let it be known there is a fountain,
That was not made by the hands of men.

There is a road, no simple highway,
Between the dawn and the dark of night,
And if you go no one may follow,
That path is for your steps alone.

Ripple in still water,
When there is no pebble tossed,
Nor wind to blow.

But if you fall you fall alone,
If you should stand then whos to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home. krakhead 23-03-2008, 10:35 PM If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine

Vera Susa
Your Agressive manner scared me off this thread a bit,
I Am A Decent Human Being,
Yet You Accused me of being a Schill,
I Am Not A Christian,
That Was Corrupted At The Council Of Nicea,
But I Know The Scriptures,
As Being Part Of The

Masterplan!!!

My Take on The Scripture,
Would be Like The Essenes;

And Jesus answered:&quot;Seek not the law in your scriptures, for the law is life, whereas the scripture is dead. I tell you truly, Moses received not his laws from God in writing, but through the living word.

The law is living word of living God to living prophets for living men. In everything that is life is the law written. You find it in the grass, in the tree, in the river, in the mountain, in the birds of heaven, in the fishes of the sea; but seek it chiefly in yourselves.

For I tell you truly, all living things are nearer to God than the scripture, which is without life.
God so made life and all living things that they might by the everlasting word teach the laws of the true God to man.
God wrote not the laws in the pages of books, but in your heart and in your spirit. They are in your breath, your blood, your bone; in your flesh, your bowels, your eyes, your ears, and in every little part of your body.

They are present in the air, in the water, in the earth, in the plants, in the sunbeams, in the depths and in the heights.

They all speak to you that you may understand the tongue and the will of the living God.

But you shut your eyes that you may not see, and you shut your ears that you may not hear.

I tell you truly, that the scripture is the work of man, but life and all its hosts are the work of our God.
Wherefore do you not listen to the words of God, which are written in His works?

And wherefore do you study the dead scriptures which are the work of the hands of men?&quot;


Now Not Everyone on The Internet Is Thick Skinned,
Some People are very sensitive,
Bear That in mind when you insult People in The Future!!!!

Oh I Have Opened My Message Box,
If You Want To Contact Me!!!

But I Prefer To Do My Buisness In The Open!!!! vera susa 23-03-2008, 11:25 PM I thought I just maintained it wasn&apos;t a joke and have apologised for initially making a jokey comment.

I&apos;m beginning to feel like you don&apos;t like having your (possible) mistakes pointed out.

Ah, here we go, point at the guru who isn&apos;t there, then attack the man for not being holy...old trick!

How many times do I have to repeat that I DON&apos;T,&quot;want people to accept what you say without any questioning whatsoever&quot;, but RATHER, SEARCH OUT the LINKS&amp;LEADS THEMSELVES (there&apos;s a big reminder in the number
of links I post to!), which is what WE ALL DO, then SHARE them for EACH OTHER to EXPOUND ON through their individual perspective and posting style.

Now tintin&quot;seems&quot;an &apos;easy mark&apos; BECAUSE he is so VERY GOOD at cutting complex code to the simple bone, but it would be cheating to imply that
his &apos;easy to read, shorthand&apos; has no sound foundation, as that&apos;s where
you also insult all the other posters, who provide the foundation stumps
and king pins, as if their posts don&apos;t count...besides which, most here
could only dream of the sorts and level of life experience tintin has, on
which to draw (likewise myself, only it would be a nightmare), so we
SHARE our individual views, with those who enjoy being awake.

So yes, if we had a disinformation agency, funding and publicising
this thread, we could have cleverly worded C.V.&apos;s and Biographies
&apos;produced&apos; and distributed to refer people to in the usual, &apos;don&apos;t bother
thinking further&apos;, way. But we simply share our free time freely and leave
our findings for others to pursue further or ignore, as they will.

Genuine questions we happily answer, AND ASK...like for help in
working on CORNWALL!!!! (come on guys, it&apos;s a big one!!!) and
Royal and &apos;Society/Industry&apos; PEDIGREES...but ain&apos;t no one here
setting themselves up as faultless gurus, selling a &apos;product&apos;,
selling a &apos;new religion&apos;, not committing anyone to anything,
as we&apos;ve gone out of our way to stress, too many times...
our calling is simply to draw attention to the elephant in the room,
and let folk decide what to do about it themselves.

We WITNESS the SIGNS of the CHANGING SEASON,
and WARN of it&apos;s LIKELY CHANGE of CONDITION
and man&apos;s RESPONSES to them..and in my case at least,
&quot;so that others may see, He told us from the beginning,
what would be revealed before His return, believe He
exists, do a 180, and LIVE.&quot;

So, what, &apos;Fine&apos; to lead people down the countless
long dead paths running to die in the mausoleum
that is FAITH in the&quot;Moses lead Israel out of &apos;Egypt&apos;&apos;, LIE,
but don&apos;t point to the countless sound reasons folk
SHOULD QUESTION the GREAT CONSPIRACY that PREVENTS
them from SEEING, &apos;EGYPT&apos; is the MOTE in the eye of the
deceived but otherwise righteous brothers...and OZ IS ZION,
yet another PROMISE KEPT BY GOD!

Now being deceived, does not condemn you;
willingly choosing to hide in ignorance, and
knowingly spreading deception...well, not smart, not smart at all! cleopatraxxx 23-03-2008, 11:27 PM While This Thread is Going Through This Interlude!!!

For I tell you truly, all living things are nearer to God than the scripture, which is without life.
God so made life and all living things that they might by the everlasting word teach the laws of the true God to man.
God wrote not the laws in the pages of books, but in your heart and in your spirit. They are in your breath, your blood, your bone; in your flesh, your bowels, your eyes, your ears, and in every little part of your body.

They are present in the air, in the water, in the earth, in the plants, in the sunbeams, in the depths and in the heights.

They all speak to you that you may understand the tongue and the will of the living God.

But you shut your eyes that you may not see, and you shut your ears that you may not hear.

I tell you truly, that the scripture is the work of man, but life and all its hosts are the work of our God.
Wherefore do you not listen to the words of God, which are written in His works?

And wherefore do you study the dead scriptures which are the work of the hands of men?&quot;

I Would Like To Reply To Vera Susa

Vera Susa
Your Agressive manner scared me off this thread a bit,
I Am A Decent Human Being,
Yet You Accused me of being a Schill,
I Am Not A Christian,
That Was Corrupted At The Council Of Nicea,
But I Know The Scriptures,
As Being Part Of The

Masterplan!!!

My Take on The Scripture,
Would be Like The Essenes;

And Jesus answered:&quot;Seek not the law in your scriptures, for the law is life, whereas the scripture is dead. I tell you truly, Moses received not his laws from God in writing, but through the living word.

The law is living word of living God to living prophets for living men. In everything that is life is the law written. You find it in the grass, in the tree, in the river, in the mountain, in the birds of heaven, in the fishes of the sea; but seek it chiefly in yourselves.

For I tell you truly, all living things are nearer to God than the scripture, which is without life.
God so made life and all living things that they might by the everlasting word teach the laws of the true God to man.
God wrote not the laws in the pages of books, but in your heart and in your spirit. They are in your breath, your blood, your bone; in your flesh, your bowels, your eyes, your ears, and in every little part of your body.

They are present in the air, in the water, in the earth, in the plants, in the sunbeams, in the depths and in the heights.

They all speak to you that you may understand the tongue and the will of the living God.

But you shut your eyes that you may not see, and you shut your ears that you may not hear.

I tell you truly, that the scripture is the work of man, but life and all its hosts are the work of our God.
Wherefore do you not listen to the words of God, which are written in His works?

And wherefore do you study the dead scriptures which are the work of the hands of men?&quot;

But cheeb, I&apos;ve seen too many of your posts in other threads,

which I was not going to share in public, but now that you&apos;ve decided
to come out yapping and snapping at me, with a little pack of Benjamin&apos;s whelps, I&apos;ll just remind folk that;
it pays to look for a consistency and integrity of &apos;voice&apos;

Also to watch for those who choose &apos;smooth words&apos; over

But as I often read and write when I&apos;m very tired, it will show

usually apologise for low gear moments as soon as I notice them,
not needing to be prompted, as I did with the moment you use,
to throw out this attempt at convincing folk that God&apos;s Living Word
has retired to leave all to their own vain imaginings and the lies
of educators and writers (DEAD scriptures), exactly what
got the world into this sick state.

No, I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t buy your claim to having feeling hurt,

common ploy for discrediting anyone who is NOT SERVING

It&apos;s mean to yank a toddler by the arm, but not if it&apos;s to
whip them out of the way of a speeding bus, and I simply
do not have the stomach to pander to sneak thieves who
leave behind poison bait.

Theme Lyrics

It&apos;s About Time
by
Gerald Fried
and
Sherwood Schwartz -

It&apos;s About Time


It&apos;s about time,
It&apos;s about space,
About strange people in the strangest place.
It&apos;s about time,
It&apos;s about flight,
Travelin&apos; faster than the speed of light.

About space people and a brave crew,
As through the barrier of time they flew.
Pass the Roman Senators,
Pass an armored knight,
Pass the firing Minutemen,
To this modern site.

It&apos;s about time for you and me
To meet these people of amazing feats.
It&apos;s about two astronauts and how they educate
A pre-historic woman and her pre-historic mate.

It&apos;s about time
It&apos;s about space
About strange people in the strangest place
They will be here
With all of us
Dodging a taxi, a car, a bus.

Where will they go
What will they do
In this strange place where everything is new.
Will they manage to survive
Watch each week and see.
Will they get accustomed to the Twentieth Century.

It&apos;s about time
For our good byes
To all our pre-historic gals and guys.

And now,
It&apos;s About Time
It&apos;s About Time
It&apos;s About Time
It&apos;s About Time! vera susa 24-03-2008, 05:24 AM http://img.verycd.com/posts/0608/post-231969-1155234368.jpg

2007 National Alpaca Fibre Seminar
Alpaca Fleece: the Future
July 28th 2007,
Ballarat, Victoria

The Story

Last year the inaugural
National Alpaca Fibre Seminar
was held in Canberra...
then the REAL CAPITAL got it&apos;s turn!

It simply does not wash, that that
small, provincial City, should have
so many
NATIONAL EVENTS&amp;MONUMENTS,
etc. unless it IS MUCH MORE... emerald 24-03-2008, 10:06 AM 1986 message in bottle drifts 1,735 mi.

SEATTLE - Merle Brandell and his black lab Slapsey were beachcombing along the Bering Sea when he spied a plastic bottle among the Japanese glass floats he often finds along the shore of his tiny Alaskan fishing village. He walked over and saw an envelope tucked inside. After slicing the bottle open, Brandell found a message from an elementary school student in a suburb of Seattle. The fact that the letter traveled 1,735 miles without any help from the U.S. postal service is unusual, but that&apos;s only the beginning of the mystery.

About 21 years passed between the time Emily Hwaung put the message in a soda bottle and Merle Brandell picked it up on the beach.

&quot;This letter is part of our science project to study oceans and learn about people in distant lands,&quot;she wrote.&quot;Please send the date and location of the bottle with your address. I will send you my picture and tell you when and where the bottle was placed in the ocean. Your friend, Emily Hwaung.&quot;

Brandell, 34, a bear hunting guide and manager of a local water plant, said many of the 70-plus residents of Nelson Lagoon were intrigued by his find. Beachcombing is a popular activity in remote western Alaska. Among the recent discoveries was a sail boat that washed onto shore last October.

&quot;It&apos;s kind of a sport. It keeps us occupied. It&apos;s one of the pleasures of living here,&quot;Brandell said of the village reachable only by plane or boat that is too small to have its own store.

He had no idea just how unusual his find was until he tried to track down the sender: a fourth grader from the North City School in the Shoreline School District.

No one answered the phone when Brandell called the school in December so he sent the school district a handwritten letter, which eventually ended up on the desk of district spokesman Craig Degginger.

After some searching, Degginger discovered Emily Hwaung is now a 30-year-old accountant named Emily Shih who now lives in Seattle. She was in the 4th grade during the 1986-87 school year at a school building that closed more than a year ago.

&quot;I&apos;ve been getting a kick out of it for a month now,&quot;Shih said during a recent interview.

She said she was flabbergasted by the news and immediately shared it with her Kirkland co-workers.

&quot;I don&apos;t remember the project. It was so long ago. Elementary school is kind of foggy,&quot;Shih admitted.

The project may have been more memorable if each child had created her own message and personally dropped it in the water, but the letters from Carol Aguayo&apos;s fourth grade class were typed. The students only added their names and signed them, then a friend carried the bottles on his boat and dropped them in the ocean.

&quot;It took away a little of the mystique,&quot;Shih said of the form letter.

She also was a little chagrined by the offer to mail a photo to whomever found the letter and by the environmental implications of dropping plastic bottles in the ocean, and noted that times have changed a lot in 21 years.

&quot;I&apos;ve had a good laugh about that with all my friends,&quot;Shih said.

As she was sharing her story with friends and co-workers, Shih realized how rare it was for a message in a bottle to arrive safely somewhere.

&quot;Many of them had tried to do it themselves, but you never hear of one coming back. The odds are so low that you&apos;ll ever hear back from somebody,&quot;Shih said.&quot;It was just kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing.&quot;

Brandell has a theory about how the bottle ended up on the shore of Nelson Lagoon and how the letter remained so readable after its 21 years in transit. Maybe the bottle didn&apos;t spend those years in the water. It might have blown his way quickly and then remained buried in the mud for years.

It was found among some Japanese floats that took a similar journey many years ago. They don&apos;t really wash ashore. They extrude out of the mud and into the hands of beachcombers, who sell them on eBay or craft jewelry out of them like Brandell&apos;s mother does. vera susa 24-03-2008, 10:24 AM We&apos;ve had the old testament, and the new testament;pretty soon I have a feeling we are all gonna feature in the next testament.

Sir William Du Burgh..

With a lineage stretching back to the great Emperor Charlemagne, the de Burgh&apos;s role in Irish affairs has made an immense impact on the shape of the island&apos;s past. From the first Norman knights who cantered across the seas in the 12th century to the courtrooms of Georgian Dublin, the de Burghs have been intrinsically involved with some of the most pivotal events in Irish history. The Oldtown branch was established in Kildare just over 300 years ago by Thomas Burgh, one of the first great Irish military engineers. His descendents include the Georgian orators Walter Hussey Burgh and John Foster, General Sir Eric de Burgh, the singer Chris de Burgh and the 2003 Miss World, Rosanna Davison. tintin 24-03-2008, 03:51 PM This Chris de Burgh thing is mighty interesting.

Tejano music star Emilio Navaira was hospitalized in critical condition after his tour bus crashed early Sunday in Bellaire, police said.

The Grammy Award-winning Navaira was driving the bus, heading north along the west 610 Loop near the Southwest Freeway, when it crashed into a set of freeway barrels shortly before 5 a.m., police said. Navaira and six others in the bus were taken to area hospitals. The others&apos; conditions weren&apos;t immediately known.

The group performed Saturday night at a Houston night club. Messages left for Navaira&apos;s agent were not returned.

Police blocked all lanes of northbound 610 at the accident site.

Navaira, known simply as Emilio to his fans, is a San Antonio native who has been honored dozens of times by the Tejano Music Awards. He won a Grammy in 2003 for his album Acuerdate.

He started his singing career alongside fellow Tejano music star Selena, who was shot and killed in 1995. emerald 24-03-2008, 08:48 PM Read&amp;grin, folks....
10,000 year old structure found in Canadian lake

In the Spring of 2005, Canadian divers conducting a project in MacDonald Lake at the Haliburton Forest and Wild Life Reserve, came upon an ancient stone structure - 40 feet below the present lake level. Initially the structure was considered to have been ferried by glaciers created during the last ice age, thousands of years ago and dumped where they happened to melt at the end of one of the more recent cold-freezes. Theres been several ice ages in the history of the Earth. Whats commonly called the ice age, is actually the most recent one, which began about two million years ago, and was characterized by cold, and relatively warm phases. Out of that, there have been four major continental glaciations recorded in North America. The last began about 70,000 years ago, and ended about 8,000 BC. At the peak of the last glaciation, approximately 97% of Canada was covered by ice. emerald 24-03-2008, 08:52 PM Root beer kegger attracts cops

KRONENWETTER, Wis., March 24 (UPI) -- A root beer keg party hosted by a Kronenwetter, Wis., high school student attracted police who suspected underage drinking at the shindig.

Dustin Zebro, 18, said the idea for the root beer party was cooked up to mock school administrators who suspended some of his friends from sports after they were caught drinking, the Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald reported Monday.

The party displayed enough similarities to parties with the root beer keg&apos;s alcoholic counterparts that police showed up to administer breath tests to the rowdy high school-age partygoers. However, every reveler tested was found to be free of alcohol.

&quot;We didn&apos;t know it would work well enough to make the cops show up,&quot;Zebro said. The student said he and his friends believe that underage drinking off school grounds is a matter to be handled by police, not school officials.

However, Principal Tom Johansen defended the school&apos;s actions.

&quot;I think we have an obligation as an educational institution&quot;to investigate underage drinking and mete out penalties, he said. emerald 24-03-2008, 08:54 PM Lottery winner back at McDonald&apos;s job

CARDIFF, Wales, March 24 (UPI) -- A Welsh man who won a $2.6 million lottery jackpot has returned to his job at McDonald&apos;s because he missed his co-workers.

Luke Pittard, 25, who quit his job at the Cardiff, Wales, restaurant after he and Emma Cox, 29, his girlfriend as well as co-worker, won the jackpot, said he decided to go back to his old position as staff trainer at McDonald&apos;s after living the rich life for 18 months, The Daily Mail reported Monday.

&quot;They all think I&apos;m a bit mad but I tell them there&apos;s more to life than money,&quot;he said of his co-workers at the fast-food restaurant.&quot;I loved working at McDonald&apos;s before I became a millionaire and I&apos;m really enjoying being back there again.&quot;

&quot;Lots of my old McDonald&apos;s workmates came to our wedding and I had kept in touch with them all the time, so I just thought: &apos;Why not go back?&apos;&quot;Pittard told The Daily Mail.&quot;To be honest, there&apos;s only so much relaxing you can do. I&apos;m only young and a bit of hard work never did anyone any harm.&quot; emerald 24-03-2008, 09:04 PM Cops chase stolen squad car

GARY -- A man who asked a Gary police officer for a ride to a bus station Friday afternoon ended up stealing his squad car and leading police on a chase through a brief snowstorm on the Indiana Toll Road.

As Gary and Indiana State police pursued the man, identified as Danny Ware, 39, of Winkelman, Ariz., Sgt. Martinez Newman pleaded over the stolen car&apos;s radio for him to pull over.

&quot;Please stop that car,&quot;Newman was heard saying on police scanners.&quot;Please stop that car before someone gets hurt.&quot;No injuries were reported by police and Ware was taken into custody after the car was stopped in LaPorte County.

The mayhem began after Cpl. Jeffery Patrick agreed to give Ware a ride from the city&apos;s public safety building to the Adam Benjamin Metro Center.

Not only the postman rings twice. A Jackson County man remained in jail Monday after he drove two cars into the post office in Ravenden Springs.

Randolph County Sheriff Gary Tribble said Glenn Irvin Sparling, 65, drove one vehicle into the post office on Sunday, and fled the scene. The sheriff told Jonesboro television station KAIT that the car stopped running. So Sparling went home and got another vehicle, a red antique sports car, and started driving back to the post office.

The sheriff said a deputy spotted Sparling and gave chase. The pursuit ended when Sparling ran the second car into the post office building. Sparling wasn&apos;t hurt, the sheriff said.

Manager of Post Office Operations Hillrey Adams said Monday that the building had an 8-foot by 8-foot hole in it.

&quot;The damage is extensive. This is a small, modular post office building and it has one wall completely out of it right now,&quot;Adams said. tintin 24-03-2008, 09:13 PM http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/San_Onofre_NPP_cropped.jpg/718px-San_Onofre_NPP_cropped.jpg

There is fashion, there is fad

Why ask your head, it&apos;s your

Woman, man, girl and boy
Feel the pain, feel the joy
And side step the little bits of history repeating

Just little bits of history repeating

Just little bits of history repeating

The party displayed enough similarities to parties with the root beer keg&apos;s alcoholic counterparts that police showed up to administer breath tests to the rowdy high school-age partygoers. However, every reveler tested was found to be free of alcohol.

&quot;We didn&apos;t know it would work well enough to make the cops show up,&quot;Zebro said. The student said he and his friends believe that underage drinking off school grounds is a matter to be handled by police, not school officials.

However, Principal Tom Johansen defended the school&apos;s actions.

&quot;I think we have an obligation as an educational institution&quot;to investigate underage drinking and mete out penalties, he said.

OK Cheeb, you&apos;r truely a GRANDMASTER when it
comes to this symbolism stuff; pure brilliance at times.

Here&apos;s my take on Vera Susa and the Bible.
The bible is the most important book obviously in the world.

But it is used to create world war.
Israel is the centre of the biggest hoax of all time.
And here comes Vera Susa and has explained that HOAX to me.

From that moment on I looked at the world and at the Bible with different
eyes. Why are they desperately surpressing the BIBLE KNOWLEDGE.
Why? if it&apos;s NONSENSE you don&apos;t need to surpress it
because NONSENSE will destroy itself.

Secretly they are following the BIBLE KNOWLEDGE to AUSTRALIA.
If that part of the KNOWLEDGE is true, then maybe there is
even more truth.
Why are JESUS CHRIST and GENUINE Christians more or less
outlaws? Why this deliberate plan, that is eveywhere
to be seen, to make a fool out of real christians and christian values.

There must be a reason.
Australia is the BIG secret, maybe that other
BIG secret, Christ is true as well.

And not only Christ, but maybe GOD as well.
Maybe GOD is the BIG secret they are afraid of.
Just looking at what THEY are AFTER is a very convincing
argument to believe THERE is a GOD.

There is a DELIBERATE PLAN TO make THE BIBLE into
a book for FOOLS.

ISRAEL and the SATANIC (Khazar) JEWS are essential in that game.
The whole world can see that those folks HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with GOD&apos;S PEOPLE. That&apos;s the trick.

USE SATANISTS and tell the world THEY ARE GOD&apos;s CHOSEN PEOPLE.
Let them STEAL a worthless piece of DESERT, let them GET AWAY
WITH ALL CRIMES you can think of and PEOPLE will BLAME GOD.

Look at GOD&apos;s HOLY people.
There is YOUR GOD....
F**** YOUR GOD!!
There is a lot of HIDDEN hatred against Jews today and that will
probably come out sometime. It&apos;s a set up. Muslims are getting
warmed up to go bananas against all people, not only jews.
Christians as well.

Next this will happen. The FINANCIAL world will COLLAPSE TOTALLY.
People will point to the JEWS. Chaos and anarchy.
Muslims wil go mad, BOMBS everywhere. and all because of
a few HOAXES...

Vera Susa was the one that opened my eyes.
All what&apos;s happening in today&apos;s world became suddenly clear to me.
It&apos;s all a DEVLISH plan. And people will be tested to the limit.

The awakening proces has started, but it is tiny and too little
too late. And when the big CRISIS will hit the world I am
afraid that most will choose for their own future, even if that
would hurt other people. Understandable, but not good
for the world in general.....

I think the only hope for the world is REAL CHRISTIANITY. Forgiveness
and love and even LOVE for your enemies as they are VICTIMS of
SATAN&apos;s MASTERPLAN as well....
I don&apos;t believe in Violence at all. We are all beautifull SUPER COMPUTERS.
And some even have a heart that is ticking.
You wouldn&apos;t even THINK of destroying an expensive computer
but the wonderfull creation that are humans are bombed and killed on
a daily basis.

I have never heard a story like this.
&quot;IN GREECE today 120 Expensive Packard Bell Computers
have been brutally massacred&quot;
No, of course not, because it doesn&apos;t make sense.

And I think you shoud treat your fellow human being like it was
you own expensive CAR. (Wow, there would be peace instantly...)
To begin with of course...

And that&apos;s the choice people have to make.
God or satan....it&apos;s up to the people.....
And that&apos;s when the shift wil come...
At least IMO.....

And maybe we have shown, as humanity as a whole, that we are
not capable of solving this mess on our own.
Maybe we DO need a guy like Christ....
Maybe our only hope...... cheeb 25-03-2008, 12:29 AM OK Tintin,
You Are Probably Right about Vera Susa,
I Have never met her,
So I Wouldn&apos;t Know,
From What I Have Seen of Her Posts,
They are a mark of Genius,

But I Don&apos;t Think I See Eye To Eye With Her,
On Spiritual Matters,
Which Is A Shame,

I Hope We Can Get Over This,

But If Not,
I Will Not Diss Her Opinion Again,
Because I Am A Newcomer To This Thread,
If She Wishes,
I Will Leave It,

The Truth Is More Important Than Stubborn Egos!!!!

The Global Patriot
(image from Global Container Lines website)
The ship was reportedly carrying used military equipment

A US container ship approaching the Suez Canal
has opened fire on a small Egyptian motorboat,
killing one man and wounding two others, reports say.

The Global Patriot, carrying used US military equipment,
was in the Gulf of Suez when it was approached by
a motorboat selling local merchandise.

Its crew apparently fired after the boat failed to heed warnings
to stop when asked, the US navy said.

It added that it was in contact with Egypt
through the US embassy in Cairo.

As many as 100 other local vessels are said to
have gathered at the scene,
carrying hawkers demanding an inquiry.

Some 7.5% of world sea trade
passes through the Suez Canal,
which is 190km long (118 miles)
and 120m wide (395ft)
at its narrowest point.

Military charter

It was after sunset on Monday
when a motorboat carrying
three local Egyptian
traders approached the Global Patriot
in the Gulf of Suez
as it prepared to sail towards the Mediterranean,
according to Egyptian officials.

http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44512000/gif/_44512322_egypt_suez203x152.gif
Map

The Global Patriot&apos;s crew are reported to have ordered the motorboat
to stop and when it did not, they opened fire,
killing Mohammed Fouad
and wounding two others, the officials added.

A US naval spokeswoman,
Cdr Lydia Robertson,
said that the Global Patriot
had warned the small boats to turn away
&quot;via bridge-to-bridge radio
and a series of warning steps&quot;.

&quot;One small boat continued to approach the motor vessel,
which then reportedly fired warning shots.&quot;

Confirming that the incident was under investigation, she added:

&quot;Fleet authorities
are working cooperatively
with Egyptian authorities
through the US Embassy
in Cairo.&quot;

Cigarettes

A spokesman for Global Container Lines told the Associated Press
that he had no information about the incident.

According to the US Navy&apos;s Military Sealift Command (MSC),
the Global Patriot is a US-flagged roll-on, roll-off container ship
chartered from Global Container Lines.

In the past, it has been used by the MSC
to transport a US military Patriot Missile
defence battery, ammunition, and MRAP
(Mine Resistant Ambush Protected)
vehicles around the world.

On this occasion, the Global Patriot is said to have been
transporting used US military equipment from Dubai.

The BBC&apos;s Heba Saleh in Cairo
says fisherman and small boats carrying hawkers
ply the waters of the canal trying to sell cigarettes
and other local products to ship passing through.

It is not clear why
those on board
the Global Patriot
opened fire.

Al-Qaeda militants have in the past
used small motorboats to attack
US military and other foreign vessels
in waters off the coast of Yemen,

Army launches assault in Comoros

Tanzanian African Union troops
are greeted
in Anjouan (25 March 2008)

A military operation begins in the Comoros
to put down a year-old rebellion
on the island of Anjouan, a day after
the military was authorised to retake it.

Defence chief of staff Mohamed Dosara said
around 450 troops had already landed
and had seized Anjouan&apos;s second town, Domoni,
as well as the airport.

The island&apos;s renegade leader,
Mohamed Bacar,
is believed to be holding out
with several hundred armed police.

The Comoran troops are being supported by
a 1,500-strong African Union force.

On Monday, President Ahmed Mohamed Sambi
said in a televised address that Anjouan would
be&quot;liberated&quot;in the&quot;coming hours or days&quot;.

Mr Sambi said he had hoped that Mr Bacar and his supporters
would&quot;surrender themselves in order to avoid confrontation&quot;.

&apos;Feet on the ground&apos;

Mortar and machine-gun fire was first heard as dawn broke on Tuesday
in Anjouan as the government force, believed to include Tanzanian and Sudanese AU troops, launched a long-expected amphibious assault on
the island.

Later, Mr Dosara told the BBC that around 450 troops
had already landed on Anjouan and had taken the island&apos;s
second town, Domoni, as well as the airport in Ouani.

He said they had met a small amount of resistance from
supporters of Mr Bacar, but claimed that
the joint Comoran-AU force was now advancing on
the island&apos;s main town, Mustamudu.

There has been no independent confirmation
of the success of the government operation.
The authorities have said it is too early to know
whether there have been any casualties.

Five boats carrying the Comoran and AU troops
had left the island of Moheli early on Monday,
while a helicopter dropped leaflets over Anjouan
warning citizens that the assault to retake the island
would begin in hours.

Mr Bacar has defied African Union and international calls
to step down since proclaiming himself president in July 2007
after an election which the federal authorities declared illegal.

In an interview on Thursday, Mr Bacar insisted
he would not step down.

&quot;I am still determined to defend Anjouan despite my concern
that people are ready to come here and fire on the Anjouanese
but I am continuing with my preparations to defend Anjouan,&quot;
he told the AFP news agency.

A history of political violence
has left the tiny Comoros archipelago
in the Indian Ocean
desperately poor
since independence from France in 1975.

At times, the country has teetered on the brink of disintegration
amid tensions between the semi-autonomous islands
and the central government.

Anyway, there is far too much in ANYTHING&quot;BEATLES&quot;,
for me to bother pointing out
(I&apos;d need a Million hands with all fingers pointing),
but for those still coming to terms with their THOROUGHLY EVIL,
role in bringing about this current age of DEADLY SELF WORSHIP,
you could apply what we discuss here to the obituary here, for starters;

http://www.latimes.com/images/standard/lat_logo_inner.gif
http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-aspinall25mar25,1,186628.story vera susa 25-03-2008, 09:01 AM I bought a bible recently. I&apos;ve never owned one in my life.

Ha, as Catholic as my family was, we never had a Bible in my mothers house,
then just before I got married, I JUST HAD TO get one.

And didn&apos;t that nearly do my head in!

Then, a couple of decades later (through many close calls into Occult ways and other dangers of a lone searcher), I got hold of an old STRONG&apos;S CONCORDANCE, and found why it was that I simply could never give up my faith, no matter how&quot;sensible&quot;&quot;They&quot;made it sound with all that Pagan EDITING by Rome.

Suddenly my love of science made sense... everything made sense!

See, this is what always bugged me; if The Bible is the world&apos;s most
read&amp;studied book, and it&apos;s God&apos;s Living Word, and the world is so
full of EVIL &apos;Christians&apos;, what are we all MISSING in it, that He cares to
WARN US that MOST of the world WOULD BE DECEIVED, WHEN we had
MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN EVER?

Then I noticed that He spoke of THE WHOLE WORLD and ALL THE EARTH,
so very much more than EGYPT, yet that PLACE gets far more reverence,
and OBSESSIVE study from &apos;Christians&apos; as well as SELF DECLARED SATANISTS,
than ANYONE EVER put into studying Holy Scripture&apos;s WHOLE WORLD/ALL TIME, PERSPECTIVE, so being a stubborn sod when it comes to matters of truth, I thought I would, rather than wait for some &apos;guru&apos; to come along
and give me another &apos;almost truth&apos;.

Now when you remove that GREAT PYRAMID Shaped STUMBLING BLOCK,
BINGO, countless snares set in our everyday live are sprung before they
trap us, and better still you can see that a DEATHLESS age once existed
(as science has finally &apos;discovered&apos;) and that there will be again.

Our GENUINE Faith is NOT in vain; it&apos;s just a MUCH, MUCH, MUCH LONGER
Time Line we need to take into account when studying His Living Word.

And a reminder; a favourite ploy of Anti-Christs is to convince folk it is
only a book, written by man, a few thousand ago at the longest. Yet it is chock full of things we could NOT know until this age of science, like the existence of the Super Continent, which IS THE STARTING POINT FOR LOCATING Lands, Nations and the SCATTERED, MIXED&amp;MINGLED Tribes
of Israel today. tintin 25-03-2008, 09:39 AM Man accused of driving into post office

Not only the postman rings twice. A Jackson County man remained in jail Monday after he drove two cars into the post office in Ravenden Springs.

Randolph County Sheriff Gary Tribble said Glenn Irvin Sparling, 65, drove one vehicle into the post office on Sunday, and fled the scene. The sheriff told Jonesboro television station KAIT that the car stopped running. So Sparling went home and got another vehicle, a red antique sports car, and started driving back to the post office.

The sheriff said a deputy spotted Sparling and gave chase. The pursuit ended when Sparling ran the second car into the post office building. Sparling wasn&apos;t hurt, the sheriff said.

Manager of Post Office Operations Hillrey Adams said Monday that the building had an 8-foot by 8-foot hole in it.

&quot;The damage is extensive. This is a small, modular post office building and it has one wall completely out of it right now,&quot;Adams said.

McLEAN, Va. - Maybe he heard a faint rattling around in his luggage, but he surely never assumed the sound came from a stowaway snake sealed in his bag. Alas, that&apos;s what happened to Andy Bacas, an Arlington man who was taken to the hospital Monday after being bitten by what authorities believe was a juvenile canebrake rattlesnake.

Bacas, a rowing coach at Yorktown High School, told fire and rescue personnel that he reached into his luggage Monday morning after returning from a team trip to South Carolina when he felt a sharp pain. That&apos;s when he saw the nearly foot-long snake and quickly slammed the luggage shut with the snake inside, said Chief Ben Barksdale, spokesman for the Arlington County Fire Department.

Fire and rescue workers took the suitcase outside, opened it and blasted it with a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, essentially freezing the snake and killing it, Barksdale said.

&quot;The guy who responded had seen it done on TV,&quot;Barksdale said of the technique, adding that it can be effective for bees or other wild animals.

Bacas was in stable condition Monday afternoon at Inova Fairfax Hospital.

Barksdale said he had no information that the snake was deliberately put into the luggage.

Bob Myers, director of the American International Rattlesnake Museum in New Mexico, said it&apos;s conceivable that a snake would crawl into luggage seeking warmth or shelter, though his first instinct was to suspect some sort of prank.

The venom from a canebrake rattlesnake can be particularly harmful, but a juvenile rattlesnake is not usually large enough to deliver enough venom to be lethal, Myers said. While the snake found in Arlington was less than a foot long, adult canebrakes can grow to a length of six feet.

&quot;There&apos;s an old wives&apos; tale that says a baby rattlesnake bite is worse than an adult bite, but that&apos;s just not true,&quot;Myers said.

Myers said three or four people die each year from rattlesnake bites in the United States, out of perhaps 8,000 bites a year. emerald 25-03-2008, 11:31 AM Wacky bras auctioned for charity

GLENDALE, Calif., March 24 (UPI) --&quot;Twin Peaks Bra&quot;and&quot;The Great Bra of China&quot;were featured creations at this year&apos;s Soroptimist&quot;Bras for a Cause&quot;fundraiser in Glendale, Calif.

The main component of the charity event was the auctioning off of wacky and creatively designed bras with original names and themes.&quot;Yosemit-D Bra&quot;and&quot;Snorkeling in Bra-zil Bra&quot;are two other examples.

Soroptimist, a global volunteer organization for career women who&quot;work to improve the lives of women and girls,&quot;donated the auction proceeds to breast cancer healing and research, the Los Angeles Daily News reported.

One of the most attention-grabbing designs last Saturday reportedly was the&quot;Op-Bra,&quot;constructed by a hair dresser named Joe DiMaggio, who is, in fact related, to the famous baseball star. It was a super-sized black bra containing large, old-fashioned globes in its cups.

The yearly event, which began in 2003, is the brainchild of Soroptimist President Kathy Lefkovits, the newspaper said. emerald 25-03-2008, 11:34 AM &apos;Rare&apos; tiger snapped in China is circus escapee

BEIJING (AFP) - A tiger snapped in central China initially thought to be a very rare species has been identified as a more common Siberian one which escaped from a circus, state media reported on Tuesday. A photographer for a local television station last week said he had taken a photo of a big animal in a forest in Hunan province, and asked for help to identify it, according to the China Daily. Preliminary findings confirmed it was a tiger, and speculation mounted it was one of the rare South China species, the report said. vera susa 25-03-2008, 11:39 AM ...about

GARY -- A man who asked a Gary police officer for a ride to a bus station Friday afternoon ended up stealing his squad car and leading police on a chase through a brief snowstorm on the Indiana Toll Road.

As Gary and Indiana State police pursued the man, identified as Danny Ware, 39, of Winkelman, Ariz., Sgt. Martinez Newman pleaded over the stolen car&apos;s radio for him to pull over.

&quot;Please stop that car,&quot;Newman was heard saying on police scanners.&quot;Please stop that car before someone gets hurt.&quot;No injuries were reported by police and Ware was taken into custody after the car was stopped in LaPorte County.

The mayhem began after Cpl. Jeffery Patrick agreed to give Ware a ride from the city&apos;s public safety building to the Adam Benjamin Metro Center.

Green says retirement is final

By Tim Clarke
March 25, 2008

TEARFULLY ending his professional boxing career,
world light heavyweight champion Danny Green
said no amount of money could tempt him
to reverse a decision to quit
made after an early-morning
Easter Sunday&quot;epiphany&quot;.

In a move which
will cost Green millions of dollars,
the 35 year-old emotionally quit the ring
saying his future as a husband, father and grandfather
was more important than defending the WBA title
he won last December.

And while Green said he felt fitter and sharper than at any time
in his 16-year career, he also believed he was making the decision
of a wise man to walk out of the sport at his peak.

&quot;I woke up at 1am Sunday morning with my stomach churning,
and it was telling me to hang up my gloves basically,&apos;&apos; Green said.

&quot;You can imagine I have struggled with the decision as I believe I am at
the top of my game and the peak of my career as a professional fighter.

&quot;I have never gone against my gut feelings and I am not about to
start doing that now.

&quot;There is going to be questions about whether there is
anything wrong with me physically, the answer is categorically no.

&quot;It was almost like I had a premonition, an epiphany -
I am not religious by any stretch of the imagination -
but I do listen to my stomach and that is what it has told me.

&quot;I have clarity, it was weird but that is the way it is.
I leave with my dignity and my health intact.&apos;&apos;

Green was in preparation
for his mandatory defence
against Argentinian Hugo Garay
at Challenge Stadium on April 27,
having abandoned plans to train in Perth
in favour for his usual Sydney surroundings.

But after wrestling with his decision for hours,
he said he was happy and content.

&quot;You won&apos;t see me come back.
I am turning down millions and millions of dollars,&apos;&apos; Green said.

&quot;My decision is not financially based, it is based on myself, my family
and friends and what I have to offer the community in the future.

&quot;A lot of people will think I am crazy, but a lot of fighters stay in the game
too long and that is not going to be me.&apos;&apos;

With the Garay fight off,
the much talked about rematch with
Anthony Mundine - which would have brought both men
monster paydays - also won&apos;t eventuate.

&quot;It would have been nice to go out in front of 20,000 fans
at Burswood with a massive rematch but it is not to be,&apos;&apos; Green said.

&quot;All I would say to Choc is
keep your chin down
and look after your health
because it is a very tough sport ...
and thanks for a great rivalry,
because you have made the sport
so much more exciting.&apos;&apos;

Mundine&apos;s manager Khoder Nasser
said Green&apos;s retirement would be a loss to boxing,
and he hoped he would reconsider.

&quot;Danny is a gentleman
who was part of the greatest fight
in Australian history,
he fought back from adversity
to become a world champion again
and his retirement
is a massive loss to boxing,&apos;&apos;
Nasser said.

&quot;Every man is entitled to change his mind
and we certainly hope he does
so he can fight Anthony again.&apos;&apos;

But watched by a large group of family and friends,
including his wife Nina and two children Chloe and Archie,
Green said he would now be pursuing other business interests,
as well as staying involved in boxing in an official -
and possibly unofficial - capacity.

&quot;Boxing is always going to be part of my life,
but instead of dealing with the sharks
of the sport out there, I will be dealing with ...
any prospective boyfriends (for Chloe),&apos;&apos; Green said.

&quot;That is why I want to make sure my health is intact,
because when I am 60 years old and there are boys
knocking on the door I still want to be able to
go the knuckle if I have to.&apos;&apos; vera susa 25-03-2008, 02:52 PM http://www.news.com.au/files/mosaic_large.jpg

Dalai Lama reiterates
threat to quit

EXILED spiritual leader the Dalai Lama
has reiterated a threat to resign
as leader of Tibet&apos;s exiles
if there are more violent
anti-Chinese protests
inside or outside China.


But the &apos;RATTIEST RATS&apos; are these sorts
of SELL OUT CREEPS who say,
&quot;PEACE, PEACE&quot;when there is NO PEACE&quot;!


``If the violent demonstrations continue,
I would resign,&apos;&apos;
the Buddhist leader said today.

``I think inside or outside China,
if the demonstrators utilise
violent methods,
I am totally against it,&apos;&apos;
the Dalai Lama said.

Last week the spiritual leader, who has been
based in the northern Indian town
of Dharamshala since a failed uprising
against Chinese rule in 1959,
issued a similar warning.


CREEP CREEP CREEP CREEP...CREEPY CREEP...
yeah, I don&apos;t BUY this guy and it astounds me
that anyone can fall for his ACT! tintin 25-03-2008, 03:23 PM Snaked stowed away in luggage bites man

McLEAN, Va. - Maybe he heard a faint rattling around in his luggage, but he surely never assumed the sound came from a stowaway snake sealed in his bag. Alas, that&apos;s what happened to Andy Bacas, an Arlington man who was taken to the hospital Monday after being bitten by what authorities believe was a juvenile canebrake rattlesnake.

Bacas, a rowing coach at Yorktown High School, told fire and rescue personnel that he reached into his luggage Monday morning after returning from a team trip to South Carolina when he felt a sharp pain. That&apos;s when he saw the nearly foot-long snake and quickly slammed the luggage shut with the snake inside, said Chief Ben Barksdale, spokesman for the Arlington County Fire Department.

Fire and rescue workers took the suitcase outside, opened it and blasted it with a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, essentially freezing the snake and killing it, Barksdale said.

&quot;The guy who responded had seen it done on TV,&quot;Barksdale said of the technique, adding that it can be effective for bees or other wild animals.

Bacas was in stable condition Monday afternoon at Inova Fairfax Hospital.

Barksdale said he had no information that the snake was deliberately put into the luggage.

Bob Myers, director of the American International Rattlesnake Museum in New Mexico, said it&apos;s conceivable that a snake would crawl into luggage seeking warmth or shelter, though his first instinct was to suspect some sort of prank.

The venom from a canebrake rattlesnake can be particularly harmful, but a juvenile rattlesnake is not usually large enough to deliver enough venom to be lethal, Myers said. While the snake found in Arlington was less than a foot long, adult canebrakes can grow to a length of six feet.

&quot;There&apos;s an old wives&apos; tale that says a baby rattlesnake bite is worse than an adult bite, but that&apos;s just not true,&quot;Myers said.

Myers said three or four people die each year from rattlesnake bites in the United States, out of perhaps 8,000 bites a year.

Smashing Pumpkins sue Virgin Records
Tue Mar 25, 8:29 AM ET
LOS ANGELES - The Smashing Pumpkins are suing Virgin Records, saying the record label has illegally used their name and music in promotional deals that hurt the band&apos;s credibility with fans.

In a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, the rockers said they have&quot;worked hard for over two decades to accumulate a considerable amount of goodwill in the eyes of the public,&quot;and that Virgin&apos;s use of the band in a&quot;Pepsi Stuff&quot;promotion with Amazon.com and Pepsi Co. threatens their reputation for&quot;artistic integrity.&quot;

Virgin released the Smashing Pumpkins&apos; music for more than 17 years, but the only active agreement between the two parties, the lawsuit claims, is a deal granting Virgin permission to sell digital downloads of the band&apos;s songs. The agreement does not give Virgin the right to use the band in promotional campaigns to sell outside products, the lawsuit said.

The band members said they would&quot;never grant such authority to Virgin, or any other entity.&quot;

An after-hours call to Virgin Records wasn&apos;t immediately returned.

The lawsuit demands that Virgin pay with the profits earned in the promotion and asks for an injunction against using the Pumpkins&apos; name or music in the future. pri01 25-03-2008, 05:51 PM Started thinking about the Jack and Rose connection Tintin and came across some other slant to refer to.

MIAMI - A crane collapsed Tuesday at a construction site for a high-rise condominium, killing two workers, injuring four and smashing into a home that the contractor had been using as an office, police said. Rescue workers were going through the rubble at the site of the more than 40-story luxury condo tower on Biscayne Bay. Fire officials said rescue efforts were hampered because the crane remained unstable.

Officials were unsure how the crane fell.

&quot;I watched it go through the roof. It was a disaster,&quot;Mike Huffstutlear, a drywall supervisor, told The Miami Herald.

One of those killed died at the scene and the other at a hospital, Miami police spokesman Delrish Moss said. The injured were in serious but not critical condition, Moss said.

Parts of the home near the construction site were destroyed by the crane. Miami fire spokesman Ignatius Carroll said the building was used in the movie&quot;There&apos;s Something About Mary.&quot;

Workers at the sales office for the Paramount Bay condo complex said they had no details about the accident or what construction company was on site. The tower developer, Royal Palms Communities, did not return a phone message seeking comment.

The accident came 10 days after a 20-story crane collapsed at a New York construction site, killing seven people.

The U.S. Office of Safety and Health Administration did not immediately return phone messages Tuesday.

Tower cranes and crane operators are not licensed or regulated by the state of Florida, but bills moving through both houses of the Legislature would change that. Jane643 25-03-2008, 08:51 PM The EVIL are the KNOWING DECEIVERS,

Zechariah 9-11, The Arrival of the Shepherd King

9.11,

If People Understood The Scripture,
They Would Understand,
What 30 Peices of Silver Really Means!!!

So they paid me thirty pieces of silver. And the LORD said to me,&quot;Throw it to the potter&quot;-the handsome price at which they priced me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD to the potter. (Zech 11:12-13)

Now Zechariah declares a time for rejoicing for your king is coming to you (vs. 9). There are descriptions giving to the coming king: righteous, bringing salvation, humble, and riding on a donkey

I Can&apos;t Really Be Bothered At The Moment,
But I Think We All Know Who The Bad Shepherd Is,
That Will Lead The Flock Astray:

MIAMI - A crane collapsed Tuesday at a construction site for a high-rise condominium, killing two workers, injuring four and smashing into a home that the contractor had been using as an office, police said. Rescue workers were going through the rubble at the site of the more than 40-story luxury condo tower on Biscayne Bay. Fire officials said rescue efforts were hampered because the crane remained unstable.

Officials were unsure how the crane fell.

&quot;I watched it go through the roof. It was a disaster,&quot;Mike Huffstutlear, a drywall supervisor, told The Miami Herald.

One of those killed died at the scene and the other at a hospital, Miami police spokesman Delrish Moss said. The injured were in serious but not critical condition, Moss said.

Parts of the home near the construction site were destroyed by the crane. Miami fire spokesman Ignatius Carroll said the building was used in the movie&quot;There&apos;s Something About Mary.&quot;

Workers at the sales office for the Paramount Bay condo complex said they had no details about the accident or what construction company was on site. The tower developer, Royal Palms Communities, did not return a phone message seeking comment.

The accident came 10 days after a 20-story crane collapsed at a New York construction site, killing seven people.

The U.S. Office of Safety and Health Administration did not immediately return phone messages Tuesday.

Tower cranes and crane operators are not licensed or regulated by the state of Florida, but bills moving through both houses of the Legislature would change that.

WOW, this is a doozie!

So MUCH....why did we need to be told this;

Miami fire spokesman Ignatius Carroll said the building was used in the movie&quot;There&apos;s Something About Mary.&quot;

when there were TWO PEOPLE KILLED and 4 SERIOUSLY HURT?

I am really interested in astrology and have beem wandering around the sites to try and get a better understanding. This interested me.

Jack it is said can refer to the Sun. A good example is the song/nursery rhym,
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water.

Jack came down and broke his Crown and Jill came tumbling after.

Put another way;

Jack/SUN rises in the sky to move into the constellation Aquarious (pale of Water)

When Jack /Sun sets(falls down) he breaks his crown. Sun/Korona. Jill Follows (Moon rising).

Jack and Rose (Sun Rise)

MISS THE PLOT!! emerald 26-03-2008, 10:32 AM Police: Pantless woman gets out of car

YONKERS, N.Y. - Suburban New York police say a drunken driver had a suspended license and had marijuana in her car. Oh, they also say she didn&apos;t have any pants on. Yonker police say 22-year-old Long Island resident Angelica Buchanan was found Saturday standing bottomless in a street near her car. They say she was so drunk she had to be hospitalized.

Police say she claimed she wasn&apos;t wearing pants because she needed to use the bathroom. They&apos;ve charged her with driving while intoxicated, unlicensed operation of a vehicle and marijuana possession.

A telephone message left at her family&apos;s Rockville Centre home Tuesday night hasn&apos;t been returned.

Earlier this month a Westchester County man was accused of using a doughnut shop&apos;s drive-through lane while not wearing pants. He&apos;s charged with public lewdness. emerald 26-03-2008, 10:45 AM 2 charged in triple homicide in Easton

With the help of witnesses and investigative work from a slew of law enforcement agencies, police have arrested two men who they say shot and killed three people execution style in an Easton home in November.

Both men, Ali Elijah Davis, 20, of Freemansburg, and Lewis Gray 31, of East Orange, N.J., have ties to North Jersey, believed to be the focus of the investigation from the start.

Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said at a news conference Tuesday that there may be more arrests. He also said investigators have a &apos;&apos;very solid case&apos;&apos; against Davis and Gray based on cooperating witnesses and physical evidence. The cooperation from witnesses apparently stretches back to at least last month, and the leads drew Easton investigators into the Newark, N.J., area many times.

&apos;&apos;It required extensive travel back and forth to New Jersey,&apos;&apos; Morganelli said. He said the triple homicide was a &apos;&apos;very, very difficult investigation.&apos;&apos; Earlier this month, at another news conference announcing a large drug bust in the city, Morganelli said he expected the lengthy federal prison sentences some people were facing to pry loose information on Easton&apos;s triple homicide.

On Tuesday, Morganelli said information that came out of the drug busts corroborated information investigators had heard and was essentially another piece in the puzzle in assembling the case.

Morganelli would not elaborate on the evidence or other details that led Easton Inspector Matthew Gerould to charge Davis and Gray with homicide, robbery and conspiracy in the deaths of Alphe Rene, 21, Aleah Hamlin, 19, and Chanel Armour, 23. The affidavits laying out the case were ordered sealed by a Northampton County judge at Morganelli&apos;s request.

Morganelli called the information in the affidavits &apos;&apos;very sensitive&apos;&apos; and said releasing it would be detrimental to the ongoing investigation and the safety of witnesses.

&apos;&apos;There are people who have cooperated with us [whom] we need to keep confidential,&apos;&apos; Morganelli said. He also said the information must be kept secret because the investigation is continuing.

&apos;&apos;There is the potential for more than the two we have in custody,&apos;&apos; he said.

Morganelli, referring to comments he made after the triple homicide, said he still believes the slayings were a &apos;&apos;hit,&apos;&apos; though he would not elaborate.

He said investigators are looking at gang, robbery or &apos;&apos;intertwined motives.&apos;&apos;

Gerould singled out the cooperation of Irvington, East Orange and Essex County investigators and Hudson County prosecutor&apos;s office in New Jersey, the FBI in Allentown, the FBI in Newark and the homicide division of the Newark police.

&apos;&apos;You couldn&apos;t ask for any better help,&apos;&apos; said Easton Police Chief Larry Palmer.

Gray was arrested Feb. 15 while in Essex County Prison on cocaine and heroin distribution charges. He is awaiting extradition to Northampton County on charges that Morganelli said could carry the death penalty.

Davis, originally from Livingston, N.J., was arrested Monday night and sent to Northampton County Prison without bail.

They are charged with gunning down Rene, Hamlin and Armour Nov. 29 on the third floor of an apartment at 128 N. 13th St. in Easton&apos;s West Ward. Their bodies were all in one bedroom, Morganelli said.

Local authorities looked to a connection with New Jersey gang activity when they learned Rene, less than two days before he was killed, was spotted with a dozen alleged Bloods gang members at a park in Jersey City, N.J., law enforcement officials said earlier.

At the park less than an hour after Rene was spotted, James Singleton of Newark was shot and killed in retaliation for fatally shooting one man and injuring another earlier that day, police said. Singleton&apos;s keys were recovered from the crime scene in Easton, a New Jersey law enforcement official has said.

Gray and Davis have been arrested before.

In August 2006, Davis was charged by Easton police with criminal mischief, theft from a motor vehicle and possession of an instrument of crime. According to court papers, he broke into a car parked in the 1300 block of Spring Garden Street, the same neighborhood as the triple homicide, using a screwdriver. He pleaded guilty to criminal mischief in June 2007 and was sentenced to 12 months of probation, fined $856 fine and ordered to do 50 hours of community service.

Gray was picked up on a parole violation in August 2006. He was on parole stemming from a June 2004 incident. He was convicted of threatening to kill someone, said Paul M. Loriquet, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor&apos;s office.

Gray was arrested and convicted in 1996 on theft, burglary, weapons and assault charges in Essex County. He was released from prison in June 2000, according to the New Jersey Department of Corrections. emerald 26-03-2008, 10:51 AM Woman shot, killed by husband

A Deepwater woman died Saturday after being shot in the chest, according to the Henry County Sheriffs Department.


Patsy D. Long, 34, was pronounced dead by Coroner Scott Largent just after 6 p.m.


Long was shot by her husband Ronald Long outside their home just after 6 p.m., while she was assisting him with the installation of a satellite television system, according to a written statement by the Sheriffs Department.


Ronald Long, 39, of 956 SE 1121, Deepwater, told deputies he had made several attempts to punch a hole through the exterior wall of the house, according to the report. When that did not work, Long told deputies he used a .22-caliber handgun to shoot through the wall from inside the home. His second shot hit Patsy Long in the chest, the report stated.


Deputies are still investigating the death, and Once we complete a diagram of the incident, we will be submitting everything to the prosecuting attorney and let him decide if he wants to press criminal charges, said Major Robert Hills, of the Henry County Sheriffs Department.


Hills said he could not speak for the prosecuting attorney, but normally in these types of cases the person would get charged with a manslaughter of some sort.


Henry County Coroner Scott Largent declined to release any information about Patsy Longs death until the Sheriffs Department finishes its investigation. emerald 26-03-2008, 10:54 AM Man Accused of Forcing Trains to Stop

CINCINNATI, March 25 (UPI) -- A woman who went to an Ohio county courthouse to pick up an indictment faces another charge after she allegedly cheated the blind owner of the courthouse deli.

Melissa Cordell is now charged with theft by deception. She was arrested at the Hamilton County Courthouse, the Cincinnati Enquirer said.

Cordell allegedly gave Kent Parker, owner of the Courthouse Deli, a $1 bill, telling him it was a five. A few minutes later, police said, she upped the ante by telling him she had given him a $10 bill.

She was arrested after allegedly trying the trick a third time. That time, an employee saw what she was up to and alerted Parker.



Small dog escapes gator&apos;s clutches

LUTZ, Fla., March 25 (UPI) -- The Lutz, Fla., owners of a small dog said their pet was able to escape the teeth of an alligator with no broken bones or internal bleeding.

Mike and Cathy Piendel said Gizmo, their 7-pound Maltese-toy poodle mix, suffered puncture wounds on his ear and back leg from his encounter with the gator, but a veterinarian told them the pooch is expected to make a full recovery, TBO.com reported Tuesday.

The Piendels said they heard Gizmo yelping in a panicked fashion Sunday and they spotted him with his ear in the clutches of the alligator, which was attempting to pull the small dog under the water. The dog briefly escaped, but the reptile managed to take hold of one of his thighs before Cathy Piendel scared the predator off with a scream.

Long was shot by her husband Ronald Long outside their home just after 6 p.m., while she was assisting him with the installation of a satellite television system, according to a written statement by the Sheriffs Department.


Ronald Long, 39, of 956 SE 1121, Deepwater, told deputies he had made several attempts to punch a hole through the exterior wall of the house, according to the report. When that did not work, Long told deputies he used a .22-caliber handgun to shoot through the wall from inside the home. His second shot hit Patsy Long in the chest, the report stated.


Deputies are still investigating the death, and Once we complete a diagram of the incident, we will be submitting everything to the prosecuting attorney and let him decide if he wants to press criminal charges, said Major Robert Hills, of the Henry County Sheriffs Department.


Hills said he could not speak for the prosecuting attorney, but normally in these types of cases the person would get charged with a manslaughter of some sort.


Henry County Coroner Scott Largent declined to release any information about Patsy Longs death until the Sheriffs Department finishes its investigation.

Sarkozy praises Britain&apos;s &apos;courage&apos;
http://www.orange.co.uk/images/editorial/ITN/story2da6a038325aa0259a55cf0e18ac6fa1_160x120.jpg
Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni


French President Nicolas Sarkozy has praised Britain&apos;s
&apos;determination and courage&apos; in a speech to MPs and peers.

Mr Sarkozy, who flew into Heathrow with his wife Carla Bruni
for their first state visit to the UK,
hailed Westminster as a &apos;touchstone&apos;
for democracies around the world
as he addressed both Houses of Parliament.

He said it was a &apos;signal honour&apos;
for him to be invited to speak at Westminster
during his two-day state visit to the UK.

He said that, through their
struggles for freedom,
the British people have
taught a lesson to the whole world.

Speaking in French, Mr Sarkozy said:
&apos;For the President of the French Republic,
it is a signal honour
indeed to address both Houses of the British Parliament.

&apos;It is indeed in these walls
which house your chambers
that modern political life was born.

&apos;Without your Parliament,
parliamentary democracy
would never have existed
in this shape anywhere
in the world.&apos;

Britain had shown that
parliamentary democracy
was &apos;the best bulwark against tyranny&apos;, said Mr Sarkozy.

&apos;This Parliament arose and stood
through a struggle for the protection
of individual freedoms,
and this is the lesson that you,
the British,
have taught the rest of the world,&apos;
he said.

&apos;This Parliament, your Parliament,
was the first anywhere in the world
to achieve the results
of parliamentary democracy.

&apos;The result of this is that
you represent
the touchstone
of everything
our democracies stand for.&apos;

Mr Sarkozy paid tribute to Britain&apos;s history of
repelling &apos;invincible armadas&apos;
and the
&apos;magnificent accomplishment&apos;
of the Battle of Britain.

&apos;The strength of the British people
has always been that of a free people,
a people that takes its own decisions,
that determines its own fate,
and and is prepared to pay
the ultimate sacrifice
in order to defend its freedoms,&apos; he said.

&apos;How many battles has your nation won
that everyone thought you had lost?
If your nation has been able to face
so many challenges that
seemed impossible to overcome
it is because,
quite simply because,
you believed
that your cause was
a just one.&apos;

While he said that Britain
was seen in many countries
as a &apos;political and human ideal&apos;,
it was with France that it had
the &apos;tightest, closest ties&apos;.

&apos;The destiny of our countries
have been intermingled
for some 1,000 years
since William the Conqueror
landed from Normandy
and wrested the throne
of Edward the Confessor,
right through to the reverse trend
whereby thousands of young British
men and women contributed to
the liberating of Europe,&apos; he said.

While Britain and France had found themselves over the centuries
&apos;locked in combat&apos;
it was
&apos;not because we were too different
but because we were too alike&apos;.

Mr Sarkozy and Ms Bruni
had earlier been greeted at Heathrow Airport
by Prince Charles and
the Duchess of Cornwall
before being driven to
Windsor where they were welcomed by
the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh.

They will stay at Windsor Castle
as guests of the Queen
during their two-day visit.

The trip aims to strengthen the &apos;entente cordiale&apos;
between the two countries and
high-level bilateral talks
are planned between
Mr Sarkozy and Prime Minister Gordon Brown
on Thursday. vera susa 27-03-2008, 12:18 AM 28 april is day 118.
1180 days and the movie
MARCH of the PENGUINS.

This year is a LEAP year so this year
DAY 118 is 27 APRIL.

Toponyms that are identical or similar

A newer theory,
the Iranian theory,
claims that the Bulgar language
was originally an Iranian language,

Additional theories

In the 19th century, even theories of
a Slavic or Finno-Ugric affiliation
were proposed on the basis of
the little or no evidence.[22]
These have practically no adherents
among today&apos;s scholars.
Another tiny minority view is that Bulgar,
far from being affiliated to Chuvash,
belonged instead to the same branch
as all other surviving Turkic languages
and more specifically
Kazan Tatar.

See, anyone can do it. kallista 27-03-2008, 09:30 AM My, how clever of you. vera susa 27-03-2008, 09:45 AM There&apos;s just too much being yelled at the world now, I can&apos;t keep up.

One little story, one news image, will keep me following links for hours,
and right from the outset, those links are perfectly contextual and tell
a more concise message, the further you follow.

But I have great pressure in my real world life from those who have been
watching and waiting for me to &apos;go too far&apos;...telling of THE GREATEST CONSPIRACY, doesn&apos;t bother &apos;them&apos; as with so many in the world promoting
belief in Alien Invasion and other such childish nonsense, and so many buying it, they know I can&apos;t compete against those professional, media groups, who
invent &apos;real looking/sounding evidences&apos; and employing troops of professional
touts to claim personal conviction etc.

But the thing is, I&apos;m not competing against anyone for anything...I&apos;m not
after supporters, fame, wealth or any of that &apos;stuff&apos;, I&apos;m simply called to
&apos;drop words&apos; so those who have ears may hear, and make their own free will
choice to search further for themselves.

And hence, I&apos;m a little heart broken...so much IS being exposed, but still those who do work for &apos;Them&apos;, keep dragging folk back into vain, worthless...worse than worthless, DANGEROUS imaginings, and childish, ego stroking, prattling about how clever they are to HATE The GOD they &apos;claim&apos;
they don&apos;t believe exists, or wise to follow some demonic teachings that
make a mockery of The Truly Loving, Perfectly Just, Creator...nearly to the degree they make a mockery of any intelligence they boast they posses.

See I don&apos;t &apos;spell out&apos; the meanings behind all my posts, I don&apos;t even highlight all the details worth looking into, but simply hope to inspire others to learn to
read between the lines, and then share their findings, because I also want folk to understand that God didn&apos;t lie about His Word not being for secret, private interpretation (that thinking, creates things like Guru&apos;s and Popes!),
but it&apos;s there for ALL called out to seek His Good News.

Anyway, it was the image of the BBC VALUED EXPOSURE;

(why am I always told I&apos;ve posted more than 10 images when I haven&apos;t?)

that inspired this post, and it&apos;s property numbers, 60.17&amp;61619.

I hope folk will Google the image pages for those two numbers, and read
the pages of the individual images, because at this point I really do want
folk to SEE FOR THEMSELVES what&apos;s being said with images like....

of someone who tries to be funny by imitating.

This is ONE THREAD that does not play those Navel Gazing, Lust Feeding,
Ego Stroking GAMES...there is a whole CONSPIRING WORLD of &apos;conspiracy&apos; sites and threads for &apos;your&apos; ideas and BS, so why is it so important for your ilk to start jumping in here now to TELL OTHERS TO IGNORE what we SHARE
from our our unusually varied life experience of mixing in the sorts of &apos;Circles&apos; most only read of in spy novels...we KNOW the ANSWER, though, don&apos;t we! tintin 27-03-2008, 10:48 AM The format we are using.
We are now attacked because of our LAY OUT.
I have thought about that and this is what&apos;s happening.

I am not here for my EGO, I am here to spread a certain
message. And I use a certain format.

I started with this stuff by only using normal letters
and no pictures. But over time it evolved into the
kind of LAY OUT that i use today.

When I think about it, it&apos;s quite logical.

http://indymedia.nl/img/2003/01/8397.jpg

The best selling papers are the TABLOID papers, like the SUN, the
DAILY MIRROR. The biggest paper in Europe
is the GERMAN BILD ZEITUNG.

http://www.mallorca-blog.de/wp-content/bild_14_4_07.jpg

The BILD ZEITUNG has hardly any text. Headlines and pictures.
But it sells about 3.8 MILLION papers every day.

Now, whatever you can tell about this paper, one thing
they DO KNOW, and that&apos;s how to SELL.

I mix two styles. The TABLOID to make it easy, and
normal text when I try to explain the headlines.
I admit using TABLOID methods, but it happened&quot;unconsciously&quot;
and naturally. It also reflects the URGENCY I feel.
The things we present here are so obvious to me that I
have difficulties to understand other people don&apos;t&quot;get&quot;it.

And since this thread is already so HUGE, I think it&apos;s
a good format to present things.
We live in the&quot;FAST&quot;age. And, if we like it or not, we are
all affected by it. So we have to adjust to that.

http://www.fontblog.de/wp-content/FAZ_neu_S1_gross.jpg

The FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE is the&quot;quality&quot;paper in Germany.
It sells about 400.000 papers. About one tenth of the BILD Zeitung.
But how many people are really READING this paper?

That&apos;s how the world works today.....
We don&apos;t have time to read more than a few lines.
TABLOIDS or Quality papers.

The quality papers are for SNOBS.
It&apos;s the same BS, only presented&quot;sophisticated&quot;. kallista 27-03-2008, 11:06 AM For me this thread is about learning, it is a process that never ends.

Thanks Kallista, and I agree.
And some people here also need to learn some good
manners.
Just randomly bumping into threads.
One of my favourite philosophers was SCHOPENHAUER,
not because of his philosophy but he had some incredible
sense of humour at times.

And he told that only very small details in human behaviour
can tell you almost all you want to know.
One little post by someone and you know already enough.

Learning....

Yep, being curious, looking at all kinds of things.
Don&apos;t stick to your own country as being the centre of the world.
We connect SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, etc,etc.

The game that is being played is a WORLD GAME.
The whole world is connected.

We try here to go beyond language barriers and REAL borders
or BORDERS inside our heads.

Because I live in Holland doesn&apos;t mean Holland is the
centre of the universe. Lot&apos;s of folks think like that and
see their own country as the place where it all happens.

Where do you see KANYA WEST linked to KENYA WEST where
all the ORANGE troubles happen.

I have highlighted the importance of PAUL TIBBETS and linked
it to TIBET. And right now there is mass unrest in TIBET.

http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20080325/sg-tibetchina1.jpg

Big trouble in TIBET.
Yesterday MIA FARROW was on CNN to talk about TIBET and DARFOUR.
Another celeb that plays the&quot;good samaritan&quot;.

Just like RICHARD GERE and Philip GLASS are very much involved
in the TIBETAN cause.

Isn&apos;t it strange that all people, almost all celebs, are worried
about unrest and wars and whatever in the world.

Yet, it never stops. No because those SAME CELEBS are part
of the Illumi brainwashing that is ESSENTIAL in keeping the
world in perpetual wars.....

And that&apos;s one of the things we try to expose here.
The subtle CON GAME that is present in every corner
of the world, and hiding behind different masks.

French serial killer Michel Fourniret, who has confessed to going&quot;virgin hunting&quot;with his wife, goes on trial here Thursday for the murder of seven young women and girls.

Fourniret, 65, made a pact with Monique Olivier while serving a jail sentence for sexual assault that she would find him virgins after his release if he killed her ex-husband, the court will hear in evidence.

The couple will sit behind bullet-proof glass in the dock in Charleville-Mezieres near the Belgian border to hear accusations that Fourniret raped and murdered six young women or teenage girls women in France and one in Belgium between 1987 and 2001.

Olivier, 59, is on trial for one of the same murders and complicity in four of his other crimes.

Investigators believe that in addition to the seven murders the couple have already admitted committing, Fourniret may have killed several other women.

The bespectacled former electrician, dubbed the&quot;Ogre of the Ardennes&quot;, has admitted that he needed to go hunting for a virgin at least twice a year, prosecutors said, adding that he was obsessed with virginity.

They said the couple began their killing spree in 1987 and that it only came to an end in 2003 when a 13-year-old girl Fourniret tried to abduct in Belgium managed to escape and raise the alarm.

He was arrested and confessed to several murders after Monique Olivier, months later, spilled the beans to Belgian police.

Fourniret has served time behind bars for voyeurism and sexual assault.

It was while in prison in the late 1980s that he met Olivier when she responded to an ad he put in a newspaper for a pen pal.

According to letters seized by investigators, the couple concluded a pact: if he killed her first husband, whom she said had abused her, she would help him find young virgins so he could fulfill his fantasies.

Olivier was waiting for him when he was freed in October 1987, but he never kept his side of the promise.

The charges against them state that Olivier would play a key part in her husband&apos;s meticulously-planned schemes to abduct young women.

Members of the victims&apos; family members as well as two women who survived Fourniret&apos;s attempt to kidnap them will testify in the trial.

If convicted, the couple face life imprisonment. vera susa 27-03-2008, 12:04 PM Has anyone noticed lately,
just how much OZ gets a spot
in BBC NEWS?

&quot;Why not?&quot;, you say,
it is still part of the Commonwealth.

Yeah and so is CANADA.

Canada Population: 33,390,141
Australia Population: 20,434,176

Only ten or so million more people,
and a couple of more centuries of history,
and next door to America, so why not
give them bugger all attention...surely
there can&apos;t be that much of interest
going on there, compared to little baby Oz.

Words or pictures can have different meanings.
PLAZA DE TORO. TORRES, TOWERS, it&apos;s all a rebus.

That&apos;s what i mean with CROSSING language borders and borders
inside the brain. Because SPANISH is a different language
means spanish people live in a SPANISH world
and FRENCH people live in a FRENCH world.

That&apos;s what they want. Divide the world into COMPARTMENTS.
The more COMPARTMENTALIZED the world is, the more
difficult to see the big picture. Exactly what they want.
That means people who only speak one language have
a great DISADVANTAGE compared to people that can read
different languages.

What we do here is pointing to KANYE WEST as someone
who is prominent in the news.

Same with MICHAEL TODD who falls of a CLIFF in SNOWDONIA.
and trouble in TIBET, just after we have posted bout TIBBETS
and the relation to TIBET where the DALAI LAMA rules
and is born on the same day as BUSH.

Long before that we have pointed to the symbolic importance
of TODD SWEENEY, the DEMON barber of fleet street.
Charles SWEENEY was the BOCKSCAR PILOT. NAGASAKI.
Madama butterfly etc,etc

It makes no sence to discuss the Michael TODD case as if
it&apos;s just some isolated event.
Same with Jessica Alba and the pinguins.

I get quite a few PM&apos;s from people who are enjoying it and
tell me they appreciate the way I present things.
Those people tell me I must be doing someting right.

A few years ago BELGIUM was in the grip of the DUTOUX affaire.
The people in Belgium knew it was BIGGER than just Dutroux.

And here another example how it&apos;s all linked.

Marc Dutroux, most infamous
Belgium in history. Born
6 November

Laura Bush and Michael Douglas.
So, again, don&apos;t isolate this one simple fact.
But it&apos;s part of the HUGE amounts of facts related
to MICHAEL DOUGLAS and LAURA BUSH.....

Wife of fourniret is OLIVIER.
OLIVIER MARTINEZ was ONOFRE BOULIVA.

ONOFRE and the NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.
OLIVER STONE and MOUNT OLIVE. Popeye and OLIVE.
Popeye is EYE OF THE POPE.
He has one EYE and that is the ALL SEEING EYE.
POPEYE is about BRUTE force.
The force of the KNIGHTS.
Popeye village is on MALTA.
OLIVE is the TREASURE BLUTO and POPEYE fight over.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Popeye-comic-book-cover.jpg

This is the first pic on the wiki POPEYE page.
OLIVE is in the DESERT.
OLIVE OYL represents ISRAEL. Israel is a worthless piece
of DESERT, and hence this as the first pic.

The box of PANDORA is about to be opened.

Movie directed by a guy called PABST.
POPE is PAPST in german.
A POPE directs the BOX of PANDORA.

Gordon Brown was just

at the state banquet for Nicolas Sarkozy.

The prime minister and French President
were among 150 guests at the banquet
in St George&apos;s Hall at Windsor Castle.

the Queen
can be heard saying to
Princess Anne:
&quot;The prime minister got lost.

President Sarkozy sat between
the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall,
while his wife Carla sat
on the other side of the table.

Mr Brown was due to sit opposite as well,
but,
judging by the Queen&apos;s comments
picked up by television microphones,
must have taken his seat late.

Conservative leader David Cameron
and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg
were also at the banquet,
where guests enjoyed a four course meal
washed down with vintage wine and champagne.

I don&apos;t often reply to resort reviews,
as everyone has their own experiences good or bad.
However, this one piqued my interest
and had me doing some investigative work.

To set the story straight,
I asked the resort to provide me with
the background on this property.

It appears that some Ballarat locals are confused
about this beautiful properties history and it&apos;s heritage.

The historic Blythewood Grange mansion
where the new WorldMark Ballarat Resort is located,
was originally built using local bluestone blocks in 1878
for James and Jane Leckie.

After raising their family and moving on
at the end of the gold rush,
Dr Higgins, the local Catholic Bishop,
purchased the house and donated the property to
the Sisters of Nazareth.

With the construction of another beautiful building
and chapel on the site,
the property became an agricultural orphanage
for boys (St Josephs).

From 1984 to 2003, the property housed a successful
conference and function business,
during which time reunions of the
&quot;St Josephs Old Boys Association&quot;
were held at the property.

In 2004, the property was renamed WorldMark Ballarat
and joined the South Pacific Club&apos;s network of resort locations.

This property was not and has never been featured
on any current affairs program relating to child abuse.

It appears that The Blythewood Grange
has been confused with two
totally separate children&apos;s homes
in Ballarat:

The Ballarat Orphanage
on Victoria Street Ballarat
(a state-run institution),
and Nazareth House,
on Wendouree Parade Ballarat,
(WHERE THE ONLY ORIGINAL,
&apos;56&quot;Melbourne&quot;
OLYMPIC&quot;MARKER&quot;
still stands...
The OLYMPIC RINGS)
which was an orphanage for girls.

That property still runs under the name of
Nazareth House,
is still run by the same order of nuns,
has been totally rebuilt and refurbished
and now cares for the aged.

Next time you&apos;re in Ballarat, ask the front desk to relay the history
of the property to you. I&apos;m sure they would love to tell you the story.

Sarkozy praises Britain&apos;s &apos;courage&apos;
http://www.orange.co.uk/images/editorial/ITN/story2da6a038325aa0259a55cf0e18ac6fa1_160x120.jpg
Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni


French President Nicolas Sarkozy has praised Britain&apos;s
&apos;determination and courage&apos; in a speech to MPs and peers.

Mr Sarkozy, who flew into Heathrow with his wife Carla Bruni
for their first state visit to the UK,
hailed Westminster as a &apos;touchstone&apos;
for democracies around the world
as he addressed both Houses of Parliament.

He said it was a &apos;signal honour&apos;
for him to be invited to speak at Westminster
during his two-day state visit to the UK.

He said that, through their
struggles for freedom,
the British people have
taught a lesson to the whole world.

Speaking in French, Mr Sarkozy said:
&apos;For the President of the French Republic,
it is a signal honour
indeed to address both Houses of the British Parliament.

&apos;It is indeed in these walls
which house your chambers
that modern political life was born.

&apos;Without your Parliament,
parliamentary democracy
would never have existed
in this shape anywhere
in the world.&apos;

Britain had shown that
parliamentary democracy
was &apos;the best bulwark against tyranny&apos;, said Mr Sarkozy.

&apos;This Parliament arose and stood
through a struggle for the protection
of individual freedoms,
and this is the lesson that you,
the British,
have taught the rest of the world,&apos;
he said.

&apos;This Parliament, your Parliament,
was the first anywhere in the world
to achieve the results
of parliamentary democracy.

&apos;The result of this is that
you represent
the touchstone
of everything
our democracies stand for.&apos;

Mr Sarkozy paid tribute to Britain&apos;s history of
repelling &apos;invincible armadas&apos;
and the
&apos;magnificent accomplishment&apos;
of the Battle of Britain.

&apos;The strength of the British people
has always been that of a free people,
a people that takes its own decisions,
that determines its own fate,
and and is prepared to pay
the ultimate sacrifice
in order to defend its freedoms,&apos; he said.

&apos;How many battles has your nation won
that everyone thought you had lost?
If your nation has been able to face
so many challenges that
seemed impossible to overcome
it is because,
quite simply because,
you believed
that your cause was
a just one.&apos;

While he said that Britain
was seen in many countries
as a &apos;political and human ideal&apos;,
it was with France that it had
the &apos;tightest, closest ties&apos;.

&apos;The destiny of our countries
have been intermingled
for some 1,000 years
since William the Conqueror
landed from Normandy
and wrested the throne
of Edward the Confessor,
right through to the reverse trend
whereby thousands of young British
men and women contributed to
the liberating of Europe,&apos; he said.

While Britain and France had found themselves over the centuries
&apos;locked in combat&apos;
it was
&apos;not because we were too different
but because we were too alike&apos;.

Mr Sarkozy and Ms Bruni
had earlier been greeted at Heathrow Airport
by Prince Charles and
the Duchess of Cornwall
before being driven to
Windsor where they were welcomed by
the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh.

They will stay at Windsor Castle
as guests of the Queen
during their two-day visit.

The trip aims to strengthen the &apos;entente cordiale&apos;
between the two countries and
high-level bilateral talks
are planned between
Mr Sarkozy and Prime Minister Gordon Brown
on Thursday.

The importance of SARKOZY.

And some people here also need to learn some good
manners.
Just randomly bumping into threads.
One of my favourite philosophers was SCHOPENHAUER,
not because of his philosophy but he had some incredible
sense of humour at times.

And he told that only very small details in human behaviour
can tell you almost all you want to know.
One little post by someone and you know already enough.

Learning....

Yep, being curious, looking at all kinds of things.
Don&apos;t stick to your own country as being the centre of the world.
We connect SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, etc,etc.

The game that is being played is a WORLD GAME.
The whole world is connected.

We try here to go beyond language barriers and REAL borders
or BORDERS inside our heads.

Because I live in Holland doesn&apos;t mean Holland is the
centre of the universe. Lot&apos;s of folks think like that and
see their own country as the place where it all happens.

Where do you see KANYA WEST linked to KENYA WEST where
all the ORANGE troubles happen.

I have highlighted the importance of PAUL TIBBETS and linked
it to TIBET. And right now there is mass unrest in TIBET.

http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20080325/sg-tibetchina1.jpg

Big trouble in TIBET.
Yesterday MIA FARROW was on CNN to talk about TIBET and DARFOUR.
Another celeb that plays the&quot;good samaritan&quot;.

Just like RICHARD GERE and Philip GLASS are very much involved
in the TIBETAN cause.

Isn&apos;t it strange that all people, almost all celebs, are worried
about unrest and wars and whatever in the world.

Yet, it never stops. No because those SAME CELEBS are part
of the Illumi brainwashing that is ESSENTIAL in keeping the
world in perpetual wars.....

And that&apos;s one of the things we try to expose here.
The subtle CON GAME that is present in every corner
of the world, and hiding behind different masks.
(yesterday the&quot;caring&quot;mask of MIA FARROW....)
Just keep going everyone - you are all doing a grand job - if people need to make funny comments then let them.
We all see things in different ways around the world - it is only by sharing our opinions that we will keep cracking the code -&quot;they&quot;know we are on the case. By the way - does anyone think that roses are connected to messages passed during the Easter time as Jesus&quot;Rose&quot;on the third day?

SANTO, Texas - A rattlesnake rancher who calls himself Bayou Bob found a new way to make money: Stick a rattler inside a bottle of vodka and market the concoction as an&quot;ancient Asian elixir.&quot;But Bayou Bob Popplewell&apos;s bright idea appears to have landed him on the wrong side of the law, because he has no liquor license. Popplewell, who has raised rattlesnakes and turtles at Bayou Bob&apos;s Brazos River Rattlesnake Ranch for more than two decades, surrendered to authorities Monday. He spent about 10 minutes in jail after the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission obtained arrest warrants on misdemeanor charges of selling alcohol without a license and possessing alcohol with intent to sell.

If convicted, he faces up to a year in jail and $1,000 in fines.

Popplewell said he will fight the charges. His intent, he said, is not to sell an alcoholic beverage but a healing tonic. He said he has customers of Asian descent who believe the concoction has medicinal properties.

&quot;It&apos;s almost a spiritual thing,&quot;said Popplewell, 63.

But alcohol commission agent Scott Jones pointed out that investigators confiscated 429 bottles of snake vodka and one bottle of snake tequila. At $23 a bottle, that&apos;s almost $10,000 worth of reptilian booze.

Even if Popplewell intended his drink be used as a healing tonic an assertion the alcohol commission disputes his use of vodka requires a state permit, authorities said.

&quot;It&apos;s sold for beverage purposes, and he knows what he&apos;s doing,&quot;commission Sgt. Charlie Cloud said.

Popplewell said he uses the cheapest vodka he can find as a preservative for the snakes. The end result is a super sweet mixed drink that Popplewell compared to cough syrup.

&quot;I&apos;ve honestly never seen a person drink it,&quot;he said.

An Asian studies lecturer at the University of Texas said there is some merit to Popplewell&apos;s claim that snake vodka could be seen as a tonic.

There&apos;s a street nicknamed&quot;Snake Alley&quot;in Taipei, Taiwan, where street vendors put the gall bladder of a freshly killed snake into a glass of strong liquor. The drink, sold to the highest bidder, is supposed to improve eyesight and sexual performance, said lecturer Camilla Hsieh.

&quot;It&apos;s like the ancient version of Viagra,&quot;Hsieh said.

EDMONTON, Ontario, March 27 (UPI) -- Animal rights activists are raising a stink in Canada over Lucy the elephant at the Valley Zoo in Edmonton, Alberta, demanding she be moved to a warmer climate.

Voice for Animals sent&quot;elephant dung cookies&quot;to City Hall to&quot;remind councilors that Lucy is still sitting down at the zoo, by herself,&quot;spokeswoman Tove Reece told the Edmonton Sun.&quot;We&apos;ve had a really cold winter. She&apos;s been locked up most of the winter.&quot;

The cookies weren&apos;t actually elephant dung. They were chocolate-colored&quot;vegan squares,&quot;Reece said.

Lucy suffers from arthritis and some respiratory problems and the activists want her sent to an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee. However, city spokesman Robert Moyles said moving her&quot;is not in her best interest.&quot; tintin 27-03-2008, 08:35 PM When you have a reasonable and logical alternative I am open minded enough to listen to YOUR informed contribution.

From the website:

BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA - An Australian woman who stabbed her husband to death because she was tired of being bossed around said an argument over Bruce Springsteen was the last straw.

Karen Lee Cooper pleaded guilty to manslaughter Thursday and was sentenced to eight years in prison for killing partner Kevin Watson in a drunken argument at their home in northeastern Queensland state in July 2006.

Cooper, 50, called an ambulance after suffering what her lawyer Greg Maguire called a&quot;brain snap&quot;and stabbing Watson, 49, once in the chest with a kitchen knife. He died at the scene.

Cooper told police she had become fed up with Waston telling her what to do during their two-year relationship. On the night of the killing, she tried to play a Springsteen CD and he took if off the stereo, triggering a bitter argument. emerald 27-03-2008, 08:42 PM Monroe County woman killed in crash

A 49-year-old Price Township woman was killed in a two-vehicle crash 200 feet from her house this morning, the Monroe County Coroner&apos;s Office said.

Patrice Fish, of Circle H Road, was pronounced dead at the scene, the coroner&apos;s office said. Death was caused by multiple blunt force trauma, the coroner&apos;s office said.

State police at Swiftwater said the accident happened at 7:30 a.m. when Fish drove out from Circle H Road, heading south on Route 447. Her vehicle was struck by another vehicle driven by Scott A. Bartolacci, 43, of East Stroudsburg, who was northbound on Route 447, police said.

Bartolacci suffered minor injuries, police said.

GROOTE EYLANDT, Australia, March 27 (UPI) -- Police in northeastern Australia said they saved an intoxicated&quot;idiot&quot;from a grisly fate between the jaws of a saltwater crocodile.

Officers said onlookers spotted the crocodile stalking the drunken man, who was swimming out to sea on a dare, The Daily Telegraph reported Thursday.

&quot;People saw this large crocodile in the water nearby and saw this idiot swimming out towards the croc trap,&quot;Police Cmdr. Colin Smith said.&quot;They called police who got there fairly quickly.&quot;

An officer who arrived at the scene fired his semi-automatic pistol at the crocodile.

&quot;The first one either hit the croc or put him off because it swam under the water,&quot;Smith said.&quot;But it was still headed in the man&apos;s direction and this is when police fired more shots ... to give him time to reach the shore. No one doubts the actions of police saved this fella.&quot;

Smith said police are considering whether to take disciplinary action against the drunken swimmer.



Snake secretly lives with woman for months

ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 26 (UPI) -- A Maryland woman discovered a large black python may have been secretly living in her apartment for two months, animal control officers said.

The woman, who said she&apos;d spent two months living in her apartment, was watching television Wednesday when she first saw the large python slither out from the back of her TV set, WBAL-TV, Baltimore, reported. She reportedly called animal control officers, who were able to remove the snake from her home.

An animal control official said the python may have belonged to a past tenant of the apartment, WBAL reported.

Animal control authorities are giving the python&apos;s owner five days to come claim it at their facility, Anne Arundel County police said. majicdragon 27-03-2008, 08:53 PM mandala |ˈmandələ;ˈmən-|

The members include Desmond Tutu, South African archbishop emeritus of Capetown; former U.S. President Jimmy Carter; former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan; Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and Mohammed Yunus, the Nobel laureate and founder of the Green Bank in Bangladesh.

The group plans to get involved in the world&apos;s problems -- climate change, pandemics like AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, violent conflicts.

BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA - An Australian woman who stabbed her husband to death because she was tired of being bossed around said an argument over Bruce Springsteen was the last straw.

Karen Lee Cooper pleaded guilty to manslaughter Thursday and was sentenced to eight years in prison for killing partner Kevin Watson in a drunken argument at their home in northeastern Queensland state in July 2006.

Cooper, 50, called an ambulance after suffering what her lawyer Greg Maguire called a&quot;brain snap&quot;and stabbing Watson, 49, once in the chest with a kitchen knife. He died at the scene.

Cooper told police she had become fed up with Waston telling her what to do during their two-year relationship. On the night of the killing, she tried to play a Springsteen CD and he took if off the stereo, triggering a bitter argument.

A South Australian wine collector
has paid a record price for a bottle of
1951 Penfolds Grange.

The buyer paid just over $50,000
in an auction for the bottle,
one of about 20 thought to be left
from the vintage.

The vendor is an Adelaide wine collector.

A spokeswoman for Oddbins wine auctioneers
says the price is the highest ever paid
for a bottle of red wine in Australia.

I LISTENED to my Grandfather
when our Uncle got their first TV.
(Our house followed years later.)

&quot;IT ISN&apos;T TRUE, IT&apos;S JUST STORIES&quot;

He told us to LOOK at THE WORLD
but NOT BELIEVE THE STORIES,
so I could &apos;hear&apos; EVOLUTION this
and EVOLUTION that, but I WATCHED
the LAND, WEATHER, FLORA&amp;FAUNA
etcetera, and THOUGHT FOR MYSELF.

So again, where exactly do the majority of
the World&apos;s population get their&quot;WORLD VIEW&quot;,
but from THE MEDIA, the MOST EFFECTIVE

but as most as still waiting for the

top suffer a&quot;Falling Away&quot;,
due to this SHORT, CONSTRICTED,
&quot;TIME LINE&quot;SOLD to us, they forget
that CHRIST told us,
THE FALSE PROPHETS WERE ALREADY THERE,
WAYYYYY BACK THEN.

So, NO, far from make God in my image,
I do what He told us to do, by studying
what IS in ALL His Creation and REFUSE

Theres a bear in the woods
March 27, 2008 7:00 pm | by Duncan

Hal Riney, who has just died,
worked with Ronald Reagan in 1984
to present the Ready for Peace
presidential election campaign,
justifying Reagans push to
maintain the arms race
with the Soviet Union.

Hal Riney himself provided
the voiceover for the ad
featuring a brown bear
wandering through the wild.

Theres a bear in the woods.
For some people the bear is easy to see.
Others dont see it at all.
Some people say the bear is tame.
Others say it is vicious and dangerous.
Since no one can be sure
whos right and whos wrong,
isnt it smart to be as strong as the bear,
if there is a bear?

Ronald Reagan TV Ad:&quot;The Bear&quot;- YouTube

The ad finishes with a picture of Ronald Reagan,
with the slogan, Prepared for Peace.

So what is the bear about?
Is it about the pro-gun lobby,
supporting the rights of hunters?
Is it about the dangers posed
by a changing environment?
Or is this a reference to the Soviet Union?
Despite Reagans portrayal
of the Soviet Union as an evil empire,
Reagan eventually collaborated
with Mikhail Gorbachev
to begin the downsizing of
both countries nuclear arsenals.

Was it really about the bear market?

the Bear in the Woods advertisement.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In 2004 when his hit television comedy&quot;Friends&quot;ended, David Schwimmer longed to direct a feature film, and four years later his debut movie&quot;Run FatBoy Run&quot;finally rolls into theaters on Friday. Schwimmer, nominated for an Emmy as the quirky Dr. Ross Geller on&quot;Friends,&quot;honed his directing skills on stage in Chicago for years and directed several&quot;Friends&quot;episodes.

He was attached to direct&quot;Run FatBoy Run&quot;even before&quot;Friends&quot;left the air but the movie languished with an American production company that was unable to get it off the ground for a variety of reasons.

Still, Schwimmer, 41, stuck by plans to make&quot;Run FatBoy Run&quot;his film-directing debut because, he said, it had a lot of heart.

&quot;I&apos;d been reading a lot of scripts and this was the first one I laughed out loud at throughout. More importantly, I was really moved by the story,&quot;he told Reuters.

The comedy revolves around a hapless, overweight security guard named Dennis (Simon Pegg) who abandons his pregnant fiancee Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar. Realizing his mistake years later, Dennis tries to win back Libby by running in a marathon against her new boyfriend.

At the same time, he is trying to build a relationship with his son, now about 6 years old. Seeing his earnest effort, his friends and family rally around him.

Schwimmer describes&quot;Run FatBoy&quot;as&quot;three movies in one&quot;-- a broad physical comedy, a love story and a sports movie.

&quot;I thought it was big enough that it would really push me and really challenge me,&quot;he said.

15 APRIL emerald 28-03-2008, 02:52 PM Parents pick prayer over docs; girl dies
WESTON, Wis. - Police are investigating an 11-year-old girl&apos;s death from an undiagnosed, treatable form of diabetes after her parents chose to pray for her rather than take her to a doctor. An autopsy showed Madeline Neumann died Sunday of diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition that left too little insulin in her body, Everest Metro Police Chief Dan Vergin said.

She had probably been ill for about a month, suffering symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, loss of appetite and weakness, the chief said Wednesday, noting that he expects to complete the investigation by Friday and forward the results to the district attorney.

The girl&apos;s mother, Leilani Neumann, said that she and her family believe in the Bible and that healing comes from God, but that they do not belong to an organized religion or faith, are not fanatics and have nothing against doctors.

She insisted her youngest child, a wiry girl known to wear her straight brown hair in a ponytail, was in good health until recently.

&quot;We just noticed a tiredness within the past two weeks,&quot;she said Wednesday.&quot;And then just the day before and that day (she died), it suddenly just went to a more serious situation. We stayed fast in prayer then. We believed that she would recover. We saw signs that to us, it looked like she was recovering.&quot;

Her daughter who hadn&apos;t seen a doctor since she got some shots as a 3-year-old, according to Vergin had no fever and there was warmth in her body, she said.

The girl&apos;s father, Dale Neumann, a former police officer, said he started CPR&quot;as soon as the breath of life left&quot;his daughter&apos;s body.

Family members elsewhere called authorities to seek help for the girl.

&quot;My sister-in-law, she&apos;s very religious, she believes in faith instead of doctors ...,&quot;the girl&apos;s aunt told a sheriff&apos;s dispatcher Sunday afternoon in a call from California.&quot;And she called my mother-in-law today ... and she explained to us that she believes her daughter&apos;s in a coma now and she&apos;s relying on faith.&quot;

The dispatcher got more information from the caller and asked whether an ambulance should be sent.

&quot;Please,&quot;the woman replied.&quot;I mean, she&apos;s refusing. She&apos;s going to fight it. ... We&apos;ve been trying to get her to take her to the hospital for a week, a few days now.&quot;

The aunt called back with more information on the family&apos;s location, emergency logs show. Family friends also made a 911 call from the home. Police and paramedics arrived within minutes and immediately called for an ambulance that took her to a hospital.

But less than an hour after authorities reached the home, Madeline a bright student who left public school for home schooling this semester was declared dead.

She is survived by her parents and three older siblings.

&quot;We are remaining strong for our children,&quot;Leilani Neumann said.&quot;Only our faith in God is giving us strength at this time.&quot;

WESTON, Wis. - Police are investigating an 11-year-old girl&apos;s death from an undiagnosed, treatable form of diabetes after her parents chose to pray for her rather than take her to a doctor. An autopsy showed Madeline Neumann died Sunday of diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition that left too little insulin in her body, Everest Metro Police Chief Dan Vergin said.

She had probably been ill for about a month, suffering symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, loss of appetite and weakness, the chief said Wednesday, noting that he expects to complete the investigation by Friday and forward the results to the district attorney.

The girl&apos;s mother, Leilani Neumann, said that she and her family believe in the Bible and that healing comes from God, but that they do not belong to an organized religion or faith, are not fanatics and have nothing against doctors.

She insisted her youngest child, a wiry girl known to wear her straight brown hair in a ponytail, was in good health until recently.

&quot;We just noticed a tiredness within the past two weeks,&quot;she said Wednesday.&quot;And then just the day before and that day (she died), it suddenly just went to a more serious situation. We stayed fast in prayer then. We believed that she would recover. We saw signs that to us, it looked like she was recovering.&quot;

Her daughter who hadn&apos;t seen a doctor since she got some shots as a 3-year-old, according to Vergin had no fever and there was warmth in her body, she said.

The girl&apos;s father, Dale Neumann, a former police officer, said he started CPR&quot;as soon as the breath of life left&quot;his daughter&apos;s body.

Family members elsewhere called authorities to seek help for the girl.

&quot;My sister-in-law, she&apos;s very religious, she believes in faith instead of doctors ...,&quot;the girl&apos;s aunt told a sheriff&apos;s dispatcher Sunday afternoon in a call from California.&quot;And she called my mother-in-law today ... and she explained to us that she believes her daughter&apos;s in a coma now and she&apos;s relying on faith.&quot;

The dispatcher got more information from the caller and asked whether an ambulance should be sent.

&quot;Please,&quot;the woman replied.&quot;I mean, she&apos;s refusing. She&apos;s going to fight it. ... We&apos;ve been trying to get her to take her to the hospital for a week, a few days now.&quot;

The aunt called back with more information on the family&apos;s location, emergency logs show. Family friends also made a 911 call from the home. Police and paramedics arrived within minutes and immediately called for an ambulance that took her to a hospital.

But less than an hour after authorities reached the home, Madeline a bright student who left public school for home schooling this semester was declared dead.

She is survived by her parents and three older siblings.

&quot;We are remaining strong for our children,&quot;Leilani Neumann said.&quot;Only our faith in God is giving us strength at this time.&quot;

The Neumanns said they moved from California to a modern, middle-class home in woodsy Weston, just outside Wassau in central Wisconsin, about two years ago to open a coffee shop and be closer to other relatives. A basketball hoop is set up in the driveway.

Leilani Neumann said she and her husband are not worried about the investigation because&quot;our lives are in God&apos;s hands. We know we did not do anything criminal. We know we did the best for our daughter we knew how to do.&quot;

A 46-year-old Emmaus man has been arrested in connection with a robbery today at Hartzell&apos;s Pharmacy in Catasauqua, borough police said.

Chief Douglas Kish said David Hetrick, of 280 Powder Mill Road, allegedly entered the pharmacy around 12:50 p.m and went behind the counter after being told not to do so. Hetrick allegedly grabbed some pain medication and fled. No money was taken, police said.

After police put out a description of the suspect and his vehicle, Hetrick&apos;s car was stopped at 1:10 p.m. at Cedar Crest Boulevard and Hamilton Street in South Whitehall Township. Officers brought him back to the pharmacy, where he was identified.

Kish said Hetrick apparently had been at Easton Hospital earlier in the day for treatment of unknown injuries. Kish called an ambulance to the pharmacy and had Hetrick examined before police took him away. emerald 28-03-2008, 08:38 PM Student apologizes after his electronics project sparks a scare in NYC subway

NEW YORK - A college student has apologized for causing a scare on a New York city subway train when his science project short-circuited and started smoking in his backpack.

Gregory Kats, 29, says the device was just a model of an elevator&apos;s inner workings. But it frightened riders on a B train near the Seventh Avenue stop on Thursday.

Kats says he tried to reassure his fellow passengers that it was a school project - not a bomb - but people scrambled for the exits nonetheless.

The box he was holding had a small battery, wires and a motor.

Kats, who was questioned by police and later released, says next time he&apos;ll be much more careful and keep his electronic projects at home. emerald 28-03-2008, 08:49 PM Poodle dog tired after 16-puppy litter

CHILLIWACK, British Columbia, March 27 (UPI) -- A standard poodle in Chilliwack, British Columbia, had an anything-but-standard litter of puppies, delivering a record 16 little pups.

Charlie, named after the popular TV show&quot;Charlie&apos;s Angels,&quot;began the birthing process March 17 around dinner time and didn&apos;t finish until the afternoon of March 18, The Province newspaper in Vancouver reported.

&quot;I was up for 23 hours straight,&quot;said Charlie&apos;s owner, Deborah Bridgman, a dog breeder and pet shop owner in Chilliwack.

The births of the 10 female and six male pups began on St. Patrick&apos;s Day.

&quot;There was lots of green fluid, and that&apos;s typical in birthing,&quot;Bridgman said.&quot;I could&apos;ve done with a green beer halfway through it, I tell you.&quot;

Canadian Kennel Club spokesman Andrew Patton confirmed that 16 puppies is a Canadian record for poodles, eclipsing the previous record of 14 set in 2005.

Bridgman said she thinks Charlie also set a world record for standard poodles, but she is awaiting confirmation from the Guinness World Records. emerald 28-03-2008, 08:54 PM Not gonna make it pass unnoticed.

Something BIG is coming to California and people will
LOCKED up en masse, INVOLUNTARY.

Just look at the horror in New Orleans. People tend to forget, but
what happened in the SUPERDOME for instance was DANTE&apos;S HELL.
But only an appetizer for things to come.

California is the main event.

The drummer of van HALEN was ALEX van Halen.
Currently married to Audrey WILSON and a son called MALCOLM.

WILSON and MALCOLM are key names.
MALCOLM and the VOLCANO and DAY of the DEAD.
WILSON as discussed many times.

WOODROW WILSON, the president that installed the FEDERAL RESERVE.
It started with WILSON and the VOLLEYBAL WILSON shows
how it all ends....

DROWNING....

OWEN WILSON and his suicide attempt. And the CAR movie.

It was PROMETHEUS that gave FIRE to the PEOPLE.

We combine here.
5150 is clearly associated with CALIFORNIA.
CALIFORNIA is part of the RING OF FIRE.

GEERT WILDERs.
He made a little movie called FITNA and it was seen
on the internet.

For weeks now this guy grabs all the headlines.

A ridiculous propaganda movie.
It was so bad I had to laugh.

How many tricks and lies can you put in sixteen minutes...

There is more to it.
he is GEERT WILDERS.

G.W.

Coincidenty G.W. will destroy america pretty soon.

Movie was made by a guy called the Scarlet Pimpernel.

http://kilby.sac.on.ca/towerslibrary/pages/users/Video%20-%20The%20Scarlet%20Pimpernel%20-%20Mademoiselle%20Guillotine.jpg

The SCARLET PIMPERNEL saved people from the GUILLOTINE.
FRENCH REVOLUTION. The BLADES. THE SHAVING of CALIFORNIA.
THE DEMON BARBER of FLEET STREET.

It&apos;s all part of the big BARBER, SHAVING ritual.

Jerry Sanders was born QUATORZE JUILLET.
The GUILLOTINE started after BASTILLE DAY.

Geert Wilders, G.W., was born 6 September.
61 days later LAURA BUSH killed MICHAEL DOUGLAS. 16 days
after that KENNEDY was KILLED.

61 and 16. Bush and Laur are both 61 years old, Michael Douglas
was born the 16th of november (16-11) he died 6-11.

This year 15 APRIL will be the 106th day of the year.

Geert Wilders was born 77 days before the Kennedy murder.
77 and Perfection.

The FITNA movie was shown on 27 MARCH, day SAN DIEGO was
incorportated. It&apos;s all much bigger. Just one little piece of the puzzle.

In that SCARLET PIMPERNAL story ARMAND and MARGUERITA
play a vital role. ARMANDO MARADONA and MARGUERITA as PEARL.

Scarlett KEELING

See the TATTOO?
When you go to the GUILLOTINE you head is chopped off.
And the NECK and THROAT is the place where it happens.

SCARLETT KEELING.

THROAT is KEEL

Throat is KEEL in dutch.
And when you CUT SOMEONES&apos;s THROAT it&apos;s called KELEN
KEELING and KELEN.

Coincidently in that FITNA move by SCARLETT you see
exactly that happen...... emerald 29-03-2008, 11:36 AM Steven Seagull returns to motel for cake

DULUTH, Minn. - Steven Seagull has returned to the Super 8 motel here, looking for his customary cake doughnut. Year after year, the ring-billed gull has tapped at the lobby&apos;s front door until a staff member gives him the doughnut, said general manager Jodi Chambers.&quot;If it&apos;s quiet in the lobby, you can hear him tapping on it,&quot;Chambers said.&quot;But if we&apos;re busy, he starts squawking like crazy.&quot;

Steven returned Wednesday.

Chambers said she&apos;s sure it&apos;s the same bird because he behaves the same way every year. For one thing, Steven chases away other gulls looking for his food.

&quot;We don&apos;t feed them if there&apos;s more than one, and he&apos;s figured that out,&quot;Chambers said.

Leslie Larsen, the education director of the Lake Superior Zoo, said Steven Seagull has learned to respond to positive reinforcement.

&quot;What I do know is that animals, they don&apos;t necessarily have to be intelligent to respond to what we call operant conditioning,&quot;she said.&quot;Without knowing it or meaning to, they&apos;ve trained that gull. They&apos;ve given him a positive consequence to come back.&quot;

Whatever the reason, Chambers said Steven is a hit.&quot;The guests love it,&quot;she said.&quot;I&apos;ve had a few come in and say &apos;We came to check out your bird.&apos;&quot;

STEVEN SEAGULL = of course, STEVEN SEAGAL, cited by wiki at first as NATIVE AMERICAN, but he has nothing to do with the NATIVES, having an IRISH mom and a JEWISH dad. Moreover, that CHAMBERS name reminded me of MARILYN CHAMBERS, the star BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR, born 22.04.1952 in PROVIDENCE, RHOSE ISLAND. At one point in her life, he married a guy named DOUG. emerald 29-03-2008, 11:39 AM Woman, 77, saves mail carrier from dog

HIGHLAND, Ind. - A 77-year-old woman used her car to drive off a large dog that was attacking a mail carrier, saving the woman from more bite wounds. Joan Michniewicz was backing out of her driveway when she heard Danielle Lawrence, 28, scream on Monday afternoon. Michniewicz drove at the mixed-breed dog and then yelled for Lawrence to jump in her car.

&quot;I&apos;m so lucky,&quot;said Lawrence, who has been on the job less than two months.&quot;If she hadn&apos;t come, I would have been tore up worse than I was.&quot;

Lawrence suffered several bite wounds before Michniewicz arrived. The dog had pushed open a backyard gate and attacked her while she was walking up to a mailbox.

&quot;It was a very frightening thing,&quot;said Michniewicz, a retired construction office manager.&quot;But I thought, &apos;I just have to help this poor girl.&apos;&quot;

Police ticketed dog owner Sandra Kulchawick for allowing her pet to run loose.

Lawrence has been reassigned to a motor route.

&quot;I don&apos;t want to say I&apos;m traumatized. But I am upset,&quot;she said.&quot;When I see a dog now, I get upset and fearful.&quot; emerald 29-03-2008, 11:42 AM Man wakes up inside a garbage truck

MUNCIE, Ind. - A man nearly crushed inside a garbage truck told police he can&apos;t recall how he ended up inside a trash bin and then the truck after a night of drinking with friends. A Rumpke garbage truck driver had emptied a bin behind the Muncie Eye Center into his truck and was about to activate its trash compressor when he heard someone screaming.

&quot;He looked up and this gentleman was standing out the top of our truck,&quot;said Larry Green, market safety supervisor for Rumpke.

Green said the only thing Bowen said to the driver who found him was that he was cold.

&quot;This gentleman was extremely intoxicated,&quot;he said.

Bowen told police the last thing he remembers before waking up in the truck was drinking with buddies about 3 a.m. Thursday at a Muncie bar.

Bowen, who wouldn&apos;t tell police who his drinking pals were, was treated and released with minor injuries from Ball Memorial Hospital.

Green said Bowen was lucky that wasn&apos;t seriously injured or killed in the trash compressor.

&quot;I&apos;m just glad it turned out the way it did,&quot;Green said.&quot;We didn&apos;t have a body that was dead. We had a body that was talking.&quot;

There was no telephone listing for Bowen in the Muncie area. bobjob123 29-03-2008, 12:07 PM Its the first time I have been on this site I am new to this I was very impressed by Mr Ickes books my age is 69 yrs old.

Just posted bout FRANKENSTEIN.
GENE WILDER was FRANKENSTEIN.

GENE wilder was born 4773 days before the other GW in the White house.

4773 is 777 + 6 X 666

Or it is 111 and 7 X 777.

These numbers are NO COINCIDENCE at all.
They control us by way of NUMBERS.
NUMBERS are the BOSS. When a NUMBER says in some
LAW book that you are not allowed this or that
the people pbey that NUMBER instead of their HEARTS.

Some stunning example I heard yesterday.
THEO van GOGH was KILLEd in Holand a few years ago.
The day after it happened his little son did not go to school.

But they got a letter that told the little guy would be PUNISHED for that.
I am not kidding. It happened and lot&apos;s more in that case.

That&apos;s how they want folks to BE.
Like ROBOTS in the SYSTEM.

You see American security at airports already behaving like that.
Only an appetizer folks....

The DOGS of WAR.

DOGS and MAIL means MESSAGE.

DOG is the opposite of GOD.
Dogs LEAD the BLIND.

Dogs are extremeley loyal.

That is moving, but also a bit scary.
They like soldiers to be that way. No questions. LOYALTY, whatever
the BOSS orders you, just do it.

As a reward those soldiers get MEDALS for BRAVERY.
I would call them medals for STUPIDITY.

Wars are MADNESS and people should refuse to fight in them

Thanks in advance.

Very significant.
You know my WIKI fetish (I know, a bit perverse...) and so
at some point I was looking at the info they present
on the pictures.

If you click on a Picture then you will see all kinds
of info. Just scroll down a bit.
Let me give an example.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Bush-laura-barney.jpg

I just was looking into info on WACO texas and looked
at the info on this pic.

You can see what USER has posted the pic, the DATE they
posted it, the date the picture was taken, lot&apos;s of info.

You know about the importance of the number 43.
this WACO PIC has a file size of

43 kb

See? WACO stands for the BURNING of their own Citizens.
So very important symboliclly.
Bush is President number 43 and here 43 KB......

There are better and some staggering examples, but
just to give you an idea that every little detail
can be important.

The pic is 515 X 411 pixels. Just today I have discussed the number
5150. That is the number for an involuntary lock up.
(People that seem mentally disordered.)

Section 5150 of CALIFORNIA&apos;s Welfare and institutions code.
INVOLUNTARY PSYCHIATRIC HOLD.

So now we have TWO important numbers connected
to BUSH and WACO.

43 and 5150.

Not a big jump to FRANKENSTEIN.....
Eddie van Halens Studio was called 5150....
Google 5150 and you see the FRANKENSTRAT guitar.....
Can go on and on about the VAN HALENS as well but
hope you get my point.....

Vera Susa is a master in juggling with these things.... pri01 29-03-2008, 05:00 PM Thanks for that, it makes better sense. Whenever I clicked an image and looked at the higher resolution I never looked beyond that.

Just been thinking about the Anti Christ and stuff that you posted a lot about Dutch Royal family. If you replace the words Anti Christ with numbers ie. A/1 C/3 = 13.

We see 13 quite a bit. Look at the B in the trade name for the movie Beowulf.
1752

Also if you look at the big M outside any Mcdonalds diner it is alway shown sitting on a line. So when it is turned on its side it lokks like the number 13. Can&apos;t find a close up picture for that at the moment, sorry. You may have touched on this way back but I don&apos;t ever stop thinking about things like this.

Turn it 45 degrees and you have number 13.
The M is the 13th letter and the AC (13) comes from the 13th
satanic bloodline.

It is indeed hard to let it go.
Once you see certain things you cannot
pretend to be blind anymore. Yo cannot GO BACK
unless you prefer your ignorant state.

Awareness in general is the only way to end this PRISON.
GUNS won&apos;t do the trick.
They have far better guns, and even weapons that we don&apos;t
know of. So I don&apos;t really trust those GUN advocates.
Do they really think KILLING will heal the world?

Just look at Israel and see what THEIR VIOLENT solution brings.
ETERNAL WAR and the WRATH of a BILLION plus muslims.

Suppose they would be Christian all of a sudden.
Suppose they would compensate all the palestinians and
would forgive everything.

They would be the most popular people on EARTH
and everybody would live happily everafter.
And they also wouldn&apos;t have to be afraid anymore of GOD, by
living according to RIDICULOUS rituals that strangles you
wherever you are and whereever you go.
God wants us to be free, free of that nonsense.
(Of all the organized religious nonsense.)

But that would also mean the end of that SATANIC racist religion.
And that&apos;s EXACTLY what they DON&apos;T WANT.
And also the end of the MYTHICAL SUFFERING CHOSEN
people which has a strange kind of ROMANTIC attraction
to a lot of people.

There is nothing ROMANTIC about POGROMS.
And there will be new pogroms again.
Because SATAN wants it that way and the SATANIC ELITE
is very eager to assist....... tintin 29-03-2008, 06:23 PM http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/GeneWilderMay07.jpg/470px-GeneWilderMay07.jpg

JENSON BUTTON has everything to do with RED BUTTON.

The RED BUTTON means the NUKE BUTTON. And that
means DEATH on a MASS SCALE.
See the number on his chest?

Number of DEATH.
And that makes a lot of sense in the case of JENSON BUTTON.
He won his first Grand prix in 2006 on 6 AUGUST.

Button won on
HIROSHIMA DAY.

You could call that a RED BUTTON day.
was race number 13 of the season.
He won it after

113 races.

All over the world they use the term GRAND PRIX.

MAGNOLIA, Ark. - Blake Icenhower got a one-ton wake-up call. As the 19-year-old laid in bed Friday morning at a hotel, co-worker Hoby Armstrong went outside to start his Dodge diesel truck. Armstrong said he started the engine and stepped out of the cab.

That&apos;s when the lifted truck roared through the motel&apos;s brick-and-mortar wall, pushed aside a bed and went toward Icenhower. Icenhower said Armstrong was able to jump back into the cab and stop the truck a foot away from hitting him.

Armstrong suffered a scrape to his arm.

If the truck had struck two brick support beams less than five feet away, the top floor might have collapsed, motel owner Ken Patel said.

Read&amp;laughed, couldnt help it. The name of the town made me think of the movie STEEL MAGNOLIAS. Besides, we got an EISENHOWER spelled differently, a BLACK EISENHOWER. And he was indeed... emerald 29-03-2008, 11:31 PM 5 dead in Canada plane crash

CALGARY, Alberta, March 28 (UPI) -- Five people were killed in a small plane crash near Wainwright, Alberta, Canadian officials said Friday.

The names of the four men and woman killed were withheld pending the notification of relatives.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the wreckage was located around noon northeast of Wainwright near the Battle River, Canwest News Service reported.

The aircraft apparently was en route to Winnipeg through Edmonton. The federal Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

The six-seat plane is a single-engine Piper Malibu PA-46, registered to A.D. Williams Engineering in Edmonton, the report said. The company&apos;s chief executive officer, Allan D. Williams, was killed in a plane crash in British Columbia in late October which his 3-year-old granddaughter survived. tintin 29-03-2008, 11:33 PM Tintin.

WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn., March 28 (UPI) -- Workers and residents at a White Bear Lake, Minn., apartment complex say an ornery turkey has been attacking them and damaging their cars.

Residents said most of the turkeys that wandered into the area last fall are docile and even friendly birds, but one 20-pound turkey has been chasing children and last week tackled and attacked 250-pound maintenance man Pete Wright, the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press reported Friday.

Wright, 52, who is not a small man at 6 feet, 2 inches, said the aggressive land fowl knocked him over and began beating him mercilessly with its wings.

&quot;Those wings hurt,&quot;he said.

Residents said they fear for the safety of their children in the area, and no outside location is considered safe so long as the bird is at large. Apartment manager Kelly Wright said she has been given permission to capture or humanely kill the offending turkey, but it has so far eluded her attempts.

Bryan Lueth, a state wildlife supervisor, said the turkey has likely become aggressive due to the start of mating season.

&quot;The increasing day length is getting their hormones fired up,&quot;he said.&quot;One turkey is dominant. He starts to identify people as turkeys.&quot;


Public names Minnesota apple Frostbite

MINNEAPOLIS, March 29 (UPI) -- A contest to rename a Minnesota apple called MN447 has produced an appropriate name for a fruit developed in the Upper Midwest: Frostbite.

The brainchild of two University of Minnesota horticulture scientists, the contest gathered a variety of name suggestions and after slowly narrowing down their choices, Frostbite was the clear winner, the Star Tribune reported Saturday.

&quot;It was a little like letting your friends at work choose the name of your child,&quot;university Professor Jim Luby told the Minneapolis newspaper.

Lisa Rolf, who was one of eight people who suggested Frostbite, said she took the naming process seriously and even created a matching slogan for the apple.

&quot;If you want to reach for one of these apples, you better protect your extremities,&quot;the Minnesota resident&apos;s proposed slogan reads.

The university&apos;s breeding program helped create the new apple and one of the program&apos;s top officials, David Bedford, told the newspaper the small apple tastes like&quot;raw sugarcane on steroids.&quot; emerald 29-03-2008, 11:38 PM Mexican bull thrown in jail for devouring corn fields, destroying shacks

SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico - A prisoner is behind bars in southern Mexico for acting beastly.

Residents of a town in the southern state of Chiapas say the bull devoured their corn crops and destroyed two wooden shops. So they had it thrown in the slammer.

Police say the bull will not be released until the owner pays damages, to be determined by a local judge.

The owner, Moises Santiz, says he&apos;ll pay a maximum of $400.

That&apos;s the same price he forked over for the bull four months ago.

Santiz says he bought the animal on Nov. 4 and let him out to graze.

The bull disappeared on March 1 and was later found tied up on the patio of a private home in the town of Canalumtic.

It&apos;s not the first time an animal has been jailed in Chiapas. Last year, a dog was locked up for 12 days after biting someone. His owners were ordered to pay a $18 fine. emerald 29-03-2008, 11:41 PM Man Allegedly Shoots Cat &apos;To Get Even&apos;

BOULDER Police say a man shot a cat with a rifle and sent e-mails to relatives to tell them he did it&quot;to get even&quot;with his wife.

Longmont police say they arrested 50-year-old Paul John Vickers Wednesday after his wife&apos;s sister told police of the e-mail in which Vickers wrote about killing&quot;Bootsie.&quot;Police Sergeant Tim Lewis says the married couple was involved in a long-running argument and Vickers was angry at his wife.

Police found the cat&apos;s body in a pond near where Vickers lives and say&quot;Bootsie&quot;was shot while in the couple&apos;s basement.

Vickers is being held at the Boulder County Jail on $25,000 bond. He faces charges of felony animal abuse, domestic violence and harassment. emerald 29-03-2008, 11:58 PM Web tip leads mom to Asia, abducted son

NEW YORK - Tiffany Rubin had all but given up hope of ever seeing her abducted child again when she received an anonymous tip through her MySpace page. Someone had spotted her 7-year-old son and her ex-boyfriend in South Korea. The Queens special education teacher caught a 15-hour flight to South Korea on Sunday. She sneaked into her son&apos;s school, found Kobe Lee in a classroom, disguised him with a wig and sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy before bringing him home Wednesday.

&quot;It&apos;s great,&quot;Rubin said.&quot;I never thought this day would come.&quot;

Her ordeal began on Aug. 21, after her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Salko disappeared with their child after a visit. At the time, he had joint custody of their son but was facing up to six months in jail for not paying child support. The boy lived with his mother and saw his father on alternate weekends.

Kobe&apos;s court-appointed law guardian, Joseph Fredericks, had recommended Rubin receive sole custody.

&quot;They were constantly at war over this child,&quot;Fredericks said of the parents, who separated when Kobe was 4 months old.

After Salko disappeared with her child, Rubin was afraid her ex, born in South Korea, had taken the boy abroad.

&quot;I was just basically panicking,&quot;said Rubin, 30.&quot;I was hoping they were still in the United States.&quot;

Her fears were realized when she hacked into Salko&apos;s e-mail account, she said. She discovered an e-mail he had sent to a friend saying he was flying to South Korea and wasn&apos;t coming back.

Mark Miller, founder of the American Association for Lost Children Inc., a Christian charity that recovers missing children, persuaded her to put him on the case.

&quot;She was so distraught,&quot;Miller said.&quot;Her whole world was taken from her.&quot;

The FBI issued a warrant for Salko&apos;s arrest, but Rubin didn&apos;t get her big break until January.

She received a message on her MySpace page from someone who had seen her son and knew where he went to school. Shortly after, she received a phone call from Kobe telling her he missed her and Salko was listening in. Rubin said her son wasn&apos;t aware he had been kidnapped.

Shortly after, she flew to South Korea with Miller and Bazzel Baz, chief executive officer of the nonprofit Association for the Recovery of Children, to recover Kobe.

The men surveyed the school while Rubin waited in a hotel. Security appeared to be lax, Rubin said, and the next day she went to her son&apos;s classroom and called his name.

&quot;I was like, oh my God,&quot;Kobe said.&quot;I can&apos;t believe she&apos;s here.&quot;

Rubin explained who she was to her son&apos;s teacher and said she needed a minute to speak with him. Then mother and son walked out of the building and hailed a cab to the American embassy. tintin 30-03-2008, 12:08 AM tin tin great work as usual bro.

what do you think of the dates march 5th and march 26th, i would love to have your analysis.

OK. 26 MARCH. Only recently the importance of the state
of TENESSEE became clear to me.
But by combining a few things I learned that it&apos;s the symbolic
state where AMERICA&apos;s dream died.

Started with my investigation into D DAY.
Been busy looking into that especially since DANIEL DAY LEWIS.
Then came the importance of the number 4, as the 4th letter.
D DAY is 4-4.

I saw that MARIN LUTHER KING Died in Memphis TENNESSEE
and ELVIS, the other King, as well.
MLK died 4 APRIL. 4-4.

And that&apos;s when I realized that the DREAM died in TENNESSEE.
From that moment I looked into TENNESSEE WILLIAMS

The TENNIS sport is Dominated by the WILLIAMS sisters.
WILLIAMS and TENNIS and TENNESSEE WILLIAMS.
TENNIS as the 666 sport where 6-0 6-0 6-0 is the perfect gme.
And the FED EXPRESS is ROGER FEDERER.
Headquarters FED EXPRESS is located in MEMPHIS TENNESSEE.....

TENNESSEE Williams was born in the year 911.
(1911) on 26 MARCH. So there you have an import little link in
the whole circus.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/172880.1010.A.jpg

Just yesterday I posted about this one.
ROSE, WALLIS, TATTOO (marks...)

All linked to each other.
27 March, is the day SAN DIEGO was incorporated.
All these dates have a different&quot;weight&quot;but you can only measure
that weight if you combine the right things.

Yesyerday I heard that KYLIE Minogue plans to marry with
Olivier Martinez, and only recently I know that MARTINEZ is
linked to a NUCLEAR POWER plant in SAN DIEGO.
(EDUARDO MENDOZA, city of Marvels)
Means all of a sudden this marriage is far more important.
have posted yesterday about it....

So it&apos;s a continuing proces where every day THE BIG PICTURE
becomes a bit more clear....
To really make a flowing story with all the little
details is almost impossibe.

The more you see the more you see.....it gets WORSE every day
(or better, depends, ha,ha.....)
