THE ALPHA-OMEGA GATHERING

Name it what you will, Discussion Society, Debating Group, Roman Forum, Greek Peripatetics, Philosophical Metaphysics, Gossiping Bunch; by whatever term used, the Society of Alpha-Omega presented a unique forum for member interaction on the issues of the day.

Such interchange was natural to the thinking, communicating human assemblage, each participant deftly attacking and disengaging, parrying, cutting, and thrusting with sabers of wit instead of steel, yet with each intangible blade still owning an ability to injure or fatally wound a vulnerable premise, or perhaps shatter on an impregnable argument.

Consider the merrie companie lounging about the sideboards and tables of the legendary Mermaid Tavern, a capital group of the time&apos;s best and brightest, dwelling on the events of the day or year. There was many an evening when William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, and their fellow players, writers, and intellectuals of the time came together, arguing and gossiping the day&apos;s affairs over a fist of ale, or a flagon of rhenish.

Contemporary Mermaid counterparts, such as the Algonquin Hotel, Lindy&apos;s, Sardi&apos;s and similar haunts providing jousting fields for such antagonists and protagonists such as Alex Wollcott, H.L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker, J.S. Perlernan, and a contemporary set of intellectuals, to regard and argue, accept and reject, slice and suture, in the same atmosphere of the Mermaid, albeit centuries removed.

The meeting sites and participants just described likely began as informal gatherings, and continued on driven by the wit and camaraderie of those present. In parallel, the Society of Alpha-Omega had its own beginnings at an informal meeting in 1984, when the reality of that significant year, and its contrast to the Orwellian version, was discussed in detail. The conversations were broad and compelling, developing such a pronounced degree of interest that A-O came into being, initiated to provide an arena for comprehensive discussion, with participation open to all, with argumentative input allowed from anyone or any source.

Perhaps to equate A-O with the greats and places mentioned is an arrogance; however, wit is wit, and exists where it exists.

 

However, to attempt publishing every speech, every conversation, every argument or every fragment held in the A-O archives in one volume would be beyond capability; therefore, this book will treat only the various essays, statements, views, responses, and comments, plus some data and quotes from other sources, generated during meetings of the Society by the very modest, always present, Moderator, Dr. E.A. Richards, P.E.



Greeting!

Horatio: &quot;O day and night but this is wondrous strange!&quot;

Hamlet: &quot;And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are

more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt

of in your philosophy.



GREETING DISTINGUISHED VISITOR

Welcome to Alpha-Omega, the forum that provides an arena for various discussions, arguments, and opinions. Any topic is fair game; and of primary importance, is the fact that one does not have to be a genius to contribute on any matter, in any manner, and on any level. There is no issue, subject, or concept that Alpha-Omega will not accommodate. Be humorous, be serious, be whatever; but, be warned only that the Moderator will comment both objectively and subjectively on what you say.

Please note that the letters P.E. behind the name of Dr. Richards, stand for Professional Engineer, and their usage is compelled so that no strangers, casual acquaintances, friends or relatives will mistakenly assume that he is a medical doctor, dentist, or psychiatrist, and therefore independently wealthy.

Carry on!



1.0 GENERAL TOPICS

After the initial discussion of Orwellian possibilities, the tenor of the A-O meetings rather quickly shifted to topics of national, state, and local interest, and General Topics came to constitute the bulk of archived data. There was much spoken on domestic politics, which is natural, inasmuch as everything that occurs, no matter the immediate label, is basically related to politics whether directly or tenuously.

Life is political; sex is political; death is political. There is no other consideration. Siggy couldn&apos;t have said it better!

Moderator&apos;s comments follow:



BREVITY ALWAYS!

The Alpha-Omega forum, after due and careful consideration of certain regrettable practices which have recently been brought to its attention, is desirous of again reminding you of the fact - which has, of course, been pointed out on several previous occasions, but which nevertheless has apparently been overlooked or ignored by an all-too-preponderant proportion of our present group - that all users in this organization should make an earnest, sincere, continuous, and persistent effort to eschew and avoid all excessive wordiness, repetitive phraseology, unnecessarily complicated sentence structure, lengthy, involved, or obscure paragraphs, and other tautological and/or grammatical errors to indite or transcribe an internal communication of any nature whatsoever to one or more fellow members - just, you know, like you and me!



OF GEORGE ORWELL AND 1984

The author, George Orwell, was born on June 25, 1903 in Motihari, India, where his parents belonged to the Indian Civil Service, and died in London on January 21, 1950. He attended Eton College in England, then joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, which provided the background for his novel Burmese Days.

His various novels, documentaries, criticisms and essays written during the 1930s and later gained him the reputation as one of the influential and important writers of the 20th century.

One of his novels, Homage to Catalona, was based on his experiences fighting on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. Orwell, a socialist, had joined an anarchist unit, and subsequently was wounded by the communists who were trying to eliminate their far-left allies. He fought the communists, but was forced to flee for his life.

Animal Farm, an attack on Stalinism, was written in 1945 and became a great success; however, his finest and most prophetic work was the novel 1984, in which he described a totalitarianistic society, a bureaucraticized state of the future where newspeak, a language based on the denial of truth, was the accepted mode of communication.

To Orwell, writing in 1945, the year 1984 was indeed in the faraway future, but because he feared the effects of an intrusive government, tracking everyone in every activity, being Big Brother to all, he used his novel to warn the world of what might be if just and honorable men took no action to maintain rights and freedoms.

George Orwell was the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair...



COMMENTS ON ORWELL

Once could conclude is that Orwell may have been on the right track, at least in England, if world events were allowed to take their course untrammeled by wisdom. And if this allowance occurs, only Orwell&apos;s date may be incorrect; however, democratic powers, led by the United States, will ever take action to negate the imperialistic concept driving the Soviet Union.

In the true 1984, no Big Brother has yet shown up to take over in Britain and the US. And, if indications are observed, it appears that the Soviet ambitions are getting too big for their capabilities. If President Lyndon Johnson couldn&apos;t swing guns and butter during Viet Nam, in the biggest and wealthiest nation in the world, then how would the USSR accomplish it?

President Reagan and SDI may force the Soviet hand. If Moscow tries to keep up with United States talent and treasure, they will surely fail. They simply don&apos;t have the resources.

It is China we must watch...



THE CYCLE OF NATIONS

A statistican once pointed out that the average life of most once-great civilizations was about two hundred years. Each of these passed through the following evolutions:

1. From bondage to spiritual faith.

2. From spiritual faith to great courage.

3. From courage to liberty.

4. From liberty to abundance.

5. From abundance to selfishness.

6. From selfishness to complacency.

7. From complacency to apathy.

8. From apathy to dependency.

9. From dependency directly back to bondage - where it all began.

The United States celebrated its 200th anniversary in 1976. At that point it was in cycle three, touching on four. So far, so good.



ONE-GUN GOETZ

Many of us think that Bernard Goetz struck four blows for liberty when he tried to eliminate the armed hoodlums who tried to rob him. I think so too.

Throughout our own American history, the only thing that has really made one man equal to another was the firearm. Now, in our litigous society, the shysters are trying to take over that function, shooting off their mouths instead of guns, but inflicting even more harm in many cases.

Two questions:

1. Do you feel that the state should prohibit citizens from owning guns of any kind, confiscating those now owned?

2. Do you think that ordinary citizens should be allowed to carry arms on their person for purposes of self-defense?

My response? No! Yes!



ESSAYS AND ORWELL

Orwell was the author of several brilliant essays , written in his stunningly clear style, that were characterized as being among the best of type ever published. One of the most influential was Politics and the English Language, (1950) that linked linguistic decay with authoritarianism.

A four volume publication, Collected Essays, Journalism, and Letters of George Orwell was published in 1968.

Sustenance for the intellectual mind!



KILL THE KILLERS!

Do you think the death penalty should exist in our State? Should the death penalty be mandatory for all cases where one person kills another or others in passionate anger, or in premeditation, in what is known popularly as first degree murder?

I think it should!



TRUER WORDS

&quot;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena -whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, a leader who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions- who at best, if he wins, knows the thrills of high achievment, and if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat&quot;

(I don&apos;t know who composed those lines, but I wish I would have. It might have been Theodore Roosevelt)



BAN THE SECOND AMENDMENT?

It was stated that guns should be banned; but, my own thought is that if a law were passed to do so, and all honest people complied, who left would have the guns? Probably only law enforcement officials, the military, and the criminals. Is this a good condition?

I think what was meant about decreasing killing by removing guns was flawed. Crimes of passion or violence would come to involve other weapons, such as knives.

Mexico has had a no-gun law for many years, mostly to protect the existing government of the time from righteous revolt by the masses. Thus a macho philosophy based on use of the knife was developed, instead of the gun, and is just as deadly.

What seems to be said is that it&apos;s all right for the thugs to rob people if they are not professionals, and the victims should simply acquiesce in the process, meekly and humbly. I say that a few would-be robbers blown away by honest citizens resisting would go a long way towards cutting down on this sort of thing.

And if only 5% of the armed robbers are professionals, that means in one million armed robberies a year, 50,000 would be done in a professional manner. That&apos;s really reassuring! Nothing like getting killed by someone who knows what he&apos;s doing.

My own position is that if someone murders someone else he should get the death penalty, and let the bleeding hearts bleed away. Ironically, there is nothing that turns a bleeding heart into a gun/death penalty advocate as quickly as having a member of his own family assaulted or killed by some gun-toting criminal.

Armed robbers and killers are irrational animals who only think about psychiatric care when they are caught and their life is on the line. If guilty, they should be exterminated as quickly as possible. Reinforcement for this attitude can be found in the many reports of killers robbing and killing again while out on bail, parole, or release.

The NRA, a realistic organization, has a good one-liner that I can appreciate even if not a member: &quot;When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.&quot;

How chillingly true, but that&apos;s the situation in which some would put us.



TRANSIT LINE TALE

A man standing next to the driver on a long Milwaukee bus route remarked, &quot;The county took over the transit line and the service has really gone down hill. Why, it&apos;s not even as good as it was back in Christ&apos;s time.&quot;

The driver laughed and said, &quot;You&apos;re completely wrong; they didn&apos;t even have bus service back in Christ&apos;s time.&quot;

The man replied, &quot;All I know is that in the Bible it says that on Palm Sunday Jesus rode into town on his ass; I haven&apos;t been able to do that since November of 1983.&quot;

(Sorry, it&apos;s the best I can do in honor of the occasion)



DEFENSIVE WEAPONS

Proposition: That any citizen who wished be furnished with a non-lethal weapon with which he could defend himself at any time, carried on his person either openly or concealed. Penalties would be assessed for use without cause, such as non-self defense use, but no penalty when used to defend from robbery or attack.

Of course the weapon involved is not yet developed, but probably could be; I&apos;m speaking of a small hand-weapon, simple enough for a woman to use, that would render an attacker helpless for a short time, with full recovery later. How many strong-arm robberies or sexual attacks would there be if all of us law-abiding people were so armed?



REGISTRATION AND CONFISCATION

My feeling is that any honest person who wants to own a pistol or rifle or shotgun is not afraid to have it written down somewhere that he owns the weapon. What most gun-owners fear, I think, is that a formal registration list may allow someone some day to confiscate more easily, just as has happened in totalitarian societies.

In our state and city, we already have an effective gun registration program, a fact deliberately overlooked by those who would confiscate. When an individual purchases a gun he must fill out the various firearms forms involved, and the dealer also has his set of forms to complete. There is no such thing as simply buying a gun without any sort of identification. That, in my opinion, is registration enough.

It is peculiar that the same folks who would have confiscation seem to have the same notions, in the main, cut down defense spending, reduce our military capabilities, are pro-abortion, anti-death penalty, feel that criminals have more rights than victims, believe in more social programs, would do anything (including groveling) to accommodate the Soviets, who would discard friendly nations they don&apos;t like in favor of promoting unfriendly communist countries, who don&apos;t mind the tyranny of the Soviet Union but hate the fact that we are trying to win freedom for the people of Central America, and in essence, live by the old double standard. It all goes together where they are concerned.



GOOD, EVIL, YAWN

What if there isn&apos;t anything such as good or evil in the world, and those labels are used only as categories to segregate the breakers of man-made rules from the non-breakers? What if the Powers-That-Be just couldn&apos;t care less what we do, and what we do has no bearing on any future existence? I think the supreme commandment governing conduct should be: &quot;Do not hurt anyone, but defend you and yours.&quot; That ought to do it.



DESERVING DEATH

I know how repugnant it is to people to think of taking another person&apos;s life; however, there is good reason for its being done on occasion. For example, a particular piece of Milwaukee north side vermin has sexually assaulted and then strangled a 14 year old young boy. The charges so far are ludicrous: 2nd degree murder and assault, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor with death as a consequence. This odious individual had been a guest of our tax-payers for ten years after raping and attempting to murder some woman in 1972.

How nice it would have been for that bright looking youngster had society seen fit to eliminate this piece of vermin ten years ago; the boy would still be alive and the tax-payers would have saved some money. Now it will cost us more dollars to keep him in prison for another eleven years until the liberal idiots say he has been rehabilitated and let him out for another whack at some other victim.

When I look at a dope-ridden sleaze like that, and see that the bail is only $85,000, I wonder at the scale of values of Assistant District Attorneys, such as you know who. Is a black person&apos;s life only worth $85,000? How much for a white girl, how much for an oriental, or a Latino? Where is the price list?

When you say that a human life should not be taken, I have to agree; but only if you agree that a fungus like Flakes is not human, and should be exterminated like the societal disease he represents. If he does go back to jail, and I&apos;m not even sure he will, let&apos;s hope the other people there do us all a favor and eliminate him.

Let us also hope that no ACLU lawyer will try to prove that Flakes&apos; civil rights were violated by the victim because the victim struggled too much. The charge should have been first degree murder and the penalty should be nothing less than death; Wisconsin must bring back capital punishment, if only to deter and/or eliminate scum like him.



NO COMMENT

I won&apos;t comment on the fact that you must have missed the meeting that agreed Alpha-Omega would be an informal society of people who can argue anything on any subject.

And I won&apos;t continue by saying that anything of interest is acceptable, and that Alpha does not categorize its arguments, nor does it care what discussions may transpire elsewhere, worthy as it may be.

You can talk science, politics, civics, poetry, occult, mysticism, the price of sausage at Kohls, prehistory, future history, biblical history, space visitors, Dr. Who, movies, any likes or dislikes, science fiction, non-fiction, non-science fiction, or about anything or anyone else - as long as you can take the flack. Personal attacks are not forbidden, if you feel strongly enough, just keep the language non-scatological. You are very welcome, but too new to voice in-depth criticism.



POUR!

Come fill the cup, and in the fire of spring,

The bird of time has just left the runway,

And he can&apos;t fly on one wing.

Make it two fingers each! (One finger is not a drink, it is an opinion)



YOU ARE FORTUNATE!!

How lucky you tempered your last response; I was about to unleash my squad of Killer Tomatoes after you - they are straining at the stem! (And you know how deadly strained tomatoes are; almost as bad as herniated tomatoes. I would have loved seeing them catsup to you, and paste you in the mouth. What a tomato surprise)



CODDLED YEGGS

I don&apos;t really follow religiously all the precepts of the Bible, even though some may. My position is that certain crimes against other human beings place the perpetrators into a sub-human, bestial, class, and that the elimination of the perpetrators lives is a boon to the rest of humanity.

The animal that was just sentenced to 100 years in jail for the show-off rape should have been executed; had you been the victim the odds are that you might feel the same way.

One of the world&apos;s flakes in the news recently sexually molested, then killed, a 14 year old boy. Is this hmsl (homosexual) hominid a human? Should he be allowed to live? Not in my scale of values. A long jail sentence to those collective freaks is simply free room and board. And sending the flake to a male prison is like sending some happy youth to girls&apos; camp, or Vassar.



BONANZA

Back in 1949 when you were still a fignewton of someone&apos;s imagination, three of us pilots formed a partnership and bought a Beech Bonanza thin wing for 7750 dollars. Know what that exact same plane would cost today?

We also got a Republic Seabee later on (215 hp Franklin, slower than hell) with which we had nothing but fun on the lakes in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Canada. This aircraft also cost under 7500 dollars in &apos;49. They&apos;re difficult to find (I think old Tommy Bartlett still has one up in the Dells area) because South American bush pilots bought a lot of them, installed a 500 hp engine, and used them to get in and out of rivers and lakes in jungle areas. With a whole 500 horses pushing, they must really junp off the water.



THE WRONG MAN?

I would find it a matter of grave concern if the courts had convicted the wrong man and executed him. However, this is a rarity. Generally in capital cases the evidence is compelling for guilt. Perhaps the weight of the evidence should be under consideration by the sentencing judge, and/or an appellate court addressing each particular capital sentence. In the case of the show-off rapist or the boy-killer, the evidence would appear to be adequate to justify a death penalty.



EVER RISING....

If hot air rises then you must reach the heights. As I told you in past communications, your favorite sport is building those phony straw men and then revel in knocking down your own creations. Had you read Abe Lincoln&apos;s Gettysburg address with the same fervor you read a couple notes on DMSO, your rendition would take up more volumes than Anthony Adverse.

I can&apos;t believe that you would grasp at a few of those leftover straws (God knows the leftover ones are few and far between considering your usage) like the laetrile idiocy. I really call that the pits of logic. It would seem as though there were no efficacy in laetrile except that of the placebo syndrome inasmuch as there is little if any laetrilian proof of cure or remission. However there have been positive results with DMSO.

Your thoughts on the subject (among other subjects) are reminiscent of the scientist who proved mathematically beyond a shadow of a doubt that the bumblebee could not fly, yet the ignorant bee just keeps buzzing along not knowing it should not have got off the ground.

Now, you may simply be instigating for effect. I hope that&apos;s the way it is, because if you are writing from the head and heart, you may need liberal applications of DMSO over the frontal area. But, knowing well your obviously conditioned reflex towards the stuff, use instead a bit of liniment. It will make your head smart for a while, but perhaps that&apos;s not all bad.



GOOD-BYE PAN AM?

It appears as though a pioneer air line is going to figuratively crash in a few weeks. Pan American has been operating in the red by a few million dollars a year, barely staying in business in hope of achieving a profit in future days.

Now, a two-bit union with a death-wish has convinced the suckers belonging to its organization that they should go on strike to force the company to pay them higher wages while the company loses money. Ridiculous!

It&apos;s sad to note, but it seems that one more airline is destined to be no more; how can any of the executives of that line realistically expect to continue losing even more money? My suggestion would be to close up shop, sell the airplanes and/or the real estate, and count the money. Let the unions and their dupes find other jobs - if they can.

Heartless? Maybe, but when a man who has a job that pays the wages air line employees get, and gives it up through a strike, he&apos;s not too bright. One other alternative would be for Pan Am to fire the strikers and hire new workers. This would work if the government or courts didn&apos;t get involved, but that proposition is too iffy.

Saddest of all is the fact that the pilots say they will honor the picket lines. Well, they can always go from a $120,000 a year left-seat job to a $20,000 job as whatever, if they can get one.

It doesn&apos;t make any sense? Well, not much does in these times where the unions are concerned. They are building the erasers to rub themselves out of the national picture; they&apos;ll go with a whimper!



GILDING THE FLYWAYS

I can still remember when a little outfit called Wisconsin Central Airlines started up with its main flights to Chicago, MKe, Madison, Green Bay, and points between. They were an eager bunch and worked those DC-3&apos;s to death. Then came the horizontal twins and they were off and running into the big time. Next they took a close look at the Wisconsin tax laws and fled to Minneapolis becoming North Central.

After a few years the service began to sag along with the passenger bookings. It was the same way with another podunk line called Southern, and a marriage was made which ended up as Republic.

What changes have been made? Well, back in North Central days a one-way trip to Chicago cost $8.00; now it&apos;s about 5 times that much, but you can save 9 minutes a trip. A flight to Green Bay was once $8.50, but in this day it&apos;s better to drive.

Incidentally, one of the significant reasons for Pan Am&apos;s past losses was the high cost of fuel; now that fuel is down, and the company could make a buck, the union greedies want theirs first, profits or not.



THINLY PROFOUND

Did you know that the human skin varies from .02 inches on the eyelids to .17 inches or more on the soles and palms?

And among individuals, some have thicker skins than others.



BRAIN FOOD

When you get to the student&apos;s paradise, and you&apos;re sitting in the Union or the Library at 11:30 pm boning up for a quiz at 7:15 am the next day, the importance of proper diet will become one of the least significant objectives in real time as you wolf down a cold sandwich, lousy hamburger, or chips, along with a gallon of coffee.

As you progress along the first four years, visions of dietary excellence will not dance through your stomach except as an afterthought on breaks or vacation. There will be plenty of time later to consider proper eating; get the sheepskin first!



MY OWN COLLEGE DIET

I take strong exception to your statements concerning the results of my college diet, even though long ago, even though in use since then. I have a magnificent body!

It&apos;s down here underneath this one.



MEATY OF THE MINDS?

I don&apos;t want to hear it for raw nuts and fresh fruits; the less publicity for the San Francisco life style, the better. Vegetables are OK, though, so here&apos;s one cheer for broccoli (collie flower is a dog, however). Are you implying you will indulge in underprocessed foods from now on? Watch out for the terrible ptomaines! If I could spell czrnina I&apos;d tell you to stay away from that also. (Let&apos;s see: charnina, czarnena, czharnina, charneena... Oh, what the hey, Polish duck blood soup)



LUNACY IN IRAN

Far be it from me to attack anyone&apos;s religion, but the nonsense expressed by the Ayatolla How-many really repels me.

On the news this evening I saw the buses in Teheran taking martyr bands of 10 to 15 year old peasant youngsters to the front lines so they could walk through enemy mine fields and locate active mines with their bodies to let the tanks pass through safely.

One of the kids had a sneak attack of common sense and jumped off the bus, crying. I hope they didn&apos;t shoot him!

All of those idiots who worked so hard to get the Shah of Iran deposed, the white government out of Rhodesia, Somoza out of El Salvador, Batista out of Cuba, are now working to get the white government out of South Africa, and Marcos out of the Philippines. They always know what is best for other countries, even if the people hurt later, as in the nation of Ethiopia.

Why is it that the do-gooders of the world see so much evil they want to change another nation&apos;s system, except for those nations where Marxism oppresses its people, or in the case of Iran, where the How-many loonies prevail?

The Iranian dictators call America the &apos;great satan&apos; and say they will martyr themselves in any attack against the US. I say it&apos;s time for the President to have US forces assist in a mass, How-many martyrism, and the sooner the better - maybe we can save some of those bright, young Iranian kids.



CURVED LEARNING

Any child in the learning process should be told that what they are being taught represents the facts as seen at that point in time. If they are told that a scientific principle works at present, but they don&apos;t have to believe it works, that is not opening his horizons, it is closing them with confusion.

Simply because a child is taught a bedrock of knowledge to date, that fact cannot limit his imagination. Anything can be questioned, that is, if the child has the intellectual capability which drives him to ask the questions.

Man has nothing to inhibit him except inhibition itself....to paraphrase.



FOLLOW-UP

In follow-up to the last part of your argument, there are any number of aboriginal tribes left in the world whose children have a splendid opportunity to develop imaginative theories without having had the orthodox rules of present science thrust upon on them.

Haven&apos;t heard much from them lately.



SHOCKLEY RESHOCKED

Back in 1956, Dr. William Shockley, along with Walter Brattain and Dr. Bardeen, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for their efforts in the development of the transistor.

For this scientific feat, well-deserved praise and honors were given to Dr. Shockley, and the world was at his feet - that is, until Schockley branched off into an anthropological area, considered out of his limit of expertise, when he stated that after studying the races of the world it was his conclusion that the mental abilities of the blacks were slightly inferior to those of the whites.

That is when hell broke loose in the 3rd world and the US black community!

Dr. Shockley reverted from an erudite individual, gifted in science, to a dastardly racist, having no worthwhile redeeming value. It is a reputation he is tarred with even today, even though he provided statistics to reinforce his point.

My opinion? There are dolts and geniuses in all racial groups



NO JUSTICE FOR POLICE OFFICERS

The grim news concerning the shooting death of two of Milwaukee&apos;s Finest is certainly a tragedy. One of the factors in the Officer&apos;s killings could well have been the split second of forebearance episodes like the Bell case and others have caused in such situations.

Already the brayings of Laura Liberal, a notorious advocate of gun control and gun confiscation has been heard in the hinterland. She wants to pass another law against guns on county property. I&apos;m sure the crooks will really pay attention to her nonsense.

Where are the millions that the dead officer&apos;s families might collect from the black community?

 

You&apos;re right!



GOVERNMENT ETHICS

On the wall in tiny U.S. Government office in Washington, D.C., is mounted a dusty, age-yellowed poster which has the following on it:

CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE

Any person in Government Service should:

1. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or government department.

2. Uphold the Constitution, laws and legal regulations of the U.S. and of all governments therein and never be a party to their invasion.

3. Give a full day&apos;s labor for a full day&apos;s pay, giving to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.

4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.

5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or his family, favors [or] benefits [under] circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.

6. Make no private promises of any kind binding on the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.

7. Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.

8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means of making private profit.

9. Expose corruption wherever discovered.

10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

NOTE: The above Rules of Ethics apply to anyone in government service at any level, except for the President, Senators, Representatives, and their staffs, persons that are appointed by the foregoing and their staffs, other elected and appointed officials and entrenched bureaucrats. Lawyers are automatically exempt at any level or status.



AN HONEST EDGE

There&apos;s one thing about the average buyer - he doesn&apos;t want to appear stupid in front of the sage salesman, especially if his wife is with him. This effect gives an edge to the hustler; the couple doesn&apos;t want to be embarrassed in any way, have their credit questioned (even though they may be far better off than the salesman), and try to seem more sophisticated than they really are. The peddler plays these types like a violin.

Having been caveated by the emptorean process once or twice in my youth, I&apos;ve learned that rock bottom price (close to cost) must be established, and final price must be as near as possible. I&apos;ve learned that it&apos;s no personal detriment to haggle like hell, and make impossible offers to find out what the salesman&apos;s bottom line is. As long as he can make something on the deal, even if it&apos;s a minimum, it&apos;s better than losing the sale. However, the sales object must be of value to even talk at all.



SAL PETRAE

Back when we were fighting the Spanish American war (or was it Korea? I forget) I remember they used saltpeter in the military food; however, with the proper provocation, it was rendered ineffective.

Actually, saltpeter is a catchall name indicating both potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate. Actually, gunpowder is made by judiciously combining portions of KNO3, Sulfer, and Carbon, boiling the lot, and carefully drying it. This is the historic black powder. Modern cartridge propellants are much improved.



FRESH AIR

You made a comment about the lack of adequate air purification systems in taverns and bars, decrying their lack of effectiveness, or at worst, their non-existence.

Anyone who has spent time in a bar remembers the smoke hanging heavily in layers where there was enough light to see it. But in most of the larger and classier restaurants there were just as many smokers but the air was much clearer. The reason for this was that the restaurants had heating and ventilating equipment to handle the load more effectively. It&apos;s one thing to drink and play pool or dance in a cloud of smoke....enough to drink and it seems no one cares......but to eat in a layer of smoke is anathematic.

So what does this imply? Simply that the big places can afford the type of equipment that can change the air in an area a number of times a minute for the benefit of its eating patrons. To equip a small bar or tavern with adequate equipment costs money in terms of capital cost, power cost, maintenance cost, and heating cost in winter (if fresh air is exchanged x times a minute the incoming must be heated).

Too bad we don&apos;t live in a climate where we can eat and drink at sidewalk restaurants or bars, but even then, there are other forms of pollution with which to contend, depending on air currents and neighborhood.

(I think it was somebody from the arthritis foundation who once uttered the immortal line, &quot;people who don&apos;t want to get stiff in the joints should try to stay out of them!&quot;)



AW, POOR BABY!

You started it with your usual verbal flatulence, so don&apos;t go bleeding on everyone&apos;s shoulder. You may be somewhere in the range from far left to far right, but anyone to the right of Norman Thomas would still look left to find you.

You have established your position many times as anti: Reagan, Republican, Defense, Military, Conservative, and on some occasions, took the side of the enemies of the United States, such as the marxists of Nicaragua and their Soviet siblings.

You&apos;re fortunate you live in a country where even people with yours and other left-wing viewpoints can say what they want to say and still live. But I guess that doesn&apos;t hold true for the right wing groups, according to the news lately.

We all know what you are against, but not too much about what you are for. However, deductive reasoning can many times indicate preferences simply from knowing the dislikes, and your port side position is becoming more apparent with every word you say, drivel that it is.

In any case, Alpha continues to provide an arena where both dedicated Americans and those who oppose its principles can argue their cases, so feel free to continue writing. Our rejection slips here are only electronic and descriptive, with only your ego&apos;s being bruised.

Note: If being a fascist comes of being completely against the totalitarian communist philosophy, willing to strive against it in any part of the global arena, then I accept the label.

P.S. Certainly the Constitution allows the CPUSA and the White Knights of the KKK both to flourish, but I&apos;m not compelled to like either group.



SOME WERE THERE

My dear wife, Alice, remembers the times in Europe, where she was born of American parents; she spent much of the war on a prison farm run by the nazis.



ONE KNIGHT IN VALETTA

Actually, the last, great Maltean Orgy took place in 1387 when the Knights of Malta threw a party with plenty of wine and slave girls, got drunk as hell, and decided on a glorious venture involving the fabrication of a priceless, jewel studded, gold bird as a present to the Pope.

I wonder what happened to it?



SAME OLD STUFF

I felt that the appellation &apos;Comrade&apos; would loosen up your fingers but I didn&apos;t realize it would have the opposite effect on your mind. All those books you love to quote were written, in general, by cuckoos of your own port-side philosophy; it&apos;s like the cretins quoting the cretins.

No matter how cutesey poo you and are with your back patting billet doux, the fact is that your left-leaners lost the presidency, and a few got booted from the congress. We can only hope that the &apos;86 elections throw out a few more of the leftist weirdos, like the flaming Dr. Studds for example, and the Massachusetts Mafia.

Say what you want to say about Reagan, none of it will change the fact that he has done more for the country as a whole his first two years than Carter did in four. He&apos;s brought self-respect back to the nation, except for those liberal losers who never had much self-respect to begin with, much less any respect.

I think your problem is that you speak out of your own context, if that&apos;s your idea of a good time!

(Sorry Groucho, wherever you are)



MESS!

I remember in another aspect I said, &quot;These are the times that try men&apos;s souls...&quot;

Somebody added women to the equation since then, which unbalanced everything

and made quite a mess out of US politics.

(Summer soldiers, and some aren&apos;t)



NO RACIST YOU

I&apos;m thrilled that just because my skin is sort of pinkish-white that you won&apos;t hold the fact against me: inside I&apos;m red, white, and blue.

That&apos;s more than you can say for some!



HOT PLANE

You were telling me about that nice Bonanza, a plane I can appreciate; however, I rolled up a few hours in the company Aerostar, a little 6-place twin that will cruise at 3000 around flight level 18. It wasn&apos;t slow, but you had to watch it all the time, even on auto. It&apos;s more fun to fly the Banana or the Mooney......or even the Archer II, which is affordable.



WELL SAID

Your most effective answer to the purveyor of poofery saved me a good deal of mental workout. My appreciation.

However, correct as you are - based on the facts - don&apos;t assume for a second that any of what you said will have an impact on a liberal mind-set. The peregrinations of the leftish thought process is invulnerable to the more direct route of truth. They believe what they want to believe.

Your point about past Democrat Congresses providing the bases for the present deficit is well taken. The overdose of Keynesian economic philosophy brought the country to an over-programmed society where the producers were working for the defense department and the non-producers. I didn&apos;t mind the defense allocations, I just don&apos;t like throwing over 50% of my money into the social-program kitty. In any case, prepare to be booked and quoted to death.



NOT THAT HOT

I got a letter today from the manufacturers of the Aerostar; they said that, contrary to what I proclaimed so proudly that our Aerostar will not go 3000 mph at any flight level unless attached to the shuttle.

That machs sense to me!



CUT TO THE QUICK

Wow! I&apos;m sure you cut your party to quick, saying no one should blindly support any leader; but, when your Demos blindly supported Franklin Roosevelt, the people got the following:

1. More socialistic programs than in all of American history.

2. Thrust into WWII when FDR, to satisfy the foreign and domestic banking house interests, allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to take place when he knew a day in advance it was coming.

3. Were sold out, along with eastern Europe, when FDR, with the help of his communist helper, Alger Hiss, let the Soviet Union gain tremendous amounts of territory they didn&apos;t deserve.

The list of nefarious deeds by FDR is too long to be posted here; the most positive accomplishment of Roosevelt&apos;s life was his leaving it, albeit much too late. Had Harry Truman been President during the Yalta conspiracy, the face of Europe today would be much changed, and for the better.



IDIOTOLLAH

Perhaps you noted in the news that the Iranians are beginning to riot in the thousands against the religious regime there. That unrest isn&apos;t happening spontaneously; we have a finger in the pie somewhere there. Maybe the Iraqi war is a great part of it but there is nudging from the west going on. The first few cracks in the Idiotollah&apos;s armor are beginning to show.



SAYING IT

Does your saying it make it so, the old technique of basis for disparagement? You weren&apos;t called a liar for citing the articles, merely for saying the publication endorsed the article. Where did it say that? Give us the quote from the paper. Whose source is discredited, and for what? Your pinning the entire philosophy of an organization on a conjectural hypothesis in one article in one issue is nonsensical, yet expected, from a world class straw man builder-destroyer. Many times the path to your conclusions is based on such a distortion of assumption and presumption that the result is ludicrous. I understand the reason for your utilizing the bubble simile.

You certainly have the head for it.



TOO TRUE GRIT

I had heard that the rescue mission helicopters took off into a blinding sandstorm. Having worked on oil lines in the Arabian deserts, I can tell you they are dangerous simply to drive in, much less to fly in. Also, having had some experience in military scenarios, I would guess that there was a huge operation set up for the rescue involving agents in place along the route to Teheran and inside the city proper at various strategic positions. There had to be safe houses, firepower backup, escape routes and contingency plans, the entire works.

As in many critical operations, timing had to be all important. It is more than likely that the choppers were forced by circumstance of schedule to leave at a certain point in time, and decisions had to be made to initiate. The choice to start was a brave one by brave men; the elements were against the success of the project. I salute Carter for trying. Just think of the weeks of planning and setting up for the try; must have been an enormous task, logistically.



NAY - SAYERS

The nay-sayers, like the poor and stupid, will always be with us, and I&apos;m not so sure that old age makes someone know more than you do.

But there is a certain feeling of pride and satisfaction that most of the Americans get when they see the flag go by no matter what their age. I feel sympathy for those who don&apos;t ever experience that feeling.

On another note, the clearances in jet engine turbine blades with respect to the walls is in ten thousandths; sand will really scour the balance out of the jet system; filters help, but cut down horsepower and eventually cause an engine to fail. Even if reciprocating engines were used in the choppers, sand particles would have been a fatal. But, I must agree with you about Carter in general; his one great failure was probably his most shining hour.



BE PREPARED!

I completely agree with your self-proclaimed role as peace monger. But in order, as someone said here recently, to keep the peace one must prepare for war.

And as for the treaties you quoted, all of those dealing with arms buildup have been broken by the Soviet Union who used the time period involved to increase their nuclear and conventional armaments. It is recorded fact.

Do you want us to unilaterally disarm, then depend on the good nature of the Soviet Union to do the same? Not me! Their record has proved them to be untrustworthy in every sense of the word. Certainly the concept of all nations ridding themselves of nuclear weapons is commendable; if they would, we would.

But which nation is it that continues to utilize aggression as a key part of its desire to gain more territory, that foments revolution and terror in all parts of the world, that refuses to act as a reasonable participant in the world community, that causes its citizens to live in fear and repression, that erects walls to keep their people from escaping instead of others coming in? Not the United States. All want peace and nuclear disarmament; what are your suggestions as to how to go about it?



MID-AIR MEETING

What a great job that student pilot did to get back to the airport after the two planes collided, and congratulations to the instructor, and the planes themselves.

It&apos;s a tribute to the design and fabrication quality of the air frame manufacturers that events worked out as they did. And, somebody up there sure must have liked them.



CHALLENGE

Before we meet under the clock at midnite and exchange left and right propaganda, why don&apos;t you elaborate somewhat on the authors, their groups, their political positions, and their dull axes waiting to be ground.

Just as info, if one has 1000 missiles, and 5 warheads are put on each instead of one, there are still 1000 missiles, but 5000 warheads. Do your authors take this impeccable mathematics into consideration?

(If we did force down a Soviet recon, half the members in congress would wet their collective breeches, if doves wear breeches)



JUVEN&apos;DULTS

I&apos;m taking the liberty to answer your juvenile/adult question here;

My feeling is this: In order to commit the crime of rape, with all of the attendant physical reactions and responses inherent in the mature male, the male that performs with such must ipso facto be considered an adult.

In many societies of the world, the ability to impregnate is the criterion for adulthood. Perhaps this yardstick should also be used in a legal determination, at least for the crime of rape.

For other crimes, the definition is more difficult. My position might be that the mental and physical ability to load a gun, communicate to a victim the concept of money or life, and the prowess to aim that gun and pull the trigger might establish adulthood.

It might be that standards could be derived which, if met by the offender, would constitute his achieving adult status for that particular crime, no matter what his chronological age. There is a possibility that sophistication with regard to elemental life in the immediate environment also would be a factor in consideration of the adulthood level.



KIDS ARE THE VICTIMS

I agree with your criticism of the repetitiveness of the program scheduling. The best show in the world suffers when being shown over and over again ad nauseum.

And another thing the program does not really stress, as does not the little missing kids clips on WTMJ Channel 4 and others, is the fact that these children were not kidnapped in the accepted sense; they were children that went away with mothers or fathers (usually fathers) who didn&apos;t agree with some judge&apos;s decision about custody.

In Wisconsin, and other states, it has been historically assumed that the mother was automatically the most fit parent to have custody, an assumption not always valid. Even if the mother were a street-walker she would get the kids in almost every court case with such an issue. It just wasn&apos;t fair.

Nowadays, judges seem to be looking more closely at the custody issues, and in some cases award to the father, but not often. A father and child who are very close may simply fly from some jurisdiction together to escape a decision. Immediately, the kid is placed on someone&apos;s missing child list, even though the child is only missing from one parent.

And too many times the child is simply an emotional weapon that is used by one parent to injure another, looking on custody as a triumph over an opponent rather than really considering the kid&apos;s best interest.

I would say there is a great deal of heartbreak involved in all relationships which are forced to end in a family dissolution. There are many factors involved which cannot all be considered by a judge because of time constraints. Many times a parent pleads emotionally for the child because of the child&apos;s supposed needs, when revenge is the only motive.

There are many situations of tragedy in the world; breakup of the family is one of the more tragic, for both parents and offspring.



POOR INNOCENT KIDS

When you heard what I said, please don&apos;t assume that it was in any criticism of the TV show itself. It was a sad but heartbreaking story that pointed out one family&apos;s experience with a vicious animal who harmed them and their child.

My concern was not for those who post pictures and notes about missing children who have not been kidnapped but are with one of the parents. But, it&apos;s tough to discuss objectively what happened to the little kid that was actually kidnapped. Being the type that I am I believe in capital punishment for all such kidnappers of children, and would volunteer to pull the switch myself - even though I know I would have to stand in line.



THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL

The Milwaukee Journal serves a useful function in that it provides a service to liberals who can&apos;t afford to get the NY Times, the Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun, and the L.A. Times. The Journal reprints most of the items from the news services of the above named rags.

Besides, if I didn&apos;t get the Journal, I wouldn&apos;t know what the enemy was saying; plus, I would miss that reactionary cartoon about Daddy Warbucks, not to mention the Wiz, Opus, Andy Capp, Snoopy, and the upper part of the editorial page, good comics all!



WRITING ON WATER?

It&apos;s unfortunate that the Journalism fraternity can see only one end in their work - scoop the other guy. There is that kind of competition ongoing here in Milwaukee even though only two major papers exist - the Journal and the Sentinel.

Touching the thinnest of veneers on a subject does not afford a writer the actual grasp of the subject in any sort of depth. All that reporter was looking for anyway is the by-line, and he doesn&apos;t care about the necessary research for a comprehensive exposition.



WHAT, ME ABUSIVE?

Please don&apos;t stint on the question of inflammation and abusiveness on my speaking about the Journal; it was all intended as such, and the fact that it appeared where it did was a low point in my moderating career.

All kidding aside, I think that including some of the speeches of the members would have been a welcome addition, addressed to Journal reporter. I think that our group deserves some small attention because of the overall erudition and sophistication of its members, plus our its well-known feminine defender of the left.



THE JOURNAL

Of course we can agree to dislike the Journal; I have always felt that their stories were slanted too much towards the left, a flaw grown out of their old, socialist past. The religious section of all newspapers is a sop to the truly spiritual, and a phony one at that.



MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE WIRES

The usual procedure when a wire service issues a story is to do it in a long number of paragraphs. The local receiving it can print as much of the story as they wish, and alter what they wish, but there is usually enough pro and con in the wire story to go left or right depending on which paragraphs are used.

As I noted before, the Journal not only gets wire reports from AP&amp;UPI but also from the major liberal papers in the nation; that accounts for the intended liberal slant of the Journal.



NONE DARE...

That book you recommended, &quot;None dare call it Treason,&quot; wasn&apos;t that a fragment of a couplet along the lines of:

Treason never doth prosper

And this be the reason,

It treason doth prosper,

Than none dare call it treason....

I always thought Robert Welch was one of the kookier rightists after he said that Eisenhower was a conscious tool of the communists. But Phyllis Schlafly is one of the more articulate writers of the right, and one of the most effective voices of the patriotic faction in America.



BAD MOUTHING REAGAN AGAIN

The latest diatribe on Reagan and sundry is a capital example of unnecessary foaming at the mouth over fancied occurrences, whipping the writer into a self-inflicted frenzy through tired positional reiterations, as though the retelling would make all accusations true.

Fat chance!

What it boils down to is that the Reagan victory is resented so much by the left that they lose any modicum of perspective and simply blast mindlessly away in a mad explosion of anti-Reagan rhetoric, with some side snipes at people who favor the Reagan style. Analyze the words; it will help to explain some of the irrational rationales.



UNION MOTORS

I think that the description of the AMC problem at Kenosha was self-explanatory - the Union in its arrogance will drive the company under. Beside the Union, the second strike against the Kenosha plant is its being controlled by French interests. The combination of the two will be a knockout blow to Kenosha.

Perhaps there should be a plant-wide vote by the workers, not under the jurisdiction of the union, as to whether or not the cuts in pay and benefits will be accepted by the workers in lieu of losing their jobs.

My prediction is, if that would happen, the workers would vote for the jobs and the paychecks, and the Union would wind up with egg on its goons. I just don&apos;t think anything that reasonable will be allowed; instead the workers will succumb to the inevitable union death-wish, and vote themselves into oblivion.



REAGAN SPEECH

Even when he lost his teleprompter, Reagan came out again as a master of Communications. His response to the hecklers was appreciated even by those European heads of state who deal with the bellicose adversaries of their own parliaments every day.

That line about congressman walking out in time was a gem; unfortunately, none of them will ever walk out never to return. They all will be tied to their shields and carried out quivering and jerking spasmodically after losing an election.

Bitberg turned into a massive media non-event, just as it really was; as the commentators said, the network coverage was a masterpiece of media inadequacy, especially on the part of CBS. Of course, this point, dwelled on in tonight&apos;s Journal, sounded almost conservative, though their affiliation is NBC slanted anyway.

Here&apos;s to Reagan and the United States, and bad cess to both their enemies!



WE&apos;RE ALL MASOCHISTS

Any of who join this forum must have masochistic tendencies. Just remember the personality changes involved: When we argue our position, we&apos;re masochists; when we answer dissenting arguments, we&apos;re sadists!

That&apos;s what makes it so interesting!

I guess my own basic sadistic impulses, plus the fact that one member&apos;s words are so figuratively jumpable, cause my caustic rebuttals. Some statement establish a graven premise with a built-in dare to disagree with position, no matter how indefensible it is. Mix that positional slant with a liberal dose of base innuendo and you have the basis for my kind of answers. It&apos;s the same in reverse...



COPYING VIDEOTAPES

Concerning the videotape copying controversy, I think the pressures of the marketplace will handle that. If the laws will be enforced in a draconian manner, consumers will gravitate to the tapes and programs of least possible problem. You will see, in the future, those items released by manufacturers without qualification, allowing free copying, thus killing the competitors who will be perceived as greedy by consumers. Just wait for it.



REAGAN THE DEMOCRAT

With regard to Reagan once being a Democrat. Back in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s, the Republican party was conservative to the point of extreme stuffiness, and could have been rightly called the party of big business and wealth. The Demos of the era, in spite of Rooseveltian Socialism, were a party of the people, most of the time.

Many old-line Democrats feel today that the Democrat party has passed them by in an inexorable sweep to the left; many of them have changed their registration, realizing that the Republican party of today espouses many of the concepts inherent in the Demo party of the past. As Reagan has said on many occasions, he didn&apos;t change - the Democrat party changed.

Take notice of the events to come soon; many Democrats, like the black legislator in Michigan yesterday, are changing affiliation to Republican because they think the Republican party best represents their views of the real world. I&apos;ve been neither a Democrat or a Republican, simply a Conservative, but I find my sympathies lie more with the GOP than with the ultra-liberal Demos of today. There are big changes coming, changes which will rock them!



QUOTES

This morning on the news the Reagan repartee struck again. When asked by a network hack about his reaction to the Gorbyechev statement about the US being the one to foment trouble in the world, the Reagan response was, &apos;he should talk.....&apos;

Instead of a five minute speech on why Gorby was incorrect, those few words were enough to say this:

Statements accusing the US of the world&apos;s troubles, made by the head of a nation whose raison detre seems to be one of conquest, are mealy mouthed lies obvious to all thinking people.

Not bad for a Pres who some dupes say is stupid.



KIDNAPPING

I suggested that the case was not kidnapping in the classic sense, that is, stealing a human and holding him for ransom. As for one parent taking the child from another, that&apos;s a tough judgement. Until every fact is known in the case it is impossible for a settlement in equity.

Last evening I read where some goofy judge had given someone&apos;s child to a pair of males living together as man and wife. If the natural mother or father had taken the child from them, I wouldn&apos;t have called it kidnapping, but simple justice. Fortunately the child was removed through other means.

The tragic aspect of the entire missing children situation with regard to one parent or another taking or keeping the child is that there can be no real solution because there is no longer a real family. The loosening up of moral standards in this nation is a root cause for the early breakup of families, another accomplishment of the liberals&apos; decadent policies.



HAPLESS HECKLERS

I&apos;ll just give you one of the last; when the communists in Portugal&apos;s parliament got up and left as Reagan entered, he said &quot;it looks like some of the seats on the left side aren&apos;t very comfortable.&quot; I guess when the leader of the world&apos;s greatest Republic speaks, the communists, as is usual, don&apos;t want to listen.



NOSTALGIC NOTES

I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;re old enough to remember what Dixieland is, but I was once part of a dixie band that played up at Devils Lake back in my old undergrad days in Madison. We had a trumpet, clarinet, bass, trombone, and if lucky, a piano player. We were an elephant band - lots of fun but worked for peanuts. Have times changed any?



REAGAN&apos;S BOOK?

I didn&apos;t even know that the President had written a book with that title; goes to show how up to date I am. However, I feel that if the book would have hit any of the lists there was

a good chance I would have seen the information on it.

Controlled press? Not only the press, but also the distribution lines. There are a great many books not given distributive coverage because certain elements of our society do not want them publicized. If you want some examples, let me know after the meeting.



THE SUB FLEET

I would have counted the deadly submarines you mentioned, but when I last looked they were all underwater, and my scuba gear is at the wet cleaners.

(Was this Luxembourg&apos;s submarine fleet you were mentioning or was it part of the US navy contingent in Omaha, Nebraska? They really do have a US Navy base there)



USURIOUS?

Being blessed with the ability to read the printed word quickly, one of the more interesting diversions I use to pass the time during commercials is to read the fine print in the huckster ads. (Audio off, of course)

If you watch the Tapper Store stuff, it seems that the fine print offers an interest rate approaching 16%; for Nelson Bros. furniture, the very fine print lets you know (rather quickly) that the interest rate is almost 25%. I think that&apos;s over the old Wisconsin law defining usury.

I know that times have changed somewhat, and I realize that you and I and the rest of the Alphans would be wary of such a high rate, but what about the guy who can only read the big print, goes into the store, buys a grand&apos;s worth of furniture, then gets charged 250 bucks just for interest.

And this interest may even be higher when clothing is purchased by the minorities at some hustler&apos;s store who is not really in the clothing business, but in the garnisheeing business. When I worked at a car wash during my college days, I would have to go down to a few of these shyster places to get a release for one or more of my workers so they could get a check for food and rent.

While there, we saw that whenever a minority worker would buy something on credit (on scandalous terms) a garnishment form would automatically be filled out ready to have served if the worker was over ten seconds late on a payment. These joints had their own full-time lawyers working; some were company owners; all were in the human misery business, a profitable line then, and seemingly now also.

The most expensive words today are, nothing down, pennies a month.



WAVING THE FLAG

If the time ever comes when no one will want to wave the flag - it will probably no longer be worth waving. Let&apos;s hope that time never comes, no matter what inadequacies you may perceive in the system.



GUNS AND THEIR USES

We&apos;ve been arguing this question over many areas, and I&apos;d like to re-state my position and let you, and the members, agree or disagree.

1. I think people who use cheap handguns for robbery are reprehensible, and am totally against their existence - the people, not the handguns.

2. I am totally against legislation keeping the people from buying any firearms they wish to buy, except for licensed, fully automatic weapons.

I also deplore the fact that people are injured by handguns, expensive or cheap; but, I also think we should maintain the freedoms given to us by the documents written by our founding fathers.



BLIND LOYALTY

Don&apos;t think for a moment I was impugning your patriotism; what you stated about blind loyalty to the kind of people you mentioned is largely true. For example, Wilson promised to keep us out of the first world war but inevitably we were drawn into the conflict to pull the British and French chestnuts out of the fire.

Roosevelt was elected in 1940 on the promise to keep American boys home, then immediately did everything in his power to get us into the second world war. Why? Because the British and French interests were declining rapidly due to the deteriorating military situation, and it took the US to again save their butts - and their financial empires.

When Roosevelt said that Pearl Harbor day was a day that would live in infamy, we didn&apos;t realize that it was his own infamy with regard to American lives that would be discovered down the line. Roosevelt, by the way, was the President who recognized Soviet Union in the 30&apos;s, setting the stage for the aggressive communist plague which exists today.

Roosevelt was idolized by the millions in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s, and still is today by those liberals who can&apos;t believe their hero could do any wrong. The world is a sadder place because of the doddering Roosevelt and his communist advisors, Alger Hiss, for one.

Yes, let&apos;s look at the lessons of history, one of the more prominent being the detrimental legacy of Franklin Roosevelt, a socialist President who makes Richard Nixon look like a patriotic American saint. Why? Because both houses of Congress in his era was dominated by Democrats who would vote down any Republican who dared to ask for investigations of the liberal schemes - just as in the Lyndon Johnson reign.

When the Democrats are in control of either house, crooked goings-on are a matter of course, the latest example being the thievery involved in the Indiana congressional election, where they voted to overthrow the legitimate decision of the state in order to seat their liberal flunky who really had lost.



PLAYING FOR PEANUTS

It looks as though times haven&apos;t changed much. A dedicated musician just wants to play no matter what the money, and only a few hit the big time. I heard that the pay scale in Hawaii is at least a little better than it is here - they pay in macadamia nuts.



ANCHORS AWEIGH REVISITED

During an engineering job in Omaha some years ago, we always had lunch at a particular restaurant downtown. We&apos;d get in there about noon and leave about 1:00 pm. As we entered we would see the Naval Officers from the Navy/Marine installation seated in their usual booth. We would also see them when we left, envying their military two-hour luncheon. We found they were regular navy stationed in Omaha. If you would like to call the naval commander there and verify this, it&apos;s 402-558-7909. Tell him to watch out for whales and icebergs!



HOME DEFENSE

Citizens who are brave enough, and prudent enough, to keep a firearm in the home as a defense against predators should keep some basic rules in mind so they won&apos;t be sued, according to a popular publication.

1. If you hear someone trying to break in, but he is still outside, turn on the lights; he will probably go away.

2. If he is in your house, use your weapon to disable or kill; don&apos;t waste time with a warning shot. He won&apos;t try to warn you.

3. If the predator is still alive after your action, and escapes from the house, don&apos;t fire any more shots if he is outside. If you merely wound instead of kill, you may be liable for civil damages.

4. Very important: Teach your wife and children how to respect and handle firearms; they are tools for certain jobs just as chain saws, axes, knives, and autos are - deadly devices all.

5. If you are liberally oriented, and feel no house should have a gun, or no family should know anything about guns, then pray that your house will never be invaded by one of the predators.

You won&apos;t have a chance to argue rationally against the concept of crime. Let me say

good-bye to you now, before it happens.



359 -1066

This recognition of the above phone number was written in honor of the 1066 Norman Conquest, when William the Second, Duke of Normandy, invaded England and established himself as King William the First, of England.

I note this event because it was the first time since grade school I have been able to use this information that I sweated so hard to learn back when Sister Florentina was cutting a swath with her ruler.



SIMPLE EQUATION

Trying to look at the problem from your standpoint, I can see many sincere reasons why you think the way you do; it looks as though neither of us will change the other&apos;s view.

Let me put it in terms of a simple equation:

Criminal + cheap (or any) gun may = robbery, injury, or both.

Remove Criminal from the equation, and the cheap gun by itself won&apos;t on its own either rob or injure someone.

Oversimplification? Maybe. But all the laws in the world didn&apos;t keep those MOVE idiots in Philadelphia from stockpiling guns, ammo, and explosives. I hated to see the place burn down, but I salute Mayor Goode for his stance on the responsibility.

There&apos;s a law concerning the purchase and use of dynamite; law-abiders respect it; the MOVE&apos;s didn&apos;t even care.



CSA

I have to confess that I am a full Colonel in the Confederate States Air Force, a short step up from former military rank for me. Our job is to guard the air and land within the borders of our beautiful nation, keeping it secure.

When I last looked, no one had stolen a square foot of continental US territory, so we must be doing a great job!!!

The CSA is always looking for good officer material. One of the stringent mental and physical requirements that must be met is for the applicant to have five or ten bucks he can send for his commission as &quot;Colonel.&quot; If you can meet this demanding qualification, send your application to:

Confederate States Airforce, 5892 Denison Drive, Venice, Florida 33595

You don&apos;t have to be a pilot, military or civilian, to qualify - it only takes the bucks. Join, and you will be assigned to my squadron, the leader of which is determined by the flip of a coin. The loser gets to be Squadron Commander.



3:00 AM

Note: At 3:00 am every red-blooded CSA Colonel is contemplating jumping out of bed and facing the day. And shortly after jumping back into his bed, noting that the thick haze before his eyes which would surely prevent anything but IFR.



CHIPPING THE RIGHTS AWAY?

You picked an unfortunate time to discuss the Supreme Court&apos;s chipping away at our rights and freedoms, even though they only classified motor bus type units and did not address house trailers up on blocks.

The reason I&apos;m saying this is that female Milwaukee Judge threw out a confession wherein that murderer &apos;Bobo&apos; had admitted he killed the woman and the child. What if he is now set free? Is that the way you want the laws to work? Knowing you, I think not.

That so-called &apos;judge&apos; really loves the rights of the accused; how is she on the rights of the dead victims - even if they no longer care. There must be a way to use that type of evidence......



NO PROBLEM

If we wait long enough the navy will not have to lift a rudder to flood out many areas. When the earth&apos;s axis tips a few degrees in the right direction, the heat of the sun will melt the polar ice caps, thus raising the level of the oceans.

New York will be under water, possibly clean for the first time, the Mississippi will be 200 miles wide or more, forming a great inland sea. Like the saw says, Las Vegas will have beachfront property, and condos on the Rockies will be in style. The US Navy in Omaha will be afloat at last.

The Soviet Union will no longer be a threat as they will finally have the warmth and moisture to farm and feed their people. Don&apos;t sell your flippers!



KORN

When we dished out the corn back on the farm I remember who most ate it up. Spelling and pronunciation were never my strong points, and I&apos;m trying to think of any strong points existing that could be discussed. Give me a few weaks.



UNION LACKEY

William O&apos;Donnell, one of the minor league mentalities of the county bored, won&apos;t let Coors beer be sold because the Colorado brewery won&apos;t let the union parasites in their plant.

Thus Coors has withdrawn their sponsorship of the free lakefront concerts.

O&apos;Donnell said that his decision was based on saving jobs at Pabst. What an outpouring of horse manure. Coors has been non-union for years. Why? Because the workers voted that way; they didn&apos;t want to give a percentage of their pay to the union bloodsuckers.

This information has been available to O&apos;Donnell for years. Why just now has he taken this idiotic action? Probably because his union mentors are pulling the strings on his back and moving his lips. Too bad they don&apos;t massage his brain on occasion; no, then he might have an original thought, and the union can&apos;t stand lackeys with original thoughts.

One of the other giant intellects of the county, Parks Director Robert J. Mikula, said he would not sell Coors, the reason being that Coors was a non-union company. Mikula said he was given the orders on removal of Coors, but didn&apos;t say who gave the orders. Donald Weber, who works for O&apos;Donnell, said that the county exec gave the order.

What a trio of fruitcakes. What a stupid union. What a bunch of kooky union members.

Why are unions going down the drain in the US? You&apos;ve just heard why!



WHAT, ME WORRY?

The picture of the sub-normal chap with freckles and big ears found on some old calendars, was featured in a 1950&apos;s comic book, and given the name, Alfred E. Neuman.

In truth, there were two such hill-billy families, one with the fictitious name of &quot;Jukes&quot; and the other named Kallikak. The face of Alfred E. Neuman was on a family portrait of one of those families, and was picked out by some hustler to make a buck, and sold to myriad printers.

The &quot;Jukes&quot; name was given to that family group by sociologist R.L. Dugdale, who had concluded that feeblemindedness, degeneracy, and criminality were inheritable characteristics, a theory since disproven by the experts.

I saw that family portrait personally in a high school Civics Book many moons ago. I wonder if the descendants of that family could sue some corporation for damages?

To anticipate your question, no, I was not in the picture.



POISON PEN

Perhaps you saw another of Carlson&apos;s poison pen cartoons in the paper today, the one where someone sees a bomb-carrying thug type in Philadelphia and another identifies him as a member of the police department.

This is, of course, the wimp-like reaction of the bleeding heart type to the Philadelphia story where the unwashed stenches of MOVE caused the situation leading to a fire breaking out and destroying a number of row homes.

What Carlson, in his infinite ignorance, doesn&apos;t relate in the cartoon is that the police dropped a concussion bomb on a roof-top bunker. This type of explosive device blows things up, but it just isn&apos;t an incendiary device; in order to produce the conflagration that was, there had to be inflammable materials in the area, such as gasoline, gunpowder, and the like.

Too bad Carlson has such a liberal, knee-jerk reaction to these things, with a lot less emphasis on the knee.

The fact that many houses were destroyed was unforgivable; the thought that the police caused this situation is inconceivable; the culprits were the filth from MOVE, and no others.

Carlson&apos;s rationale might be described as blaming police for killing bank robbers just because the robbers were trying to get away with the money.

We had better wait to get the entire story on the action before we react to the Carlson sludge; in his case, a word is worth a thousand pictures.

Curtis, where are you now that we need you?



GRINDING IT OUT

It seems that what you&apos;re saying in that Niagara of words is that First Amendment rights are only for groups that you truly like; but, I think not!

And, I note you&apos;ve quoted me at length in some of your arguments. Good! Doing that adds some modicum of reason and thought to that tripe issuing from your sausage grinder. I really understand your motives in actions you&apos;ve taken, but I don&apos;t doubt that the others will see through your approach. I told you once it wouldn&apos;t work to hammer me with the anti-semite club, and I&apos;ll tell you again you&apos;re spinning your wheels, as usual.

And all this talk about nukes and shovels and such; just answer one question - whose side are you on? America&apos;s or the communists? If it is the American side, then why are you continually downgrading our right to make weapons with which to defend ourselves?

And why didn&apos;t you quote the argument from that Chicago writer that caused Von Trier to defend what he thought? Didn&apos;t fit your needs, right? Too bad only your left eye works.



SECRET SOCIETIES

One more thing, , could you please name some of these secret societies of neo-nazis, fascists, reactionaries, etc., that you know of here in staid old Milwaukee? I&apos;d like to see who they are and what they do? I asked my lawyer (a well-known Jewish, liberal, Democrat, attorney) what he knew about these types of clubs. He didn&apos;t know of any for sure. Help us out with some pearls from your vast lexicon of trivia. If you wish, say it in Esperanto. We must keep these things secret, right? Or, are those groups so secret that even their members don&apos;t know they exist?



MINORITY CONTRACTORS

I&apos;ve been involved with engineering and construction jobs worth millions of dollars that use dozens of subs. In my experience, the minority contractors gave us the worst value received for the money. They were always late, did poor quality work, never kept adequate records, and just weren&apos;t up to competition with the regular companies.

Were they too stupid to work? No way; most of the minority subs were bright people; they just lacked the training and experience to compete, right from top management down. Perhaps one of thirty minority subs did quality work, but they knew how to work.

For most minority subs it&apos;s a catch 22, they don&apos;t perform well because of inexperience, and they can&apos;t get experience if no one will hire them on their own merit. If the Bradley crowd wants to do things that way, let them; it&apos;s their bucks. Just don&apos;t ask me to sit there under a Wisconsin snow load in January, with a full house bringing down the roof; it really might come down.



PERVERTED CHILD CARE?

When I mentioned that the fact that a child had been given to a hmsl&apos;s family, then taken away, I didn&apos;t have it correct. There were in fact two children turned over to those creeps. We can guess what kind of upbringing the kids would have had. What a perversion of the word family! What kind of idiotic judge would have allowed that in the first place.

Very recently I have heard that a major hmsl scandal is about to be exposed in San Diego, at a seminary which involved high level priests and students, and implied that the scandal would reach the Vatican. I&apos;ll try to keep the Alphans informed of the events, which, even though disgusting, should be brought into the open.



DEFINITION OF TERMS

I understand now; when you&apos;re at the meeting it indicates absence of knowledge; when you&apos;re not, it indicates knowledge of absence. You have really cleared things up for me.

Did you say you considered the John Birch Society a fascist group? Why? They always seemed a rather harmless patriotic organization. My own reason for not traveling in Bircher pathways was they were always so tight-lipped and grim that it didn&apos;t seem that anyone with a sense of humor would fit in.

What I was asking you for was the names of Neo-Nazi and other fascist organizations that you said were here in Milwaukee. Now if you know some, please expose them so we can all learn about them. To the Bonny Briar club the NRA may be a fascist organization.

One more comment; you seem to take everything so damn seriously; maybe you&apos;re a crypto Bircher.....



NO 2ND AMENDMENT PROBLEM

I&apos;m still taking a whack at that old, dead horse. Can you see the implications in your statement? Leaving off the words Saturday Night Specials, you &quot;see no necessity for the private ownership of____ &quot; You are leaving a blank to be filled by any group who has an ax to grind (or maybe outlaw) for whatever reason.

I&apos;m not arguing with your opinion, it&apos;s your opinion. Mine is mine, and I stand fast. It&apos;s the constriction of private ownership of one item which may lead to constrict private ownership of any other items some group doesn&apos;t like. The first one is always the most difficult; subsequent decisions on what&apos;s ownable will be easier to make, to the detriment of our reasonably free society.

In New York City, any kind of hand guns have been banned for years; the ordinary, law-abiding citizen doesn&apos;t have one; but, every crook in town does. Not much reinforcement for a ban on Saturday Night Specials - or anything else in the broad sense.



WORD PERVERSIONS

What really hurts me as a minor league crafter of words is that the hmsl&apos;s have taken a perfectly fine word like &apos;gay&apos; and turned it into a disgusting label for their nauseating activities. I don&apos;t think hmsl&apos;s would harm &apos;their own&apos; children except perhaps by forcing their un-natural life style on them, causing them to think the style was acceptable/

What I disagree with is taking two normal children and placing them with a couple of male or female hmsl&apos;s living together as &apos;man and wife&apos; in a marital travesty.

My suggestion for a solution of the hmsl problem is to take all the males and segregate them somewhere, away from all contact with normal people, do likewise with the females, and let attrition take care of them. Legally thrusting children into a hmsl household is abhorrent to me.



MANY KIDS ARE MISSING

I can&apos;t recall relegating all of the missing children to the category of those taken by one of the parents; the case was pure and simple kidnap.

Also, having lived in Milwaukee through the Ed Gein story, I don&apos;t recall his killing any children; I think he was a digger, not a doer It boggles to consider that our present civilization is one of the most temperate, and that from the cave dwellers on people killed other people, big and small, by the countless thousands with never a remorseful thought. And except for a few relatively rational portions of the globe today, the killing goes on in places like Africa, New Guinea, Jungles in every tropical climate, and so on; human life in these areas is cheap; the more people per square mile, the less importance is life. The difference between killing in the aboriginal areas versus the more advanced areas is only one of magnitude and sophistication. It&apos;s all part of the continuing tragedy.



WAY ABOVE THE LAW

There is a group maintaining a workplace in which none of the following laws are adhered to:

Civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex, race, or age.

Occupation safety and health laws to protect the workers from unsafe working conditions.

The Freedom of Information Act, which, with few exceptions, requires public disclosure of government operations and information.

Laws giving workers the right to form and join unions and engage in collective bargaining, and providing wage standards for unionized labor.

Who is this anti-labor, anti-union group, and why hasn&apos;t it been compelled by the forces and pressures of the AFL-CIO and Teamsters to fulfill the requirements that every business entity must follow, a group which controls 47,000 workers?

None other than our own US Congress and Judiciary, who many times have the arrogance to believe they themselves are above the laws meant for the peasant classes. However, one of those who does not feel this situation should live on is Representative Lynn Martin (R-Ill.) who has introduced a bill, H.R. 691, to make the parties abide by existing anti-discrimination laws. How far do you think that bill will get?



MENSA

Many of the Alphans I see around here seem as though they also would be eligible for membership in MENSA, a type of discriminatory, exclusive group which sets rules for entry which cannot be circumvented by legal action.

The requirement is that those seeking to attain MENSA membership pass an intelligence test, the results of which, would place the seeker in the upper 2% IQ bracket. If you think you can qualify, write to the address below for the inevitable forms:

Margot Seitelman, Executive Director, American Mensa Limited

170 West 3rd Street, Brooklyn, New York 11223

It doesn&apos;t matter what age group you are in; the tests provide. Give it a try.



NOT TOO GAY

God help that poor kid who was exposed to a lesbian family lifestyle; I hope she can grow up and get over it.

How does she address the problem when someone asks to meet her present &apos;father?&apos; It must be tough; It doesn&apos;t seem natural; I wouldn&apos;t condone it, if it were up to me (although I know it isn&apos;t).

I&apos;d rather be a bigot than a hmsl any day. And who am I to feel that way? Just someone gender normal, but our group outnumbers their group, thank the lord. I just feel sad for them.



COORS REVISITED

A short time ago I mentioned the O&apos;Donnell/Union fiasco where in a sudden attack of stupidity the Milwaukee County Exec banned the sale of Coors beer. The newspaper story also said that Coors had withdrawn their sponsorship of several concerts.

Well, the story was wrong. Even though shut out by O&apos;Donnell and his union string-pullers, Coors will in fact provide the funds to follow through on the concerts as scheduled. That&apos;s a class act. It&apos;s only O&apos;Donnell and his union flunkies that showed their lack of it.



EAST SIDE KIDS

Generally in every large city there is an area where the artists, writers, and other creative people tend to gather. In the rotten apple it&apos;s Greenwich Village; in New Orleans, it&apos;s the French Quarter; in Milwaukee it&apos;s the East Side.

People are less staid and inhibited in those areas; their philosophies are more liberal and less rigid; they have a much higher tolerance for the inadequacies of their fellow human being.

My point was, if books and paraphernalia having to do with the practice of amateur and professional satanism were to be found somewhere, it would be in the more lenient atmosphere of such an area. (Can you see a Satanist store cropping up in the rich suburb of Elm Grove?)

As for my position on the matter, I think any city needs an area where life proceeds in a slow and casual left bank progression, where a starving artist can find a place to write or paint or sculp the great American whatever. Why not?



THE ULTIMATE PAINKILLER

Death is the ultimate panacea; but it&apos;s so damn final!



HEAVY, MAN!

I guess I have to agree that most people listen to the music and enjoy it without thinking of the religious implications or the satanist implications. Even us 39+ year olds who appreciated Beethoven, Mozart, and that bunch can listen to Crue and Maiden, etc., without flinching visibly nowadays.

Actually, it&apos;s difficult to understand the words most of the time, and the grownups don&apos;t really get excited unless they happen to see the lyrics in print somewhere.

But if the implications of the words must be taken according to content, then what about some of these lines.

Quote:

&quot;When we are dancing and you&apos;re dangerously near me, I get ideas, I get ideas...&quot;

or

&quot;That old black magic has me in its spell, that old black magic that I know so well; those icy fingers up and down my spine, that same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine...&quot;

These are only two of a thousand innocuous, for the time, lyrics that thrilled the listeners back in the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s. They sounded great in the song, but in cold print, well........

No one said anything about satanism when Sinatra sang Black Magic. Of course the Catholic Church once banned the lyric, &quot;Heaven can wait, this is Paradise,&quot; because it put the secular before the holy. Now look at the guitar masses going on at St. Rita&apos;s without comment, which would have been considered sacrilegious 40 years ago.

Sorry if I infringed any copyright by quoting the above lyrics; I don&apos;t really know who wrote or owns the songs.



NO STATUS QUO

What I take issue with is your position on maintaining the status quo with regard to our nuclear arms. I feel there must be continuous improvement in both the warheads and delivery systems. If weapon improvement were not a part of military employment in the past, we would be using blunderbusses as arms for our infantry.

Concerning the intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, was it not the Jimmie Carter administration who appointed Stansfield Turner, who proceeded immediately to emasculate the Agency? Turner was no right-wing neophyte. If Carter would have called on the services of Soviet spy, Col. Abel, to try breaking up the Agency, he wouldn&apos;t have picked a more appropriate individual to do so.



MENSA

All right, you got me! I took the test, got a certificate, and paid for about three years of actual membership. Even got invited to the side group of snobs which dealt with the upper 99.9% achievers (stuffy as hell). The point is that Mensa is an achievement, like a degree, once received it cannot be withdrawn. I know of people who flirted about the edge of acceptance, retested, and passed; might depend on your day. Mensa is a great bunch!



LEVELS ATOP LEVELS

I&apos;m aware of the Prometheus Society and the Megas; but consider this: after a certain point, IQ&apos;s become unmeasurable. For Mega and Prometheus, who makes up the questions and tests? They must be based on the first member&apos;s criteria, and allow in those with knowledge identical to his. I&apos;ll be glad to check the 4/1 Omni, as long as that date isn&apos;t germane to the thesis.



CRAVING

Better craving than craven! All I really crave is security for my family and my country; military strength will provide that security, no matter what be the totals.



MOVEABLE POSITIONS

Dogmatic ignorance is better than abject stupidity anytime, but you&apos;ll still have a forum here. Your positions are reminiscent of the Chicago weather - if you don&apos;t like it, just wait a while. Just as shifting and as shiftless.

Your statements live and die within a frame of innuendo and implication, with suggestion only as your weapon, thus allowing you to later state that it wasn&apos;t what you meant.

To you, error is any position contrary to your own. Attempting to wrap yourself in the moderate-conservative package is like the Boston Strangler coming out for women&apos;s rights.



MISSILE NUMBERS

Simply reading the numbers you posted as to quantity make me feel more comfortable from the standpoint of nuclear attack deterrence. You can argue the effectiveness of totals all you want, just as long as there will be no effect on the present stockpile.

If there were no United States nuclear capabilities, the Soviet Union would now control Europe, the Middle East, and be encroaching on Asia. It is only the threat of massive nuclear retaliation that keeps them from a continuous military attack on the regions referenced.



ZEN WHAT?

The number missiles required to keep the Soviets in check has no limit. There is no indisputable figure that can be set, and we really don&apos;t know how much is enough. That is the point! We don&apos;t really know! And if there is any error, it must be on the side of too many rather than too few.

I understand what both you are saying, and appreciate that the quantities reflect a concern for the costs involved, monies that might be better spent for other things in normal circumstances. Any would be able to spend that money in a way nearer to a heart&apos;s desire if it were available. But, until the Evil Empire joins the family of peaceful nations, we are bound to use funds more for guns than butter.



HOMOSEXUALS (HMSL&apos;S)

Your objective response to the subject of homosexuality and its positive and negative points (no puns intended) certainly place the subject in perspective.

As you can see by my pejoratives, I have a completely subjective reaction to the concept, and revulsion at the thought of it eliminates any rational response from me. However, I&apos;m sure you will be able to provide a more clinical discussion of the concept, and I will follow the reports closely.



WAR AND STRATEGY

In the 14th through the 19th centuries, battles were fought according to the principle mentioned, ie: a mass of soldiery on each side, a horn blast, and a fight to the death where the armies met. It was quantity versus quantity both in bodies and firepower.

What made the difference in war since 1914 was the concept of strategy, not that strategy was not used by Napolean and von Clausewitz, et al, but that the sophisticated levels attained by weaponry allowed more sophisticated and effective planes of strategy.

Even now, in the cold war we are in presently, strategy is elemental. If it is indeed a stand-off in terms of nuclear arms, then the various ploys of existing strategic processes are bearing on the quest for advantage in any potential conflict. The MX, the B1, the Strategic Defense Initiative - all are elements of strategy, all are elements denoting the higher levels of sophistication.

In the final analysis, the side with the superior strategy, considering nuclear equality in terms of complete destruction, will emerge with the advantage. Each side has a Damoclean sword over the other; the trick is to hold sway without cutting the string.

Consider that one of the basic tenets of the anti-nuclear weapon crowd is their fear of atomic war. Consider too, the paradox wherein they are anti-SDI, anti-intelligence, anti-military, and anti-hemispheric intervention in the protection of US interests. If, as it is felt, the nuclear confrontation is a standoff, why do the antis want us to withdraw from the non-nuclear arena?

That particular crowd sees no problem with allowing Central and South America, not to mention Mexico, go communist if they wish to, saying the US should have a hands-off policy. It is this mistaken attitude on their part which would bring the atomic holocaust of which they are so terrified.



BULL OF ATOMIC SCIENTISTS

Back in the late 50&apos;s we received a periodical called &apos;The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.&apos;

The claim to fame was the so-called atomic clock, which had a pointer edging closer and closer to the nuclear midnite. It seemed that every time the US came up with a new set of weapons, the clock was moved forward; when the Soviets did the same, the clock hand seemed not to move. So much for parity.

I wonder if the &quot;Concerned Scientists&quot; are a spin-off &apos;Atomic Scientist&apos; group. I&apos;d like to know more about their political stance, although I have a notion where their hearts lie. Let&apos;s see if we can come up some info about the group, and more importantly, their structure, leadership, and sponsors. Maybe he has it in his book of secret societies, although... etc. etc.



ABOMINABLE

Consider this situation: An F-15 is flying over our dairy state. Due to some malfunction, a small, impact-actuated explosive device is released and falls toward a farm below, where it hits a male holstein and lodges in its midsection, somehow failing to explode.

This situation can best be described by one word, abominable!



VIVA COORS

I say more power to Coors and the Coors workers who voted out the shady unions. Remember, this was a vote by the workers themselves to decertify, and a crippling blow to the parasitic unions living off the financial blood of the brewery workers.

To examine the need for a union, let&apos;s look at the following: if workers are low-paid, overworked, have no rights to complain, have no rights to say anything against the company, or just have no rights to do anything, then perhaps it will take a workers&apos; organization with the power to strike

to implement changes.

This is not how it is at Coors! I know the company well, and the workers get top industry wage, and have the right to discuss changes, knowing they will get a fair hearing, and a change if mutually agreeable that the change is for the better. The brewery workers must think this is fair or they wouldn&apos;t have thrown out the union.

Much of the antagonism drawn by Coors is due to the fact that Adolph Coors was a staunch right wing patriot who hadn&apos;t much use for liberals and their socialist philosophy. It&apos;s his privilege to think the way he likes; in fact, as one travels west, liberal thinking generally declines, until one gets to the land of fruits and nuts.

I&apos;ve belonged to some unions in my time; all they did was pick my pocket every week and extract as much as they could, giving nothing in return. Any company that can, should get out from under the union thumb, and let the workers keep the extra money. It could be said with much truth that some reasons for the decline of the American sales overseas can be laid at the feet of the unions, whose ever-insatiable demands of management led to higher and higher wages and prices, to the point where American goods were priced out of the market.

Case in point, AMC/Renault, where a modest company manufacturing a car which some feel is second-rate, has higher unit wages than General Motors workers receive. If they cut a thousand dollars from AMC sticker prices sales might rise, but who knows, the car is still basically unattractive to many.

As can be seen by the statistics, union membership and clout is dropping fast; about 27% of the work force is unionized, down from 52% in the halcyon days of labor. Unions are a concept whose time is gone! Good riddance!



SCHLITZ LOSES ITS GUSTO

The closing and subsequent sale of the Schlitz Brewery to Strohs in Detroit was a direct result of greedy brewery unions trying to drain the lifeblood of the company without regard to company profit margin.

While Schlitz may not have been the best beer in the world to some, it certainly had a national following, and some judicious paring of the high 27 dollar/hour labor package might have saved it.

But perhaps Schlitz management had a bellyful of the unions, and the stockholders just felt it was time to bail out. Now Stroh has the labels and the market, which was the real value of Schlitz.

Some might think it strange, but I think that Kalmanovitz is probably the best thing that happened to Pabst. The deadwood is being shorn away, the management and labor force are being streamlined into a tougher, more effective group, and Pabst may survive yet.

If it doesn&apos;t, it won&apos;t be because Kalmanovitz doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s doing. It will be a cold, hard decision based on whether Pabst is making money. This is the way it should be. There should be a return on investment for the stockholders and the owners; the company shouldn&apos;t be operated merely as a non-profit convenience for the unions and the union workers.



FAR RIGHT ON!

I think that our momentary problem lay in definitions; what is far right vs. far left, and why is it generally all right for anyone to donate to the left but not to the right? Old Armand Hammer has funded more far left groups than Adolph Coors has funded on the right. Generally, in the US, people can do anything they want with their own money, within the statutes. And why shouldn&apos;t they, politics notwithstanding!



UNIONS DWINDLING

The so-called union movement is diminishing every day in terms of membership and financial clout. The women&apos;s movements, for all their bombast, are too smart to turn their dollars over to a group that gives them nothing. It&apos;s too bad the teachers don&apos;t see it that way right now, but they will. The teacher&apos;s unions were necessary to raise wage standards, but in a while the standards will be well established, and the teachers will no longer want to pay the dues - and they won&apos;t.



THE RIGHT PLACE

I think that instead of deploring willy nilly the fact of providing monies to causes in other lands we must examine what those causes are.

If Coors were providing funds to the Afghanistan freedom fighters, that to me would be a good cause. Providing funds to the anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua would be a good cause. Funds for the Solidarity movement in Poland, the Grenadan peoples, or anti-totalitarian groups anywhere - that in my opinion would be for a good cause.

Giveaways to any communist regimes or forces anywhere would be for a bad cause.

If anyone wants to give his money away to anyone else, it&apos;s his money to give; we may or may not like the cause, but for legally expending funds to anyone, there is no prohibition or recourse on a third party&apos;s part.



COUNTY BORES

It looks as though the hapless County Board has shelved any action on allowing Coors to sell beer in areas under County supervision. In fact, one of the county yokels was wearing a Pabst-ornamented shirt during the proceedings, according to the Sentinel.

The actions of the County Board in this case are less than juvenile, and may come back to haunt them later. Free enterprise system? Not where the County is concerned!

I think it would be appropriate for the Sentinel to investigate the purchasing procedures employed by the County Board to see if there have been any sweetheart deals between the County and the Unions - at the expense of the taxpayers. There have been rumors for years; perhaps the Coors/Union/Board/O&apos;Donnell incident will serve to initiate some investigative proceedings.



PABST BREWING

I did some engineering work with Pabst in the past, and the Vice President of Pabst Engineering and I were good friends. I think Pabst has a fine product, and their premium beer is outstanding.

This does not prohibit me from liking and drinking other beers, especially Miller Lite, which is the best of the light beers in my opinion. But I don&apos;t feel that one beer should be promoted over another to the exclusion of another, especially where the instigation is provided by a factor other than basic quality or preference.

The elimination of Coors sales is a Union controlled ploy carried out by a Union lackey. O&apos;Donnell was supposedly elected to carry out the wishes of all the people, not roll over for his ideological masters, Schmitt, Majerus, et al.



TAX REFORM

Like they said, Rostenkowski had a tough act to follow, and he did fairly well to develop a bi-partison atmosphere with regard to Reagan&apos;s theme on tax reform.

I would venture that the reason the tax reform concept has not been argued in this forum is that it still is in a form that will be vastly changed after passing through the various House and Senate committees, joint sessions, and the special interests that will plague it.

Ironically, Rostenkowski implied that tax reform was a Democrat baby that is about to be born; I recall that Harry Truman mentioned that tax reform was vitally needed back in 1949.

Some gestation period.



SCARE UNLEASHED

I read a preliminary review of that particular anti-nuclear program; it seems the producers are pulling our all the scare tactic stops; every minute of the program will be associated with death and destruction in all the negative senses, with the point being there is no hope for any of us unless every nation disarms unilaterally. I hope they watch it in the Soviet Union, they don&apos;t get many laughs on their TV&apos;s. It might be that the review I read is too critical, but with the advent of the scare-documentaries, I don&apos;t feel too hopeful.

One thing you can be sure of: all the doves and anti-nuclear power crowds will be given a tremendous forum for their succinct blather. Here we are, the nation that invented nuclear power for developing cheap electricity, and the anti-nuke crazies are using the courts and the media to slow down or halt this power source. In any case, I hope thinking individuals will see through the propaganda which is ready to blast off. The program is certain to be absolutely subjective.



SOVIET PROPAGANDA ARM

No one has ever accused the Public Broadcasting System, or National Public Radio, of being fair and evenhanded in their presentation of programs.

Except for a sometime appearance by William F. Buckley, the output of both organizations is strictly liberal, left-wing oriented, and the viewer is given this version on almost every program. Even on one of my favorites, Dr. Who, we get the bleeding heart approach - with some United Nations type blubber- in almost every sequence.

The PBS series on WWII was a Soviet produced vehicle telling how they won in spite of their hapless allies. The last thing we need on the public broadcast systems is their offering more Soviet propaganda baloney.

And, it was reported that the President of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting resigned in a tizzy last month during a CPB meeting. Why? Because the Board refused to allow meeting with the Soviet Union broadcasters to buy public programming from them, whereupon some PBS stations then voted to contact the Soviets on their own.

It is well know that monies fed to the NPR people had millions unaccounted for, and no investigation was ever held. Why was this? Anyone know? If it happened in private business, heads would roll. What was it that kept the story a relative secret?

NPR right now has a $7 million dollar debt due to their abysmal management, and they state they need $14 million dollars in 1986, versus the $11.3 million they were being funded. Also, station management has given initial approval to a revised funding structure which would pass money directly to affiliates instead of going through NPR, thereby lessening CPB control.

It will be to the benefit of most Public System listeners and viewers if neither the Soviet propaganda planning nor the funding bypass is ever accomplished. We get enough left-wing rhetoric now.

By the way, that CPB president who resigned was Edward J. Phister; watch for his name in another cushy job connected with Public Systems, in which he will most assuredly try to get the Soviet party line into the broadcasts.



FANTASY DEFINED

I can furnish the link between fantasy and housing projects. A housing project is a place that furnishes cheap rent for those who really need it; the fantasy is thinking you will be safe in a place like that.



NUCLEAR WASTE

I certainly agree with your assessment that nuclear waste must be disposed of in a safe way; however, what should make us think that the NRC and other agency watchdogs do not try to regulate so that we will be safe? Note I said safe; nothing the government does can keep us completely safe.



THREE MILE ISLAND INCIDENT

Your note about the nuclear regulations and potential dangers reminded me of one of the items the NRC can&apos;t handle, and that is the possibility of deliberate sabotage.

At the time of the TMI incident, rumor had it that three months previous to the reactor melt-down, there was a brief article in one of the underground newspapers that all should watch for an important nuclear &quot;accident&quot; at a plant in the east, and all should prepare to take advantage of the event to help block the proliferation of new nuclear plants.

This was reported in some rag in the days following the &quot;accident,&quot; then, very mysteriously, nothing on the subject was ever heard again. It would be interesting to see that underground paper; I think Fonda&apos;s name was mentioned in the article, but I don&apos;t know for certain.



MORE TMI

I&apos;ve read a great deal about the TMI incident inasmuch as I was to be involved in a nuclear powered electrical generation facility in another country, a project which I later turned down, one of the reasons being the quality of the locals who would be running the plant after it was commissioned.

There were a number of suspicious circumstances surrounding the equipment failures, enough to raise questions about the efficacy of plant security. The question of sabotage was not raised after that initial release, but privately I&apos;m sure that there were and still are thoughts on the subject, and I also think that more stringent security measures went into effect in all nuclear installations after TMI.

Having been project engineer on a number of complete high pressure steam boiler applications, I can say that the only real difference between nuclear power plants and conventional power plants stops at the point where steam goes to the turbine generators. They are similar in most respects after the heat source.

Most of the nuclear plants have reactors that fall into the category of either a pressurized water reactor, where a heat exchanger is used to transmit the heat to make steam, or a boiling water reactor where the water changes to steam and is sent directly to the turbines.

Without going into the details of the processes, suffice it to say that although some areas of the nuclear plant vs the coal/oil plant are unique to the process, they operate in almost identical ways. Steam is made and sent to a turbine where it releases its energy, condenses, and flows back as hot water to be again converted to steam.

Many steam generators in the high output/high pressure-temperature range running on coal are just about as complex as nuclear powered facilities. There are to 4 levels of redundancy in most controls, most automatic operations, and all are alarmed for safety. High quality people in the US and other first world countries are running these plants, and are dedicated to their operations not only because of others dependent on a high level of safety, but also because any mistakes on their part might be personally fatal.

If the failure of components at TMI was accidental, and no hard facts have come up to say otherwise, then it took a complex combination of circumstance to cause that failure, and investigation by technical people, and not congressmen or environmentalists, will determine a method of even more human and instrumentational backup to ensure there is no reoccurrence.



NUCLEAR PLANT DANGERS

The real threat in nuclear power plant failure lies not in the reactor itself; if there is a complete melt-down, cooling water would accommodate that phase of the malfunction, as it did at TMI. It is the radiation that causes concern.

One of the most devastating non-nuclear explosions can occur from steam buildup in a large high pressure steam boiler. If a malfunction occurred, and the relief valves failed, a large boiler explosion would level the plant and everything around it for an 8th mile at least. It would have the effect of a small atom bomb.



TAXING SUBJECT

I think the truly wealthy people are about one or two per cent of population, and the others carry the load. Some confuse being wealthy with making a lot of money in a year; there is a difference. Someone once said that if we taxed the wealthy 100% on their annual returns, we could run the country for less than an hour. Big deal!



TEACHERS FOR LOVE OR MONEY

Keep in mind that the individual who enters teaching to make money is doomed from the start, unless he goes on to achieve a full-professorship at some U. with a great number of perks and the opportunity for outside consulting work - plus TA&apos;s to pick up his slack. And only rarely does this happen.

Notwithstanding the Union, I still maintain that teaching is a labor of love that brings rewards to the dedicated that can&apos;t be measured in money.



CRAWLING OUT OF THE WOODWORK

If anyone wonders what happened to the anti-Viet Nam War activists you can probably see many of them next year in &quot;the great peace march&quot; scheduled March 1, exactly one month too soon.

International anti-nuke forces are developing a massive campaign which will include 5000 peaceniks marching from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., and a march to Berlin in which about 25,000 weirdos will be on the trail.

The name of this last dance of the gooney birds is People Reaching Out For Peace, or PRO-Peace, and is directed by David Mixner, who started the Viet Nam Moritorium Committee which organized protests during the southeast Asia war. He was manager of L.A. Mayor Bradley&apos;s campaign and served as co-chairman for Gary Hart&apos;s losing campaign for President. No more description is necessary.

P-P (PRO-Peace) already has a $100,000 in the sack and a crew of 30 people, and are raising more funds by tapping the pockets of liberal types like Paul Newman and developer David Stein. The march director, Stanley Perkins, is dealing with manufacturers of clothing items to raise money and hype the march.

Mixner said &quot;it is the aim of P-P to create an atmosphere that will make it impossible for our leaders not to take nuclear weapons down.&quot;

He didn&apos;t mention how he would force the Soviets to do likewise, or what the Soviets would do if we eliminated our nukes. He said that he expects to use mass communications to encourage Soviet citizens to pressure their leaders to get rid of nuclear weapons. Where has this fellow been living for the last 20 years? Probably in a dream world.

In any case, the P-P group is planning a four phase campaign as follows:

Phase 1: The great peace march.

Phase 2: The civil disobedience effort in which plans to have over 250,000 people go to jail, like the Chicago &quot;peace riots&quot; back in 1968.

Phase 3: The march to Berlin, where 25,000 West and East Germans will be marching. If Moscow didn&apos;t like the plan, there wouldn&apos;t be any East Germans involved, you can believe that. (I wonder how many of the OstenDeutchers will defect to the west; and so do the Soviets)

Phase 4: Mass communications to the Soviets citizens to pressure their leaders. (Does the slave pressure his master? Not a chance.)

Well, get ready for the TV Toonervilles to go all out in coverage of this new crop of the sleazy unwashed. What I will be waiting for is the gracious welcomes the scummy tribes get when they pass through some of the western towns. Horrors! Suppose the townspeople are waiting fully armed with large supplies of soap and hot water? If I remember the anti-American Viet Nam marchers, that will be a terror too terrible to anticipate.



AUTOMATIC

Your automatic reactions invite automatic assumptions; it&apos;s easy to forcast your every answer to a given question:

If it&apos;s:

Reagan, you&apos;re against it.

Administration, you&apos;re against it.

Military, you&apos;re against it.

Nuclear, you&apos;re against it.

Conservative, you&apos;re against it.

Aid to those fighting the communists somewhere, you&apos;re against it.

Republican, you&apos;re against it.

Groucho sang, &quot;Whatever it is I&apos;m against it!&quot; With you, the malady lingers on, especially when you glance in the Right direction. If predictability is a virtue, then you are a masterpiece of rectitude.



LOGIC

I still think that absolute logic is defined in true and false statements; all else is compromise; if it isn&apos;t true-false, it isn&apos;t logic!



THE REVENGE BUSINESS

Well, from the news reports it would seem to be a good day for the nazi hunting business. It appears that time and events caught up with Joseph Mengele, giving him the fate he richly deserved.

I believe that all of the WWII criminals like Mengele should be caught and shipped back to Germany for trial. What I don&apos;t care for is the professional hunters using the fears and experiences of others to feather their own nests and travel over the world to flaunt local laws in their heavily financed searches.

What I like even less is our government&apos;s using KGB &quot;evidence&quot; to try deporting those that are only accused, to the eastern bloc without solid fact to support accusations. But, I guess all&apos;s fair in the revenge business.



NORMAL

I&apos;d say &quot;normal&quot; represents the opinion of the majority of a given group. In the Congo and the South Seas, cannibalism was considered normal by that society; in other societies, different mores dictated. I think it comes down to - join the mob of your choice.

I guess that if most of the people in a society feel the same way about the same things, and what they feel, they themselves would consider to be normal. Generally, the average guy thinks he is normal. Others may feel, as hmsl&apos;s do, that their way is normal, but not average. This is a difficulty in working with fixed labels.



COMPOSITION

How can I believe your story about the gases with the funny names like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. I have an old Soviet text book here that says the universe is made up of earth, air, fire, and water, and touches on a new phlogiston theory. Exciting new discoveries are being made about the ether of space, even as you speak.



TAX PLAN

No one will know the full impact of Reagan&apos;s tax plan until the bill is passed and signed. Then we&apos;ll be able to comment. Congress will have it&apos;s porcine say - that&apos;s where the problems will lie. Remember the guy who said, no one&apos;s wife or property is safe when the legislature is in session; and, when it&apos;s Congress, keep both hands on your wallet.



BORED TO DEATH

One special method, beloved of most teaching administrators, is the old approach of directing towards the least of the class, whereupon boring the hell out of the upper strata.

And if aimed at the upper strata, any below are even more bored with info beyond their immediate capabilities.

The answer may lie in ability-based schools, attendance determined by test, for the low, medium, and high capables. The barriers to this may include both cost and resentment.

Yes, I was bored to death in high school, and except for athletics, may not have stayed. It was not until the college educational phases that I felt a proper challenge. The problem will remain as long as teaching is aimed at the mediocre and their slower assimilation pace.



NOW YOU HAVE IT...

The story about the guy who wants his cake for nothing, provided by someone else, is precisely the way our welfare system techniques have been ingrained in the populace. The old saw of not getting something for nothing, or the concept of no free lunch, is valid just as long as the government doesn&apos;t maintain a giveaway system.

Unfortunately, the four generations of welfarites in this country demand all free from the state, and at a level equal to the workers who provide the cost-free ride on life&apos;s railroad.

Maybe you really don&apos;t feel that way, but that&apos;s how it sounded.



AWESOME TASK

Welcome to you new members! That task, of course, is trying to remember all the conversations in the Alpha-Omega forum. Some might say the word is tiresome instead of awesome, but what do they know. Luck we record all!

As you absorb the arguments you will come to the conclusion that battle lines are drawn between the political factions here on Alpha, with times out for some homespun philosophy and general tom-foolery when the rhetoric permits.

Feel free to join in at any time, on any subject. So far the fatalities have been few and figurative. Blood shed in argument needs no transfusing.

As you plow your way through live and recorded Alpha you will also note the half vast range of subject matter touched upon by the denizens. No sharp objects are allowed us except minds, but they are the best media; like those on the Enterprise, our communicators are both argument devices and weapons of attack and defense.

&quot;Lay on McDuff, and damned be he who first cries, hold...my brain hurts.&quot;



REASON PREVAILING

Let us applaud the 15 or so members of the Milwaukee County Board who utilized common sense, instead of subjective union hogwash, and voted to kill Dip O&apos;Donnell&apos;s attempt to keep Coors out of the hands of us naive county inhabitants.

O&apos;Donnell&apos;s ploy was merely a play on the emotions of the union powers that be to ensure the goodies coming in from the locals as the next election nears. The dubious strategy may come back to haunt him. Voters, whether they are Demo or GOP, aren&apos;t going to vote for a completely inept nut no matter his affiliation.

It&apos;s about time Mr. O&apos;Donnell was gracefully retired by the voters of his area; he&apos;s getting to be an embarrassment to them, and there are many qualified Demos that could take his place without periodically licking the boots of the local labor louts.

Maybe the vaunted clout of the unions is slipping even lower these days, as the Board members dared to take a stand against labor&apos;s dictates. Perhaps the time is past when labor said jump and the politicians said how high?



LOOKING DOWN AT LAWYERS

Recent days have provided the results of a new poll relating to the standing of relative professions and trades in the United States. The poll indicated that Lawyers were near the bottom of the group, just below drug smugglers.

Politicians ranked in the immediate area, some above, some below, dependent on local, state, or national office. Documentation cannot be provided at this time because the info was heard from radio news -- but it certainly figures.



BY THE NUMBERS

Now I&apos;m only going to say this once about the importance of numbers:

The number 100 is far superior to the number 13, when expressed in terms of in-pocket dollars, or even Kruegerands and Swiss Francs. This knowledge transcends all other aspects of numerology.



UNION ISSUE

I viewed the Coors issue as a union issue when I heard that O&apos;Donnell said it was, when Ray Majerus said his outfit backed the ban against the scabs, and when it was ordered that no union member should buy Coors; all due to the fact that Coors, in their enlightened wisdom, does not have a unionized brewery. Outside of that, I have no really significant reasons for criticizing the board or the union.



NEO-NUMBERISM

While I&apos;m not enthusiastic about the usual math after having pursued Theory of Mathematics some distance, I am intrigued by the possibilities of Calculust, which you mentioned in your note.

Old Carter had some kind of lust in his heart; was it passion, or merely Calculust. Did the sight of 6 over 9 cause a bad case of Calculust or was it the provocative concept of how many times 3 would go into 2? Yes, I can see the possibilities of a course in Calculust 101; they would be standing in line trying to sign on. All I want to know is, how did a nice, Christian guy like you get into so erotic a field? Is Calculust sort of like playing with Pebbles on the beach? (Pebbles works at that strip joint in Greenfield)



RETALIATION

Those two-bit garbage countries who need issues to cover the fact their people need the basics in life generally have a military capability which they use to keep down the people and flaunt to their peers.

My response is, blast their military back to bows and arrows; airfields, barracks, weaponry, naval vessels, tanks, etc., as a lesson to the other petty tyrants like the KaDaffies.



PABST REVISITED

When visiting the Milwaukee plant, a side trip to the hops room is always good for a lungfull of perfume; truly an aroma from the gods. Fellow named Keith there is an old friend, and now runs plant engineering. Too bad Pabst has such an inept ad agency; their products are too good to sell like animal crackers.



GUNNING FOR HUNTERS

The anti-gun forces are at it again, trying to strike at the rights of our Wisconsin hunters.

It seems that an attempt was made to slip through the Board a prohibition of guns on county property. This means that a hunter on his way up north, using a freeway, could be subject to arrest, sentence, or fine merely for having his rifle or shotgun uncased and unloaded locked in the trunk of his car in accordance with state law.

The self-styled societal watch-dogs are at it again, trying to get the first toe in the door in their ultimate aim of banning ownership of all guns. If they really want to determine people&apos;s feelings on the matter in this hunting hotbed, let O&apos;Donnell hold a countywide referendum on the matter - with his job on the line. I wonder who his replacement would be?

If what they are really after is a law proscribing the carrying of a concealed firearm on one&apos;s person, then why don&apos;t they be specific. I&apos;m for the licensed carrying of concealed weapons in any state. So are many law enforcement officials. What did A.E. Van Vogt say? An armed society is a polite society.



DISASTER

The Oklahoma fireworks factory that just blew up the other day killed about 20 some people for sure, and most likely some others who are unidentifiable due to their being in bits and pieces.

Contrast this extremely small plant with the complexity of the nuclear power plant, with its dozens of people on site, none of whom have been killed since the industry began.

This is not the first fireworks plant tragedy. Others in this and foreign countries have obliterated themselves in the flash of a moment. Where are the Hanoi Janes and their ilk marching in protest? Since this type of explosion is chemical, they don&apos;t care to get involved.

The inevitable conclusion is that the Fondas and their cohorts are aiming strictly at weakening the power output capabilities of the United States, and a cynic would believe it is at the behest of the bandit nation who would best benefit from an American power collapse.

The function of the atom in releasing the energy in the form of heat to make steam is still a mystery in the mind of the hoi polloi, as generally is anything demanding a thought process level above that of a chimpanzee. A massive public relations campaign aimed at educating the masses as to the workings of the nuclear systems, in terms they could understand, is long overdue.

If the average power consumer could be shown both the advantages and the levels of risk involved with nuclear power, and with coal/oil power, it&apos;s almost a certainty he would opt for the nuclear approach, especially considering the impact on his power bills.

The vacillating minds of the public in decisions is legend. The casualties of the Viet Nam war were overstressed; the fact that more men, women, and children are killed each year in auto accidents is acceptable.

If one is to lose his life without fuss or bother, it should be as a result of travel accident, suicide, drowning, electrocution, falls, machinery, or any other mundane causes, including murder (if one is poor); just don&apos;t get killed by chance radiation, serving in the military, or even in a hijack.

 

The media will see you have a splendid burst of publicity, even if you won&apos;t be around to appreciate it.



ANTI-GUNNERS BALONEY

Maybe I have jumped the anti-gunners, but it&apos;s better than being put through their hoops. The basic premise of my talk was that the anti-gunners are looking for any way to get that manicured foot into the doorway to develop a beginning wedge between gun owners and their weapons.

The methods of the anti-gunners are exemplified by their attempts to get a first, &quot;innocuous&quot; anti-gun bill passed, then when any fuss dies down, to add to it more and more until confiscatory procedures are instituted. It&apos;s the old Soviet baloney technique - get to your unsavory objective a thin slice at time, so the slicees don&apos;t really feel the pain.

And with respect to the machinations of any group whose roots are liberal Democrat, any type of law or regulation they generate should receive the most comprehensive scrutiny to determine what bit of socialistic fluff they are trying to perpetrate under the guise of beneficial legislation.



NUCLEAR FUTURE

In a few years the big ball of plasma with be made stable in its flights of fusion and we&apos;ll all have cheap, clean electric power. It&apos;s only a matter of time. Then Hanoi Jane will be marching for some other cockamamie cause like: Save the Stegosaurus!



DELAYS&amp;COSTS

With your environmentalist position on nuclear plants, I can&apos;t believe your question about why nuclear plants in various stages of construction are being shut down.

The reason is simple: The self-styled saviors of Mother Nature, the &quot;Environmentalists,&quot; have twisted the US court system into a weapon whereby they utilize their obstructionist tactics to delay implementation of the construction and operation.

Each month they delay a given project is another few million tacked onto the ultimate project cost. The environmentalist nuts have cost the consumers of this nation untold millions of dollars in power costs, and the end is not yet in sight.

Meanwhile, other countries who have used the basic nuclear plant knowledge developed in the United States are laughing their collective heads off at the stupidities generated here, instead of the electric power that should be supplied at lower cost.

And I can&apos;t believe your statement concerning an alleged irresponsible use this country makes of nuclear power. We have nuclear power plants that produce electric power, and we have nuclear weapons that protect your ass and mine from the enemies of the Republic.

I don&apos;t want to place you in the category of the environmentalist cuckoos, who make all kinds of carping and complaining statements, but never come up with viable answers in today&apos;s technologies; however, tell us what you would recommend as a course of action in this age of the atom. I wonder what Henry David Thoreau would have thought about those cuckoos? He likely would have re-written Civil Disobedience.

Shall we continue on into the ultimate development of fusion, or shall we retrogress to the wood burning days? As one of the Sierra Clubbers said one time, wood smells so good when it burns, why can&apos;t everyone use it?

No wonder they haven&apos;t been seen fighting forest fires.



WASTE.....

If the French are successfully neutralizing the waste problem, why aren&apos;t we doing the same? The longevity of any unit or plant is a function of replacement. Concrete can last 200 years; why should it be replaced? As for other parts, remember the famous hammer that was over 75 years old; the farmer that owned it only replaced 7 handles and 5 heads, and it still worked like a new one. Maintenance will do it.



CONTINENTAL AIR

I can understand that Airline Pilots Association issues the information that they do, but after all, it&apos;s their members on strike. Some of the stuff they came up with sounds pretty picky, and that part about the pilots not knowing where the IFR or ILS units are doesn&apos;t ring true.

It&apos;s like listening to the bulletins issued by the UAW when they strike one of the major auto manufacturers.



TACTICS

I would suggest that it was not the nuclear power plant designers and builders that used scare tactics. It was the weeping willies from the Sierra Club and Nader&apos;s Nosers, along with others of that ilk, that used those tactics, marching against the company at TMI.

But it&apos;s not difficult to get the loonies to march; this morning&apos;s paper had a picture of some female geeks carrying signs saying &quot;veal is poison,&quot; or &quot;don&apos;t eat meat,&quot; or some such goop. Goes to show that people will march to any limping drummer if their ganglia can be aroused.

But, I also would go out and march - to support our military forces who may be fighting in Nicaragua fairly soon. Look for me, I&apos;ll be the one holding up the American Flag.



OH THAT POOR, POOR UNION

Let&apos;s all shed a tear for the poor guys who are picketing the supermarket stores today. They are all so weak and inoffensive. All they did was smash up somebody&apos;s car, threaten customers, shoot a gun at someone, and little tiny pranks like that, just to get our attention in their own inimitable style. Gee! What a noble cause; what exemplary actions! Will Milwaukee&apos;s finest, under the new Chief, do anything. How can they? Some are union first, cops second. Oh, they&apos;ll protect the weak little union kids from the nasty customers and guys who want to work to make a living. How long is this country going to let the Union Goons get away with that kind of intimidation?

It&apos;s a rambler of a different color down in Kenosha where Majerus, Schmitt, and Koenig, those tieless, rough-talking, heroes of more, more, more are running into a management that couldn&apos;t care less about the blue color image this hapless trio tries to effect for working-stiff sympathy.

We hear their pontificating on what they will force the company to do for the good of the AMC workers, but the real truth is that they are in a hapless position where their only offense is capitulation. All those years of big-mouth from the union bosses are going down the drain in a losing cause. AMC says, play it our way or there&apos;s no game. The union has given up more turnovers than the Chicago Bears, and it will continue.

This is the approach that the return swing of the pendulum is bringing, where companies will no longer let high wages and fringes sap the vitality of the firm in an inexorable plunge to bankruptcy.

They are bad-mouthing new owner Kalmanovitz for trimming the deadwood from Pabst, but he is correct in what he is doing to make Pabst viable if possible. It still might be a tough job for the brewery to continue, but I hope it does, and it will be Kalmanovitz that saved it.

Where is the hot air from County Exec O&apos;Donnell in the Kalmanovitz sale? He did just about nothing, except nobly fight the Coors battle, and will ultimately lose that attack also.

I guess the only thing worse than taxation without representation is taxation with representation. Politicians, Unions, they&apos;re all part of the main problem of the city, county, state, and nation......not to mention the US possessions.

(I told you not to mention them!)



HOSTAGE CRISIS OVER?

The latest from the middle east indicates that the hostages are either on their way to, or already in, Damascus.

There has been an expected din of complaint from those who ask why our government didn&apos;t take any action; I wonder if they think the Shiites simply began to start the release process out of the goodness of their hearts?

Only a few of us cynics can consider that the release mechanism was tripped because the administration stood fast in the media, and talked tough in diplomatic conversations. Perhaps the language went along the lines of the Americans alive or Berri dead, something to that effect; or deliver them now and we won&apos;t turn your places into more rubble than they are.

When the U.S. was a young nation, the Barbary Pirates of Tripoli captured some American; the then President said, either our guy alive, or your leader dead. It worked then, it probably worked now.

One of the wimpier columnist questioned why the Soviet Union doesn&apos;t have any skyjacking; the reason seems to be that the commies are the instigators of all the hijackings, they or their surrogates, and they don&apos;t schedule action for their own flights.



NUKE SITES

The only criticism I would have of your plan is that many in Lebanon still consider America (not Israel, however) as a friend. It&apos;s the crazies with the guns that hate us, usually Shiite Heads that look to Khomeni as their leader.

And further, we also have friends in Iran, who still look ahead to the downfall of all the Ayatollahs and the reinstatement of a Pahlavi on the Peacock Throne.

That leaves Assad and Syria, and if Assad follows through with the assistance on the returning of the hostages, we will all view him in a more charitable light for his help, even though we all know it was the potential for strong US military action against Syrian interests that helped nudge him

Do we blow up marxist Yemen, or Khadafy&apos;s Libya? Who&apos;s left?

We all realize that the terrorism of the entire world can be traced back to the Soviet Union, and nuking them into a Siberian winter would go a long way to put a halt to such activities. Of course, we could then expect retaliation, causing a much larger problem with our own existence.

What&apos;s proper? First, let&apos;s find out who the individuals were that carried out the hijacking and eliminate them by any means. Next find the leader of the group that planned the hijacking and snuff him out along with his chief lieutenants. Issue a position statement that any nation who allows a hijacked plane to land and take off again refueled will no longer have a place to land an airplane, and will lose any sort of economic help and/or trade between them and the US.

Like the man said, terrorism has awakened the sleeping giant representing the citizenry of the United States, and once that happens, a universal acquiescence for any kind of retribution will be smiled upon by our people, to the extreme detriment of the terrorists and their countries of origin.



RUSSIA&apos;S TERMINAL ILLNESS

Recently, an analysis written for the CIA stated that the Soviet Union was beginning to fall apart of its own weight, and that the only query was to whether it would go out with a bang or a whimper.

Even newspapers sympathetic to much of the Soviet position in the world, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, confirm that the Soviets are in deep trouble. Even after more than 67 years of Communism the place can&apos;t feed itself or give its people adequate medical treatment.

The Soviet Union is the only industrialized country in the world where the infant mortality is going up and life expectancy is falling. They have a 60% to 70% abortion rate overall, and for the Balts and Slavs, the Soviet ethnic core of producers, the rate is almost 80%. It would seem that the more educated just don&apos;t want to bring children up in such a nation. Entire towns - men, women, and children - all get helpless drunk at the same time. The Soviets spend more for booze than anywhere in the globe, buying their vodka by the carton, 20 half-liter bottles at a time, and they spend less for food than for alcohol.

While the able, working-age population of the Soviet Union, about 67% of those who are the producers of industrial goods, are declining, the Moslem Republics have a very high birth rate, and are absorbing vast amounts of rubles for their schools, hospitals, and infrastructure.

That entire 67 years of communist rule has not progressed, but has caused the Soviet Union to remain a 19th century type empire, composed of 100 nationality groups, who are all dominated by the Soviets. There is not one of those nationality groups who is content with the Soviet-controlled arrangement, and who would not rather have its own political and economic choices.

The present Soviet economy can produce little except weapons, and this has caused the economy to shrink, making even weapon production costly and inefficient.

History appears to be catching up to the world&apos;s last rigidly surviving empire, and the Polituro, the group containing the top Soviet leaders, seems to have few choices open:



GOONS&amp;THEIR BRETHREN

I suppose that &quot;goons&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; certainly are descriptive words for the union personnel that do little criminal things like destroy property and shoot at people, sometimes killing them. Yet, I also suspect that the vast majority of strikers are just regular guys whose only forceful activity is yelling at customers and others who cross a picket line, and are simply the union sheep who follow the shady leaders.

When we shop at Sentry, they call us scabs as we go into the store lot. That&apos;s all right, we call them union dummies. It&apos;s the union goons and thugs destroying life and property that I dislike, and I think labels mentioned, and a few other choice terms, fit them very well.



TEHERAN TROUBLES

Going relatively unreported is the growing opposition of the Iranian people against the Iraq/Iran war. The poor in south Teheran, who have had Iraqi bombs fall in their living area, and who have historically been Khomeini&apos;s staunchest supporters, are taking to the streets to express their rising dissatisfaction with continuance of the stupid war.

The people, and their leaders (other than Khomeini) are afraid that a there will soon occur a general economic collapse or paralysis, as the war has caused shortages, rising unemployment, and a sharp decline in living standards.

Perhaps the handwriting is on the wall for the Ayatollahs also. May their tribe decrease!



FIDEL&apos;S FOLLIES

Is there no limit to Castro&apos;s flair for absurdity?

The United States has at long last erected a transmitter in Florida to counter the twaddle broadcast every day by Radio Havana. Each broadcast from Radio Havana is a second-rate mish mash of communist propaganda, delivered by a man-woman team which wouldn&apos;t last a minute on any station in the free world. The broadcasts are so inferior in style and substance that they&apos;d be laughable, if it were not for the fact that some people might believe some of what they say.

But Radio Marti, America&apos;s answer to Havana, is broadcasting in Spanish to Cuba&apos;s citizens a free-world view of events taking place on the globe, and trying to be as factual as possible. This, of course, nettles the bearded buffoon, so he is taking rigorous action. He is barring Cuban-American tourists from visiting Cuba.

This, in turn, has a devastating impact on Cuba&apos;s &quot;dollar stores,&quot; that raise coveted US dollars for the Castro regime by sales to exiles who buy for local family members and relatives.

This will cost Cuba about 50 million dollars a year, over a third of its income from tourism. Way to go, Fidel, you&apos;ll show those Yankees how smart you are!

(What especially galls Fidel is the fact that the American broadcasting station is named after a famous Cuban patriot and writer of the late 1800&apos;s, Jose Julian Marti, who was involved in the fighting for Cuba&apos;s freedom just before the turn of the century)



RECLAMATION

The most difficult chore about digging the Milwaukee Journal out of the garbage can is probably one of identification.



HAGGLING

It&apos;s reminiscent of the old story about the fellow at the bar who asks the beauty next to him if he could take her to his room for a million dollars. She said, certainly. He then asked her if she would come for 20 dollars? She replied, what do you think I am? He said, we&apos;ve already established that, we&apos;re merely haggling about the price.



NEW BUCKS FOR OLD

Technology, often a two-edged sword, has given us yet another event for which to look forward in 1988. In that year Treasury will issue newly designed U.S. currency.

The Treasury says that this is being done in order to bypass any low level counterfeiting through use of color copying machines. It could be that the real intent is to neutralize the circulating currency held in secret by drug dealers and tax evaders, who would not be able to turn in vast amounts of cash for replacement without being asked the origin of the wealth. Fine with me!

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing, along with the Federal Reserve, have expended over 32 million dollars in the attempt to develop operational anti-counterfeiting devices such as, watermarks, reflective inks, embedded magnetic strips, and the most promising of all, a hologram right on the bill representing the Great Seal of the United States.

It appears that the hologram approach is in. The American Bank Note Co. of New York has been paid almost 1.6 billion dollars to research hologram printing on bank notes. The hologram seal cannot prevent counterfeiting 100%, but will prevent running off one&apos;s mortgage payment on an IBM color copier.

There are a number of other measures under Treasury consideration which will not be publicized, but will be used for the new currency. Perhaps it will be in the form of a radioactive mark which will send a signal direct to the IRS when a certain volume of banknotes is reached. Look for a big liberal/conservative fight on this issue; as for me, I couldn&apos;t care less what form it takes, just so long as whatever amount finally gets to me is negotiable.



PARIS REVISITED

Anyone who has visited romantic Paris can remember the overripe smells from the Seine (either bank), the rude shopkeepers, the sleazy ladies of the evening, the blowsy provincials, the Gallic arrogance, the noses pointed skyward when meeting an American, whose country pulled the French chestnuts out of two fires at the cost of a lot of fine American soldiers, the crummy taxicabs, the messy restaurants that charged those horrendous prices, the weird socialist political system, the general malaise of a country in mental constipation, remember all that?

Well, prepare to be surprised! Finally there is a tour of Paris which bypasses all the above and gets to the bottom of French Culture where it really lives!

Two guided tours a day will take one to the legendary and labyrinthine sewers that lie below the crudded city. Near the Metro stop, at the Place de la Resistance, down the stairway next to the Seine River, is the entrance to the sewers.

The trips in the sewers themselves take a half hour, and are advertised as clean, easy, and pleasant.

So very different from the trashiness topside, in the top tourist trap of the money-grubbing world.



OFF THE BEAM

I have an acquaintance that owns a Baron; he flies down to the Caribbean islands on occasion, landing on a private strip that has only a low power beeper to home in on.

He decided to stop at a big city on the way down, got the VOR and set up for auto. The tower gave him straight in for 23 and he landed, taxied over to the place GC gave him, and waited. Two minutes later a squad of Cuban soldiers surrounded the plane and made him get out while they searched.

You&apos;re right! He landed at Havana International on a clear day with 30 miles. They found a flare gun in the plane that his partner had left with the emergency gear, and made a big fuss about it. In order to get out of the place he had to give the Cubans all his money, his wrist watch, a portable radio, and almost everything but his clothes. In appreciation, the Cubans gave him 450 lbs of Avgas. But they did let him go the same day; it only took about four hours to convince the Cubans that this guy was as stupid as he seemed, and maybe so.

Here&apos;s a case where he didn&apos;t check the code signal (the Havana VOR really works like it&apos;s supposed to). I won&apos;t tell you his name, but he owns an electrical supply mfg company in Milwaukee. Last I heard he was going to install an RNAV. The only excuse I can see for him was he was thinking of his own ladyhawk who also flies and lives in the area. Even so...



WENR/WLS

Back in the thirties and forties, two stations shared the same 890 kc frequency, WLS and WENR. WLS was the hayshaker station; that had the National Barn Dance on Saturday evening with people like Lulubelle and Scotty, Sons of the Pioneers, and a flock of other well known pre-country western/rock stars.

We got Soaps from WENR along with assorted nifty programs like Jolly Joe Kelly. Both stations were adequate in their time frames. The powerful Chicago station was independent WGN (50,000 watts, clear channel), and coming up fast in the late 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s was WBBM, which is now one of the premier CBS outlets.

I was involved with WBBM a few years ago when Frank Reynolds headed up news there, and Jack Kennedy had a brief stay before moving to Boston. We did a few things but nothing world shaking.



MAKING OUR DAYS

I would say that many of the people who are suggested as being Clint Eastwood fans are really Dirty Harry fans, and can identify with Harry as he uses the right tools for the right jobs, blowing away all the crooks by meeting violence with a higher degree of a more sophisticated violence, certifying that the criminal will pay for his crime instead of receiving a slap on the wrist from a liberal judge.

We all have some Dirty Harry in our psyche, hoping to see punishments meted out to the violent criminal element even if we ourselves cannot do it in a satisfactory manner.

Eastwood is not yet a super movie star, but he is a very competent actor. His reputation has been made and enhanced by the types of roles he undertook: the cowboy, the cop, the lone individual, who must fight the weaklings of the establishment simply to protect them from the very ones who would prey on them.

The argument is clear; those who would bleed for the criminals, who would follow every contrived rule for the preservation of so-called criminal rights, who shed all those tears for the killers because they have been shaped by an unhappy environment, who would pat thugs on the head with a kind hand instead of a nightstick, they are the ones who are wrong, and in the end of the Eastwood tales are proven so.

That is why Harry is so great; he does for us what we can only experience in a vicarious manner, helping hold straight his .44 mag, saying with his voice, make my day!



ATTACK ON NRA

I can&apos;t believe that irrational argument about the NRA, a argument full of, among other things, accusation, distortion, and outright lies about an organization who is four square for law and order, is behind the Constitution 100%, and believes in the America first, last, and always. To tie the NRA up with death threats is sheer stupidity!

This is a group that holds young hunter training and safety classes, and issues competency patches; it tries to provide a recognition that we are a nation of laws; it fights for the hunters, sport shooters, and gun collectors to make certain that the right to bear arms is not taken away piecemeal by the ultraliberals, leftists, and cowards.

 

I don&apos;t even belong to the NRA, but I feel their ideals are American ideals, and that your castigation by innuendo is more fit for the Sierra Club and its ilk than the NRA. Granted O&apos;Donnell is a political animal, and will vote in accordance with the winds of election, but he is no NRA backer, not by a long shot. He just sees what side his political bread is buttered in a State and County populated by thousands of hunters. The liberals on the County Board have just given their opponents an issue that will return to haunt them out of office.



CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

While the bumbling bumpkins from the County Board were agonizing over an exercise in stupidity, a pretty, young biomedical engineering student was brutally murdered by some violent sex-criminal with a knife. This animal had been convicted in the past for lesser crimes, but of course was let out to strike again. Why is it we can&apos;t have capital punishment in Wisconsin to eliminate the killers and murderers? What good does it do to lock them up and pay for their keep, knowing that they will find God and be released for their good behavior? Let&apos;s try them, convict them, and execute them. Underground, out of mind!



LIKE JUDGE BEAN

He said, once they&apos;re hung, they don&apos;t rob no more banks. Of course an appeals process should be kept intact, but I think it is agreed that the cure for future murder and rape is the elimination of the cause, and even if anyone hedges a bit, they are on target with the biblical quote, &quot;an eye for an eye, etc.&quot;

What grieves is that poor girl&apos;s family, out of state. who had to be awakened in the middle of the night with the phone call. What a hear-rending blow. I say kill the thugs who kill and rape! That poor kid. Who will her family sue for 5 million or so dollars?



REGISTRATION

Notice: Based on the Marquette U. killing, the County Board will hold public hearings on how to implement registration of all knives in Milwaukee County. The question will be how to engrave each knife with a number, and how much tax money should be raised to do it.

Any knife over 1/2&quot; long will be considered a deadly weapon and cannot be transported on County property.

Any transgressors of this future law will be immediately arrested and tossed into the pokey without regard, unless it happens to be a certain board member of darker persuasion who has an &quot;arrangement&quot; with the law enforcement officials in the county. Black is not only beautiful in this case, but it has a built-in anti-incarceration filter.

And boardroom Betty, one of the most innovative of the County Board, is preparing a rape-weapon registration program to be implemented soon. Again the problem is numerical registration with an I.D. on each weapon. She exclaimed, what about tattooing? For a mandatory fee, of course. (Rumor has it that she might handle each case personally)



STILL HIGH

I was compelled to research the high point to verify Timm&apos;s Hill as the greatest in altitude, just to check on you high guys. The Book of Wisconsin states that the highest &apos;surveyed points&apos; in the state are: Timm&apos;s Hill at 1952.9 ft, Pearson&apos;s Hill 1950.4 ft (both are in Price County), Rib Mountain at 1940.8 ft in Marathon County, and Sugarbush Hill at 1939.3 ft in Forest County.

By the by, the book spells it Tim&apos;s Hill, so it must have been named after the surveyor. Does anyone know if there are any supposedly higher points than Timm&apos;s Hill which have been surveyed? I heard of another high point in Price County, but don&apos;t know where it is.

Note: Did you know that Jefferson Davis, who became president of the Confederacy, once commanded a labor crew that cut timber near the upper Wisconsin River in 1828 to build Fort Winnebago?

Well he did, like it or not!



STATE OR FEDERAL

An interesting point was broached concerning ownership of the big lake. A few years ago, anyone could fish at any time in Lake Michigan without a fishing license, the rationale being that it was controlled by the Federal government. When the salmon were planted, it seems that all was changed, and a license became a requirement to fishing. I don&apos;t know if jurisdiction was transferred, but I thought that the state owned the lake out to a certain point, whereupon the feds took over. Maybe someone can give us the facts. And of course Michigan controls their side.



THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK?

I still recall one of the classics: You can paint a piece of coal black, but how do you know when you&apos;re finished?



CRITIQUE

When Thomas Nast, the famous political cartoonist, created the elephant as the symbol of the Republican Party, and the Jackass as the symbol of the Democrat party, he didn&apos;t realize that although most would forget his name, the elephants never forget.

The other day, while viewing the circus train, Democrat Governor Tony Earl had the misfortune to walk too close to one of the Republican symbols when it chose that moment, as the newspeople said, &quot;to spray him and his group with fecal matter.&quot;

After being wiped off by one of his sychophants, Earl was heard to say in loud tones,

&quot;Those damn Republicans!

Needless to say, something was lost in the translation, but Tony, old man, the thought was there. You were finally in the right place at the right time.



UNTIED STATES OF LUIGIANA?

Actually, Christiforo Columbo was told that if he sailed west long enough he would find the Indians. When he first saw the noble red man, he asked (in Italian, of course) if they were Indians. They said something which he took to be si. This made them Indians. When he asked what they called themselves, whatever they said must have sounded like the local word for Indians. What more proof do you want?

Look what Amerigo Vespucci did to us; we still call ourselves Americans. Lucky his first name wasn&apos;t Luigi. Indisputable (and indefensible) logic at its finest.



STANDING TALL AND FAST

For every sleazy demonstrator on welfare that marched against the Viet Nam war, for every congressional pansy that waved a yellow streaked ribbon against our fighting men there, for every pro-commie traitor in Hollywood that gave aid and comfort to our enemies in Hanoi, for every left-wing weakling on the TV and Print media forums, there were thousands of Americans who stood four-square in favor of our trying to help a small nation thousands of miles away to withstand Communism.

The problem is that most Americans weren&apos;t able to have their views heard above the raucous babblings of the liberal left who controlled much of the media; as a result, thousands of ordinary Vietnamese people were murdered by Hanoi&apos;s butchers, as are others even now.

This generation of Americans won&apos;t stomach the Hanoi Janes any more. The commies will not take over Central or South America because the American people will not let our leaders allow it. In the next eight years, most of the liberal cowards now in the House and Senate will be gone, replaced by those who think of America, and its integrity, before all else.

The final stage of the American involvement in the Viet Nam war was very similar to that of World War II, and the Korean Police Action - the United States emerged victorious militarily, and lost politically the &quot;peace&quot; that followed, aided and abetted by flaming liberals in our government, commie agents like Alger Hiss, and sick, old men in their dotage like Franklin Roosevelt, who exhibited all the symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s disease as he gave away eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin. It&apos;s not going to happen again.



AT IT AGAIN

The Soviets are at it again, harassing a US Army military inspection vehicle on legitimate patrol. It occurred while the President was in the hospital, probably to see what response would occur. We should retaliate by an even more drastic action towards a Soviet vehicle in the Western Zone, and continue on a quid pro quo, perhaps even going one up until they call a halt. The Soviet Union is run by too-clever idiots.



BRADY STREET&amp;EAST, REVISITED

Thoughts of the East side bring a touch of nostalgia for a decade or so ago, when North and Farwell once sported a number of Antique Shops whose prices weren&apos;t in the stratosphere. Whenever we stopped at one or another, a must would be a ride down Brady Street to observe the non-standard society, and a stop at Sciortino&apos;s for Italian bakery goods.

How times have changed. No longer the busy street with the various craft people about, and the whispers of acid during a stroll. Even the corner of Haight-Ashbury these days is just a minor battle zone, where the dealers have displaced the flower children, although Hashbury was even more non-standard than Brady.

I think the movement was a product of the times, and the world is again with us late and soon. I wasn&apos;t one of them, but regret their leaving.



WHAT&apos;S GOING ON?

The following news item was in the Milwaukee Sentinel today and was collected from wire services:

Jerusalem -- Israel has sent the Soviet Union a secret argument saying it is not hostile to the Soviets and expressing interest in reaching agreement on a wide range of issues, Israel radio said. The argument from Prime Minister Shimon Peres to Soviet leader Mikhall S. Gorbachev will be relayed by Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, who is to leave soon for Moscow talks with Soviet leaders. Why is the government of Peres asking to deal with the Socialist-communist regime of the Soviet Union. It can&apos;t be good for the US or for Israel.

By the way, some secret argument!



DOTAGE?

I heard your wandering words concerning Fascist groups, and you were typical in your zealot approach: first explain general rights under the first amendment, and then explain why it should be interpreted to only cover situations where your own ingrained concepts are involved.

The point of it all is: Does the first amendment cover everyone, or only those with whom you have an ideological affinity? We know you are against the fascists, KKK, Aryan whatevers, etc., etc., but there is no reason why those people cannot have an outlet for their viewpoints. What you are proposing as a rationale for selective censorship smacks of Nazism at its worst. You can do as you wish, but someone else can&apos;t do as they wish.

The old double standard again.

The question can be asked, are Americans or Canadians allowed free speech? Without answering for Canada, I must say that in America it&apos;s supposed to be free speech for all, not just for those you and yours feel should have it.

You mentioned violence by the fascist groups without mentioning that violence is a two-way street. The inference can be drawn from your remarks that no group should be acted against violently for their beliefs. I agree. But out in California, there is a think-tank group which has definite revisionist beliefs, but should have the constitutional right to believe whatever they want to believe, wrong or not, and publish their opinions.

On the night of July 4th, ironically enough, it was said that JDL terrorists firebombed and destroyed their offices and publishing facilities.

No prosecution has ever been attempted in this case. Authorities simply stonewall when asked to begin an action against the perpetrators. Now, I don&apos;t know whether this group is right or wrong in its stance (and you don&apos;t either), but what about their rights to exist and publish? Should they be destroyed because what they think is irritating to another group?

The conspiracy laws should be used against the firebombers, in my opinion, the same way those laws are used against other individuals who utilize violence to achieve their ends, violence that may again only be deplored selectively by some.

Your reporting of the so-called fascist forums and fascist groups is fine, but don&apos;t forget the other ideological scare and terror groups. I don&apos;t really think that either group is of any threat to this nation, no matter what you suggest, and in fact suggest myself that expanding any of the ultra-left or ultra-right to a level of national significance is ludicrous, and gives either a undeserved prominence.

Both groups are fascist in character; only the ideology changes.

(It&apos;s interesting that you should have the name of that fascist bunch and that I do not; talk about your agents provocateur)



HOSTAGE AUDIENCE

I just read a brief treatise on the holding of the American TV audience captive during the recent Beirut crisis; it castigated the networks for playing into the hands of the terrorists, for invading the privacy of hostage family members, for instigation of both the terrorists and the governments involved for statements against one another, thus adding fuel to the emotional flame.

The thought expressed was that a hold-back on news would be in order so as to take away the raison d&apos; etre of the hostage taking, namely the ordering up of publicity by the terrorists involved.

Do you think that any network would actually hold back from reporting on the scene news if asked by the government? TV news people and networks appear to be held in low esteem by the public, somewhere around lawyers, and have not done their cause any good by the events of Beirut.

The article implied that there was no honor among terrorists, nor much among TV journalists; I have to agree with much of that position.



WEAPONS

Can any of the Alphan crew, who has read the proposed legislation by the County Board on deadly weapons, come up with any crimes addressed in the language which would not be covered by a state or federal law?

According to the draft language, outlawed would be barbeque forks, steak knives, spoiled shrimp salad, automobiles, motorcycles, planes taking off or landing from Timmerman or Mitchell, skin divers with spear guns after carp, or archers shooting carp, hip flasks, glass containers, nail files, pencils, pens, frisbees (very deadly if used a certain way), plastic bags (easy strangulation), boom boxes (mind rotting), volley ball nets and stakes, baseball bats, lawn darts (even I&apos;m scared of those), or any number of innocuous items that could be used in a Hitchcockian manner to kill or maim.

Remember the Hitch flic where the lady used the frozen leg of lamb to do away with her husband, then roasted and ate the evidence? Silly? Yes, but no sillier than the board&apos;s do-gooder program to save us from our own law-abiding frailties, while the actual criminals would arm to the teeth in order to have their way with those who would obey the law.



HUMORLESS

When one doesn&apos;t feel like declaiming in a humored vein, one leaves it to one less lazy with a more anciently developed sense of humor. The immersion technique, according to the more modern physicians, depends for success on time and struggle. Many a witch instead of being burned was found innocent by immersion, thus escaping the fagots though ending up with the pisceans, sort of a Salemite fish bile.



HOLD OUT

I was invited to Packer training camp but I&apos;m holding out for more pay. No dollar figure was mentioned, but they said they would pay me what I was worth. I can&apos;t live on that kind of money.



EVIDENCE

The evidence may be gone, but I freely admit making many a personal attack on many for their views and viewpoints. And they are invited to attack me here or anywhere. It&apos;s all right.

I just don&apos;t like one-way mealymouthism.

Please learn that the humorless may survive, but it&apos;s not as much fun, and a funless forum is dreary, just like the meetings of the county board. I attack when I think it&apos;s needed, and expect return fire from any and all. Alpha is wide open and not a Roberts Rules session.



LAST NOTE FROM BOOTHILL

I acted on your excellent advice and reviewed your argument. I must say again that many of your thoughts really have more validity when read between the lines than they do on the lines themselves.

Again, kudos for a most excellent recommendation on interpretational method. (please don&apos;t use these minor exchanges of viewpoint as a rationale for discontinuing a pleasant discourse here in Alpha; it would ill become your spirit of combativeness. Might I suggest your presence as referee during the coming duel, where once again it will be proved that the pen is mightier than the sword. However, when the sword was mightier than the pen, reports were generally made posthumously.



TALENTED

I heard that Madonna will Handel just about anything and get Bach at 2:00, Offenbach at 1:30 for special occasions.



SUPERSONIC

When I saw the Concorde circling Oshkosh yesterday it again made my blood boil to know that the US had been in the process of building the first SST and that our congressional idiots of that day scuttled the project.

Our supersonic transport was bigger and faster, carrying much more actual payload. The same limp-brained scientists that said our aerosol spray cans would block out the sun with freon said the SST&apos;s would develop a layer of gunk in the stratosphere that would also block out the sun, or something like that. They were just as wrong on the SST as on the freon.

It&apos;s not surprising that the more expert the expert, the narrower his vision, the more he knows about less, and the more dire his predictions.



HOW TRUE

&quot;In fame&apos;s temple there is always a niche to be found for rich dunces, importunate scoundrels, or successful butchers of the human race.&quot;

(For the first two categories you can pick a Massachusetts senator to fit; the third category has too many eligible names to list)



PHEASANT HUNTING

I guess the best shooting for me is on pheasants over a pointer here in the south of the state, with my little 16 side-by-side, a hand-made piece from Christopher Funk of Suhl.

The town of Suhl is in East Germany, and they made the gun factory into a sewing machine factory, but they answered my letter and described when the 16 was made and who once owned it. Very nice of them.

The one who wrote the letter was a grandson of C. Funk, a manager of the present factory.



CRAZIES

Well, the crazies are at it again. It seems that last night some nuts from the area spray painted swastikas on a synagogue. This was stupid enough but I figured it was the work of some kids that did it just for the reaction. But, when I found out they sprayed Benji&apos;s Deli, one of my all time favorite places to stuff, that&apos;s when I really got mad.

I hope the authorities leave no stone unturned until the perpetrators are brought to justice, locked in a big stock in front of Benjis, and without any food or water, be forced to watch us eat for 30 days.

Then we&apos;ll shoot them!



MORE SPRAY

I guess they caught one of the kids in our neighborhood who was spraying 666 on the local churches. When asked why he did it, his response was, I knew it would make the minister mad.

The odds of that type of event occurring seem to be proportional to the level of outrage evoked. Just like the Shiite hi-jackers realize ever so well. Just like the swastika dolts, who, if the emblem were just a little more complex, would not be able to reproduce it.



GUN SALE

I happened to get this catalog the other day, and in it were some dandy sales on guns and ammunition that might arouse your interest.

Harrington and Richardson revolvers:

.22 RF Nickel plated, 7 shot, 3-inch barrel: $3.25 ea

.32 or .38 cal CF, break-open, 5&quot; bar, 6-shot, blued: 3.24 ea

.39 cal CF, hammerless, 5&apos; bar, nickel: 4.25 ea

Shotgun shells, 12 ga, 3 - 1/8 - 6, smokeless: 14.50 / 1000

.22 long rifle rim fire cartridges: 2.60 / 1000

If you are looking for a cheap handgun for personal protection, there is available a .22 caliber, double action, pistol for $1.44, cash.

And if you have some interest, the address is 78 Fulton Street, Chicago, Illinois; the catalog # is Fall1909. Must be some new company down there.



MINORITY GROUP

You and I and many other Alphans are members of a minority group that will never be accepted wholly by the majority, to wit: we have the ability to think and relate our thoughts in a cogent manner.

Thank goodness for that ability inasmuch as it is verity that communication is only possible between equals. Any other way is merely the dispatching of information up or down between groups or individuals. It&apos;s proportional to the standing derived from a Wexler-Belvue, Stanford-Binet, or Iowa, perhaps even an Armed Services IQ test.

Inclusion in that sort of minority group outweighs all others. So if you don&apos;t brag about your Latino background I won&apos;t brag about my English/Irish/Scottish/Welsh/German background.



SHEAR NONSENSE

They can blame the DFW crash on lightning, wind shear, engine failure, or what have you - it won&apos;t hold up. The real fault lies with the unwritten air line concepts of &apos;getting that plane in&apos; to keep the relative schedule.

The pilot never should have tried to land during that fierce weather; he should have gone around or to an alternate field, Love Field was close by in terms of minutes, or even to Houston. In my flyer&apos;s opinion It was stupid to try getting into DFW under the local meteorological conditions.



GOVERNMENT ELITE

The government elite consist of those federal and state bureaucrats who always complain about the little money they are making. Let&apos;s take a quick look at what the facts are.

1. There are 2,100,000 civilian federal employees; their payroll is in the order of $58 billion dollars per year, an average of $29,000. In 1980 there were 440,900 who worked for mere wages and another 1,445,000 who were in the General Schedule ratings, and earned between $8,234 and $13,937.

2. There were 520,000 having GS ratings from 9 to 12, earning from $19,477 to $36,923.

3. There were 215,600 earning $33,586 to $60,689, a total of 735,600 GP scale bureaucrats running the government, most voting the Democrat

ticket.

4. In 1980, the year which all these figures reflect, state and local government employees got salaries in the range of $16,200 to $27,144, with a $21,624 average.

5. All non-college teachers got an average of $20,500; in domestic industry, workers averaged $18,506.

6. It can be seen that federal employees average about $10,000 more than other skilled employees.

That is only the start. Federal pensions are the 3rd largest entitlement program, exceeded only by Social Security and Medicare. In 1984, a total of $21.9 billion was paid to 1.9 million civilian federal retired people and their survivors, an average of $11,500 each, including those who only worked for the government a few years, and hundreds of thousands who did not work for the government at all; they were just survivors.

Federal employees give only 7% of their pay to the retirement program, totalling just $4 billion in 1984. The tax payers paid the other $18 billion to make up for this, which means they pay $18 billion, plus $58 billion, for federal employees and the retirees who are able to retire at the age of 55 with maximum benefits at 30 years of service, and at 65 with only 20 years of service.

There must be a goodly number of laid off and fired Allis Chalmers employees who wished they would have worked at the post office instead of A-C.



HOUSE GIVEAWAYS

On 7/31/85, the House voted a $12.8 billion dollar foreign giveaway program which will go to various countries. There was $15 million for the Afghan freedom fighters and $5 million for non-communist Cambodian rebels fighting the Viet-installed government there.

But $12.8 billion dollars! Wow! What are we getting for our money?

The Senate, in their bravery, voted in favor on a voice vote; in the House, 226 members voted for, and 162 against.

Who is running this country, Tip O&apos;Neill? What we need is a policy that the only foreign aid the United States will provide is to a nation fighting off communist aggression.



STATE AT WORK DEPT

It seems that one of our State Representatives, Spencer Black, has come up with another funding law to make your life easier.

Rep. Black is proposing that each vehicle registration fee have one dollar added to the cost. Why? To develop a fund for the disposal of old auto tires, which he says are now in piles.

What he is really saying is that when you trade in your tires, instead of the disposal costs being applied to the account of the dealer, they will be part of your auto expense instead.

Your State in a masterpiece of inaction, once again......



YOU CAN&apos;T GET THERE FROM HERE!

When you mentioned that quandary about getting somewhere by splitting the distance to, you probably didn&apos;t know that this has been suggested in the dim past.

Rhinocles, a famous Greek philosopher, tried to prove paripatetically that you couldn&apos;t get there from here by drawing a line in the sand and approaching it half the distance at a time.

When as close to the line as he could get, he triumphantly proclaimed that even if his movements were minuscule, he would never get to the line, thus proving his theory.

However, another philosopher pointed out that although his toes did not touch the line, his nose was over the line, thus providing a fait accompli to journey&apos;s end.

Now you know why they called him Rhinocles!



GUNS

According to a Roper Poll of 1,988 adults, this is how the nation views the gun situation:

48% say they don&apos;t want any ban on guns or their legitimate sale.

25% say ban the sale of handguns only.

22% say ban all guns.

5% say they don&apos;t know.

What they don&apos;t tell us is who commissioned the poll and how were the questions stated; we also do not know how many responses were received in the eastern metropolitan centers. Probably about 22% (just a guess).



ESCAPE WISCONSIN?

It was released today that by the end of 1985 about 90,000 people will have escaped Wisconsin for climes with better tax structures, weather, and places to work. Some &apos;expert&apos; named Balkrishna D. Kales said this is not a cause for despair; at least we are avoiding the trauma experienced by the rapidly growing states.

That&apos;s like saying it&apos;s fine to be unemployed because then you don&apos;t have to fill out those time-consuming bank deposit slips. So Brilliant!



UNION FACTS

It was a pleasure to hear that some objective (and subjective) discussion on the Union farces went on while I was on a short break over in London.

Union membership is dropping towards the 20% level, if it hasn&apos;t already reached that point. Like any other &apos;business,&apos; the Union business has been found out by its customers, and the customers didn&apos;t like what they got for their money, and are going elsewhere -- to the Right To Work counter.

Many moons ago, there was a strike by Harold Christofel and his UAW comsymp pals against the Allis Chalmers company (circa 1940-41). The pay increase won by the Union after a bitter strike, versus the time it would take to pay for lost wages, was calculated back then to take about 35 years. Considering the effects of inflation, that time-off for striking was never regained in terms of pay to the strikers.

Forced pay increases by the striking unions has been the basic cause of the inflationary wage-price spiral experienced in the US, and gave the foreign manufacturers a foot in the marketplace door. Ironically, it has been the Unions who called for import tariffs so our workers can compete. In my opinion, our workers can compete best if they don&apos;t have to pay the Union dues, or go out on Union-called strikes.



FORCED JOINING

Yes, there were occasions in the history of the US that individuals were forced to join an organization in which they had no interest in becoming a member. However, who could turn down a personal note from the President of the United States, when the request began with, &apos;Greeting.&apos;



EVEN MORE HEATED

It can be said that on occasion the conservative vs. liberal fire burns fiercely on Alpha, although the broadsides take some time to arrive on or near target.

On Monday evenings there is a program called The McLaughlin Group, during which liberals clash with conservatives in a roundtable discussion on the issues of the day. There is an intensity of immediate give and take that flares into outright verbal skirmish, with each side generally holding its own. It&apos;s on PBS Channel 36, 8:00 pm. Your heart will be warmed no matter what your political persuasion.

Tonight there was a liberal uproar over the fact that Jerry Falwell was quoted as saying Bishop Tutu was a phony; this indignation lasted right up to the point where the film clip indicated that what Falwell really said was, &quot;If Tutu claims to speak for all of the black people in South Africa, then he&apos;s a phony!&quot; It&apos;s sort of an on-the-spot Alpha.



MORE POLLING DATA

It was brought out by the Wall Street Journal today, in a compilation of all polls conducted of late, that in the age group 18 to 29 years, 48% identified themselves as Republicans and 43% as Democrats. Astounding to say the least - but due to Ronald Reagan.



DESEGREGATION

I can recall offhand back when the equal rights issue was being argued from all directions that one of the bases the rights advocates used to promote their cause was desegregation was the only aim, and that all white schools must be forced only to open their doors to non-whites, and that all would be peachy from then on.

The vow was made that desegregation was the end-all, and that forced integration would not be used (or funded), and that this prohibition would be written into the law. Neither would quota systems be used to integrate.

All of this seems to be forgotten by the liberals of the world. They are proceeding all out to integrate by quota, first Milwaukee, then the suburbs. If they succeed, only the bus companies will be happy with the result.



YOU SHOULD TALK!

Your argument was noted with characteristic abandon, and what I think is the source of any problems in communication is a basic difference in forum philosophy. Not the thrust of the group, but the method of parry. It may be a shock, but even I know the basics of standard debating techniques, and have been on the school debating team as well as the football team. Debating is fine in its own forum.

But Alpha-Omega was from the start destined to be a round-table discussion, a subjective time meeting place where any could state their views, right or wrong, letting the fall-out fall out where it would. &quot;Kill him for his bad verses!&quot;

I realize that in most of your efforts, you deliberate, analyze, and finally speak, which is OK because it&apos;s your way. But I prefer to expound standing up in more immediate reply because I think it has a vitality more fitting to the arena. When you become incensed enough to talk off the top of your head the responses have a more refreshing, and sometimes, a more devastating effect.

Of course this doesn&apos;t apply to my informational offerings because it&apos;s not needed in that respect.

To summarize, the Alphans argue. Many arguments leave something to be desired in terms of glamour or context, but the idea is there, the position is solidified, and the arguer is skewered or patted depending on individual philosophy.

Proofs, quotes, contexts, reinforcements, backups, call them what you will, are fine; but, what Alpha is offering is a place for people to speak their piece, as it were, and proclaim what they think and feel about a given subject. Otherwise we all will be mired in the swamps of achievements past, with no wraiths to light our way out.



FAIR ELECTIONS

The United States has generally operated under a two-party system, although on occasion a splinter party&apos;s candidate has been elected under extraordinary circumstances.

But the obvious drawback of the present system has been its patently unfair winner-take-all final result, which is fine for the Superbowl, but not for elections.

For example, in the State of Wisconsin, in past years, there were two Democrat party senators, William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson. Most Conservatives and Republicans thought neither of the two liberals ever represented their best interests in Washington, and they were correct.

Nelson voted in favor of liberal, big-spending, social programs most of the time, and Proximire&apos;s Golden Fleece awards went primarily to defense programs whose alleged inadequacies suited his style.

The question put forth here is: Are the interests of the people on the losing side of congressional elections receiving fair, or even adequate representation, Democrat or Republican?

The answer is a resounding No!

Allow me, radical that I am, to propose a New Method of election by which the wishes of the voting public might best be served.

Establish by law:

1. That there be only two political parties, or entities. Call them Republican and Democrat, or Conservative and Liberal, and have no other than those two. Let&apos;s just use the names Democrat and Republican for this example.

2. That from each State, there will be one Senator from each party.

3. That each State will have but one vote in the Senate.

4. That the weighted value of each vote will be based on the results of the last election in terms of percentage.

5. That the House also be modified to reflect the above.



EFFECT ON THE SENATE:

For example, in the 1982 Wisconsin senatorial election, Proxmire got 64% of the vote (986,718) and McCallum 34% (526,133), with 2% going to Hart. Excluding Hart, and splitting the 2%, the result in the proposed system would have had Proxmire as the Democrat senator with a Senate vote of .65, and McCallum the Republican senator with a Senate vote of .35, thus providing a voice from those 526,133 voters.

On every Senate vote, the entire voting constituency would be represented. As it is now, a Democrat Senator represents only his party&apos;s voters, like-wise a Republican Senator represents only his.

EFFECT ON THE HOUSE:

It would be a similar situation for the House of Representatives. The District sizes would double, and each district have two Representatives. This would maintain the present size of the House, yet allow representation for all of the Nation&apos;s voters.

Some House vote percentages would have looked like this in 1982:

Party District Name Vote % Vote total

Democrat 1st Aspin .61 94,445

Republican &quot; Jannson .39 59,450

Demo 2nd Kastenmeier .61 113,204

Repub &quot; Johnson .39 72,290

Repub 3rd Gunderson .57 99,078

Demo &quot; Offner .43 75,021

Rep 8th Roth .58 100,056

Demo &quot; Clusen .42 73,545

Using the proposed New Method, 148,566 Democrat voters, and 131,740 Republican voters would have been represented in the House, whereas under the 1982 results, they were not.

Congress, under this New Method, would actually represent the makeup and the wishes of the entire voting public instead of just the winners, as they do now. Senators and Reps would still vote aye or nay on a given question, the sum of their weighted votes being in accordance with election totals.

Only the Congress would be elected according to the rules of this proposal;

Presidents and Governors would still be chosen as they are now. Perhaps State Legislators could also be elected under the proposed New Method; it would make for a more fair representation.

It would be intriguing to see what effect this New Method of electing our Senators and Representatives would have had on major Bills in the past. Maybe some more research will provide some interesting &apos;What Ifs?&apos;



VICIOUS PRIMARIES!

If Congressional Elections followed the method proposed in the last argument, the real infighting would be in the primaries which would have to be held to determine the final candidate for each party.

I can visualize some really vicious campaigning going on to win that top spot for November, and most of it within a party.

But in any case, I would know that even if my candidate got only 25% of the final vote, for a weight of .25 in the Senate, at least my attitudes and opinions would be in that 25%.



THE PARTIES

I wasn&apos;t too clear about the fact that this system lends itself to .any. two parties. What the two parties must do is win the primaries under their own names to get into the finals.

For example, if, in Wisconsin, we have three parties in the primaries, Demo, Repub, and Independent, the Demos had the highest total of votes, and the Independents had the second highest, they are the parties which would vie in November for the weighted vote. But, there still would only be two parties in the final elections.

Looking at the thought pragmatically, the third party generally garners a very small percentage of the vote, as did the Populists last election, so any third party impact would probably be minimal.



PRO UNION PROPAGANDA

Much as I respect your positions on most things, I have to disagree with the conclusions reached by Medoff and Freeman. It sounds more to me like they were retained to generate a pro-Union book.

Historically, the wage-price spiral has been the proved cause of inflationary trends, and two flakey academics are not going to disprove the facts of decades in one biased book. How do I know it&apos;s biased? By the items quoted that appear to fly in the face of experience.

They said union workers are more productive than non-union workers? There must have been a fog over Harvard the day they wrote that. I have seen at first hand the so-called efficient union help. They move slowly, act slowly, and think slowly, most of them, and if one or two tries to work a little faster and more efficiently the Steward is over telling them to slow down or else.

Unions do much social good? I saw a lot of that social good in two big strikes in which I was involved, beatings, violence, threats, damages, just like in the strike against Sentry. I guess the social good came when the Union admitted some of its lawless activities after the strike, when the NLRB forced them to do so.

Disproportionately corrupt? Not in the rank and file, just in the national and regional boards. Just like that union in Florida striking against the railroad there - outright criminal.

Undemcratic? You bet! Union bosses select the candidates for all offices 98% of the time; if you&apos;re not in, you don&apos;t run; if you run anyway, you might get suddenly dead, like Yablonski.

The unions are arrogant power bases for a philosophy that has reached a pinnacle of greed, and if their domination wanes, it will be good for the country.

My feeling is this, if I do the work and expend the funds necessary to develop a factory that puts out a product, I&apos;m going to hire people that will work under my terms. If they don&apos;t like working at my place they can leave. At no time will there be given to them the power to run my factory or make management decisions. Joining my work force wouldn&apos;t imply that they automatically make administrative choices. They would be there to work.

Unlike you, working stiffs in the present market place don&apos;t seem to have the brains to see through the Union highwaymen or the guts to throw them out. I &apos;gave&apos; lots of money to the Unions in my working time and got nothing back; lucky I was able to escape from the union tyranny --- and more important, the one-way-street dues.

When it&apos;s said that the CEO&apos;s make lots of money for running billion dollar companies, the union cry, and say their leadership make lots less. But it&apos;s generally forgotten that the CEO&apos;s work long and hard for the company, rising and falling on effort, while the union President sits in his swivel chair and figures out the intricacies of Pension Fund tiddley winks. Besides, what&apos;s a nice kid like you doing on that side of the picket line?



OPINIONS

The nice thing about discussions such as we have is that we realize opinions cannot be argued, only facts can. It appears as though facts based on personal and other events have been told in a thoughtful manner, brought up to reinforce an opinion. That&apos;s the way to do it!



SHORT REPLY

Perhaps if I put it into grunts, you may comprehend: Alpha can and will accommodate any argument on any topic.

That wasn&apos;t so difficult, was it? I&apos;ve said, on occasion, that decategorization upsets the compartmentalized mind; it&apos;s distressing, but inevitable, that your critique manifests the proof. Instead of responding to the usual bombast, bomb by bomb, I&apos;ll just use these lines to defuse:

1. What is this fixation you have on anti-semitism. Nobody is perfect, or above criticism and dislike, Jews, Germans, Arabs, and whatever you happen to be. Let the Jews take care of themselves; or are you simply held in a Biblically paranoid thrall, identifying for a quasi-protection?

2. Protocols of Zion! Really reaching, aren&apos;t you? By this time you should have run out of straw. But wait, there&apos;s more...

3. Contras: Maybe the Contras are terrorists to those on your side of the fence, but on my side they&apos;re fighters trying to free their country from the communists, as was in Afghanistan. Please, no more heart-rending stories - war is war. Were you one of those complaining when in Viet Nam the Cong came into villages and killed everyone? I didn&apos;t hear you.

Multiply Lt. Calley by a few thousand and you will approach a magnitude of Cong atrocities. Might it be that one of your intellectual soul-brothers was the virtuous and retiring Pol Pot, of Domino fame? He had moments too.

Explain, if you will, how your heroes at Amnesty International worked their wiles on the Kremlin to get all that freedom for the Soviets. I&apos;d like to hear it (so would the people).

4. Black and White made their bed; they lay in it; they suffered because of it; that&apos;s their business; I couldn&apos;t care less.

5. We&apos;re all &quot;bigots,&quot; ; it&apos;s just that some of us are honest bigots, and admit it; others, dishonest bigots, are bigots just the same, only ever-dreading that they will be found out, as you have been. My bigotry insists that there are a number of people, places, things, and events that I don&apos;t like, and I&apos;m not afraid to mention them. If you don&apos;t like my stances, so be it! But bleed me no bleeding hearts.

6. &quot;Tory,&quot; in brief, as defined by you, was sadly mistreated, not meeting a single Websters Unabridged definition line. I would have wagered a few scruples that a person of your caliper could have taken the measure of at least the four-letter word, but again, heartbrake.

7. Thugs are thugs, in any color shirt, fascist black and brown to Soviet block green camouflage (or pink persiflage); down with them all.

One word I&apos;m certain you understand: Extraneous! It is a condition that pervades your every syllable, your every word and sentence. It is the puffery for the tom-foolery, the hot air for the balloon, the magic multiplier that factors twenty into ninety for your opuscleae.

And, seeing that I might be also caught if this continues, I had better close. One question, are you out of shovels enough? I didn&apos;t even hear them mentioned. (just a little dig)



SAD, SAD....

How sad that the DC-9 went down this afternoon near College Avenue; but it was fortunate that the crash site was a woods area instead of a housing development, however.

It will be interesting to hear what caused the tragedy. My first thought was that the hydraulic systems all failed causing loss of all flight control; my second was a cracked combustion chamber housing in the engines, which are the same make as those in the 737 that went down in London.

I realize that determining the crash reasons won&apos;t help the victims or their families, but locating the cause may help in the future.

The DC-9 has been a dependable aircraft for many years; we can only hope this tragedy was an isolated incident.



HOW I ENJOY

I thoroughly enjoy the way you puff and prance, flood the air with words, and call each item insult, whenever a minor fault in definition is brought to your attention. I think that the worst of your possible worlds is when you&apos;ve been tripped on a minor point - your immediate reaction is to erupt with words in an attempt to hide the chagrin of your prone position.

You don&apos;t have to prove that you were right in every respect, in every exchange, in every discussion. In fact you can&apos;t. What you said defined Tory is not how Websters defined Tory, and all the huffing and puffing won&apos;t erase it, whether I use the dictionary or not.

Just don&apos;t try to hand us all that razzmatazz about reading other sources to prove that Webster was wrong; I&apos;ll accept his version before yours.



COMPETITION

I hope this isn&apos;t too shocking to your psyche, but I think that any large company, such as Chrysler, should rise and fall on its own merits, or lack thereof.

I don&apos;t feel that huge government bail-out programs should be established for any company; welfare is welfare no matter under what guise.



STALLING OUT

When we were taught to fly, one of the initial maneuvers was the power stall. The nose got pointed way up and the throttle left on; when stall speed was reached, the nose dropped typically, and rudder had to be used to keep the wings level.

In aerobatics, we learned the spin, which is entered off a stall. The nose was held up until stall speed was reached, and as the stall began, hard rudder to either side, with the stick held way back, caused the plane to start a spin.

Now that DC-9 was climbing steeply; the pilot knew he had only 30 or so people on the ship, and he could really pour the coal to it on climb-out.

Now lets say that both engines went out simultaneously; the pilot would have shoved the wheel forward to take advantage of the forward speed which must have been near or over 100 knots (just a guess). The plane&apos;s velocity would have been mostly maintained in a sharp maneuver like that and he may have been able to hold a steep glide angle for flareout near the ground. I think that&apos;s what the pilot would have done.

But what if the plane had been in its steep climb angle and the engines went out and the hydraulics locked so that the elevators and other control surfaces could not move? The plane would have headed upwards until it reached stall; it would have either dipped straight ahead or off to one side in a fatal attitude to the ground, or it would have slid off and spun in, which it did.

A ship made to carry a hundred passengers, yet having only 31, has much better flying characteristics at the lower load. That&apos;s about 13,000 lbs difference. So I can&apos;t believe that the fatal stall and spin was a result of pilot error, it had to be a major mechanical failure, perhaps in both the control and the power systems.

Another thought that was brought up is that some terrorist group in the world is systematically sabotaging western world flights, and not claiming credit. True? I don&apos;t know. But there seems to be a lot of accidents all of a sudden, not even counting those apparently deliberate.



DC-9 ISSUE

It&apos;s difficult for me to hypothesize on the events leading to the crash; I just don&apos;t have enough information, and don&apos;t really know the characteristics of the 9 in a flat stall/spin, if that&apos;s even possible. I&apos;ll just give up and wait for the consensus, because that&apos;s what it&apos;s going to be.

What worries me is the jet engine parts the CAP kids found on the runway. One official said that they might not by from the plane that went down; in that case, what aircraft were they from, and are some flying with a screw loose?



PRESS RELEASE

Hollywood, Ca: During a heated press conference today, an angry Jimmie Nabors blamed the media and the moral majority for Rock Hudson&apos;s illness, crying &quot;Rock baby, I know you wouldn&apos;t have got sick except for all that innuendo.&quot;

Jerry Falwell, sent a wire immediately saying he agreed!



RIPPING AWAY THE RIBS

The middle-men deserve something all right, like drawing and quartering, maybe. They are the reason the farmer gets 23 cents a pound for his beef and we pay 3 bucks a pound.

But, I must admit that the supermarket had chuck on sale for .88/lb last week; we bought some for dinner, with enough left over to patch the driveway.



NO DEFENSE NEEDED

At least it is low where you&apos;re involved because of the feebleness of the attack.

Had your Wobbly memory been in shape you would have noted that I never said there was no vehmgericht, only that I thought it was another of your obfuscations considering the contemporary issue involved.

My Websters unabridged gives a significant 16 line paragraph to the definition of the word, but I didn&apos;t consider it apropos since the last tribunal was held at Zell in 1568. That must have been where the Schwarzkatz crossed your path.

Poor, old chap, I knew you were obstreperous, irritating, irascible, contentious, and picayunish. But I never expected you to be stupid. And here you have surprised me again.

How fortunate that your clipboard does not come under the classification of sharp objects; but then again, neither do you.



ALPHA THRUST (AND PARRY)

I don&apos;t want to dwell on the subject, but Alpha is a discussion type group. We do debate, but are not a formal debating society. This was proved rather handily when I jumped in to defend your position even before you had - maybe not too well, but still done.

Alpha is more along the lines of the McLauglin Group battles. They have arguers (not strict debaters) from the left and from the right, and they say what they think, even as we all do here, without regard to a debate format.



BADDIES

In the Journal editorial section on 6 September was a letter from a Mr. Bassin, who discussed a chap named Donald Clerkin, and his group, which was said by Bassin to be the Euro-American Alliance.

Bassin went on to say, &quot;Clerkin&apos;s whole organization stands for bigotry and anti-Semitism, the two worst purveyors in history...... How sickening that these bombastic views are put in a great newspaper like The Journal...&quot;

Is this one of those groups you mentioned as being based in Milwaukee?

I didn&apos;t read the Clerkin letter, but I heard it had something to do with his allegedly saying that Israel&apos;s treatment of the Arabs was equatable with South Africa&apos;s treatment of the blacks.

Sure brought a response!



TRAGIC FLIGHT 105

I really can&apos;t tell; we know how the noise restrictions work, but they have some leeway. I&apos;ve been on DC-9&apos;s with 10 people aboard and the pilot stuck that nose up so high it was like riding in a roller coaster. But the engines stayed together and we got up in a hurry. It might be that with only 3-plus crew, this pilot did the same thing, but his luck (and everyone&apos;s) ran out on that day.

It&apos;s like the guy who said he didn&apos;t worry about flying because when God said his number was up, it was up.

The other guy said, Yeah, but what if God only says the pilot&apos;s number is up?

I guess we just have to wait for the experts.



AIR SAFETY

It&apos;s ironic, but in the 9 September WSJ an article dwelled on the fight between airport and nearby residents, which have resulted in procedures for noise reduction that force high take-off angles, and sharp turns away from residential areas.

In every case, the airport was there first, and the residents second, but the residents still complain in spite of their coming afterwards. It&apos;s like the developer who sold lots next to a large farm, and after the complex had residents, they all complained that the odors from the farm invaded their privacy.

In Orange County, landing rights are awarded to lines who have the least noise readings, developing a competition among pilots which may have a dangerous effect on safety. Pilots often tried to take off at steeper angles, using less power, and throttle back sooner. This could have a devastating effect on an aircraft if one of the engines should go out at around 600 feet, reducing control over the plane. Reminiscent of a recent occurrence, perhaps.

The question was asked whether pilots should be concentrating on noise at the expense of safety, at crucial take-off periods, mentioning that the sound of a crash was the loudest and most terrifying sound of all.



ATTACK ANGLE

I don&apos;t know the answers to the AOA for the 9, it varies with the gross weight. But what I do know is this: a full power stall is still a stall, and if half the thrust vanishes, and a stall occurs, the recovery is full power, level wings, and nose on the horizon.

You still lose altitude, and the heavier the aircraft, the more altitude it takes to resolve stall. If that left engine was running full power, and the power stall occurred at 600 feet, there may not have been enough space.

On the other hand, if that same situation occurred at flight level 35, the stall would have been resolved and the plane would fly on with one engine. Maybe his AOA was such that there just wasn&apos;t enough cushion for recovery. Perhaps the plates for Mitchell will give us a clue; or I could call departure control some time and ask, but I don&apos;t think the time is right to bother them; they&apos;re edgy right now.



STILL GOING

I&apos;ve been a licensed pilot since 1947, and have flown everything from F-86&apos;s to Piper Cubs; I just haven&apos;t got to the ultra-lights yet but I&apos;ll bet they&apos;re lots of fun. My eyes aren&apos;t good enough for the commercial anymore, and I don&apos;t keep up the instrument, but I still can use it if I need it, at least the knowledge it brought.

The last planes I shared were a Piper Turbo-Saratoga and an Aerostar, the Aero with another company, and the Piper with a partner. Both were nice, but the Saratoga was the best.

Nowadays when I have to get somewhere in convenient fashion I rent a Piper Cherokee Archer out at Waukesha; it&apos;s not an F-15, but it goes. If you ever get the urge, check out Waukesha. I&apos;m looking at a Mooney that will be just fine if one of our bigger contracts comes through.

Some of the best times I&apos;ve had were jumping a Seabee from lake to lake in the summer; that 215 hp Franklin was just enough to make 80 knots with a load, but it was fun.

I&apos;ve got some time on the Aerostar, but more on a Seneca, and even checked out on a DC-3 once. It flew easier than the Aerostar. Flying is always rewarding - if you&apos;re the pilot.



PRESUMPTIONS

I think what Goldwater meant was that one should go as far as he can to maintain the liberties of a nation. What you neglected to mention was that wishing death on all with which one differs no longer constitutes a liberty defensive situation. But you made the presumption that your version was what he meant, and then criticized him for your own presumption.

This is the technique you use to deride other statements; first make an unwarranted presumption that a given statement means other than what the person says it means. Second, take that coined presumption and then crucify it; third, become extremely noble in a self-serving pat for being on the right side of yet another issue.

Just give us your opinions, and why you feel they are right, and your reasons that you have those opinions, if you wish, or not. You have a weakness for deriding all who don&apos;t conform to what you wish to believe, using the usual word-twists to condemn those who don&apos;t travel the road with you and your liberal fellows, thus drawing like, and heavier, fire from the other side.

Attack not, and ye will not be attacked, if you don&apos;t like being attacked; however, if ye likes being attacked, and loves the drawing of return fire, then so be it. But if this way is your preferred way, then just shoot without carping about the incoming rounds.



NBC SAWS

Last night NBC in a rather obvious play for a scoop made the statement that pilot error was the cause of 105&apos;s demise, just more of their baseless, slanted reporting for effect. Today the investigators said no such inference could be drawn from the presently known facts of the situation. Another typical media grab for a cheap story.



LIBERTY

I can&apos;t legitimately argue with your opinion, of course; my position is that in defense of the United States, and the liberty of its people, I would use any tactics or weapons in that defense, extreme or not.



COME ON OVER

On Alpha-Omega we have a vast range of positions on all facets of life, science, politics, and existence. Somewhere in this half-vast panorama you are certain to find a comfortable niche, if there is such a thing on Alpha. Alpha works in cycles, history, occult, religion, politics, news of the moment, ESP occurrences, personal attacks, UFO&apos;s, etc. Feel free to enter the arena at any time.



VICINITY

The secondary, or perhaps even the primary, problem is that no matter how far from the city a major airport is built, there will be developers selling the land around it. What they might have done is dumped Mitchell in the 50&apos;s and built a big new airport at Bong, with enough acreage to keep the developers an honest distance away. I would have felt safer climbing out with plenty of latitude from a field as Bong was to be. Remember, the law says one can move to the nuisance, and then complain about it.



RICHARD I. BONG ALMOST AFB

You must realize that I&apos;m torn between two attractions; if they situate a field out at Bong, it would be fine for flying, but surely would tend to deteriorate the pheasant hunting.

My ticket number is 715308, and was issued by the CAA. That Kitty you spoke of was a Hawk, same as me.



CREAKING ALONG THE CRACK

As I once mentioned, I spoke to Sam Andreas some time ago; he said it wasn&apos;t his fault.



STALLING

The military planes I flew were small fighter aircraft with big horsepowers; their stall characteristics resembled those of the classic barn doors with engines mounted.

This particular DC-9, and the Journal had a very acceptable article on it Sunday, seated 60 passengers, and seemed to have an adequate wing-span and control surface to make them stall-responsive.

But as someone said, when fast approaching stall in a power climb, ready to ease the climb angle and turn, and then one engine goes, it only means trouble. In fact, I wonder if there wasn&apos;t a little tail slide before the 9 went in?



WHAT, ME OLD? HELL NO!

I get the impression that some of the Alphans are implying that because my ticket number is so low that I&apos;m pretty old for the flying game.

It&apos;s a damn lie! And when I&apos;m flying my S.P.A.D. the entire 30 miles to Cedarburg tomorrow, and I&apos;ll be laughing at all you youngsters.

(know where I can get some French 40 octane stuff?)



WOMAN?

Your reference to &apos;Descent of Woman&apos; gives your note a suspiciously feminine aura. And as far as Charley and Mortimer are concerned, just jump right in; we welcome even wooden headed dummies to the discussion, and are pleased to give them tit for tat, and if I&apos;m right, can reply to any of the Effie Pringles.



DOMESTIC ASSASSINATION

There are many who say that Richard Nixon was one of our great Presidents with regard to foreign and domestic policy, and that Watergate was a set-up job by the left wing to get him, aided by the liberal media. There are others who say that he deserved the burden of Watergate and that he was simply not to be trusted as President and should have actually been impeached.

Over the next few days and weeks we will examine some of the occurrences of the Watergate period and why they happened. I&apos;m sure that some friendly battle lines will be drawn, and that some heated rhetoric will occur.

But please don&apos;t forget that personal attacks on opinions, even though acceptable, should not contain much cursing, well, at least not too much. But Nixon is a subject of which some feel the only way to respond is with a good deal of strong language - on either side.



FUTURE SHOCKS

Coming on Alpha will be topics including the psychology of the madding crowd, and some such examples from the past. Then some actual Cayce prophecies, trying to establish accurate dating, and some of the methods for forspeaking by Tarot, which has been neglected somewhat to date.

There will be some good receipts in the near future, not the ordinary kind slanted towards Cuisine, but some specialty items for thirsty and hungry Alphans.

Now that fall is here, and cool weather will again re-start up the discourse, Alpha is certain to be more controversial than ever.

Summer is a&apos;goin out, singe luhdde again, cuccu.



INFLUXED UP

As one more in a continuing series of Wisconsin notes, I must tell you a well-kept secret, until now, of our State lore regarding our dark beginnings.

It seems that in the early days of the Territory, most of the emigrants coming to the Milwaukee area came from New York state. How ignominious! We can only believe that we got the cream of the crop, that is those who were smart enough to leave New York, and especially NYC, and come to what once was equivalent to the promised land.

Now, with the Democrat over-taxing programs, including the new communal property law, it seems to be of greater promise to escape Wisconsin to areas with better tax climates.

Note: But we certainly know how to treat our New York visitors in high fashion; yesterday it was 23 to 20, Packers.



SAD AND SADDER

All of the discussion we have had here on Alpha concerning the ill-fated flight of 105 almost pales into insignificance next to the blurb on the PBS battle of the baby-killers versus the pro-lifers. Mentioned was the fact that about 15 million babies have been killed (you know where I stand) by the abortionists since the supreme court ruling on the subject.

Why is it that most of the liberals bleed for every cause except the one dealing with the extermination of humans who never had a chance to become totally human? To me it sounds totally inhuman, and along with the acceptance of the life style and its vile diseases, constitutes a rodentian gnawing at the pillars of American society.



EARTH IS HELL?

Have you heard the theories and speculations of some that Earth itself is Hell, and that our sentence here is merely the painful penance for sins in another, prior, existence? If proved true, then when Willie asked, &quot;who would these fardels bear&quot; he&apos;d get quite a few answers. Quietus Hardware would sell out of bare bodkins in a hurry.



EVOLVED

The described paths of evolution with regard to natural selection do not seem to have considered mutation as a part of the evolutionary process in the classic definition, that is, a quantum leap in ability due to a happenstance occurrence.

Rather than the evolutionary process, I feel the mutative process coming about in a more significant mode of influence.

And as I once mentioned, if humans have experienced these quantum leaps in mental ability, they certainly wouldn&apos;t discuss them for fear of being killed by their lessers, or at best, studied to death.



IF

Not to break into your talk, I have to concur with most of what you&apos;ve expressed. The operating misfortune of his statements is still that big &quot;IF&quot; right at the beginning; all that follows is the logic of the Jesuits.

(I probably would have concurred with all of what you said, but I didn&apos;t want to set any dangerous precedents)



LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS

Elsewhere in the archives was a reference to the League of Women Voters, a liberal, holier-than-thou gaggle of self-serving feminists who are trying to overthrow the President&apos;s decision on the Strategic Defense Initiative, as though the integrity or ability of the group was of any significance in the great scheme of things.

This is the same LWV who apparently was involved in an election fraud, the Florida &quot;Votescam&quot; in the election of November, 1982.

A videotape made secretly shows 70 dues-paying members of the LWV sitting at long tables in a private area of the central vote-counting facility. The women were punching out holes in punch card ballots, thousands of holes in a four-hour span.

Each punch-out was an illegal vote!

The language of the federal statute concerned is this:

All proceedings at the central counting location shall be under the direction of the county canvassing board and shall be open to the public, but no persons except those employed and authorized for the purpose shall touch any ballot or ballot container, any item of automatic tabulating equipment or any return prior to its release.

Two investigative reporters, Kenneth F. Collier, and James M. Collier, former Editor-in-Chief, and Editor of the Miami Beach Herald Examiner, have sued the LWV for $150 million in damages, charging wrongful acts in the election process, not only in Florida, but in all other states where the LWV has unlawfully handled, or changed, ballots and ballot counts.

There is no reason to allow the LWV access to the inner workings of the polling places on election night, and even less of a reason to allow the handling or modification of ballots.

It will be interesting to see what the courts do with the videotaped proof of the LWV&apos;s illegal handling or changing of the Florida votes, as alleged in the suit, and if any government attorney will have the fortitude to ask for criminal warrants in view of the video proof.

I don&apos;t see any reason for a group such as the LWV having access to the ballot counting or handling process than I would if it were the Conservative Caucus; no group should have the right to be there!

My question is, how many elections and votes has the LWV influenced by actions such as these in past years, and are we going to let them get away with any more than they already have?

(Some wag called the group, &quot;The Vote Of Women Leakers.&quot;



STILL MURDER

You know my position on when human life begins; but, I am not one who maintains that abortion can never be performed - there are extenuating circumstances.

I&apos;m just against those who recklessly perform in the knowledge that if a pregnancy occurs, it can be resolved as easily as wiping a chalk board.

I guess it basically stems from the abysmal moral attitudes engendered by the TV and Movie perverts, who want the moral tone of the nation dragged down to their sleazy level.



OPPOSITION

The kids at St. Rita&apos;s are getting sex education in the proper manner (and I don&apos;t mean on the playground) with the consent of the parents. (But, it was probably more fun learning it on the playground, if I remember, whether the info was right or wrong)



WHEN?

I just have to go back to the point that when conception takes place, the vitality formed can only grow up to be a human being, and as such must be considered a human at any time after conception occurs. It there were a chance it would mature into a baboon or a lion, I might agree with you, although I understand the various forms the fetus takes in its development, but feel they are not important.

On another subject, do you feel that those forms the fetus does pass through are an argument in favor of evolution?



FINE LINE

But once conception takes place, a human life has started.

Consider the case where the girl and her boyfriend discarded their baby causing it to die. They were sentenced to long prison terms. If they would have aborted the child at any time before birth, &apos;for the health of the mother,&apos; it would have been perfectly acceptable by the authorities. What a fine line on which to balance.



MURDER

Even if no religion had ever existed in the world, secular rules against the murder of a human being would probably have come about.



DOWN THE WELL!!

The most exciting news of the year has been the predicted demise of OPEC and high oil prices. It was the OPEC actions in the 1970&apos;s that was responsible for much of the world depression. The late word is that Saudi Arabia has upped its production by 40%, an act that will bring it more revenue, even at potentially depressed prices. And those depressed prices, oil down to 15 dollars a barrel, will bring a boom in the world economy that will be of a magnitude never before seen on this earth. The sooner it happens, the better! (gasoline at 50 cents a gallon? It could be)



WITHOUT BENEFIT OF CLERGY

Color still is a factor! In Milwaukee County last year, 57% of all births were to unmarried black females under the age of 19 years. There is a movement within the black community to reduce this number. I hope it succeeds.



BIGOTED?

A bigot is someone who doesn&apos;t think the way you think he should. We are all bigots in our own fashion, even those who are bigoted against their version of bigots.



CROOKED ARROW

Bring the lakes and woods of Wisconsin into a big circle, the Indians are attacking again. What is it this time? Well, along with their cradle to grave socialist government blanket, paid for by you and me, they are trying to state that their treaty rights with the US Government entitle this band of insolent Chippewas to claim 50% of the fish and game in northern Wisconsin, any time they feel like taking it. They also want to use high power lights to shine deer, along with netting, spearing, and selling of game fish.

Here&apos;s what else they want:

Hunt on privately owned land enrolled under the state forest crop law.

Hunt and fish without any state supervision.

What is my position? I say let the would-be Hiawathas hunt and fish as much as they wish, just as their ancestors did. But, I also say that they should use no modern materials, no guns, no plastic or fabrics, that did not exist to them back in the time of the treaties. No cars, no boats except for hand-made canoes and equipment, nothing modern.

Most of the indians of Wisconsin and the US are no better off than the welfare blacks, in education, skills and attitudes. Let&apos;s stop this reservation pets nonsense and let them make a living for themselves. Some indians! If they took away the government checks, food stamps, and other handouts, they&apos;d probably starve.

You don&apos;t believe this? Talk to some of the businessmen up in Wisconsin Dells, or some of the schoolteachers there. You may be surprised.



NIXON

There are those who maintain the only question was should he be hung with a new rope or old rope. They&apos;re all from the left side of the aisle, except for a few holier than thou people temporarily deserting the right.



UNION HALT

When has a union gone too far in its zeal to hold out at all cost? I think it is when it refuses to obey a court order issued by a judge.

There was a story today that mentioned the teachers union who was on strike, and who had been ordered back to work by a judge. The union in its arrogance refused to accede to the judge&apos;s order, whereupon the judge imposed a 10,000 dollar per day fine, and other sanctions.

The union obviously thought it would again get away without paying any fines or suffering any losses, as so many unions have in the past, but this time the judge refused to listen to the union please. She reaffirmed the fines, some 55,000 dollars, and ordered jail sentences for some of the rebellious strikers.

Let&apos;s hear it for that judge, where ever she is!



SAME OLD LINE

It&apos;s unfortunate that the right side of your mouth never knows what the left is doing; your gibberish is a tribute to double-standardism, and not worth this these lines of reply.

You are going to believe what you want regardless of facts, in your subjective port-sided manner; reading your implication and innuendo based tirades are like a sequel to 1984, but without the Orwellian flare.



HOSTAGES

What will anyone wager that the Achille Laurel terrorists will claim that the sole victim had a heart attack so they threw him overboard?

Wait for it.

As soon as I saw what you said I shut up shop and turned on short wave. The BBC, Radio Nederland, and Voice of Germany all carried play by play news casts much of the night. I didn&apos;t get much sleep.



CREDENCE FOR CRETINS

: After the first of your arguments I realized that anything generated by your flaccid processes was suspect, and have since treated as such. It matters not to me what you think or what positions you hold. You are too rigid to be effective in reasonable discourse.

I admit that I baited you on many an occasion to see what the reactionary rhetoric of the response would be, not in its stance (that was inevitable) but in the shrillness of the tone.

But again I have to mention you disappointed once in a while, sounding actually reasonable for a few lines - but only a few lines - at the times when you felt my position matched yours.

I think what really bothers you is the fact that I don&apos;t really care what about being held in high regard or esteem by you, and that your criticisms, such as they are, have no effect on what I think or speak or write; I do and hold what I wish, without consideration for your suggestions, thoughts, books, nits, and picks. The way you present your output, in its propensity for derision, sarcasm, and garble, subjective in its general manner, objective only in its suspect references, is a mild irritant because of its &apos;saying makes it so&apos; to many who simply don&apos;t mention it, but bland to others who take the trouble to do so.

You flatter yourself immensely to bombastically state the requirements for your believing what I say; again, to conform to some warped standards you set for correspondence is twaddle; why don&apos;t you just step down off that half cubit plastic tower and speak as though you were a reasonable person instead of assuming that lofty pedantic air holds all others in thrall. It does not.

If you had the patience to read your first Alphan input, you would see that all of my flamboyant responses were in kind to your aggrandizing self-indulgences, sort of a counterpoint leash to heel your narcissistic upload flabbery.

You have characterized yourself somewhere as a space pedant; I agree, especially since Webster defines &apos;pedant&apos; as:

&apos;One who parades his learning.

&apos;One who is unimaginative or who unduly emphasizes minutiae in the use or presentation of knowledge.

There are others, a male school teacher (are you qualified for that?), too narrowly concerned with learned matters (maybe), a formalist or precisionist in teaching or use of knowledge (the knowledge held, I would venture to say), and if we skipped to the next word down there is an applicable phrase about traveling with trifles which might fit.&apos;

Concerning the &apos;space,&apos; I know where that is! Maybe your Oxford has even more to tickle your fantasy.

What I&apos;m telling you in this note is this: no more will I answer your idiocies as such. When you learn to say &apos;I disagree, this is my opinion however,&apos; instead of &apos;I disagree, and you and Reagan are both crazy&apos; then you will receive an answer when one is merited.

My claiming you were in your dotage was completely wrong; I apologize; but let us hope you reach your intellectual teens some day, and even beyond.



ARSE NIL

Our mighty arsenal consists of 4 BB guns, an antique 10 gauge that no one would ever dare to fire through those damascus twist barrels, four bows, and a slingshot.

We got our last deer by carrying the BB guns in the woods, and dragging the deer to the car when it had a heart attack while laughing himself silly over our armaments.

This year we plan to use boomerangs; we may not get a deer, but kangaroos are dead meat!



INTERPRETATION

If you are baffled by the intricacies of the subjunctive, then it is up to you to pursue the knowledge required for definition. You often have donned the expert&apos;s mantle in fields of science. Simply try it on again for defining the complexities of the paragraph, but don&apos;t step into your own crude traps, such as the one of your prior talk.

It could gum your leg to death.



NIXON REVISITED

In order to treat the subject of Richard Nixon beyond ordinary accolade or vituperation, let us have some input on the subject. What I&apos;m asking is this: In your opinion, should Nixon have been impeached and convicted for the Watergate situation, and if you think he should have been, for what crime would he be impeached. We&apos;ll try to keep this discussion on an objective level, although I&apos;m certain some subjectivity will CRP in.



GUESS

Considering what you said, and its impact and significance, I am convinced you have brown eyes. And the remainder vertically is a material of construction.



READING

Did you miss the phrase &apos;according to many historians&apos; in the argument?

Did you miss the word &apos;allegation&apos; and others in reference to the suit filed in Florida against the LWV?

Really, you should quit reading the supermarket news; it&apos;s influencing your comprehension, it would seem. If you are a glutton for innuendo, then review some of your old arguments on various subjects, and note the subjective treatment thereof.



ARMS OFF

In the paper this morning, it was said that the arms sale to Jordan was put off because Israel didn&apos;t like it. On NBC this morning, Peres stated that no mideast country in a war situation should receive any arms. If this is the case, why do we give arms to Israel?

Who runs the US Senate, the people of the US or the leaders of Israel? I don&apos;t care what Israel says or does, really, I just want a more even-handed approach to our policy in the mideast. The next oil shortage is coming soon; will we get oil from Israel? Don&apos;t bet on it; but the Arabs, based on how we have treated them, will let us have some for $100 a barrel.



LWV WEIRDOS

Of course you are surprised and confused most of the time; why single out this particular situation; but, let&apos;s put a synopsis together for you, one time only:

The first allegation stated that the LWV in Florida were videotaped punching out holes in the ballots. For me that evidence is good enough for a conclusion to the effect that they are probably culpable.

The second asked the LWV to respond for their side of the story; you know the result.

The third described the suit with its allegations of what happened. After reading the federal law on the matter, and knowing that a video tape exists indicating they were in the act of breaking that law, I feel that they did indeed break the law. I didn&apos;t accuse the Milwaukee LWV of being involved, as she would like to have you believe.

But an organization like the LWV should know what&apos;s happening in other states, especially where they are being sued. There must be a national newsletter of sorts, or do I give them too much credit. As I said, and will say again, if there is a videotape of LWV members mishandling ballots, then I feel they broke the federal law regarding such actions.



ARISTOTLEAN TO THE RIGHT

Your logic certainly must be symbolic, because it surely isn&apos;t actual.

If A = B, then B = A, no matter what your old white head says in the pm.

Can&apos;t you really understand the questioning what-if from the Aristotlean log-if?

If you don&apos;t, then do not waste all that upload time picking nits - and evading the real issues of the LWV situation. But for your obviously needed edification, I&apos;ll again related my stance:

1. The LWV was caught on video-tape doing their prima facie frauds, and in my opinion are guilty.

2. The lawsuit against the LWV contains charges of same; the magazine report related the news in terms of allegations, to protect themselves in any case.

3. When you learn to analyze a record, and the depth of scope it requires to assimilate it as such, instead of considering it as veneer, then you will have a greater understanding of the participant interface of forum activity. Cognizance may relieve you of innate stuffiness engendered by so many years of living in Nitsville. Not too many here appreciate your quasi-scholarly approach which depends for effect on your minute mis-analysis of what is said, versus what the text really states.

4. In the past I have made some reference to the market tabloid headlines, about which you seem to know a great deal. I used them, in those few times, as tongue-in-cheek bases for effect, knowing that they were merely sensation oriented, and had no real or actual significance in the great scheme of scholarly literature.

But then again, you have brought up the Scheer and Talbot (sic) shovel books, which equate almost identically to the Star and the Enquirer, so we are even.



AT LEAST

My lips don&apos;t move when I read!

(I&apos;d be happy to see the defense in print; however, no one from the LWV or its surrogates seems to wish to post the information; and, of course, the actual defense can&apos;t be printed until the trial is over. Can&apos;t wait to read the depositions, though.)



TWEETY TREATY

One of the funnier events recently was finding out that the so-called ABM treaty (which the Soviets proceeded to break in record time) did not have any of the constrictions that the anti-arms groups thought they did. What a blow to the blowhards.



LUPUS TUNES

Seriously, the reason I don&apos;t care to review those liberal books is that you have given us a thorough review of what they say, and from your words it would appear they are simply another anti-Reagan, anti-administration collection of tripe, based on what the authors would like to present as the truth, but most likely is nothing but implication and innuendo. The only way I would care to hear from them is in direct conversation where questions could be asked.)



GROUP ATTACKS

One of the problems with many groups is their inherent ability to attack a proposed event in the manner described.

Their theory is, if one man can do it in 100 minutes, then 100 men can do it in one minute. Ergo, if one &apos;scientist&apos; is shown to be against a proposition, then a hundred scientists lend so much credence to damn a concept, then it surely must be wrong.

When JFK said we would put a man on the moon in a decade, there were those who said it was silly to even consider the possibility. Yet it was done. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the names on the couldn&apos;t go to the moon list were not, in many cases, the same as on the present the SDI won&apos;t work list.

And I see the degree syndrome in operation in liability cases, where a so-called expert is deposed for his opinion, and all those degrees don&apos;t mean a sen when it comes to actual, practical experience. The juries in the cases recognize hot air when they see it, and the jury of the nation also realizes more than the ivory towerites give them credit for doing.

Then there is the verse:

They told him the job couldn&apos;t be done,

And if he tried, he would rue it!

So he tackled the job that couldn&apos;t be done,

And by golly, he couldn&apos;t do it!

But in any case, the fellow above tried, and the Gorbyclones don&apos;t even want to allow an attempt.



TREATY

Being the cynic that I am, it&apos;s difficult for me to believe that our side (since Reagan) wasn&apos;t aware of what was actually in the document. Note the timing.

Out of the blue, just prior to a summit, it is released that a top-notch word-wiggler had been hired to review the treaty and report on what it really states. That&apos;s overstretching the long arm of coincidence.



COMFORT INDEX

One of the more reassuring concepts I have developed (just now), is something called the BCI. It stands for the Bureaucratic Comfort Index, and is as pervasive in the Soviet ranks as it is in ours, in fact, probably even more so due to the opportunity for the Soviet Bureaucrat to obtain goods that no non-party worker can.

This attitude of attained comfort has to have permeated the Soviet levels, and no good bureaucrat would take any chances on losing his relatively good life and perqs in a stupid nuclear war. Especially in the great Marxist heaven where the good life is so rare.

And, as you have stated, with the lowered potential for the Soviet&apos;s delivering all their missiles effectively, none of the bureaucratic ladder will want to risk losing all.

Peace = SDI + BCI



EH, WHAT&apos;S UP, PLUMBER?

Which reminds me: A doctor had to call a plumber over to fix some leaky plumbing and fixtures. When the job was done, the plumber presented his bill. The doctor analyzed it, got angry, and said, &quot;this is preposterous! When I break down the cost it comes to about $170 an hour. Why I only make about $80 an hour.&quot;

The plumber said, &quot;yes, and when I was a doctor I only made about 80 an hour myself.&quot;



TRYING TO DEFECT

What did you think about the fiasco of last week when the Soviet sailor jumped from the ship, and was returned to the Soviets twice? Was it a communist ploy or was it a case where we again turned someone back to the bad guys too soon? We had done it once before. Sounds like a good deal of bureaucratic bungling, as usual.

And some of the older Alphans may remember Operation Keelhaul where millions of people were sent to the Soviet Union after the war even if they didn&apos;t want to go. A huge part of those millions were anti-soviet Germans, Poles, and others, who were most certainly eliminated by Stalin.

The US military coined the name &apos;Keelhaul&apos; to tell the world exactly what was being done by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, to the everlasting discredit of those so-called leaders.



TEMPERAMENTS

Have the Alphans noticed lately that some of the members are getting testy to downright nasty in their daily social interfaces, calling a spade a &quot;spade,&quot; and ripping off the veneer of civilization to let their thalamus be their guide?

I love it!



ED GARVEY

We&apos;ll never forget old Ed Garvey.

He was the NFL players union rep who brought about the strike a few years ago, to the detriment of football fans everywhere.

He always has been the tool of union interests, so much so that our own chief klutz, Tony the Taxer, appointed him to the post of deputy state attorney general, and in the same state as the Green Bay Packers yet.

Now he wants to be a US senator, and we&apos;re informed that he will hold a fund-raiser Monday at the Phister Hotel, starring none other than left-winger Ed Asner, who can always be found on the side of the communists in any world action, and who has been quoted as saying that we are the aggressors in Central America, and that we were wrong in throwing the communists out of Grenada.

To let a tool of the Unions, like Garvey or some other Demo clone, get in a senatorial position would be a disaster for the State of Wisconsin; you would see that doubling of the teachers&apos; salaries and the same old left-wing Democrap picking of the tax-payers pockets even more.

Ed Asner? Why didn&apos;t the Demos just feature Daniel Ortega and stop all of the hypocrisy?



TWO ITEMS OF INTEREST

1. As noted in the Sentinel, Latvia&apos;s Independence day is to be celebrated on November 18th. This small country is, of course, paying attention to the fact that at one time it was free, starting on a given day, even though it is now in the clutch of the evil empire.

Along with Latvia, two other small, Baltic countries were absorbed by the Soviet monster, Estonia and Lithuania. The Soviets have tried to eliminate all of the heritage and customs of those Baltic peoples, but have not been successful.

No contact on any subject, much less &apos;arms control,&apos; should be made with the Soviet killers until they get out of all the countries they unlawfully occupy; the Baltic states, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, Cuba, the African states, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, etc. - the list is long.

Jimmy the Greek said it best: Gorbachev is Kruschev in a $700 suit.



MERCENARY MERCENARIES

Mercenary training, to the disgust of those who know what the real business is all about, has become fashionable just like designer jeans and rapids cruising.

These mercenary camps are willing to teach you anything for that old buck! Whether or not you learn anything (in my opinion) they couldn&apos;t care less as long as it&apos;s cash in advance.

What it is, is amateur night in the trenches, where you can bleed plastic blood without the pain, and shoot off a few hundred rounds just for the sound, maybe run a bad-guy course and waste a few cong pictures.

The real merc camps you can&apos;t get into except by invitation.



BIG-MOUTH SCHROEDER

What Patricia Schroeder seems to forget is the 1st Amendment rights, not only for the radicals in her wimpy party, but also for the other citizens of the nation. If her warped mentality held sway on the question, no martial arts schools would be allowed to operate, trap and skeet clubs would be shut down, and if she could do it, she&apos;d be likely to dissolve the armed forces. A typical Demo double-dip!



MAGICK

I am not the only magician! Some day we&apos;ll relate the story of how Bambi and his brothers turned three of us into turkeys early this morning in the wilds of the north Kettle Moraine area. Lucky there was a sign up forbidding the shooting of turkeys ($200 fine).

We might have been doomed!



PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT

I don&apos;t think that he has crossed that fine line of prosylitization versus theological argument; at least not yet. I don&apos;t mind listening to discussion concerning religious viewpoints; what we don&apos;t want is chapter and verse battling chapter and verse, and we have not arrived at that plateau.

He is presenting his arguments for scrutinization; those who disagree are dissecting them, or chopping them down as is their wont. It&apos;s a battle of aspects which is perfectly acceptable on Alpha. Get in on it and make your thoughts known, for or against.



DNR

Some say it&apos;s an acronym for Damn Near Retarded, having achieved that dubious status during the reign of Tony the Taxer, who practiced well his idiocies at that agency, perfecting them for the time when he would be governor.

Can you doubt the title after the fiasco of past days, wherein the agency allowed a selective extension of the deer hunting season, offering more hunt time to the chosen few who were fortunate enough to be awarded an antlerless deer permit for a given hunt area?

Two appropriately disgruntled hunters filed suit to obtain a court order so all hunters with unfilled tags could hunt; they were temporarily successful. Yesterday afternoon, another of the judiciary blocked the order and transferred the case to Dane county, where it will probably languish until the extended deer season passes into history.

In view of the DNR&apos;s decision for a discriminatory split season, I feel the next step for those who were arbitrarily barred from the second hunt is a class action suit against the DNR to recoup half the license fee paid. It&apos;s only about six dollars, but I would donate twice that much to supplement legal costs (along with many others) so as to see the dopey DNR get its well-deserved comeuppance.



AFL-CIO

What would you expect from a Union release - that it&apos;s better to be a right-to-work state than not? The figures they related indicate a difference of $1664 per annum, or $3 a week, in pay. Union dues, in many cases, construction for example, exceed that amount. I&apos;d rather work non-union for a little less and not have them on my back, and as an employer would fight to the death to keep the Union out of my company.

(My brother was a steward at Allis Chalmers for years; now that the excessive union wages have forced the company to close down, he has had second thoughts about the role of unions in American industry, and not to the benefit of the unions)



ZOHAR

At the risk of your becoming the official Rabbi here (not a bad thought), I&apos;d like to have you tell us more about the Zohar or Book of Light. I realize that it takes time to develop these things, so take your time if some research has to be done.



BLAME

I suppose I blame the unions because they and they alone were responsible for the wage-price spiral that got ever higher until it priced American goods, for the most part, right out of the marketplace.

Have you ever heard of the study (which received not a bit of national exposure) that since 1945, unions have been responsible for all the recessions because of the inflation born out of the alliance between unions and Democrats. If we use oriental-made products, such as cars, clothes, and electronics, it is due to the fact that artificially high union wages would not let American manufacturers meet foreign prices. Unions no longer contribute to our society; society contributes to the unions - either directly or indirectly.



UNION PATHS

I think the unions should take some of the vast amount of money they have in pension funds and other funds and set up their own businesses to compete in the marketplace. That way they could hire all union labor and have their own way at all times in company operation. Wages and benefits could be as high as they want, with the best of work rules in place, and tremendous perqs for everyone. Best of all, they would have no bargaining or strikes to worry about, only their business competition.

Why don&apos;t you ask your union about buying out your present employer and setting up Union Industries, Inc? Sounds like a winner.



PRODUCTION

Of course we need a forum to discuss our opinions, which are unarguable, a fact that the lamented girl never could comprehend. Even Two-ton Tip and Righteous Ron get along in spite of their differences.

One statement in your talk, &quot;Employees control the means of production,&quot; I must take issue with. If you are speaking of the unionized workers whose job it is to generate a product of some sort, for effort, they are being paid, it is neither up to them or to the union to control the means of production; that is management&apos;s responsibility and none other&apos;s.

The company, the stockholders, the board, the officers, they are the ones who set production standards through the various management lines. Certain standards of efficiency must be set for adherence by the workers; if, after training, the worker cannot meet the set production rate, that others are meeting, he is of little use to the company and should be discarded. He has the privilege of going to another firm at which he can meet company production goals. No company should be forced to retain an employee who is a loss to that company. This reasoning applies to the company officers, why should it not apply to the employees, union or no?

From each according to his abilities might go over big in socialist states, but here in the US there&apos;s no place for it, except in some unions&apos; arrogant marxist approaches.



WATCH OUT IN THE BIG APPLE!

Last time I was in NY we did indeed get mugged. It was at the exclusive La Chatelaine, where lunch for four was $138.70.



DUCK, BLIND

Force X Mess = Deceleration!

However, KaDaffy says he will wreak havoc on the streets of the US. Should we warn him about the streets of Chicago or NY, or Imperial Blvd in LA? His squads wouldn&apos;t last 10 minutes in some of those spots after 9 pm.



CRESCENT CITY

I had an attic apartment in the Pontalba House on St. Ann street, on the north side of Jackson Square, back during a military summer seminar at Tulane. It was the greatest, just a couple blocks from Bourban Street.

And, right on Bourbon, just north of Toulouse, the oyster/shrimp bar had all you could eat for 50 cents. Pat O&apos;Brien&apos;s charged 6 dollars for a 1938 Chateau LaFitte, the Dixie Kitchen on Toulouse had the biggest and best Poor Boy in town for 65 cents.

I&apos;d like to tell you more but I dislike slobbering over the keys.

Even the restaurant in Maison Blanche department store had Crab Louie...

(And some of the best spots were the tavern/casinos on Lake Ponchartrain; all the big shrimp one could eat for 70 cents. I must add that 2 slot machines allowed them to be called casinos)



GIANT!

Japan found out what it meant to wake a sleeping giant; only a stupe like KaDaffy would try to irritate one already awake. May he wake up to the tune of neutrons some bright Libyan morning.



BUT GOOD!

In your recommendation that the US develop a hit-squad to eliminate the terrorist leaders of a given regime you have forever severed yourself (and it&apos;s about time) from the liberal line; they will never forgive you!

The sad fact about your most excellent suggestion is that liberals in the Congress have brought about some flakey rule forbidding the US from eliminating other heads of state in any situation, and if the event ever did occur in the near future, we would see the Kennedys, Harts, Weikers, and Cranstons of the Congress looking to impeach whatever Republican president was sitting at the time.

I&apos;m certain that even though your thought was rather hawkish in this situation, you still retain your humanitarian concepts, so don&apos;t think this is a criticism of those stances; it is merely a paean to the thought involved, and a hope for more of the same.



MINOR LEAGUE FLAKE

Who? None other than our foot-in-mouth &apos;governor&apos; Tony Earl.

I thought he had overtaxed every item in the state that was taxable; I was wrong - recent statements have revealed that he has overtaxed his mind.

In the paper this morning, Earl went on record as to how to celebrate the Martin Luther King &apos;holiday&apos; coming up on January 20th. His suggestion? That the blacks should go out into the countryside and help the farmers pick corn and other crops that were not able to be harvested because of inclement fall weather. Yes, he did say that.

Can you visualize anyone in his right mind, black, white, or indifferent going out on a frigid January 20th to pick corn? I think he just lost most of the black vote, and his aides have rushed over to remove the shoelace hanging from his lips. But, it&apos;s too late.



TRAPPED AGAIN

In thinking it over, if nature acts on physical bodies according to the same laws, how does science account for Loni Anderson and Ruth Buzzi?

I guess even Mother Nature breaks the law on occasion.



THINK IT OVER

An object tends to maintain itself in whatever condition until acted upon by an outside influence of whatever nature - like a tornado, or a wife...



SOAP-BOXER

You&apos;re correct, but it&apos;s not worth raising a sweat about. Some people can only rise to a height in other people&apos;s crises; some make a career out of belaboring the obvious; sometimes the two qualities are combined in the same individual - if one would term them qualities rather than deficiencies.



HIPPETY DIPPETY, DOC

The US fixed his clock;

The chime struck seven,

Doc went to heaven,

On a US military plane......

(I may have my poetic license suspended, which is only fit, since Baby Doc went to France in a move that smacks of cruel and unusual punishment)



FORM

Many a proposition, in the most proper form, offers most proper analysis, except to those who would read into it what they wish to and want to.

It&apos;s characteristic of most fiction, or to be charitable, of those who believe that saying it very sincerely, must surely make it so.



HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED

That it&apos;s those who have the least credibility have the most to say.* And it&apos;s obvious where those sympathies lie - feet in the clouds, head buried, not an ounce of pragmatism or good sense. It must have been all those lessons from the left; he passed the course with frying colors.

*Moderators not included...



IT&apos;S IN PRINT....

What is most obvious is that he is one who believes all he sees and reads - on TV, in the newspapers, and in the magazines. He also states that he thinks, &quot;our government structure is long overdue for a complete overhaul and restructuring.&quot; This type of thinking neatly coincides with that of others whose dearest wish is to remold our Republic to their heart&apos;s desire. And bringing up the straw man question about violence - who ever said there was not violence, in fact....

Hell! Why am I responding to such preposterously put nonsense......

BLOW TO THE SCHOOL BOARD

In July 1984, US District Court Judge MacKenzie, decided that forced racial busing of elementary grade children in Norfolk, Virginia, for the purposes of &apos;desegregation,&apos; should be halted. Of course the ruling was appealed by the &quot;let&apos;s you and them integrate&quot; crowd of liberals backing quotas and discrimination.

However, a three-judge panel, from the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals, said it would uphold Judge MacKenzie&apos;s decision, in a major, anti-busing victory. The decision will play a large part in similar challenges around the nation which are certain to erode the idiocy of court-ordered busing.

The ruling should cause the Milwaukee School Board to take a new look at their grandiose plans to attempt control of the school systems of the area. Follow-through of the suit will simply cost the tax-payers more expense that would be best saved, or at most better spent for useful purposes.

Busing for racial desegregation is a concept whose tragic time should never have come, and whose acceptance is gone.



INITIATIVE REFERENDUM

We have not discussed at length the advantages or disadvantages of the Initiative Referendum concept. The I-R is a method by which the voters of the State can cause a law to pass or be rejected simply by their votes.

For example, if a proposed 21 year old minimum drinking age were on the ballot for vote, a simple majority of voters could make it a statute or reject it. The same follows for other proposed legislation.

I&apos;m for it! Can you see any dangers, or will benefits outweigh the perils? Is it time we allowed the voters to control at least a part of their own destinies in this high-priced state?



TRAGIC FLIGHT 105

Didn&apos;t we know it would come to this: The engine mfg blaming the crash on pilot error, and the airline blaming it on the engines, with the big prize to come from the insurance settlements from both.

When a pilot brings in a plane safely after an accident that turns it into a barn door with wings (like last week) then he&apos;s a hero. If everyone is killed, blame the pilot - he won&apos;t put up a fuss.



SPIES LIKE OURS

I think it a matter of principle and self-preservation that the US have spies in enemy or unfriendly countries. I dislike the fact that our so-called best friend in the world still finds it necessary to spy on the land that provides it with billions of dollars, latest technologies, and moral support against its enemies. Can it be said that with friends like Israel, we don&apos;t need enemies? Many are of that opinion.



LOUIS RENAULT

The Wisconsin powers that be are kow-towing to Renault in order to keep them in this state.

Louis Renault, the French automobile manufacturer, of the same present-day company, collaborated with the Nazis, and was arrested by the Free French forces on September 23, 1944. He died mysteriously before being brought to trial.

Some of us have longer memories than others.



YOU HAD DIMENSION IT!

Perhaps money can be defined as a synergism of the first three dimensions in pragmatic terms: Without money there is no existence! (quote from the famous Japanese architect, Flank Royd Wlight, who had a yen for things like this)



CD-ROM&apos;S

I suppose I heard it last again, but I was gently amazed at what I read in an article concerning a new compact laser disk, similar to the disk used for audio reproduction, but utilized for computer work as a compact-disk, read-only memory (CD-ROM).

It was reported that this 4.7 inch disk would store up to 250,000 pages of text, with no wear because of the laser-mode sensing. This relates to 1200 times more information than regular floppies, and almost 100 times the capacity of an average hard disk.

In February, Datext Inc., of Woburn, Mass. is shipping the first products integrated for the business market. Du Pont and Phillips are beginning a joint-venture effort to manufacture the disks.

According to the information, Digital Equipment is marketing drives and databases in order to develop a software standard.

Perhaps our coming 100 megabyte hard disk drives will fit in a cigar box.



EXTREMES

I always try to avoid extremes in temperature; and ask, should our CD disks be sheltered also? I told you my news would be late; my question is, why haven&apos;t you guys in the know posted news on the disks before this?

Concerning the indestructibility of the CD&apos;s, they probably get that reputation from their material, even though, as you relate, a scratch will do them in. Good that you passed on the info as to potential dangers in mishandling.

Some further notes: Sony and Phillips have agreed on physical standards for their disks, but there are still others being tested, ala the CBS and RCA quibble on TV signals in the dim past. Two other groups in industry are working on size, namely High Sierra and the National Information Standards Organization.

It seems that perhaps several CD standards will emerge, each dependent on application. But, the largest computer company, IBM, has yet to announce that they have a product, and until they do, it would appear that there would be a danger in developing a standard which IBM would not use, and IBM&apos;s standard could make existing standards obsolete overnight.

What really caught my eye was the fact that market analysts project a $900 million dollar market by 1990 (a conservative guess), with a base of 390,000 installed units, and 74 million CD disk sales. Another analyst predicts that by 1990 there will be 22 million drives and over 200 million disks sold.

The bandwagon may be leaving soon; get your tickets now.



ACTUALLY,

It&apos;s, absinthe makes the heart grow flounder; or would you rather drink wormwood in Gaul?



DEMOCRAP RESPONSE

After the President spoke on the need for aid to the freedom-fighters of Nicaragua, in their quest to force free elections on the communist bosses that had taken over their country, Tennessee Democrat James Sasser went on the air to agree that, yes, the communist had taken over and scorned the aims of the revolution, but that the Demos of congress would not vote money to help the contras.

To put it bluntly, Sasser is one of the young Democrat wimps whose guts must be in blind trust. With representatives such as him in this country, the Sandanistas need not worry about support for their cause. Sasser like many of his Demolib partners, decry the communist activities, but won&apos;t do anything to halt them. If being a traitor means giving aid and comfort to the enemy, the label fits Sasser and his siblings like a glove.

It would appear that the only hope of the United States in the world of the future is to rip out these cowardly cancers via the ballot box, and elect a congress with the backbone to resist the red aggression. Sasser, like Solarz, is quick to vote billions for Israel, but not 10 million for the contras with which to fight for freedom. Where do the loyalties of these people really lie? In America or in Moscow?

Clem Zablocki was an old-time Democrat who knew what theýcommunists were after and voted to hold the line militarily during his term of office. Where are the Democrats like Zablocki, Scoop Jackson, and Harry Truman today? Probably learning to eat borscht quiche for their proposed millennium.

As far as I&apos;m concerned, a vote against the contra aid package is a vote against the future safety and interest of the United States, no matter which political party the congressman may belong to.



CRITERIA

I realize that you are using the term &apos;unsubstantiated slander&apos; from a position of ignorance, and allow me to relieve you of that burden by saying that records exist which do substantiate all of the names and statements made.

For starters, you may glance at a publication called &quot;The Web of Subversion,&quot; a book written by a conservative scholar named James Burnham, whose credentials as a writer and investigator are impeccable even in more liberal eyes.

Burnham cites hard evidence from the various trials and hearings, naming dates and places.

Another so-called American who was high in the Roosevelt administration&apos;s echelons of government, and who was a communist party member and a communist spy, was Alger Hiss. He was dealt with in a book named &quot;Seeds of Treason,&quot; By Ralph de Toledano, which also cites many of the names listed as communists.

A handful left? Not a chance! Their activities were too well documented, and were brought up again to indicate how deeply the Soviets had their tendrils into our government. It&apos;s not even certain today that moles do not exist in our very Congress; the way some of them vote makes them suspect.

However, if you feel that some on the list I posted were unfairly accused, please note those and I shall offer description of why they were on.

More than gladly.

(Note: would you mind explaining the phrase, sub-classes of logical fallacies? Sounds etymologically intriguing)

(Note II: Another book which substantiates descriptions of the nefarious anti-American activities of those on my list was, &quot;The Whole of Their Lives,&quot; a portrayal of Communism in America, by Benjamin Gitlow. It would clarify much for you, and put some of the recent world events in a more enlightened perspective)



COMMIE DEFINITIONS

In this day and age of communist aggression throughout the world, and in our own nation where the liberals seem to be confusing Gorby with Pope John, I&apos;d like to offer again some definitions that should be kept in mind where the communists are concerned. They may have already appeared in the early Alphan days, but they are still worthwhile noting. This is how the communists view some commonly used terms:

Conservative: Fascist

Fascist: An effective anti-communist

Right-Winger: One who tends towards an anti-commie government

Co-existence: A temporary situation until the communists gain time to infiltrate, subvert, and grow in strength and power.

Peace: The final victory over America and capitalism.

Democracy: A one-world socialist state under Communism.

Emerging Nations: Nations that throw off feudalism and gravitate towards Communism.

Neutral Nations: Pro-Soviet nations.

Reforms: Programs that centralized controls and destroy free enterprise.

Progressive: Any pro-Soviet movement.

Liberation: The taking over and subjugation of any peoples by force to develop a totalitarian communist state. Just as what is happening in the

nations of Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and anywhere else the

communist tyranny is allowed to flourish.

When you hear on TV, or read in print, fancy quotes from the communists and their flunkies, you will understand what they really mean.



COMMENT

Like the man said, when two or more people agree all the time, then one guy is doing all the thinking. Obviously, the denizens of Alpha surely think for themselves as evidenced by the variation in ideas and concepts.

That is what makes the place so great, not the sometime energies of the moderator. The credit belongs to the mental abilities of the group, and their prowess in demonstrating their ideas, letting the electrons fall where they may.



LA WHO?

It wasn&apos;t so many moons ago that the La Rouchites were accosting us in all the major airports, handing out pro-nuclear leaflets, and calling for the elimination of Jane Fonda (one point on which I agreed). Some of their peculiar philosophy sounded less than creditable, but it was always interspersed with enough flag-waving and patriotism to make much of it palatable, yet with the 10% warped factor offsetting the rest.

The Demo fiasco in Chicago left the party with enough egg on their faces for a world class omelet, and if the Demos were watching the store, as they should have been, it probably wouldn&apos;t have happened.

Now I couldn&apos;t care less about Illinois politics, especially as represented by that king of the wimps, Addled A. Stevenson, who doesn&apos;t even have the neat sense of humor his flaming liberal father had. Of course, old Adlai senior was beat so many times for president, he needed a good sense of humor.

But I digress.

The point of all this is, that the party who claims to be of the common man, of the little guy, of the tiny champions against the forces of the establishment, along with various other claims to Democratic idealism and the rule of law, their &quot;leader&quot; got on TV after the embarrassment and perhaps violated the statutes against slander by calling the La Rouchians &quot;Nazis, fascists, thugs,&quot; etc.

What was their crime? They beat the system, and the Democrat party in Illinois, by some clever maneuvering.

And then what did we hear from that sanctimonious party of the people?

That they would go all out to negate the victory in some way or another; that the dems would meticulously check every aspect of the candidates filing procedures, trying to find a tiny loop hole that would throw out the rascals, even before they had a chance to get elected.

Poor wimpy Stevenson; he made such an ass of himself on national TV that I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll make it for Dog Catcher in any state but Illinois; and then it will be tough.

I say the La Rouchies won fair and square, and like any primary winners should be allowed to run in the finals without the hot air from the Demos, whose own nefarious manipulations in that sad state set new records for chicanery, especially in the 1960 presidential race, which they stole outright for Dr. F. Kennedy.

I don&apos;t think Stevenson would have beat Thompson anyway, but after his indecent exposure on the tube, Thompson may be a shoo-in.

There is an arresting passage in the first section of Beethoven&apos;s Sixth Symphony, in which sound of the cuckoos is heard among the lighter woodwinds...

Let&apos;s dedicate it to the La Rouchians and the Democrats, in spite of the awesome challenge to tell one set of tweets, or twits, from another.



PROFESSIONAL GOLF INSTRUCTIONS

Maybe you just don&apos;t have it right yet!

There are two elements, a big ball and a small ball. The object is to hit the small ball off the big ball, then maneuvering the small ball into a hole in the big ball, after which the small ball is removed from the big ball.

Got it now?



RESOLVED,

Be it resolved that anyone involved in any kind of terrorist action is vermin, and should be searched out and executed out of hand. That means anyone.



LUDVIG

At some time in your illustrious career you may have played a Beatles tune called &apos;Roll Over Beethoven.&apos;

If you did, he did.

And when the Beatles first emerged on the music scene, I couldn&apos;t stand to listen to them; now I think they are fine musicians and composers.

It&apos;s amazing how much better they&apos;ve got in 20 years.



LAW...

Paralleling Gresham&apos;s Law, bad news drives out good; bad opinions drive out good opinions. The media is not interested in providing accuracy - their aim is to sell controversy, because that&apos;s what sells.

If the world does end up offering freedom to all countries and all citizens, it will be in spite of media activities which generally promote the contrary in terms of the most mealy-mouthed.



GETTING RELIGION

For a sometime radical like Eldridge Cleaver to come to his senses and join the Republicans indicates that he has more depth than originally thought; he simply became a born again conservative.

Lee Iacocca, on the other hand, is a dyed in the wool Democrat who let the union have a seat on his board of directors, which says little for his acumen. Can&apos;t you see Wayne Kirkland as Secretary of State?

The party that really never learns is the Democrat party. It still thinks it is in the 1930&apos;s with Roosevelt and the liberal-socialist philosophy promoting even more big government and big-spending social programs.

The Demos lost with Mondale&apos;s adherence to the antique union-liberal methods and throw-money fixes; Kennedy still hasn&apos;t changed his water spots; Hart is so far left his right hand is lonely.

I noted in Business Week that the Unions collectively lost another 2% of membership among working men and women in 1985. See what happens when you educate the proletariat.



STOCKMAN&apos;S RATIONALIZATION

In view of the fact that the book isn&apos;t available in the stores, and the news mags have only published one chapter, and the only data you and I have is the response of critics, I don&apos;t think it can be fairly appraised by either of us.

Both Buckley and Broder, in today&apos;s Sentinel, have questioned Stockman&apos;s motives and declared the book more or less self-serving.

The consensus seemed to be that whenever Stockman leaves one frame of reference, ie: academe and accounting, to arrive at another, the white house, then another, Wall Street, he appears to denigrate the people and events of the immediate past, to his benefit of course.

The question was what was he to write when leaving Wall Street to re-enter politics, if the desire should come upon him.

I think Stockman, bright as he is, has pin-pointed his type and style, and has done so to his detriment.

I think I&apos;ll wait for the movie.



KNEE-JERKS

When it comes to Reagan, Israel, US policy, the conservatives, Republicans, anything that doesn&apos;t conform with your particular pattern of logic, nothing inspires your confidence. You merely join with the wind-baggery of the outs (who shall stay out, let us hope) in tilting at administration windmills, with the same cumulative effect en toto as the good Quixote, with most of those knee-jerk critics not owning the acumen of Rosinante.



FOUR QUOTES TO THE GALLEON

In the headlines the other pm was emblazoned the quote by Kissinger to the effect that anyone meeting Reagan for the first time would wonder how a man like him could attained the governorship of CA and subsequently President of the US.

This is what was quoted, extensively.....

Kissinger went on to say, as is known now, that Reagan was one of the finest thinkers, administrators, politician, and leader that has emerged in the past 50 years.

Funny how that part got left out.



NEGA-NEWS

Milwaukee Sentinel, April 25, 1986



LIGHTED CIGAR IN ELEVATOR RULED NOT A VIOLATION

A charge against Thomas S. Sommers, 60, of 1716 Alta Vista Ave, Wauwatosa, for carrying a lighted cigar onto a courthouse elevator was dismissed Thursday by Circuit Court Commissioner Harry Halloway. County Supervisor Dorothy Dean had complained that Sommers had a lighted cigar when he boarded the elevator Feb. 17. Halloway ruled that the act of carrying a lighted cigar onto the elevator did not violate an ordinance that banned smoking on an elevator.

End of article.

Milwaukee Journal, April 25, 1986



CIGAR CONTROVERSY IS SNUFFED OUT

A court commissioner extinguished a burning controversy between a county supervisor and a lawyer Thursday when he dismissed the case of the lit - or was it unlit - cigar.

A complaint by Supervisor Dorothy Dean against cigar-holding lawyer Thomas Sommers resulted in his getting a $23 ticket last February for smoking in a Courthouse elevator.

But on Thursday, Court Commissioner Harry Halloway dismissed the case because the citation against Sommers wasn&apos;t supported by county ordinance, said Asst. Dist. Atty. Stephanie Rothstein.

An ordinance prohibits smoking on elevators, Rothstein said. But the citation, which stated that Sommers carried a lit cigar on an elevator, didn&apos;t say he was smoking, Rothstein said. But the citation, which stated that Sommers carried a lit cigar on an elevator, didn&apos;t say he was smoking, Rothstein said.

Sommers, 60, of Wauwatosa, still maintains that the cigar was unlit. Sommers maintains that Dean might have complained because she was angry that he refused to tell her his name during their elevator ride together.

Dean could not be reached for comment.

End of quote.

I&apos;d like to mention something about self-important cuckoos fluttering out of their nests, but the articles speak for themselves. I don&apos;t smoke either, but when I did smoke, I liked it, and even now I don&apos;t mind if others smoke.

Some times the smoke from a cigar or pipe bothers me, but I&apos;m not a nut about it, like some escapees from Hickory City.



DISGUSTING!

Did you see the paper this evening? Jobless rate down to 7.1, a drop of about .4%? Lies, all lies! I hope Reagan doesn&apos;t try to take credit for that drop just because his policies are working. Next thing you know he&apos;ll be trying to get controls off natural gas, and that will mean a big jump in price just like it did in home heating fuels and gasoline. Isn&apos;t it like him to use this to his advantage, just as he did because of the tiny drop in the inflation and interest indexes. Can&apos;t trust those politicos who haven&apos;t any comprehension of day-to-day economics. Let&apos;s get someone like Carter back in so we can make money on short sells and commercial paper again. We&apos;ll show that stock market who&apos;s the boss!

(you know, someone like the intrepid Ted Kennedy, who will apologize to Liba and Nicaragua if we have caused them any harm, and would they please accept our remorse in bank notes. You would hear applause for the ex-swim champ from the likes of Moody and Kleczka, our resident fawners of the left)



ADMINISTRATION

Your use of the term administration should mean some that are in the lower echelons of administration, that is, way below the top level. And at the top is our widely admired prez, R. Reagan, who has said no to any tax on foreign oil right from the beginning. No matter what the opinions of the peons, it&apos;s still the boss that calls the shots.



SDI

Where does it say that I claim to be an expert on the subject of SDI? Anyone with a modicum of sense can understand what it is supposed to do via news releases, but just for you I will expound.

As I see it, when the Soviets shoot the missiles at us, lasers mounted in space platforms will disable them.

Next, it should work because the laws of physics operate in space as well as on the ground, and the basics have been proved.

Lastly, I favor any sort of weapon which will act as a defense against Soviet attack on our nation.

How about you?



ENGINEERS

Those fine engineers working on nuclear weaponry are all that have kept you and millions of others from being forced to learn Russian. We don&apos;t need Siberia, we have Wisconsin.



I DIDN&apos;T UNDERSTAND

No I misunderstand your witty remark; due to its intrinsic nature I was forced only to half-understand.

But, I wonder what Orville or Wilbur&apos;s wife looked like; I remember the fellow who said he would rather be wright than president.

Or Gary Hart who would rather be left than president, or was it left and president; more likely just left.

Right?



STOCKMAN UBER ALLES!

Stockman&apos;s hang-up is this: he does have a bright, well-educated mind, but it seems that he has a tendency to see all others as intellectual inferiors, whether they are or not. Stockman has treated economics as a science, which it certainly is not, instead of as an art. Economics, as oil painting, is an art whose success is measured by the response of the viewer, ie: if you like the result, you like the artist.

Stockman&apos;s doomsday views on the administration&apos;s aims have been enjoyed by those who feel the economy will inevitably collapse. Those who don&apos;t share this opinion, don&apos;t care for the creator of the work. Stockman just has the arrogance which accompanies those who feel their positions are always correct and everyone else&apos;s wrong.

Like most economists, of the left, right, or center, part of what he avows will be right, and part wrong. This kind of batting average is what keeps the economists in business in spite of their abysmal forcast records.

In all cases, Stockman is for Stockman, is for making money.



SDI

If one looks at the SDI situation in coldly logical terms, the following may be assumed:

1. If the system is only 50% efficient, then that means 50% of missiles fired at us would be disabled or destroyed.

2. Thus more Americans would survive the attack, even though devastation would certainly be significant.

3. If the system requires 10 billion dollars for only 50% efficiency, that $10 billion would be well spent.

4. If no billions are spent, in an all-out exchange, devastation could be close to total, thus making the non-spending moot.

5. Is an alternative to SDI presently viable, other than the alternative of bowing to the Soviets on every issue, right up to the last one?

My statement about Bowman sponsorship by seven peace groups came right from the Journal.

Your position seems to have been in the past one of advocating a strong defense for the US, but also one of criticizing methods to achieve that strong defense, at least by the present administration. What alternate methods to hold the Soviets at bay, other than sheer force of arms, would you suggest?



SDI CHICANERY?

Do you really have documentation that in the test described the target was fired at a number of times, missed each time, then blown up by a ground controlled command, and finally called a success because of the fact the target was destroyed.

If that is true, then there was a fraud perpetrated on the citizens and taxpayers of the United States, and should be prosecutable, and I, for one, would be in favor of that.

Please provide to us the source of that information; if it was common knowledge, the major media surely must have covered up the charade in their well-known penchant for selective publication. If the facts are as you have outlined, then heads should roll.



SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT

That&apos;s what we all can do in view of the fact that it was reported by Janes of late that our nuclear subs on duty can fire the equivalent of 32,000 Hiroshima equivalent atomic missiles if required.

While it is my sincere hope the requirement does not arise, I feel much better knowing the capability is there.

Too much fire power? Well, they haven&apos;t shot at us yet......



BUSING FOR DOLLARS

On a radio newscast this a.m. I had the dubious privilege of hearing the head of our local school system spouting off about integration, saying in effect that it would be best for all if the blacks and whites were mixed like salt and pepper so all discrimination would stop, and that this mixing, by whatever means, is what he would like to see.

Without regard to the stupidity of the forced busing programs, it is my feeling that the head of the school system should keep his racist views to himself, and concentrate on the problems already brought about by the repressive integration methods used by him and his limousine-liberal followers.

When my daughters went to our nearest high school, it seemed that the worries were about the kids sneaking in gum, comic books, and fan magazines. Since we have had busing, the worry is about the diurnal visitors sneaking in marijuana, cocaine, and weapons. Included with the latter is the continual sexual innuendo, the bullying tactics, and the inevitable arrogance of the intellectual inferior, who appears to employ that aesthetic state of &apos;cool&apos; to replace the disciplinary state of learning.

Back in the middle 70&apos;s, the high school came across as a regular high school; now, in the middle 80&apos;s, the place looks like a mess, with students roaming the halls willy-nilly, spending class-time in the rest rooms, and generally emitting all the halcyon charm of an institution where the inmates have taken over the asylum.

I won&apos;t name the school; I just hope this busing nonsense bites the dust soon so that those who would, can get an education.

I am totally against forced segregation.

I am totally against forced integration.

Let the kids go to their nearest schools and let the patterns form where they may.



THAT ELUSIVE POINT

You keep missing it - with your favorite ploy of setting up your own targets, then shooting them down. But this is an arena of conjecture, so conject away.

Re: Saudi arms

Do you ever read the newspapers? As soon as a proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia was announced, the Jerusalem post was quoted here as saying Israel would fight hard to keep the sale from going through because it was a threat, and that they would mobilize their friends in the US Congress to defeat it.

This was done in both houses. Why? So that when Reagan vetoes the bill, and it is not over-ridden, then those who run again can proclaim that they did not vote against Israeli interests. Who runs this country anyway?

Re: Cigars, etc.

You&apos;re blowing smoke again, picking on a poor little apprentice reporter for reporting something you didn&apos;t like reported in that way. Why don&apos;t you face the fact that a sixth grade-school paper reporter would have done it the same way, and whatever reporter was on the job would have written a story that exposed this particular action of that female supervisor as one of supercilious egotism. Just when I get to the point of thinking she may have some redeeming social value, she does something typical again to indicate my basic opinion of her is correct.

Re: SDI

So this will mean sending gold into space; well you are finally correct, in a way. Many of the contacts and terminals may be gold-plated. However, the intrinsic value of the material used is minuscule; the money stays here on earth; any other reply to your SDI opinions is a redundancy.

Re: Waldheim

Isn&apos;t Weisenthal&apos;s analysis, with all of his gathered data on possible war criminals, good enough for you? I think that the Zionists cum Israelis in this case will only cause anti-semitism in Austria to grow, and cause problems for Jewish citizens of Austria who don&apos;t need any more troubles.

The Israelis are over-reaching themselves by meddling in the affairs of yet another nation, like they do in the US. The Jews who live in a given country should not have to bear the burden of events caused by those in some other sovereign land, same religion or not.

Re: Convincing

Neither of us will convince the other on concreted positions. Yes, beating dead horses is usual for us both because of those strongly held positions; but, on occasion, you still hammer the skeleton with little effect.

(Who&apos;s on rib cage?)



NEWTON SAID

For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction...

And for each measure the Soviets come up with for destroying chips, we will already have had a plan for negating theirs, in my opinion.

Had you been in control when thoughts of the Manhattan Project were evolving, it may never have come to pass, in which case, we would be dealing now with the Soviet Socialist Republics of western Europe.

The point being made is, just because you and others are against SDI doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t a viable and valuable concept. The US always has had members of the ivory tower community nay-saying progress in military arms development, even as the &apos;Concerned Scientists&apos; group are today. It is the burden of those who are willing to place time and money at risk in the research and implementation of new weaponry, offensive and defensive, to have the tremulous nipping and yipping at their heels.

I can&apos;t help but believe that if Mondale, Carter, Truman, Roosevelt or Kennedy had come up with the SDI concept, every liberal in town would have loved and cherished it.

It&apos;s not the doing of it, it&apos;s who thought of it. Which is why most criticism of it is a triviality.

Whatever the magnitude of the blather factor therein.



THERE YOU GO....

May I ask on what basis you say SDI can&apos;t work in real life? Your flat statement that people... who still believe in SDI as a working solution are precisely those who have not studied it and do not understand the factors involved.......

I can&apos;t believe you really made a statement such as that; it belies all your past pretense to objective analysis. Whether or not SDI works, and I hope it will, you cannot, by merely making a subjective statement that pretends to describe how knowledgeable other individuals, in the scientific community and the government, are about the project, offer any modicum of accuracy with regard to how anyone feels about the concept other than yourself. However, if you have a direct line into the white house, or into government research facilities, then it&apos;s just possible your SDI comments are valid.

If not, they&apos;re not, except as conjecture.

It begins to appear that the SDI critics, like the moon landing critics and all anti-administration critics, just don&apos;t want the SDI concept to prove viable, thus once more egging their faces. So, they will do or say anything to block the SDI research process.



WORDS TO LIVE BY!

Henry Kissinger, Secty. of State, 1973:

By controlling food, you control people.

By controlling oil, you control nations.

By controlling money, you control the world.

I guess this means if you&apos;re broke, hungry, and out of gas, there isn&apos;t much left.......



FEATHERING

Stockman falls into that category of opportunistic types who utilize their positions to feather their nests later on. Like Deaver. Immediately after they leave, they begin the carping and criticism which marks their greed.

It isn&apos;t only a Democrat syndrome.



BACH AND ROLL

I like Bach! Also Beethoven, Mozart, etc. Also Ozzie Osborne and Heart.

What I hate with a passion that knows no bounds is the gagging syrup emitted on some freqs by cretins who O.D.&apos;d on their version of golden oldies, with huge orchestras, a sicko of violins, and arrangements straight out of grade school band books. Nauseous!

The equivalent to that glop they call music is ingesting a concoction of maple sugar with honey and chocolate syrup poured over it, brown sugar edging, and an overall sprinkling of powder sugar. And a white Karo chaser.

If some of that pre-excreta comes through the speaker by accident, it takes two weeks to clean and sterilize the voice coil.



MICHAEL DEAVER

Actually I gave Deaver a bad rap; he hasn&apos;t criticized anyone like Stockman has, and he may be guilty only of arousing the Metzenbaum types, not a classic crime in most books.

But, as long as we are here with Deaver, we could discuss the probities of leaving office, then working in an area which may be related to one&apos;s effort in that office.

Should there be a time limit? Should it be forever, or just until the administration worked for is out of office? Is a limitation on any work of that nature an affront to the first amendment? It could be.

Is there a moral and ethical consideration involved, and if so, one man&apos;s morals may be another&apos;s rationale?

Disregarding Deaver, the problem is this: there are so many laws on the books now that any citizen, congressman or not, does things in their normal way of life that could be prosecutable under one or more of those laws, valid, reasonable, or not.

Geraldine Ferraro was prosecutable under several US Title Codes, but was not; George Hansen, a Republican from Idaho, was tried and convicted for some supposed &apos;crime&apos; for which legal opinion said was not unlawful. This country seems to be heading for selective enforcement, with the news media as judges under a neo-Napoleanic Code, where a chargee is judged quilty until proved innocent beyond a shadow of a doubt - that is if he is not a Democrat.

Democrats, like Ferraro, are judged by self-promulgated standards.

If the Demos don&apos;t hang Danny Deever in the morning, it won&apos;t be because they didn&apos;t try.



MURDER MOST TRAGIC

The tragedy of Friday last, where a young girl from Muskego was killed, and it was alleged that a number of empty beer cans were in the car, points out the silliness of allowing drinkers to drive.

The best solution to the problem is one they utilize in Norway; in any party, one person drives, and does not drink; or if all drink, then taxis or other transport is used to get to one&apos;s home.

Anyone caught driving after having downed the equivalent of one beer, or glass of wine, gets an automatic jail term and suspension of license.

I don&apos;t know the exact length of the term, but if I recall, was from 3 to 6 months. The rentacar manager in Bergen warned us in the strongest manner to be sure not to drink and then drive, otherwise we might be caught and jailed, even if we were Americans.

Draconian measures? Maybe, but the main reason the 55 speed limit has saved lives is that the lower speed gives the drunk more reflex time. Let&apos;s put the limit back up to 70 on the I-System and get drunks off the highways.



AUTOBAHN RACEWAY

I was driving east on the autobahn in a Mercedes a few years ago, cruising at about 105 mph; a silver Porsche passed me as though I were standing still. Would you put cars as capable as that Porsche in the hands of a typical Milwaukee driver?



MEDIA DATA NO SURPRISE

The Lichter-Rothman Study of 240 &quot;Media Elite,&quot; which included the top news commentaters, directors, producers, writers, etc., in the business of film- making and Television broadcast, resulted in the following statistics:

Of all those people associated with film-making and television,

8% attend church or synagogue weekly.

86% attend seldom or never.

55% believe extramarital affairs are not immoral.

95% believe the hmsl life style is not wrong.

85% believe hmsl&apos;s should be permitted to teach in public schools.

Lichter-Rothman went on to say that an estimated seven hundred people control about 75% of the film and television industries, and because of financial ties between Malibu and Wall Street, exert an immense influence on the viewers of the United States.

The profile of the group, according to Lichter-Rothman, is predominantly male, wealthy, Jewish, entrepreneurial, and extremely liberal, both religiously and politically.

The study appeared to be less surprising than confirming.



THE BLAME BUSINESS

I think that over forty years is long enough a time to forget what may or may not have happened. If the Allies had lost the war, Eisenhower, Patton, Stilwell, Marshall, Montgomery, De Gaulle, and their minions, would have been considered &quot;war Criminals.&quot;

Had we lost the Korean conflict, I might have been considered a war criminal. This business of ferreting out supposed war criminals by a group whose only participation in the war, with some exceptions, was of passivity, is an anachronism.

WWII is over. The main combatants are now close friends and trading partners, allied against the totalitarian forces of Communism. This alliance should not be subject to the second-guessing of those whose best efforts seem to be remembrances of things past.

The Irgun, a pre-Israeli state terrorist group, was said to have had on-going contact with the nazi regime. Why isn&apos;t this a subject of Wiesenthal investigation? Is it because some of that group, Dyan, Begin, etc., were in the Israeli government?

To me it appears that the war criminal hunting process, as developed to the point it is today, is slanted towards extracting as much money as possible from Americans who happen to be Jewish, among others, and is a completely self-elective process.

The war is over for everyone except the Wiesenthals and the Israelis, it seems; life must go on - they haven&apos;t learned that yet.



PHIL&apos;D UP TO HERE

Whatever Secular Humanism is, talk show host Phil Donahue has been called its unofficial spokesman. With regard to what he has to say, it may be true.

Here are a few of his quotes:

&quot;Religion seems to be full of narrow-minded hard-liners, but science is a channel to God.&quot;

&quot;Stories like Dr. and Eve badly need revision. It&apos;s wrong to think that God made and then took a rib from his side and made Eve.....&quot;

&quot;Religious zeal is caused by brain malfunction mistaken for divine intervention.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe homosexuality is a moral issue, per se. I believe to condemn a person for it is tantamount to condemning me for having gray hair.... The hmsl act is none of our business.&quot;

I would wager that being in the big time TV business at one of the major networks results in exposure to such a great number of hmsl&apos;s that it generates indifference to the disgusting concept. Does familiarity breed attempt? Has any rubbed off on Donahue?

It can be supposed that Donahue would agree with the district court order that allows Larry Flynt to send free copies of Hustler to Congress. The court ruling said that the First Amendment rights enjoyed by Flynt to mail his magazine to the Congressmen unsolicited outweighed the Congressmen&apos;s rights to be let alone. I wonder who the judge was? Another secular humanist?

On the other hand, Jacob Neusner, Distinguished Scholar of Judaic Studies at Brown University states that students might believe that religion does not exist in the world if they follow the teachings of the nation&apos;s schools today. He said that, &quot;... American public life in general excludes religion.&quot;

Dr. Neusner went on:

&quot;according to what is taught on university campuses, religion forms an entity altogether unimportant - or else a danger to rational order in society. We are misleading our coming generations by pretending that the critical factor in human life does not matter.

&quot;The secular curriculum wishes religion away, bringing to its logical conclusion the sustained attack on all religion characteristic of education in this country for several generations....

&quot;In truth, if we want to teach our students about the world as it really is, religion should form the center of the curriculum, both in primary schools and in universities.&quot;

Note: I&apos;m not trying to begin another trial by combat of chapter and verse versus verse and chapter; all I wish to do here is present comment on what seems to be a discarding of moral values in the nation today, values, without regard to any particular religion, upon which this country was founded, and which seem to be under siege from much of the liberal-slanted media. My own position is, I would tend to agree with the precepts tendered by Dr. Neusner than those espoused by Phil Donahue.



THE TROUBLE WITH CHRYSLER

Can anyone explain why Chrysler is consistently out-sold by General Motors, and why Chrysler was saved as a corporate entity only by government loan guarantees, and why the Chryslers generally have all the styling of either a bathtub, a rectangular box, or a combination of the worst features thereof.

In my opinion, the only good Chrysler product was the 1958 Plymouth, a racy looking car by Chrysler standards, but it had its bad points.

I had to change them every 6500 miles.



MAKE PORN AVAILABLE?

Are you saying:

That anything, including hard porn, should be allowed on the TV airwaves, and that watching or not watching should be up to the viewer.

That in view of the fact that ministers and priests of any faith, whose job it is, generally, to offer religious help, solace, and comfort in most tragic situations in life, and who generally fulfill that function, should be portrayed willy nilly as being weak, cowardly, money-grubbing womanizers and murderers, along with members of their families, as a matter of continuing course in many TV programs? Is that OK?

Do you think Golan and Globus are the new moral leaders of the American viewing audience?

Well, strike that last one.



GOOD ENGINEERING, LITTLE STYLE

I have to state that in my experience, the Chrysler product always has had excellent engineering in its manufacture; the only thing that suffered was the styling, usually abysmal. This is because engineers controlled the outside design.

GM, on the other hand, has had good engineering and good stylists and designers, and usually came up with an attractive offering.

Ford outdid itself in the first Thunderbird (2-seaters); Studebaker&apos;s 1953 Starlight Commander a beautiful car far ahead of its time.

...and, I always did like the Cord and the &apos;38 Continental.



PRESIDENT NIXON

I always have thought Nixon was a good president; I didn&apos;t say I agreed with him on everything.

Nor with you, of course.



TELLING QUOTE

A fellow once said that you can determine the magnitude of a man&apos;s mind by how high he hops over a minor error; the higher the hop the simpler the mind.

You haven&apos;t let me down, although I&apos;m having difficulty seeing you way up there.



THE PRESSURE IS ALL MINE

Can&apos;t you understand that word-twisting according to the self-defense book just doesn&apos;t cut it? That saying it still doesn&apos;t make it so. Don&apos;t you ever read your own words objectively, to see what it is that actually brings on the assaults?

And if you would read my notes with dispassion you might have understood also that I don&apos;t feel compelled to be eternally right, as you seem to do, and not only that, I admit it, which you seem to don&apos;t.

I thought maybe a breather would let you put your straw away for a rest, but you still build those straw men and shoot them down. Ah, rabbit redux.

What you have generally done is assumed a role as reactionary, being content to wait for expression and then nit-pick it away; I&apos;m still waiting for you to generate some original concepts on contemporary events, but you simply want to carp, carp, carp, making those jabbing accusatory statements, then accepting what you&apos;ve just said as fact, and then complaining about the gist of what you&apos;ve just said.

But, it&apos;s OK. We meet here in Alpha and agree to disagree. And on the few occasions we do agree, it startles to the point of re-examining a given position for error.

As regards trivial pursuits, you have no corner on accuracy. Being correct means being right, and you have never leaned right in your life.

And as soon as things get precarious, you begin the with enough shovels discussion.

(or do I indulge in Scheer fantasy again)



FOUR QUOTES

Someone once said that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel; it is a truism. But here in Alpha we can disagree with positions as much as is wished, without rancor. We all have our opinions of patriotism, and all they are is what they are. In personal opinions, some may or may not measure up to that particular level. Just as example, Jane Fonda or Ramsey Clark do not measure up to a brand of patriotism with which I myself would concur. Yup! These are the times that try men&apos;s souls.

With regard to the collar and the habit; again last evening there appeared a Perry Mason offering which showed a cleric murdered, and a nun accused. This nun, in order to help with the investigation, in the show, ran through a men&apos;s locker room; gee, wasn&apos;t that funny.

And I&apos;m surely not a prude; I just think it&apos;s tacky. The show was good right up to that point.

Concerning what brought the flux of notes concerning the networks treatment of clerics, much of it was in a small magazine published by the National Federation for Decency, Box 2440, Tupelo, Mississippi 38803, just in case you wanted to subscribe. It&apos;s religious oriented, but I read it anyway. One of the sections was on how the Networks seem to be anti-religious and anti-Christian/Catholic in their programming. What they said struck a responsive chord and brought about a more close scrutiny on my part of the general scheduling. I think Dr. Gene Scott would have agreed with that, cigar smoke and all.

(I lied about the four quotes; but you&apos;re just a galleon of fun)



WE AGREE!

I agree with your position on the tackiness of some electronic evangelists (love that tintintabulative treatment), but what I meant, if I didn&apos;t say it in too precise terms, that the good Dr. probably wouldn&apos;t care to see an average, hard-working priest or minister cast in the role of TV goof. I still think that might be correct.



MAKE MY PULPIT

Yes I&apos;m another Dr. Gene Scott fan; he&apos;s the Dirty Harry of the deacons; no one likes him except the people.



WINNERS/LOSERS

Glad to see you back; here I thought you might have tiffed out and left for a while.

This is not intended to be an insult, but there are times, especially lately, when you sound like a real cuckoo. There are intervals of rationality intermixed, and it is at those rare moments that you are especially cherished.



FLAMING FOTO

Wasn&apos;t that a nauseous picture in the Sentinel this am? There was Gerry E. Studds, a confessed hmsl and Democrat representative from Massachusetts, with his arm delicately around aids sufferer Dr. Pascarell at the 10 km walk in Boston dedicated to Aids research. They said about 4,000 joined in and raised almost $500,000.

My opinion is that when the embattled farmers stood at the rude bridge that arched the flood (near Concord), and fired the shot heard &apos;round the world, it was the high point in Massachusetts history.

Had it been Studds and his ilk standing by the bridge, they would have waved scented hankies at the British (some of whom probably would have waved back).

(Their hankies to April&apos;s breeze unfurled, here the anxious pansies stood, and waited to go &apos;round the world! Some Concord hims)



GUNS AND LAWS

For Alphan gun and hunting enthusiasts, here are some provisions and explanations of the Volkmer-McClure gun bill which passed the House on 10 April last, and expected to easily pass the Senate and be signed into law by President Reagan, as defined by Dr. Knox, past officer of the National Rifle Association and noted gun enthusiast.

1. Long guns (but not handguns) may be purchased out of state from dealers, so long as the laws of both states are complied with.

2. Ammunition and components may again be purchased by &apos;mail order.&apos; Record keeping and ammunition-only dealer licensing is eliminated.

3. &apos;Engaging in business&apos; is defined to protect collectors and traders from being charged with unlicensed dealing.

4. Elements of criminal intent must be proved before conviction.

5. Safe transit of unloaded firearms in interstate commerce (including legally owned machine guns) is exempted from state or local laws prohibiting possession, if the person may legally own the gun under Federal law and it is not &apos;readily accessible.&apos;

(So much for the Milwaukee County Board&apos;s trying to prohibit hunters from transporting their firearms in a safe manner on County property)

6. Gun registration systems are specifically prohibited, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tax, and Firearms may not adopt any future regulation requiring that dealer sales records be &apos;recorded at or transferred to&apos; any governmental facility - existing regulations are retained.

(For Wisconsin hunters, target shooters, and collectors, the existing laws in the state and local governments seem to be satisfactory)

7. Lawyer fees must be reimbursed if a gun owner defeats an effort to forfeit his guns, or if a judge finds a criminal prosecution to have been brought &apos;without foundation.&apos;

8. Seized firearms would be returned upon acquittal for a criminal prosecution.

9. Mandatory sentences doubled for using a machine gun or silencer in a crime of violence, and expanded to include carrying a firearm during &apos;drug trafficking.&apos; (It&apos;s about time!!)

10. All persons are prohibited from knowingly making a firearms sale to a prohibited buyer.

11. Restoration of gun ownership rights possible for persons convicted of GCA 1968 or other felony firearms convictions who are now permanently prohibited from ownership.

12. Forfeiture of firearms limited more closely to those &apos;used or intended to be used&apos; in an alleged offense, to preclude seizure of an entire collection.

13. Machine gun definition expanded to include a part or part designed and intended for fabricating a silencer.

14. Dealers may sell at gun shows.

15. Dealers could be inspected routinely without notice only once each twelve month period.

16. No revocation of a dealer&apos;s license could occur based on the same charges for which he had been acquitted in a criminal trial.

17. &apos;Traces&apos; of firearms are limited to &apos;bona fide criminal investigation, which should greatly reduce the number of traces.

And, as mentioned in the past, if you do deal in firearms, make certain that your activities fall within the existing laws. Those above go into effect 180 days after signing. Machine gun provisions will be effective immediately.



SALTY DEMO DEATH WISH

What it&apos;s like is this: There&apos;s a team against which your team is playing basketball, who agrees that there will be no player in the game over 7 feet tall, and the basket diameter will be greater than 20 inches.

As the game progresses, your team finds out that the others have two players 7&apos; 6&quot; and that your basket on their end is only 16&quot; diameter.

Now if you play their game by putting up with their cheating, you are ultimately going to lose, as the cards are stacked against you.

So it is with the so-called Salt II treaty.

It has been proved by the administration that the Soviets have deliberately broken the treaty in many ways, therefore, the President decided that if they continued to cheat, the US would not consider operating under the constrictions of SALT II at year&apos;s end, a correct decision in my opinion.

Well, what are the liberal Demo-dummies doing? They are proposing that a bill be passed to force the President to play the loser&apos;s game of SALT II, to continue adhering to the flawed treaty no matter if the Soviets play fair or not. This Demo plan of death wish idiocy is being touted by none other than the swimming champ of the Senate, Ted Kennedy, who won his Olympic yellow at Chappaquiddick a few years past by edging out Mary Jane Kopechne in the underwater automobile exiting event. Aiding and abetting this tomfoolery is that strange Byrd, Robert, whose only claim to fame is his political lineage.

How the Soviets must go into hysterics at the actions of our hapless liberals, choking back the laughter while cheering them on. If it weren&apos;t such a tragedy, it would be Scaramouche unbound!

Are these deluded senators and representatives really conscious of what they are trying to do to the United States with their proposed stupidities? If so, is it possible that they may be conscious tools of the Soviets, instead of unwitting dupes? Sounds far-fetched to me, but what else can explain actions which would force the US to abide by the terms of an agreement which is broken every day by the communist gang supposedly to operate under the same terms.

PS: This morning on the Today show, Jim Wright, the wrongo from Texas, was oh so sanctimonious in his desire for some treaty, any treaty, implying that it will keep us out of a nuclear arms race...

Sure it will! And the snail darter is critical to the US economy...



HAG-RIDDEN HEROES?

I really can&apos;t say nasty things here; as you know I&apos;m a stickler for etiquette, and insist all correspondence be on a lofty plane, possibly a 747; for examples of the type of noble discourse located here, note the archived billet doux generated by such principled and reasonable gentlefolk as heard here.

This quality of genteel writing does not lend itself to nastiness or hyperbole. For shame!

But, there are lots of members on Alpha, well a few anyway, or perhaps maybe one or two, well, one for sure that is more ideologically suited to appear in the fluted columns of Shepherd Express, that is, if he can tear himself away from researching the collected works of J.B. Stoner, in his inimitable, unidimensional manner.

Sometimes I type fast, sometimes half...



SEX, SCHOOLS, AND STUDENTS

We have a few high schools in this area that kids I know attend, WA Central, Greenfield, Hamilton, Greendale, even Pulaski, which is a bit further east, but still touched by the influx of north side dwellers. The teachers themselves, in quiet conference, tell shattering stories of kid sex, drugs, weapons, threats, violence, strong-arming, etc. Do you think they made them up?

Don&apos;t forget, it was the cream of the crop in black kids that went to high schools such as yours, honor roll material. It&apos;s different now, as reported by the kids and teachers themselves. In the school my kids attend, the black kids on the sports teams are the best, and the scholars are next.

Many of the rest are indifferent, and there is a remaining few who bring drugs and sell them. Just the same as the white kids, right? Except for the drug part. Kids have to be taught the drug ropes by other kids, aided by the TV; the knowledge doesn&apos;t spring full-blown into their heads.

And the saddest part of all is this: nothing is going to change; we will yet be blasted by the TV and magazine media (Journal lingerie was for general effect) until soft porn will be in, with who knows what to follow on network TV. We will still see the tube and the flicks bestowing on cocaine a false mantle of glamour, with the drug pushers waving 100&apos;s at everyone, with a token comeuppance in the end.

Am I prejudiced as blacks, or anyone, as an ethnic or religious group?

No.

Am I prejudiced against anyone who brings drugs and weapons to a school; who engages in violent acts or strong-arm techniques; who disrupts the learning process in a school? Am I prejudiced against the porn-peddlers whose market reaches down to the little kids because of availability; who soft-sells sex on the tube?

You better believe I am.

And I&apos;m not even considered a good Christian, but then again, are there any good Christians, Jews, or Muslims left who realize the moral climate of the US is deteriorating by the day, and are willing to try to do something about it? No one is his brother&apos;s keeper any more, as Dr. Gene Scott said in his last series, unless there&apos;s a buck to be made......



MORE THAN NOT

If you really read my stuff closely, you will see that we have no large areas of disagreement, but instead some places where terms and conditions differ. I think we are all in general agreement that street drugs are bad, teen-age pregnancy is bad, some TV and print media is bad, etc.

And we can agree that some of the above have their good moments.

And with regard to the control of the tube, it is summer vacation now, many kids have their own TV&apos;s, parents work at home and away, so can a parent keep a very close look at what the kids watch? Some of the daytime soaps available are equivalent to what they used to show at the Princess Theater where we were never supposed to go, but did. (Anyone ever hear of Milwaukee&apos;s Empress Burlesque theatre? Boy, are you old)

I&apos;m not backing off my statements that the moral climate is not what it once was, I&apos;m recognizing that it has changed, and is still changing, for what I consider the worse, and my castigations are aimed at the degenerative ongoing process - which in my opinion should be brought to a halt some point far short of Deep Throat on Dallas, or Debbie Does Sesame Street.

Further, I do realize some sort of help should be given to teen-agers who become unmarried pregnants, but the points I was making stressed that without the free-sex blessings of the tube and media, the situation would not be as bad as it is.

Concerning minorities, drugs, and the life-style thereof, you don&apos;t have to believe my opinions out of hand. Merely check contemporary history as related by the newspapers, magazines, crime reports, and the nightly news.....



ON LOWEST BID

Would you really have gone up in the space vehicles of the moon landing era, or on the all but last shuttle flights, in some hardware not made in the US, even though it was mostly low bid? I don&apos;t think so!



YOUR KIND OF TEACHER

I&apos;m sure that the kind of teacher you were resulted in the kids getting a good education in the subject at hand, with no help at all from the parents.

And there is the thrust of the matter.

When the kids go out that door in the morning, they are in the care of the alma mater and not the parents. The school is the surrogate, a role that it always has played. And the parents expect it that way. What the kids do in school and learn in school, whether or not it is a part of the curriculum, is generally reflected in a report card, or by note, if some school rule of importance has been broken.

If one parent works, the family concern in the school can be considered nominal, if both work, apathetic, no matter the subject, and a good teacher can fill an inevitable gap in that apathy - if he has the time, and with a class size over 30, time is precious.

It may follow, may, I said, that good teachers cause interesting classes which cause passing marks which cause apathetic parents because of the good teacher.

If you had a goodly number of apathetic parents, it was your own fault for being the good teacher you were.



I PROTEST ALL NONSENSE!

How can you be so wrong time after time; my bigotry, selective though it may be, is never camouflaged.

I think what is irritating you presently, among other things, and why you try to pin my comments to Stoner&apos;s, is still that little jab, even though you have been told I never heard of J.B Stoner until you brought him up. I did hear of the ThunderBolt, however, and if anything needed sending in a plain, brown wrapper, that is it. But you know more about publications like that than I do.

It&apos;s clear that you relish reading those obviously biased papers and magazines so you can relate here and other places what you&apos;ve learned, and why they are so baaaaad....

Reminiscent of the little old lady on the small town porn committee who decries the reading of all the explicit books and magazines, but it&apos;s a job that has to be done, &quot;and yippee, tonight we&apos;re going into Hustler!&quot;

If you could get your head out of the sand, thus preventing the creep of cranial osmotic silicosis, you might understand that I have never denied being bigoted with regard to everything. I don&apos;t mind being bigoted, and don&apos;t pretend that I am not bigoted, as you seem to do.

However, my bigotry, as it says above, is selective, and is non-existent in many personal, individual, instances. But I sure as hell don&apos;t love everyone regardless of race, creed, color, or national origin.

And if you do, then I&apos;ll send over a case of band-aids for that bleeding heart problem.

Give my regards to J.B.



USSR SUPPORT

Are your thoughts on the US official position that a marxist state in Nicaragua, or in any part of Central America, is absolutely contrary to US interests, and should we do all we can to destroy the communists there who are puppeteered by the Soviet Union?

It should be interesting, inasmuch as you are totally anti-USSR when it comes to a Soviet threat to Israel, yet you seemed to have had a live and let live attitude with regard to Soviet operations against the South and Central American nations.



PARENTING 101

Yes it&apos;s the hoary Something 101 gambit, but it still works.

All that aside, your idea of having a parenting course in high school (grade school in some areas) has merit, but a possible flaw in timing.

If you took your course in 12th grade at age 17, got married at 24, had your children at 26, when your child was growing up, there would be quite a gap between your leaving high school and your child&apos;s entering, say, 4th grade when parenting assistance becomes effective.

Almost a generation, if one considers a generation approximating 18 to 20 years, a period in which times inevitably change. Compare the 60&apos;s with the 80&apos;s, for example.

So, what you say has merit; it only requires some refresher courses as the years pass.



I DIDN&apos;T WANT TO INSULT YOU

Even though I implied all those nasty things about your viewpoints. I only accused you of being completely liberal.

Oops! Did I just do it again?



FAULT

If you live in a tar-pit, some of it is bound to come off on you.

If you live in a society that says sex and drugs are all right, some of that philosophy will rub off on you.

Especially if you&apos;re a youngster with impressionable mind.

And even some oldsters with impressionable minds.

It is not always the parents fault, especially if they are not able to spend all their waking hours with the kids. Exposure breeds trial. On the rest, I maintain my position.



ARE YOU CLAIMING

You mean Ortega was not a marxist-leninist before he began the revolution? Gee whiz, you are now a candidate for the &apos;Harrison Salisbury&apos; truth in reporting award.



MORE BUSING NEWS

In our friendly paper this evening it was reported that six alderman are going to try stopping the busing program because it hadn&apos;t done any &apos;good&apos; in ten years of trying.

It takes some a little longer than others, and some never do learn, but eventually a bad idea collapses of its own weight.



WEIRD MARKETING?

The high quality engineering from Germany, Britain, and Japan, among others, is generally paid for by the producing firms in those countries.

However, we give free money to Israel so they can sell products to us that have been developed and paid for by our money in the first place.

Now that&apos;s a weird way of marketing - a least for the US.



AFTER THE FACT...

One of the last statements concerning who was better off when gave rise to an opinion, one with which you may not agree; namely, it&apos;s my feeling that the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, Iran, along with a couple places I may have missed (and I do not include Haiti), were better off with their former rulers than with Castro, Ortega, the Ayatollah, etc.

The jury is still out on Aquino, but amateur night in Manila will be over soon; the military is making unhealthy noises.



CHOICES?

Kissing or riding? Some high school girls probably like bussing more than busing.

 

KENT STATE, TWISTED

The twisting that those poor words of yours go through probably make them useless for further use. You ever want your cake and eat it too, seated next to your straw men, while saying it to make it so. It gets tiresome.

Just because your opinion as to what happened conflicts with mine, it&apos;s all right, different views are what makes arguments, or even discussions, if you will. In the news of the time, events were described by the media in ways contingent to their philosophies; Long Island Newsday, The Times, The Post, all saw it one way; The Tribune, The Conservative Digest, Human Events, all saw it another.

Between the Times and Human events, the distance between the rioters and the Guard covered a hundred yards. Pictures I have seen showed the rioters and troops in close confrontation; Dr. Dixon&apos;s text showed them far apart. With a judicious choice of text and pix, you can make the situation look adverse for either side. I tend to believe the confrontation, based on the pix, was closer than stated in Dixon&apos;s research text, which, obviously, was written by someone sympathetic to the student side- left side, of course.



BUSING FOR INTEGRATION

The Supreme Court has refused to force Norfolk, Virginia to bus elementary school pupils, in effect allowing a return to neighborhood schools. They found no flaws in the neighborhood school attendance plan.

Let us hope Milwaukee and other large cities will return to some semblance of sanity and throw out the busing for integration here. As mentioned, six local aldermen are proposing a halt to such busing. It&apos;s an idea whose time has finally arrived.

P.S. Those who still want their children to travel to other schools in the city in a personal effort to integrate may still have them do so. It&apos;s the &apos;compulsory&apos; part that should be banished to the scrap heap of history.



SOURCERES APPEND LIST

The question has been put as to what sources furnish the material of political and geo-political nature which I post on Alpha, that are other than my own opinion. So to enlighten those who have asked, and who God knows need some enlightenment, the following publications are among those from which I draw the many gems of conservative wisdom you see on Alpha:

American Opinion Conservative Digest Conservative Register Critique Mother Jones

The Spotlight Rolling Stone World Press Review National Review Intrigue

Review of the News The Nation Public Opinion Washington Monthly Foreign Affairs

The Freeman Americas (OAS publication) US News&amp;World Report Aramco Magazine

Congress Monthly Third World Accuracy in Media Report Human Events Wanderer

Wall Street Journal Local Papers Maryfaithful NFD Journal

 

And a few more, in which do not include what&apos;s her name&apos;s favorite, &apos;The ThunderBolt.&apos; I don&apos;t buy and read each publication each month (can&apos;t afford it) but pick and choose what&apos;s interesting in the moment. For example, the June New Yorker has a fine article on the lawsuits of generals Westmoreland and Sharon, and a view on winners and losers.....

You may note that there are a couple of left-leaners in the newspaper and magazine group, but it&apos;s well to know what the other side thinks.

If it can think...



SELF-DEFEATING?

The contract between AT&amp;T and CWA contains a provision that I think should be in all union contracts, namely the workers education clause. It indicates some innovative thinking on the part of a union. The problem is, that the smarter the workers get, the less they care to be unionized. Looks like a built-in self-destruct.



LIBERAL BIGOTS

Any bigot, except a liberal bigot, can be defined as a bigot in the liberal lexicon.

A liberal bigot can never be a bigot, instead he is a creature of acumen and discernment, able to separate the good works of the world from the bad works, especially where conservative motives are concerned.

Or is it that liberal bigots never have the intestinal fortitude to admit they are bigoted in any way, and that accusing them of such is cold, calculated, and, of course, unwarranted and unjust bigotry.

Poor, put upon, creatures.



CLARENCE PENDLETON

In an interview, Clarence Pendleton, chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, chairman of the Urban League of San Diego 1975 to 1982, director of the Model Cities Department of San Diego 1972 to 1975, chief of urban affairs for the National Recreation and Park Association 1970 to 1970, past instructor and coach at Howard University, where he earned two degrees, president of his own business development and investment firm, terror of the Jesse Jackson/Ronald Dellums types, bane of black and white liberals everywhere, was asked:

&quot;Is it rough being a conservative who is black?&quot;

&quot;Not for me!&quot;

We need more Pendletons speaking for the black community - and less Jesse Jacksons, Ronald Dellums, and the like. Gary George may be the state&apos;s first black politician who is metamorphisizing into a conservative. Let&apos;s hope so.



WEREN&apos;T YOU THOUGH

You weren&apos;t going to do that, you weren&apos;t going to (whatever ). Face the fact that I have no requirement to respond to your subjective nonsense, your fatuous questions, your incessant demands for what you consider &apos;proof&apos; of anything.

Sometimes silence is the most effective answer.

In reviewing some of your quotes and comparing them to the original records, such as in the Ennes writings, the original text suffers, having been clouded over by your penchant for quoting sources which have been flavored by your own viewpoint.

It isn&apos;t the first time you have quoted statements tinged with your own inimitable massaging techniques, and nonsensical as the hollow earth theory may seem, your interpretation of what the article actually said is open to doubt, as is most of your language on what you consider derisable.

It&apos;s well demonstrated in your paranoid defense of the Liberty attack, and your equally paranoid attack on administration policies with regard to combating the communist philosophy.

To what country do you owe your allegiance? Is it Israel, the Soviet Union? You seem to be an apologist for one and an indirect supporter of the other. And this is not simply a reply to your run of the mill name-calling and allegation; I really would like to know.

My feeling is that the United States should maintain a vigorous stand against the growing encroachment of the communists in this hemisphere; the vote for contra aid in the house last evening seems to indicate that cooler, and more patriotic, heads in the house finally exerted the necessary will to do so - in spite of the wimp factor.

What is your position on resisting Communism in Central America, or in the world; should we adopt the liberal method of sticking out their tongues at the commies, or should we be firm, back up our basic instincts towards freedom and help those who would fight for their own countries to oust the Ortegas of the hemisphere?



VOTING THE PARTY LINE

In the vote on contra military aid yesterday, voting in favor of fighting the communists in Central America were, Steve Gunderson, Thomas Petri, Toby Roth, and Jim Sensenbrenner. Voting to aid and comfort the communist enemy were Bob Kastenmeier, Gerald Kleczka, James Moody, and David Obey.

It&apos;s unfortunate that the voting sheep of Wisconsin have elected to office such summer soldiers as Kastenmeier, Kleczka, Moody, and Obey. They, along with Earl and his own strange appointees, have combined to provide an anti-business, pro-socialism, pro-gay rights, pro-tax, and a general aura of ineptitude to those outside.



LUTHERANS DUMP MILWAUKEE

Why? Because Milwaukee is looked upon as socialistically provincial, a small-minded place of backwoods Wisconsin, with a minor league airport, doddering municipal government, regressive approaches, etc. Bishop Preus of Minneapolis, no mean hick town itself, made the speech that listed all the Milwaukee shortcomings. It took a while.



TWO OF A KIND LOSES TO A STRAIGHT

I don&apos;t think you are dishonest or treasonous. But your pursed lips and percy words of future accusation bring to mind what your twin brother once said:

&quot;If it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn&apos;t, it ain&apos;t. That&apos;s logic.&quot;



KENT YOU REMEMBER?

Remember how long it took you to reply in the first place? I don&apos;t want it to be a case of my authors versus your authors. Trying to maintain an objective view of such a subjective subject is difficult; many times, it is better to obtain a detached history of the event by a western society writer of some other nation, who has observed the happenings with that desired objectivity. If one sees the Kent State story through the eyes of a participating student, it will be a different version than one seen by one of the guardsmen.

And after I offer my comments on the Kent State tragedy, there will be the inevitable call for verification of quotes, including the names and addresses of the authors and their closest relatives, not to mention their upgrades in writing, by those sympathetic to the college revolutionary, albeit quiescent, left wing. Which is fine, but it takes up lots of time, so be patient.



HOLLOW THERE!

Looking at your favorite anti-theory rationally, I still am convinced that some parts of the earth are hollow; notable examples being Mammoth Cave, Cave of the Mounds, Carlsbad Caverns, etc. Perhaps there are more and greater caverns yet undiscovered. Objectively, the subject itself is interesting from a scientific point of view, namely, could the center of the earth have a hollow spot of some significant diameter? What is the physics involved to conjecturally prove or disprove the thesis? I began this note to deride your anti-anti antics, but it seems to have evolved into a legitimate subject for argument.



GRIM HUNOR

A writer of humor, Alfred Polgar, said the following:

&quot;It is best never to have been born. But who amongst us has such luck? One in a million, perhaps.&quot;

This was a funny line back before abortionists, but not any more.

And the numbers have changed, grimly so.



THE BOOK SAID

I stated that Mohammed rode into heaven on his ass; well, he could have been seated on a horse. Maybe something got lost in translations by the learned.

Remember what Ben Franklin said:

&quot;He was so learned, that he could name a horse in nine languages. So ignorant that he bought a cow to ride on.&quot;

Another great line...



RUMOR

The sense is that you are gamboling among the sweetpeas in Greenfield Park.

You roving gambolers are all alike!



MYSTERIOUS (K)&amp;(R)

I read an article reprint lately that dealt with a supposed breakdown in the concept of church and state separation, and implied that at least in one existing situation, government indeed is tastefully entangled with religion.

What they said was, that on many food items in the grocery stores of the nation there appears a little R or K in a circle, and that this meant the food in question was OK&apos;d as kosher by a rabbi. This activity is fine with me, the cleaner the food, the better. (If you recall, sometime back on Alpha, Dr. explained the general meaning of the term &apos;kosher&apos; as connotating food and its preparation in circumstances of cleanliness; &apos;clean,&apos; as it were)

But the article went on to say that the US Government pays the rabbis to inspect the foods solely to see if they are prepared in a manner fit for kosher ingestion, and, if true, this is something with which I disagree.

The government doesn&apos;t pay priests or ministers to pass judgement on food that is sold nationally; why should they pay the rabbis? What does this cost the average food buyer who doesn&apos;t really care if a product is kosher, or not, just as long as it&apos;s wholesome and the manufacturer guarantees it as so. What does it add to manufacturing costs - and to the average non-kosher family food bill?

Is what the magazine stated true? If it is true, can any of the Alphans explain more about how much it costs the taxpayers annually. This is a service that might better be paid for by those purposely utilizing it.

It does seem to be a government supported religious concept, but I haven&apos;t heard anything about it from loud mouth atheist Anne Gaylor, so maybe it really is just a rumor; she would have screamed to high heaven by now.

In any event, even I can figure out that K may mean kosher, but what does the R mean?



BIG BROTHER CHECKING YOU

The discussion on polygraph tests gave rise to comment on a program I saw recently wherein company computers were overseeing working personnel and checking on their work, judging efficiency and capability, and if the worker&apos;s effective level dropped below a certain point, the computer would note it in a mild argument of rebuke.

Now this to me is a greater intrusion into the life of a worker, or anyone, than the polygraph ever could be. The sight of a computer image stating that you, the worker, should have moved 12 wobblies in the last 30 minutes instead of 8, engenders great concern.

You know that I am generally pro-management and pro-business, but I am also anti-big brotherism, no matter whether it is the steward setting the level of work quota or the computer checking, reporting, and filing worker efficiency data.

So far I haven&apos;t heard any response from the major unions to this phenomenon - they must be aware of it. And if they, as I surmise, are against the concept, then there should be immediate action on their part to protect the workers from the computer watch dogs.

And one point about the polygraph; it may be used indicate the guilt of a given person; however, it also can be used to indicate innocence, using &apos;indicate&apos; in the sense of trend towards either direction. Some companies, where employees have access to a continuing flow of cash, such as in a fast-food restaurant, or a car wash, use six month polygraph testing to keep down pilferage. However, in my opinion, to use the polygraph as a matter of course in business is unacceptable, and smacks of the Orwellian 1984.



SENSING

Just as it is the singer not the song, it is the looker not the looked; thus the infinite when dealing with the deception of perception.



RAVINGS?

You claim your insistence on pro-union concepts are not ravings. OK, but just remember, Alpha is for anything at any time, within the bounds of reasonable English, without the constraints of good taste, even already yet. I swear by my polygraph.



LIBERAL + MEDIA + UNION = PROPAGANDA

Disregarding the Washington Post&apos;s disregard of alphabetizing, did they mention who did the accusing? Was it the Democrat congressman and the union bosses (no mean crooks themselves)? And was it that same Post who published government secret information?

Oh, that dogged post.

Did the blurb also mention that it was the massive power of the liberal press that forced a good woman, Ann Burford, to resign, and tried to tar brush any number of other Reagan administration officials, but failed?

How many of those &apos;forced out&apos; were actually tried and convicted of anything except by liberal innuendo? Except for that one EPA girl, against whom the charge was flimsy, but got her convicted anyway......



AMERICAN PATRIOT

Another of our true American patriots is gone, Admiral Hyman Rickover, considered father to our nuclear powered navy. Rickover was an irascible, aggressive, sometimes nasty, capable man; without him we might still be burning coal and oil in our ships, and D-cells in our subs. His burning ambition was to make ours the most capably-powered fleet in the world.

He succeeded. He will be missed.



HOMOSEXUAL TEACHERS?

I would say the rejection of the hmsl teacher is a manifestation of the general public&apos;s repugnance towards hmsl&apos;s, an attitude which I share. Even before the AIDS situation, I was repelled by the hmsl life-style, and would not want my children to be taught by that type individual, be it biologically male or female. They are an aberration of humanity, and should be isolated from normals, and, in view of the deadly disease they may carry, now more than ever.



MAKING BAD LAW

Have you not been aware of the court fiats that impinged on the legislative branch wherein the federal judges have used their courts to issue rulings that have the force of law?

 

The Warren Court was especially prone to this type of judicial legislation. In the decade past, other federal judges have issued rulings, which were de facto legislation, that allowed them to exert their will on the people of the land, from an appointive, not an elective, office.

Perhaps with Reagan&apos;s appointments of more conservative judges to the various courts, the judicial will revert to their proper role of interpreting the laws rather than passing them.



BAD SPELL IN DC

If you had listened to the liberalidiots, you might have thought that Dan Manion, Reagan&apos;s appointment to the Court of Appeals, was the anti-christ; however, his was a greater crime than that!

He miss-spelled some words in a draft opinion!!

But reading between the lines, is it just possible that he was anathema to the libs because his father, Dean Manion, was a rock-ribbed, hard right, John Birch &apos;Conservative,&apos; and a staunch anti-communist?

Could be.

Just because he had the endorsement of the American Bar Association, what did that matter? The &quot;Hero of Chappaquiddick&quot; called him inept, bordering on illiterate; yes, he said that, the one who had someone take his Spanish Exam for him in college.

The multi-faceted Joe Biden, Demolib from Maryland, said they should not only look at the man, but also his political philosophy, and how he would act because of his conservative leanings.

This was the same Joe Biden, who, when the Democrats nominated some party hack for a judgeship, said people should look at the integrity and goodness of the man, and not his politics.

Well, the Demolibs got beat by a 49-49 tie, with Vice President George Bush casting a vote to make it 50-49 to beat back a Demolib gambit to force reconsideration. It was a happy ending.



I FORGET

Does anyone remember that suburban teacher who was featured in Playboy some years ago? Wonder what she does now?

I think the teacher&apos;s name was Diane, but I can&apos;t remember. I&apos;ll bet she is a popular counselor, although not as popular as she would have been in the 60&apos;s. One simply must attend a school which sets a high value on academic excellence - in any field.



BAD DECISION

We have just seen three baboons go free after sexually assaulting an 18 year old girl who was in a drunken stupor and unable to resist the assault. Her blood alcohol level was twice that required to determine drunkenness. In my opinion, anyone with a modicum of civilization would not have touched the girl in her condition, but then again, baboons are baboons.

One of the baboons had been previously indicted for sexual assault in his home state; I don&apos;t know if that fact had been brought to light at the trial.

What this seems to portend, is that if one is a sports figure, he can assault at will without fear of retribution. No sport or organization needs animals who exert their jungle ways on women unable to resist them.

The only redeeming feature is that drugs are killing some of them off.

And it isn&apos;t a question whether or not the deeds were committed, it&apos;s only a question of whether the acts were &quot;invited&quot; by the female. The sleaze attorneys paint as black a picture as possible of the woman involved, and try to convince juries that &apos;those poor fellows were only responding to her advances.&quot;

Absolutely disgusting!

No one could blame the girl&apos;s father if he took matters into his own hands and blew the baboons away; he could plead temporary insanity and probably get away with it.



A RANGE OF THOUGHTS

A sitting president should have the right to appoint any person he considers qualified. I&apos;ve heard that story before, that tale whereby a flaming liberal is acceptable because he&apos;s a good man, but that a good hard-rock conservative is unacceptable because of his political stance.

It&apos;s the old left-wing double standard, ever in place, ever promulgated by the liberal press and its ideologues.

 

CONTROLLERS CONTROLLED

If some experienced controllers wanted to reapply on government terms, with non-strike features in a contract agreement, it might be acceptable.

But not as PATCO controllers.

Since the union controllers left, flying ATC routes for us pilots have been much more pleasant; the people are actually courteous instead of arrogant.

If letting them back means returning to the days of arrogance and nastiness instead of courtesy and assistance, they can stay away forever.



GET A TOURNIQUET

The bleeding heart liberals are at it again, Joseph Rauh, Teddy Kennedy, Ben Hooks, and the like; they are gushing out their life fluid in anguish over the nomination of Judge Renquist to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Kennedy, called a moral leper by many, who would not be a Senator except for his family&apos;s money, but instead would be an ex-convict for manslaughter, has the nerve to say Renquist is unfit for the job.

Ernest Hollings, another southern senator with liberal religion, was a strict segregationist when he first got into politics many moons ago, but now has seen the black light, and is castigating Renquist for an alleged racial voting incident 25 years ago.

Joseph Rauh, an ACLU figure, said on national TV that Renquist was against the rights of everyone - an outright lie, yet laughable in view of Renquist&apos;s voting position on many occasions.

Rauh, who had backed Abe Fortas, another left-wing liberal, for a seat on the supreme court, who failed, incidentally, said any person to the extreme right or left should not get seated on the court; but he also said that Fortas was not an extremist of the left.

Of course, in Rauh&apos;s stance, no one to the left of Karl Marx would be an extremist, but everyone to the right of Franklin Roosevelt would.

Prediction: Renquist will be confirmed easily in spite of all the trumped up witnesses the left digs up to testify, including that paragon of moral quality, the Chappaquiddick Flash.



HONORED SYMBOLISM

Isolated instances of symbolic gesture are impressive under certain circumstances; that was one, to be sure, when the Viet Nam vet hung his medal on the edifice.

But peering beyond the symbolism, what was the man trying to say? Was it that because of Viet Nam, a war the Democrats started, quit on, and caused to be lost to the communists, that our nation&apos;s trying to root our the communist menace to the hemisphere that has festered in Nicaragua is not the appropriate action?

Did he make the statement that we in the US should simply stand back and let the communists take over Central America, then Mexico, then South America, one at a time?

Did he imply that because of a liberal press and tv conspiracy to halt the Democrat-begotten war, denigration of the men who fought it, the erection of a black memorial of shame underground in a back-handed salute to VC vets the US should fail to fulfill its commitments in this part of the world.

Or did he place the Medal there in sorrow of an anticipated retreat from our hemispheric duty, led by the cut-and-run experts of the left, and that he felt it was inevitable that our nation&apos;s greatest adversarial hurdle would be those in our congress and media, who would succeed in their politics of retreat once again?

If I didn&apos;t have a firm belief that the United States is the finest country in the world, that it would lead the defense against Communism in this hemisphere, and have the moral and physical integrity to follow through with courage and backbone, you could have my pile of tin also.

It&apos;s only metal and enamel, but none of it is yellow.



LIBERALS

I suppose I shouldn&apos;t simply use the Democrat/liberal/left wing terms without remembering that the Republicans also have a few left-leaners; Lowell Weiker comes to mind, Robert Mathias is recalled; Packwood has his moments; and Nancy Kassebaum makes Alf Landon spin in his wheel chair.

It may not come to pass, ever, but I would suggest the party names of the present be dropped in favor of Liberal and Conservative.



BLOCKADE

My position too is that an effective air-sea blockade be set up to isolate the communists of Nicaragua; but, instead of allowing Ortega the time, let&apos;s do it now. He can always get a job with Peter, Paul, and Danny.....



EXCHANGE

At the Renquist nomination hearings Friday, the following exchange took place:

James J. Brosnahan: Senator, do you think that after 24 years I would take the trouble to come to these hearings just to testify against Mr. Renquist for something I remember seeing him do to voters on line at a polling place, simply to do him ill?

Senator: Yes I do!

Note: Brosnahan, a political activist in the 60&apos;s, a Fonda-Hayden type, lives, appropriately, in Berkely, California, and serves a selective clientele.



HAUT CUISINE

That&apos;s Nicaraguan Style!

In the Sandanista daily paper, Barricada (Managua, 23 June), a Sandinista draftee published a recipe for those who can no longer get chicken, beef, eggs, or milk:

He recommends that &quot;roast snake be prepared for your family on special occasions. Discard the head and the entrails, then cut the remains of the snake into equal portions for all to enjoy.&quot;

See what sophisticated foods become staples in yet another of the communist paradises? Under the Patron&apos; they were very poor, and all they had to eat was chicken, eggs, milk, and a little beef on sunday. How their lot has improved.



THERE TOO?

Letter from Anthony Gray, Warminster, to &quot;The Shires:&quot;

&quot;I went on a shopping spree recently in Warminster and made the following purchases: a pair of cheap shoes made in Poland; scissors made in Brazil; a lavatory seat made in Sweden; shoe polish made in China.

What DOES go on in this country?&quot;

(Mr. Gray should live in the US, so that, to the above, he could add an auto from Japan, a TV set from Taiwan, a shirt from Korea, toys from Hong Kong, shoes from Italy, and so on ad nauseum....

I&apos;ve noted these while driving my Volkswagen)



REPORT FROM PRAVDA

&quot;Pravda, Moscow, 3 July, &quot;Freedom&quot; in America, 100 years ago and even more so now, is the freedom to sell and be sold, the power of the dollar, the supremacy of the moneybags. American-style freedom means &quot;freedom&quot; to live in poverty (34 million people), &quot;freedom&quot; to go hungry (20 million), &quot;freedom&quot; not to have a roof over one&apos;s head (million).&quot;

Well, at least they spelled &quot;freedom&quot; right, even if they don&apos;t know what it really means, or what they&apos;re talking about.



OUT OF CONTEXT

The US news media is unsurpassed at quoting out of context, and having learned from them over the years, I am pleased to report on what Novosti Press Agency Weekly reporter Alexander Pumpyansky said in the Moscow News:

&quot;President Reagan&apos;s patience has snapped after seven years of faultless and scrupulous adherence to SALT II by the US side...

&quot;He was not able to stand the USSR&apos;s terrible treaty violations and awful behavior....

&quot;The president was right when he ignored Shultz, trying to preserve the accord....

&quot;The US is always right and Moscow is always wrong and to blame for every world problem....

&quot;The Soviets simply cannot adhere to treaties. The USSR is an &apos;evil empire&apos; trying to bring about a &apos;world revolution.&apos; One cannot negotiate with the Soviets. They adhered to SALT II only because it was beneficial for them and did not hinder them from arming to the teeth.&quot;

(If anyone from the KGB ever sees this version of what Pumpyansky wrote, old Alex will be transferred to the Siberian Daily Frostbite, if he lives.)



VIOLENCE/ACTION

Before we go further, my guess is that what you probably mean in your use of the term &quot;violence&quot; is &apos;strong, necessary, physical action,&apos; either in offensive or defensive mode to prevent harm to one&apos;s self, whether that one is an individual or a state.

Walking along the street and kicking an old lady into the wall is violence; taking strong, necessary physical action to keep one&apos;s self from being mugged is not violence, except in the classic sense of violence interpreted as movement to neutralize.

I don&apos;t think that many here will deny you the right to neutralize actions directed physically against your person; and if anyone merely turns the other cheek in the face of such violence, they will end up with two bloody cheeks. Anyone who simply lets himself be pushed around without immediate retaliation, or lets his family be attacked without acting in their defense, doesn&apos;t deserve either respect or family.

Many of the more liberally oriented souls, whose hearts have bled for the poor, poor minorities, overlooking their crimes in the thought that their environments forced them into violent actions against people and property, have shifted their views 180 degrees after they or theirs became victim to the darlings of the radical chic.

He is just needling on the subject; I don&apos;t feel that if he or his were accosted by some hooligans, he would stand around and watch.

And, incidentally, criminals are a minority class, no matter what other attributes of description.



VIOLENCE IN DEFENSE IS JUSTIFIED

Taking defensive action to protect one&apos;s life or the life of his family is not &apos;probably&apos; a justified act, it is the only action to be taken by a rational human being. Perhaps you didn&apos;t mean probably, but merely employed a stock qualifier peculiar to the profession. Or do I mean to the peculiar profession. No I really don&apos;t; it was just a nice turn.

Seriously, however, I see the subjectivity inherent in your position, namely, that threatening by an armed group constitutes violence, even if no action is taken. I think the &apos;sticks and stones&apos; phrase of yore governs the situation. If implements are not used, words won&apos;t physically injure.

Unless one is paranoid, which may be construed an abnormality.

If two of any are having an intense argument, with a high degree of epithet exchange, the situation remains non-violent, even if not calm, until one may attack the other in a physical action. For the prudent two, there is no reason for either to become violent under any circumstance which involves words only. My rights (and lefts) extend only to the tip of your nose.

But what you seem to be saying is, that if a group &apos;goes around&apos; in a threatening manner, and is &apos;armed to the teeth&apos; (and who says things you don&apos;t particularly like), that it is all right to commit violence against those people under the guise of being &apos;provoked,&apos; even though those armed have not committed violence.*

I think you&apos;re reaching.

Terrorists are not terrorists (whether the Stern Gang or the PLO) until they physically commit terrorist acts - sticks and stones again. Retaliation against terrorists, on an international scale, has been exacted in the most part as revenge for past acts, sort of a do unto others before they do unto you approach to life and death.

Observe some domestic para-mils: The KKK and similar groups have castigated blacks, Jews and Catholics (which includes me) for some or other quaint reasons, in the typical anti-everything&apos;s simplistic litany of fancied wrongs. What they are really saying is that they don&apos;t like anyone who doesn&apos;t believe as they do. So be it! As long as it&apos;s just talk, albeit vicious, I can&apos;t let it bother me. I&apos;m not that thin-skinned; let them talk. I can&apos;t consider speech as &apos;violence,&apos; and neither does the first amendment.

If some would define certain statements as violence, the paramilitary JDL and its &apos;never again&apos; slogan (meaning pick on me and I&apos;ll kill you, an honorable attitude, by the way), would also be noted as violent. Yet, except for isolated instances, they don&apos;t appear to be an actively violent organization here in the US. (I think Meir Kahane is a nut case; but then again I also feel the same way about Arafat and Khadafi; is that violence on my part?)

Your last was too simplistic a cause and effect sequence for me to accept, other than agreeing that there are drives basing an action (I love my ego, but oh you id). The law provides levels of classification for killings, from, I think, involuntary manslaughter to first degree murder, and those classifications are descriptively concise.

If a man plans to kill his neighbor for whatever, prepares his fatal weapon for the job, carries out his plan to conclusion in a rationally methodical manner, and gets caught after the fact, he is bound to be charged and convicted of first degree murder.

Never mind that the neighbor in question may have committed an outrageous crime against his murderer in times past, that event being the motivating factor to the action. It is first degree no matter what the psychological motivations happen to be, at least in my opinion.

Just as the ends may not justify the means, neither may the motivations justify the events, with regard to first degree.

Even so, a gray area of definition might be the situation wherein someone points a gun at you and states he is going to kill you. Only words were spoken, but the violence lies in the physical act of pointing the gun. But if someone makes a statement of that type with his gun in his holster, is that threat or violence? Threat, I think, armed or unarmed. Of course the rebuttal is, if the person shoots you, that may constitute definable violence, but you might no longer be in a condition to care.

In summary, my position is that violence is generally as described in Webster, a physical or quasi-physical event. The power of &apos;threat&apos; is not felt to be unimportant in this position, it simply does not hold that non-physical threat is violence.

We may only disagree on &apos;Definition,&apos; that nebulous word womb where most disagreements gestate to ambiguous term.

*Note: Each fall I become part of a great armed group who perforce advocates physical violence to certain life forms; and, except for some Save the animals and Sierra freaks, no one seems to care. However, in the past two years, I&apos;ve been in the words will never hurt you group instead of the sticks and stones bunch. I hope it&apos;s different this year.



REDNECKS

My only quarrel with the so-called &apos;rednecks&apos; is that they denigrate all blacks and some religions they don&apos;t like. I don&apos;t think their basic simple patriotism is in question. As I&apos;ve stated before, my own bigotry is selective; I don&apos;t have to like anyone regardless of race, creed, color, or national origin.

I like who I like, tolerate some others, ignore most of the rest, and take action against those who try to harm me or mine.

An easy philosophy.



GOETZ DEFENDED

To state that Goetz was a loony, waiting for a chance to use his gun, is to say you know what his thought processes were at the time. I don&apos;t think that you could know that.

By that statement you have reversed your past positions on personal defense as noted here many times. Even in the present context of developing a &apos;defense force&apos; of some type, saying that Goetz is not eligible to defend himself as he did can only imply that an individual or group can only make a defense in selected cases, cases that you would judge even though not being on the spot, at the time.

Consider the circumstances that led to the incident.

Goetz had been attacked on a previous occasion.

He didn&apos;t want it to happen again, so he developed a means of self-defense.

When attacked again, by hoodlums, he took action to save his life and property.

If he hadn&apos;t been prepared, he might have lost his life and property.

So why are you saying that he was a loony? Except for the one unable to physically move about, the others of those who attacked Goetz have committed other crimes in the interim. Had Goetz shot straighter, or more effectively, those others would not have been able to victimize the people they did. Why should some be able to defend themselves, under your terms, and others just sit and wait to be assaulted like lambs to the slaughter?

Goetz was on his way home, in the same manner as he was many times before. He didn&apos;t ask to be assaulted. He didn&apos;t ask for the chance to use his gun. The situation was thrust upon him by a group of thieves, who ran into more than they bargained for.

And got what they deserved.



NECESSARY MILITIA

We may have lost sight of the classic definition of militia, which is: the body of men in the country which can be called to serve as members of the military during time of crisis.

And a secondary meaning is, the large group of citizens who own arms and can be called on to bear them in an emergency to defend themselves and their country.

While I can agree with your motives in wanting to see a group ready to take up arms to defend the right, I agree with your stance that the function of that group may be within the immediate realm of organized law enforcement.

So what you said is correct. There already are groups to serve the situation. Locally, it&apos;s the sheriff&apos;s department, the municipal police forces, even the feds, when necessary, who can mobilize to take action when required. Effective, planned, strategic action.

I think what he is really talking about, is a secret group whose job might be that of righting wrongs that cannot be righted in any other fashion, ala the Equalizer or Remo.

Emotionally, I can say great, this is what we need, go ahead and right those wrongs. Get the bad guys!

Objectively, I can also ask, who determines which are wrongs to be righted?

Example: The US is floating in a glut of crude oil; however, on the news that a crummy bunch of dingiest from an over-age cartel, who produce only 17% of the oil we use, and who cheat on any agreement they ever have made, will lower their daily production rates in two months, the gouges from the oil companies have, just yesterday, used that excuse to raise the price of regular gas by 10 cents a gallon.

Who can right the wrong inherent in that blatant thievery? Do we assassinate the president of Amoco?

Hardly.

The phone company was forced to provide a rate reduction recently; then they raised the price of other services about the same amount. Do we get the head of Ameritech?

I think not, no matter how satisfying the thought might be at first glance, before reason takes over.

And in many of life&apos;s minor tragedies, where the power of big money can easily crush an average person&apos;s rights, do we kill the perpetrator out of hand, even if he has used the legal system to unfairly prevail?

Not usually!

But, what I have espoused in past stances is the position whereby I would not mind seeing a group that methodically erases from humanity the drug dealers and their cohorts who poison the people of the world with their deadly wares for the sake of personal gain.

The Theory of Selective Removal, applied to those vermin, while not in strict conformance to present law, surely would be effective in diminishing the flow of sweet poison to this country at least, and in conjunction with an overt plan of securing borders and destroying sources, might remove the monkeys from millions of backs.

The contemporary Old Man of the Mountains must be hoist by his own petard. (If you don&apos;t mind a reference to poetic justice)



DEGRADING THE ENVIRONMENT

There have been many negative environments; white ghettos containing Italians, Jews, Poles, Germans, Latins, etc. In none of them has the incidence of crime been as pronounced as in the black ghettos, which consists mostly of black on black crime.

Even when housing has been given almost outright to the blacks, as in the case of the elegant St Louis housing project, Pruitt-Igoe, they have crimed and trashed the residences to the point where they were valueless, and had to be torn down, just as in some Chicago projects. Do you blame this on environment? Even when the environment is a more than adequate apartment?

Even in third-rate housing, the above-named ghetto groups took good care of the place they lived. Back in the 40&apos;s, in Milwaukee, the area around 24th and Brown street was a white neighborhood of neat houses. Now it looks like a disaster area on occasion. To what do you attribute that? Bad environment or aloof residents?

Disregarding the black African propaganda on the mythical empires of the area, Zimbabwe, Timbuctoo, Sheba, etc., why did not the black tribes achieve civilizations paralleling those of white Europe? Was it torpor, or a lack of necessary intelligence?

What comes of all this conjecture, is: some blacks are highly intelligent; some whites are highly intelligent; the incidence of high intelligence seems to be higher in the white groups than in the black And the median higher.

And a baboon is a baboon, black or white......



LISTEN OH SPACE MAN

When you arrived In the earth year of 1984 AD there were more of the so-called indigenous native American group living in the United States then there were when Leif Erikson first got there. They are better fed, better clothed, have better housing, and better opportunities than they ever did. It&apos;s amazing, but the now majority white population, along with some non-whites, support the &quot;indians,&quot; as they are now called, with all of the above - including medical care, university educations, and cash payments.

Yes, it&apos;s also amazing how that present majority simply sits back and pays, not only to the natives, but to many other non-whites, without a great deal of grumbling, except for a few big-mouths near that large lake.

The government allows the natives to maintain their own customs and culture and still remain wards of the government, still having all the rights and privileges of US citizens, with a few others regarding hunting and fishing added, that the whites never will have; whites have, in general, the right only to pay the bills for the non-whites.

Not only that, but the whites of America and Europe developed much of the modern technology which has been provided to, and used by, non-whites of the world whose greatest contribution to date has been a most effective degree of sophistication regarding proliferation.

You could say that procreation is their greatest product.

No, I presently would vote against allowing Earth into the Federation of Civilized Planets. The non-whites in general are lacking in the intellectual qualities which can culminate in the level of technologies which would permit qualification by their group. The whites, while they may be qualified in the technical sense, have proved by their providing continuos largess to the non-whites, in every area, without recompense or gratitude, that they are too socially stupid to be even considered for membership.

Come back in a thousand cycles, just for a clinical glance at the vari-colored chaos.



ALIENS

And the thing is, I have no quarrel with reasonable and sincere non-citizens who want to live in the US and become part of the American way of life, even as my great-greats came from the British Isles and Germany many moons ago. People like that are always welcome, and can contribute to the nation in many ways. It is the enclaves that stay indubitably foreign with which I take issue, enclaves who have no desire to speak any tongue or follow any rules but their own.

My progenitors didn&apos;t come over in 1620 on the Mayflower; but, they took a later boat, the Hopewell in 1635.



REALLY WALLOPED

After the committee had voted to support Judge Renquist&apos;s nomination as Chief

Justice, one of the Republican senators, Malcom Wallop, I think, made a little speech that ripped the hearts out of the five Demo-libs that utilized the star-chamber tactics on Renquist, implying that their actions bordered on middle-ages inquisitionary attack. Faces turned beet red in the group of five, and lo! Ted Kennedy&apos;s Rudolphian visage led all the rest.

Especially at the part when the GOP senator stated that some of the inquisitioners pointed fingers that were on hands not so clean themselves.

I guess Chappaquiddick salt water isn&apos;t the world&apos;s best cleaning and purification agent.



ONLY THE CLONELY

I don&apos;t think we will ever understand everything about human development simply because the brain complex is just that. It is the linkups within the brain that let us be Albert Einsteins or Alfred E. Neumans, and only when every brain is exactly the same can we understand all concerning develpment.

I&apos;m still figuring out the HP 97.



ULTIMATE AXIOM

Or, Richards&apos; Universally Constant...

&quot;No one knows, or ever will know, anything for certain.&quot;

(I&apos;m positive of that!)



A FEW FACTS

Things you probably suspected, but never really wanted to know:

Driving on Saturdays is most dangerous.

A woman is less likely to get appendicitis.

Weight of the Statue of Liberty - 225 tons before the plastic surgery.

Common house flies do not breed in Alaska.

A person dies every 14.5 seconds in the U.S. (poor fellow).

The last mail delivery by dog sled in Alaska was in 1963.

Thomas Jefferson belonged to no organized religion (was probably Catholic).

There are nearly 70 different pieces of wood in a violin.

Of the wounds delivered by guns, knives, or ice picks, more than 40% are caused by the victim&apos;s friends or relatives.

There are more than 20 million hunters in the US.

The liver is the heaviest organ in the body, weighing 3 to 4 pounds.

And, last but not least:

Toads have no teeth, but frogs do.

More of this illuminating discourse will follow at indecent intervals.



ITCH ITCH ITCH

Thoughts while trying to relieve the irritation of multiple mosquito bites.

Assuming a &apos;normal&apos; person with &apos;normal&apos; length limbs with relation to height, is there a point on the human body that is absolutely impossible to reach with one&apos;s hand?

My guess it might be a small area of the back, perhaps accounting for the plethora of Chinese back-scratchers at rummage sales.



UNIONS HEADING SOUTH

That statement was correct in the sense that the unions were a factor in obtaining better working conditions and better pay. Where the unions failed lay in their outliving their usefulness, that is to say, when top money for a given job was attained, the union, in order to perpetuate itself, conned the membership into the syndrome of more, more, more! That rhetoric sounded good when the money flowed, and companies were inclined to pay that &apos;more&apos; in order to stay open and productive.

However, the annual strike-raise philosophy of the unions increased the price of steel-based products, with the prices of other goods tagging along, to the point where the US priced itself out of the world market. Nothing was so ludicrous as hearing Dr. Schmitt blaming the administration&apos;s lack of tariffs on foreign products for the unbalanced situation, when the accusatory finger of fate points directly at the unions themselves.

You are correct in maintaining that the workers of the US should not be slaves to any union, and should have the right to work free of the union thumb and its collection of dues. And it appears that more and more workers are snubbing the unions; in 1945, 3 workers out of every five belonged to a union; today it is out of every five, and dropping fast.

As I mentioned in the past, the worker of today is far better educated than the worker of 40 years ago, and is more likely to weigh for himself the advantages or disadvantages of union membership. And unlike the old days, asks himself, &apos;what are these people really doing for me besides collecting money from me?&apos;

And in these days of generally proper speech and writing, the dem, dose, and ain&apos;t vocabularies of those from the union who try to talk as &apos;one of the blue collar boys&apos; just isn&apos;t going over any longer. To a high school educated worker who is able through TV to be aware of the world and its events, the phony street vernacular of Kirkland, Schmitt, et al, just doesn&apos;t hack it.

And I think the operative word is &apos;phony.&apos; Seeing the union brass up there on the podia spouting out words like &apos;more&apos; and &apos;strike&apos; and such when the average worker just wants to keep his job going to support his family, even at wages reduced to be more in line with the real world, makes that average guy wonder whether the union is looking out for him or simply for themselves.

In my opinion, over the last 40 years, the unions have had their own particular well being, affluence, and survival foremost in mind, with the workers going along for the ride on the union quest for money, political clout, and power. That ride is coming to a screeching halt due to lack of riders and their payment for the tickets to oblivion.



THE COURT IS SUPREME!

Just a thought on the impact of the two new justices on future courts decisions.

My position is, that their being on the court may augment the tendency of the strict constitutionalist to have the judges interpret the law, not make new laws via fiat, as some of the more liberal judges take upon themselves to do.

It is also my hope that Reagan will have the opportunity to appoint new judges for nomination that are more in line with the conservative, interpretive legal philosophy that appears to exist in America today.

Whizzer White may have been a good football player, but he surely has been thrown for a loss in his perception of the Justice as activist in recent years.

Marshall has no sense of color; all of his positions have been based and biased on the side of blacks, where color interface is concerned, and on the side of the flaming liberals where philosophy is regarded.



FUEL&amp;TAXES

Have you notice that the same chicken littles who ran around crying that the gasoline prices would go to $3 a gallon if fuel controls were lifted are the same little chickens who predict our economy will inevitably fail if the new tax reform bill were passed?

Gasoline has ranged from .69 to .74 recently.

On that basis, the reform bill may have promise.



JERRY KLECZKA

Kleczka is sounding more and more conservative these days, although my saying it may put the kiss of death on him in Democrat politics. May he progress on the difficult path to righteousness.



GARY GEORGE

This is the classic case of liberal backlash towards one of their own party who has momentarily escaped ideology and basked in a brief glow of common sense. To the liberal, this is a hanging offense, and they surely are out to put the noose around Gary&apos;s neck.

However, though I am of generally conservative bent, I like to reward those who speak up for the right - even from the left.

The other day, downtown, I noticed an auto with a Gary George sticker on it next to a parking meter which had shown the time expired, and put a nickel in the meter.

Yes, virtue is its own reward - even if it&apos;s only five cents worth.



DONE LATELY

I was asked, what have the unions done for us lately....

You mean done to us! For one thing, they drove up worker&apos;s wages in auto and steel to the point where it was cheaper to buy foreign steel and foreign cars manufactured by workers who still know how to work. You can attribute the rust belt phenomenon directly to the unions&apos; annual cry of more, more, more.

And the less bright union ex-workers place the blame anywhere except where it really belongs - on the greed of the unions and their bosses. Even today, where companies have made it through the world economic squeeze, the unions are talking strike, strike, strike, trying to get more money for their 8 hours of factory socializing.

But I think it&apos;s over; if the &apos;workers&apos; want to walk, the companies&apos; attitudes are to let them; there are many out there in the labor force who really want to work, not just get paid for a day of minimum production and maximum goofing off. Even more chilling is the attitude of some unions and their flocks who would strike and see a company go out of business rather than work at a wage where the company could prosper.

From my point of view, a company is developed by an entrepreneur to make money for himself and his stockholders - not simply to provide jobs in a benevolent, non-profit, organization. These days management is laying it on the line: Either come in and work at our wage scales, or don&apos;t bother us. Let someone else work who wants to do so.



MINI-SUMMIT

When Ron and Mickey get to Iceland things will get done! They have to; all that there is one big city, a few small towns on the coast, and a vast 2000&apos; high plateau - and about a hundred volcanoes.

I was in Reykjavik three weeks ago, and the major point of interest was a community pool, fed by hot springs, which stayed warm all year. It&apos;s roofless, but allows swimming on New Years Eve, with temperatures below zero.

We saw lots of husky, 6&apos; tall blonde charmers there in the capital, and the boys were even taller. The air is clean and there are 80 kinds of fish to eat. The Ron and Gorby show should be able to solve missile problems, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, eastern Europe, Angola, and any number of crisis points.

They should, but they won&apos;t, even in such a nice setting.



FORTY HOURS?

What&apos;s this 40 hours a week stuff? I work that when I&apos;m on vacation. Come to think of it, most union people put that time in someplace where they also can be on vacation. They just get paid for it. Then they get two to four weeks off where they get paid for not being in that someplace. And if they are Business Agents, they get fifty two weeks off and still get paid for not being someplace. Plus, a union president gets $200,000 for fifty two weeks for not being anyplace.

In any case, there are new union rules in effect lately:

1. Go on strike.

2. Picket and reject all contracts.

3. Be arrogant until the company says they will fire the strikers and replace them.

4. Accept the last contract.

(Isn&apos;t that vulgar coming from an ex-member of the Newspaper Guild?)



EXPLAINING KENNEDY

A senator stormed into the White House complaining because President Coolidge had publicly endorsed a certain man for senator, and Coolidge wanted to know what was wrong with him?

The senator said angrily, &quot;he is an out-and-out son of a bitch!&quot;

Coolidge said, &quot;Well, there are a lot of them in the country and I think they are entitled to a little representation in Congress.&quot;

(and if Coolidge were still around he would probably feel that the breed was a good deal over-represented - seeing that he was a Republican)



NO FUEL LIKE.....

Reagan, Schmeagan! Sifting through the oil sands, I only know that before RR was elected, no Demo wished to cut petroleum price controls, and gas was $1.39 for regular; Reagan dissolved the controls, and now there is a glut and regular has been as low as $0.64, with the present $0.74 appearing to be an artificial oil company prop-up. But the real point is this: no matter who is responsible, gasoline prices are lower and OPEC is extremely fragile under the surface. If gasoline prices rise to former high levels, then tell me about it......



DO YOU BELIEVE?

Do you really believe the Soviets came out of the goodness of their hearts to conclude an arms reduction deal and not to try to scuttle SDI?

Reagan already infamous in the bloodshot eyes of the liberals; he got things done that they could not, and will accomplish even more. In the eyes of the liberals, that is the greatest sin.

In any case, the Soviets would love to see the dissolution of nuclear armaments; it would leave them with the strongest conventional weapons force in the world.

One of the many Demo idiots on the tube said that disarming would be a great stablizing force; what the fool couldn&apos;t comprehend is that nuclear weapons are the greatest stablizers possible; SDI would enhance that stability.

Speaking of acting, Sam Nunn gave one of his greatest performances on McNeill/Lehrer this evening. He tried to remain faithful to Democrat party lines while still providing cogent opinions on the mini-summit. You thought WC Fields was a great juggler? Sam had him beat.

I may not agree with your stance on the Soviets but will defend with missiles your right to hold that position.

So will President Reagan do for you, like it or not.



QUESTION

We have had 40 years of a world without a major war between the major nations of the world. How do you account for that? Just lucky, huh!



BUCHANAN RIDES!

Remarks by Pat Buchanan speaking at a Conservatives Dinner Meeting.

&quot;Ronald Reagan - one of the most decent men in American political history - is now called an &apos;apologist for apartheid&apos; by a Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who wouldn&apos;t be chairman of anything if it weren&apos;t for Ronald Reagan. What was it Shakespeare said: &apos;How sharper than a serpent&apos;s tooth it is to have a thankless child.&apos;

&quot;Apparently the tragic lessons of Charles Percy and J. William Fulbright are being forgotten: Never, never mistake the raptured squeals of the Washington Post Editorial page for the authentic voice of the American people.&quot;

NOTE: that also holds true for the editorial nonsense of our local evening rag, whose mission in life seems to be one of patterning itself in the mould of the NY Times and the Washington Post, except that the third rate squealing from the Journal usually falls far short of achieving even that abysmal Post/Times level of tawdry liberal trashiness.



COLLAPSED COLLAPSE

Did you note how the media jumped on the word &apos;collapse&apos; to define the events of the mini-summit, even though the conference started on time and ended later than scheduled?

Considering the events since the Iceland talks broke up, the term &apos;collapse&apos; is written on a very big shoe stuck in several media mouths.

I think Sam Donaldson finally fell to acute brain collapse in Iceland, Brokaw did a fair job, and Rather kept from getting beat up by some grade schoolers or elves. To be charitable, they did their best.....



BILATERAL

I&apos;d be glad to have bilateral disarmament; it&apos;s only that the other side had always wanted us to disarm while they thought about it. Bi- is supposed to refer to two parties. The Soviets say lots of things - proving that talk, without action, is cheap.

Do you trust them?



RECALL

You may recall that when Carter was in office, the Soviets talked about &quot;sweeping&quot; new disarmament proposals, the goal being to rid the world of nuclear arms &quot;forever.&quot; We didn&apos;t have an SDI back then, so the Soviet hot air cooled off and vanished rather quickly, taking with it those sweeping proposals.

As once was said in a cogent moment, the world would be just as bad off if we cut the nuclear missiles in half, or even more, there would still be enough to effectively kill a lot of people.

So what&apos;s the difference whether we disarm or not? Dead is dead. And if all nuclear weapons would vanish, the Soviet military machine would roll over Europe in days. A bullet is just as fatal as an atomic blast to the victim, who doesn&apos;t care any more in any case.

The point is this: The only effect of the Iceland mini-summit was to indicate to the Soviets that Reagan was not a weakling who would give in for pie-in-the-sky Soviet smoke dreams, and it looks as though polls indicate the American people favor President&apos;s decisions.

Finally, ask yourself this - would we be better off having agreed to drop SDI for a nebulous treaty with the communists, who have never adhered to any treaty in the existence of their calumnious dictatorships?

My opinion is that if the Soviets get out of Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, Southern Africa, and points west, and if they allow freedom of government choice for their slave states, and if they halt their espionage operations in other countries, and if they begin acting as a rational government should act, then it will be time to listen to their proposals on disarmament and respond in a positive manner - and not until then.



TYPICALLY UNION

Three working men were discussing how smart their dogs were.

The first was an engineer who said his dog, &apos;T-Square,&apos; could generate plane figures; he told the dog to start mensurating and the dog got a pencil and paper, then drew a circle, a square, a triangle, and a parallelogram.

The second was an accountant who thought his dog, &apos;Solar Calc,&apos; was even better; at command, the dog fetched a dozen cookies and divided them into piles of three without problem.

The third was a chemist who said that was fairly good but his dog, &apos;Beaker,&apos; was even smarter. He told the dog to get a quart of beer and measure seven ounces into a ten ounce glass, which he did.

The union steward was watching all this; he called his dog, &apos;Coffee Break,&apos; and told him to do what he was trained for. Coffee Break went over and ate the cookies, defecated on the paper, drank the beer, sexually assaulted the other three dogs, claimed he injured his back while doing so, filed a grievance for unsafe working conditions, put in for Workmans Compensation, then left for home on sick leave.

Walter Reuther would have been proud of him!



USSR IBM

Pat Buchanan characterized the ABM system around Moscow - A Big Mess, so bad it doesn&apos;t even violate the so-called treaty.



BACKGROUNDS

Many of the anti-SDI individuals, perhaps yourself included, have neither military nor accredited technical/scientific backgrounds, and their arguments against SDI are strictly emotional cum visceral.

With regard to the out-of-context quotes that you liberals are so fond of repeating about the military-industrial complex, I suggest you read the entire Eisenhower speech and peruse the complete quote, not only reading, but understanding.

Yes, Ike was right, in more ways than you seem to comprehend.

Most of the critics, yourself definitely included, are not so much against defense and military spending as you are against Reagan and the relatively conservative administration. Nothing Reagan could do in the fields of domestic or foreign affairs could actually satisfy you or the other critics to the left of Tipsy O&apos;Neill. With your crowd, the only acceptance of SDI would have been if Eugene McCarthy had suggested it, thus giving it a port-side imprimatur.

It&apos;s difficult to grasp how individuals so transparent can be so obtuse.



RONALD REAGAN IN Milwaukee

We were near the airport about 10:56 and saw the President&apos;s motorcade pass almost in front of us. On behalf of the righteous we gave him a wave and a cheer......



SOCRATES SAYS

You are against SDI.

SDI is part of the military/defense posture of the US

Therefore, you are against the military/defense posture of the US...

Gone rings around you logically (and the penguin on the TV is about to explode!)



ADDENDUMDUM

Your remarks were cogent and very well put. But, I doubt if warfare, on any scale will become obsolete; all strife is based on sibling rivalry extended to numbers, in my opinion, and nothing will change until basic human nature evolves; until then, it will be fight, fight, fight, from early childhood on and up to nation versus nation. All that can be done is to minimize the level of activity and the size of the arena.



MISCONCEPTIONS

They are many times only in the mind of the misconceiver; many times deliberately so. Just as the map is not the territory, neither is the term the reality.

The event that does not agree with the critic is unchanged by the critic&apos;s naming it a &apos;misconception.&apos;

Or, as mentioned in past meetings, your saying it does not make it so; however, if you truly hold a belief with regard to the event, tender it as your opinion, and that only.



NUTTY NAZIS

Once it is apparent that the nutty American Nazi Party, just written up in the Milwaukee rags, are really half-hearted protests against society, the easier it is to disregard them. My differences with the ANP lay in the fact that it lumped Americans of Jewish faith with Jews in Israel and other foreign countries as living and speaking with one voice and one thought.

It is simply untrue.

The vast majority of patriotic Americans who happen to be Jewish are as good patriotic Americans as Americans who happen to be Christian, Catholic, or Islamic. Putting them all together as target is irrational. Most are as liable to go and fight for Israel and the &quot;international bankers&quot; as I am to join the Vatican army - if they have one besides the Swiss Guards.

My other major complaint about the ANP was its extremely low level of quality in presentation. It was strictly amateurish, sprinkled liberally with errors in grammar and spelling; it was not the type of anti-anything group that would sway anyone with an IQ over 80 to their cause.

However, to give something to chew on, it&apos;s my position also that we live in a generally free Republic, and under the First Amendment, anyone has the right to hold opinions and publish them, no matter how cruel or crude they are to a given group. The opinions can be criticized, but to physically threaten them, as some other groups have, is not in accordance with the law of the land.

Will the national ACLU, or its Wisconsin counterpart, come to the aid of the ANP in order to protect its rights to its own opinions? Don&apos;t hold your breath. It smacks of the old reliable double standard technique - I can say what I want about you, but if you breathe a negative word about me I and my group will come down on you like a ton of bricks.

My advice to those who pump themselves into high gear dudgeon is to keep in mind that situations involving groups like the ANP feed on the antagonism of those they criticize, with over-reaction being the entree. Disregard factions like both the ANP and the JDL; they do not truly represent the mainstream of American thought.

Many of those opposed to the ANP philosophy, even as I am, would like to see ANP removed from existence because of its anti-semitic, anti-Christian, racist output. It wouldn&apos;t break my heart to see it go, yet forcing it to go because some simply want no criticisms of tenets close to their hearts is just as repugnant as the group itself.



PRAGMATIC RANSOM

Distasteful as it is to me - the concept of ransom - the Reagan Administration did get some hostages returned through use of that method. Part of me resents the fact, the other part accepts it joyfully along with those freed and their families.

Yet some in congress, on the left side of the aisle, are blowing off butter-mouth type steam, and are calling for hearings - you know the Nunn, Leahy, Kennedy, and Aspin types.

These are the same cravens who, if the President had wanted to put carriers in the Middle East and threaten to blow up Iran and Syria if the hostages weren&apos;t returned, would faint from the thought of his doing so, and fall over their long sleeved jackets to get halting legislation written. The same for those who want to kiss the Soviet backside for a paper treaty, who don&apos;t care if Nicaragua becomes a total, imperialist Soviet base, and who probably wouldn&apos;t care if Florida became a peoples Republic.

The media, of course, is saying that because the White House traded some parts for lives, the Israeli munitions ring should not be prosecuted for their attempts to sell arms to Iran.

The difference is: the White House did what they had to do for the lives of some Americans; those munitions dealers tried to do it for money.

Equating the two is nauseous.



SO WHAT

So what if they are only paying in spare parts? I supposed that could be the same as arms in a sense. But I would rather send some carriers over and say the hostages alive or Teheran dead....



MACHIAVELLIAN BEHAVIOR

It all depends on how much value you are willing to place on an American life. As I said before, I&apos;m torn between shipments of parts for hostage release and the bleak alternative of no release. Let&apos;s flat out tell the Iranians if the hostages aren&apos;t released, they will have no military capabilities left after our own actions.

Machiavelli thought the ends justify the means; and, maybe this is a case where it does. Most of the liberals and pinkos thought it was fine that we leave Viet Nam to the commies, along with tons of supplies and armaments, but they&apos;re getting so, so righteously indignant at thought of spare parts being traded for Americans.

Let&apos;s get the Americans back and take it from there.



YUP!

The hilarious point of the evening was when they put a very reluctant Patrick Leahy on camera and turned on the red light. The poor soul didn&apos;t really have anything to say, especially when President Reagan stated that negotiations with Iran were ongoing for a year and a half. And most of the media experts, including Brokaw and Donaldson, stumbled over their tonsils trying to make something out of nothing.

My prediction?

In 3 weeks there may not be much said in criticism; if there is, it will be in a GOP campaign, saying the Demos put more value on exposure than on getting back a hostage or two. The dems have the eggs of a thousand omelets on their faces now.

Being the suspicious person I am, and in view of the admiration I have for the way President Reagan handles politics, it appears to me to be more than a masterpiece of planning on someone&apos;s part, giving the Demos, media, and critics enough tarred rope to get stuck on, and then waiting for the near east leak to allow the highest of dudgeons, then amidst the hue and cry come off looking like champs.

How the libs must be stewing since last night; and in their own virulent juices already. Not even Rembrandt could have painted a canvas scenario like that with such an elegant frame around it.

Will we hear from Biden, Kennedy, Hart, or O&apos;Neill? Don&apos;t hold your breath!

 

For them it&apos;s been Fizzlegate.



THE CYCLE OF LITTLE

Yes, there is wailing, but I think it will all go away, falling of its own weight. It seems to follow what happened when Nixon began to open the Chinese connection, and now China seems to be leaning somewhat towards a capitalist society.

Just like the diplomatic cycle: good relations, revolution, bad relations, a little fighting, a little talking, and subsequently good relations again; all it takes is a little bad memory on each side.



CRITICISM

I wasn&apos;t criticizing Leahy&apos;s right to respond, I only pointed out the mess he made of his response. It was pathetic! His problem was, he really didn&apos;t have anything bad to say, but said it very badly)



CENTRAL AMERICA

&quot;A specter is haunting Nicaragua.........&quot;

Let&apos;s go down, try to get Hausenfus out, knock out the 56 tanks, all the planes and heli-gun ships, blow up the harbors, and get Ortega and the rest of the Sandinista bandits.

Let&apos;s put that marxist specter back in the Kremlin where it belongs - in same tomb of the two-bit philosopher.



SAD HISTORY

Worse yet, the Sandinistas had a lot of help from liberal elements in our own government; we made the Somozas and then we broke them, just as we did the Shah. But events may be cyclic, and every forty years some GOP president will have to send forces in to clean up the country and let them begin over again.

It was noteworthy on McNeill/Lehrer last evening that Barry Goldwater said that if he would have been elected president, the Viet Nam war would have been over in a few weeks. He would have given them the ultimatum of either stopping their aggression or having north Viet Nam turned into a swampland.

I think it may have worked; but those same liberals that stopped Goldwater kept the war going and lost it, then blamed the military, then put up that abysmal black hole marker in Washington. As one who got through Korea, do you blame me for my scathing remarks on, and deep disgust for, those left wing, liberal cowards who caused South Viet Nam to be over-run by the communists, and want to see Central America go the same way?

Santayana was truly correct with regard to the liberals of America.....



IRAN NEGOTIATIONS

It wasn&apos;t long getting there.

According to President Reagan, negotiations to better relations between Iran and the US have been ongoing. During this lengthy period, the US provided some replacement parts to Iran as a gesture of good faith. Sometime during said negotiations, hostages were released, but not directly as a result of the parts shipment.

Where is &apos;there?&apos;

At a point where the media is pounding away at development of an idea that the hostage release was a direct swap, &apos;arms&apos; for hostages.

It only proves that where the best interests of the United States, and a few of its captive citizens, happen to exist, the liberals and the liberal media will do all they can to play politics, trying to scuttle in any way possible, any presidential action, any presidential effort to free hostages, especially when the president is Ronald Reagan.

On all the major networks, the concept of hostages for arms is being broadcast as an absolute; never mind ramifications for other hostages, never mind regard for truth.

What the media doesn&apos;t know, it will imply as fact; except where a Gary Hart or Walter Mondale type is concerned. Or Ferraro and family.

Had Carter tried to trade Fort Knox to Iran for the hostages of the day, the Times and Post would have yet been applauding.

But the core is this; no one except the president and a few advisors actually know what happened. The media thinks that by accusation, it can force the president to expose his methods in the secret discussions; it shouldn&apos;t be allowed to work that way.

And in reality, the fact that the president didn&apos;t confide in a leaky congress or a disruptive media is what really sticks in the liberal craw.

May they choke on it!



MEDIA NUTTIES

Yup! Right now it&apos;s 7:29 pm and Reagan&apos;s press conference is on TV. I have just heard yet another dippy broad ask the same question asked about Nicaragua and Iran that was posed five times. What a reflection on the motives and morals in the media.



TAXPAYER VS. WELFARE

I read some quotes concerning AFDC/Welfare mothers, one of which stated in essence that she felt raising a child is already a full-time job for a single mother, and that this single mother should not be forced to work and support herself and her illegitimate children.

What hogwash!

Another individual, Pat Gowens, vaunted representative of some hokey group calling themselves the &quot;Welfare Warriors,&quot; a notion whose time has obviously come and gone, said that making a welfare mother work for her money is slavery.

So, am I alone in all this criticism?

Let&apos;s look at some published comments from the evening rag, and we&apos;ll just take out some choice bits to look at:

Gwen Bauer from Milwaukee, who works in a social agency said:

&quot;75% of black children and 25% of white children are born out of wedlock.

&quot;I have personally heard young mothers tell me that they had a second child so they could afford a place of their own, or so they could remain on welfare when older children became of school age.

&quot;As for the County Supervisor&apos;s comments that single mothers already have a full-time job raising kids, I would point out that 50% of mothers with children under age 5 are already in the work force. I will soon be one of them. I am returning to work because my spouse&apos;s pay is insufficient to support our family.

&quot;Finally, in answer to Pat Gowens of the Welfare Warriors: Making welfare mothers work for their money is not slave labor. Who are you to force me to support you and your children? I have worked the most menial, low-paying jobs - from cleaning lady to nurse&apos;s aide to McDonald&apos;s - in order to support myself.

&quot;I have never received any food stamps, grants, or government loans of any kind. If I can do it, so can other mothers. Learn a marketable skill and get a job. You can support yourself with dignity and teach your children to do the same. Perhaps it is not as attractive as sitting home getting money for nothing. But it is the way the majority of us live, and we are tired of supporting the parasites who choose to do otherwise.&quot;

Lerayne Desforge of Shawano said:

&quot;I find the County Supervisor&apos;s views on why welfare mothers should not work - because they already have the full-time job of raising children - ridiculous! Where has she been hiding, under a rock? Eighty percent of the work force has children at home.

&quot;Pat Gowens is another jerk. Since when is making welfare mothers work for their money slavery? How asinine can they get?

&quot;What do they call forcing the taxpayers to foot the bill for a bunch of loafers?&quot;

Yvonne Heuter of Milwaukee said:

&quot;Thompson&apos;s (workfare) proposal will naturally &apos;stir doubt&apos; in the minds of those second and third-generation on AFDC who will now have to get used to the idea of working for a living.

&quot;The comment by Welfare Warrior Pat Gowens that &apos;forcing AFDC mothers to work for their money is slavery&apos; only serves to prove how absurd the welfare situation has become in Wisconsin.

&quot;Work is not a dirty word.

&quot;As a working taxpayer, I think that forcing working people to continue to support these illigitimate children is &apos;slavery.&apos; I salute Thompson.&quot;

And now from our blowing smoke department, a quote from ex-priest Dismas Becker, 7th Assembly District (D):

&quot;It is hard to know if/when we&apos;ll ever be able to change the general public&apos;s perception about our social service programs. We must continue, at the very least, to do all we can to dispel the myths.&quot;

Sure Dismas, you talk with double-speak tongue! What you really are saying is, &quot;How do we stroke the taxpayers into keeping up the money flow?&quot;



IRANGATE?

Is it Irangate what you&apos;re trying to say? Media tempest-in-a-teapotgate is more like it.

Who would you have do the straightening out? The Democrats and their pals on the left, including the hapless media? I think what they really want is to force a resignation by Reagan; then the former hostages could be sent back to Iran, no questions asked.

There is enough of this attempted government by the fourth estate via a distorted pretense to the first amendment.

I also watched portions of the press conference, heard the same idiotic hypothetical questions in the same insipid manner by the same air-headed clones. What happened more than likely is that the public in general got tired of listening to the media BB-brains trying to embarrass Reagan, and they will resent the TV venals instead of a leader who tried to establish relations with a former enemy and got some hostages out in the process.

As for the next two years, there was never any doubt that the liberals would try to make hay for the &apos;88 elections, no matter at what cost to the US and its people.

I think it will rebound to their disadvantage.



REAGAN WINS AGAIN

Ronald Reagan at his video worst comes off ahead of the media at their dismal best. By media, I mean Radio, TV, Newsprint, and Magazine, all experts in the sorry art of beating dead horses - a synonym for pounding the liberal drums. When I hear the liberal congressmen trying to put the kiss of death on the remaining Reagan years, I realize it is the left whistling past the graveyard of broken liberal dreams past.

The devastatingly accurate point of your talk was the concept of attempted media and liberal revenge because neither was in on the plan. For good security reason, I might add. Can you believe if a Byrd or a Cranston were privy to the attempt, how long secrecy would have lasted?

And down to the bottom line score:

Reagan got three released, out of six or so: the Great Stumbler, J. Carter, got 0 released out of a lot more in his military effort - he still must have sand in his eyes.



WATERGATE FOLLIES

There really wasn&apos;t much law broken in &apos;Watergate&apos; at the highest levels of government, as the Democrats wanted everyone to believe, and certainly not as much as in the Johnson presidential levels in vote fraud and the Bobby Baker affair. Had the GOP controlled the Congress during that era, Johnson would have been impeached and convicted for various financial crimes in cahoots with Baker and others.

Had the GOP controlled the Congress in the Nixon era, Watergate would still be a classy hotel in DC, and that&apos;s all. The Democrats and GOP liberals turned a minor burglary into a major farce. People still forget that the reason for the Watergate break-in was to find evidence verifying the suspicion that the McGovern crowd was getting campaign funds from Fidel Castro. Sam Ervin and his bunch did everything to cover up for the Demos and McGovern, in a masterpiece of double-standard sleaze.



SECRECY

In the sensitive areas of foreign policy there a number of things which must not be made public knowledge, even if the media gnaws away at the edges. The press would love it if every secret mission, every secret dealing, was exposed to their scrutiny in every way.

If by that you think I imply that the media would expose any secret weapon or approach by the government or military just for the sake of a scoop, be assured that I do. We have arrogant media in this nation, with arrogant politicos who would release any detrimental information concerning the US in order to augment their positions, like the Pentagon Papers, or line their pockets - like Daniel Schorr.

We have the big-mouths, Durenberger, Nunn, Leahy, Cranston, Kennedy, Biden, and the biggest liberalidiot of them all, Daniel Moinihan, flapping their collective yaps under the delusion that it is at this point they can talk big without harming themselves.

Yes, it is a delusion. All the stupid statements by Les Aspin will come back to haunt him some day, and the people of Wisconsin will suffer for it, when the state is passed over for some federal largesse or another. And by &apos;largesse&apos; I don&apos;t mean something for nothing; I mean getting some of our federal tax money back into the state to do some good.

Between Proxmire and his stupid golden fleece award which antagonizes any agency or defense group so that they will never look on us for contracts, and Les Aspin who simply sounds silly, adding to that group such lightweights as Moody, Kleczka, and Adelman, Wisconsin will almost never be even considered as a place for the government to do businesss. Even Kasten will have a difficult time overcoming such irritations if trying to bring federal business to the state.

What I&apos;m saying is that the issue of Iran and Iceland and the nuclear arms talks and positions are really straw men with the left, maintaining an enhanced veneer of importance, a pseudo-importance contrived by liberal thinking, an issue that will blow away as soon as the people note the would-be liberal emperors really have no clothes.

It is already happening.

This business of keeping the American people informed of dealings best kept secret at this time is an anti-American charade promoted by the liberals, who would torpedo an American-Iranian accord, or a Soviet-American true arms agreement, simply because it was not they that completed it.

For years I&apos;ve heard the Demo-libs talk about their goal of a nuclear weapon-free world. As soon as it was found that Reagan did indeed discuss the concept, liberals were outraged at the thought - triple standarding their way through the media, saying 10 years wasn&apos;t ripe for such an agreement.

All their screaming about the issue mentioned above is reminiscent of Tip O&apos;Neill&apos;s retirement from the House, riding into the sunset, two horse&apos;s asses, and only one horse.

The entire thing is a media-built charade, by a group who would rather have the American hostages still held rather than know Reagan was getting them back. And it is entirely the fault of the media whose ham-handed handling of the overall matter that kept the rest of the hostages from being freed by now.

If any of the liberals would ever listen to the BBC or Radio Nederland or any of the free world foreign radio broadcasters, they would learn that much sympathy is directed towards the President by those who can&apos;t really understand why our media is trying to crucify him just for trying to get Americans freed. I can&apos;t understand it either.

And on a very recent BBC program, Stephen Solarz, a New York congressman who is the epitome of sleaze, was mouthing off about how he and his Democrap compatriots were going to &apos;pin down the president and get some answers,&apos; when he was asked by the BBC correspondent&apos; what was actually wrong with freeing hostages in any way possible?&apos;

Solarz said that had nothing to do with it; their aim was to get the president and his men to answer questions about possible illegalities that may have happened during the process.

When the BBC correspondent asked if they only were going to exploit the issue strictly to go after and embarrass the president and subsequently the United States, Solarz just mumbled something about that being politics.

My opinion is that Solarz is just another opportunistic left-wing sleaze. It appeared that the BBC man concurred with that thought after the interview, saying that &quot;even the worst Laborite antagonistic to Thatcher &apos;would not have comported himself in such a manner.&quot;

That announcer yet has to meet the likes of Leahy, Kennedy, Cranston, and that sort.

In summary, it&apos;s my feeling that delicate negotiations with a former antagonist, where said antagonist is extremely sensitive because of past events, good and bad, should be carried out on the most secret of levels.

What we need is a British-type Official Secrets act to curb the voracious, willy-nilly exposure of sensitive secrets leaked to the media. The first amendment right to speak the truth does not cover the right of media to print secrets. It&apos;s enough they print the wildest of speculations in the hope of finding true fire resulting from their smoke-blowing.

But the media can keep secrets if they really sympathize with the principal involved, such as when Jack Kennedy kept a stable of hostesses to service him and his brother Bobby in the White House.

But of course that&apos;s different, right?

Wrong!



RESTRICTIONS

You realize that in my answers I don&apos;t restrict myself to absolute responses to absolute questions, but refer to more than just whose quid is pro quo.

In the last line of your talk you say the administration has failed miserably with regard to its disclosure of all aspects of the Iranian affair. Of course this is your opinion, and that of many on your side of the fence, who resent the fact that they are not privy to all the facts in any administration event.

 

Because the president doesn&apos;t tell all, you and they think the worst. I can&apos;t help you out, I don&apos;t know all the facts, but I think the administration knows more about the way to do things than do the New York Times or the Washington Post, or the TV media. They only think they know.

As far as the liberal Democrats, they are in such disarray that the only thing they have in common is ineptitude. The squeals from the Democrat National Committee of late is only a chorus of lost chords, trying to turn a contrivance into a windfall.

&quot;We failed miserably.&quot; Phui! Of course you know that had the American-Iranian relationship turned to the better, with an exchange of diplomats in time, with the hostages being returned, without the media learning the details, all would have been fine. Silent diplomacy at its most efficient.

Understand this: The Media does not have to know every facet of government operation. The president is the Commander in Chief, and does not have to ask the Post or Times what to do or when to do it, so they can report to their readers.

There are overt and covert stages in any operation of diplomacy; others should be briefed on the basis of need to know. The situation runs more smoothly in that fashion; however, the vulture media feeds on blockage.

Again, on the news today, it was suggested that the Israelis began the entire operation themselves, broaching the plan to Washington after arms had already been shipped in one instance, and that the US came in on the deal strictly for the hostage releases.

True? Who knows? But we&apos;ll hear more from debates in the Israeli parliament tomorrow. If it were begun by the Israelis, for whatever reason, then the last three hostages may have owed their freedom to an Israeli initiative.

 

That&apos;s fine with me.

Let&apos;s take a quick look at two cause-effect type items:

All the liberals cry and march for freeing the world from nuclear arms; when the President brought up the idea at Iceland, they gave him hell for it.

All the liberals weep and wail in their yellow ribbons for the hostages; when the prez got three out, they are still giving him hell for it.

What the heck do they want?

Note: these are not, in the main, direct answers to any questions, simply a responsive discussion in my inimitable, soft and gentle tones.



TRADE

EA Reprint from Milwaukee Sentinel editorial section published last week:

To the Sentinel:

The imbalance of trade between the United States and its foreign trading partners is generated mainly in that portion of the product manufacturing cost attributable to foreign wages and/or subsidy.

The dictate of &apos;Free Trade&apos; allows this imbalance to continue to our detriment; what the United States actually needs is a trading system based on the concept of &apos;Fair Trade.&apos;

Integral to the implementation of such a Fair Trade system would be a federal law holding that the wage cost and/or subsidization factor of any given foreign-made product would be in all cases referenced to the American wage cost for the equivalent American-made product, and any difference between the two resolved by import duties.

Instituting the concept would not be protectionism in the classic sense, but merely an impartial cost-equalization factor. It would result in the wage sector burdens of foreign goods and US goods to fairly approximate one another, with other differentials reflective of manufacturing and production efficiencies unaffected.

Such an approach would offer to the American consumer the choice of domestic or foreign product purchase, in the competitive American marketplace, with the consumer&apos;s ultimate buying decision based on value perceptions of product attractiveness and quality rather than on his being restricted to purchase on the basis of price alone.

Note: I would say that initially consumers might pay somewhat more for given products; however, over the long term, competition would force prices down.



ANY-GATE REVISITED

This morning on the news some Democrat smirked and said, &quot;what did the president know and when did he know?&quot; His opposite number said, &apos;do you think you&apos;re going to get away with that old BS this time? Not a chance!&apos;

Isn&apos;t it too bad they removed the old White House tape decks. The libs would give anything to have had them in operation. Now that it&apos;s been shown the Israelis are in this up to their ears, and in fact instigated the process, including alleged money to the contras that the contras say they never got, there should be some interesting disclosures.

It still boils down to two points:

1. Was it worthwhile to try to get the hostages released and open relations with Iran again.

2. Is it worthwhile to try to stop Communism in Central and South America, and in Mexico, or isn&apos;t it.

Before the liberals start blowing off any more steam, they should realize that if they are against either concept, they don&apos;t deserve to be American citizens, morally for concept 1, or politically for concept 2.

I hope the administration never lets the critics forget that during this coming media/liberal/communist anti-Reagan blitz.

And the Israeli apologists in congress and without are going to be torn between trying to embarrass the administration while still keeping Israel out of the hot seat. May they twist in the wind, at any rpm.

I myself am for doing all to get hostages back, using military pressure primarily, but any method that will do it; I also am for stopping communist aggression in Central and South America, using any weapons at our command, whether our instruments are the contras or American military might, including troops.

The sad part of the whole situation is that the liberals in congress would rather seen the administration in turmoil so they can take over control in 1988 than see our hostages returned or Communism stopped in Managua.

But, they&apos;ve always been that way, putting their greed for politics, power, and socialistic approaches ahead of whatever is best for the United States of America.



IS PRESIDENT REAGAN GUILTY?

He may be guilty of:

1. Trying to get American hostages back to the United States after months of pleas and entreaties to him by hostage families.

2. Trying to keep a full-blown communist government in Nicaragua from taking over its neighbors one by one, and indeed attempting to destroy that government so that free elections can be held.

Anything else is mealy-mouthed liberal baloney; all those Demolibs that look for criminal activity in a conservative administration under the guise of &apos;bringing out the facts&apos; are again in the assassination business, just as they were with Nixon. In fact, some of those political thugs are saying we should have yet another &apos;Sam Ervin&apos; type committee to investigate in their own inimitable dog and pony show tactics.

The method of the liberals in these cases were as follows:

1. Try to convince the country that they only want a fair hearing on their charges, and hold those hearings in fora such as the house and senate where they are in power, ala Watergate.

2. Call witnesses to get them to speak out under oath under the pressures of the Demolibs and the media daily blitzing.

3. If the witnesses mis-speak one word, either as a break-down in memory or honest mistake, then prosecute under the laws of perjury, or any other laws possible. And even if the witness cannot be broken under congressional pressure, and has fact on his side, then try him in the star chamber&apos;s witch hunt procedures of the media.

Those who are after the president and his staff are not interested in laws broken, but in political gain; they are not interested in getting American hostages returned, but only in achieving the laurels of leftist glories.

And, of course, they are not interested in stopping Communism in Central or South America, they don&apos;t mind communist governments around the US, either from indifference or a warm feeling for that type of political system.

I&apos;m pertaining to the Kerries, Leahys, Cranstons, Kennedys, Solarzes, Bidens, and their dovecote of craven pseudo-Americans who don&apos;t care about the hostages, only themselves, and who don&apos;t care about their country, but only their political offices.

Concerning the media, I do believe in the freedom of the press; also, I believe that freedom should extend only to reporting factual news in its news columns, and conjecture in signed editorial columns. TV news the same. Too many times, of late, we have heard implications made on the basis of quotes from an un-named source, which shrivel under the light of examination, and turn out to be straw men built by the media only to provoke reaction.

The media should have the right to report solid, verifiable news as news, but editorial conjecture as conjecture, stopping the sleazy guilt by insinuation tones taken by the Donaldsons, Brokaws, and Rathers, three pretty boys whose only talents are the abilities to be made up for national presentation, and the capabilities of reading from a monitor without stumbling too often.

It appears that these three, their cadre, and their networks are trying to make domestic and foreign policy instead of simply reporting the news as it happens, in a factual manner. This is not freedom of the press, it is license of the press, and smacks of yellow journalism at its lowest. But then the national media has never been noted for professionalism or adherence to unbiased reporting.

And in summary, the issues are not (except in Demolib terms), whether there should be a witch hunt dragged out over the next 24 months, but whether it was right for the president of the United States to use his powers to bring back hostages and to fight Communism.

It is a tragic consequence of the liberal activity existing today that a president of the United States, not only has to fight Communism on all fronts, but also that he has to fight the leftists in Congress first in order to gain the wherewithal to maintain the battle against those who would take over the world if they had the chance.



CATCHING UP

I believe that it was some 24 hours ago that the president ordered all of his staff to cooperate fully with the FBI and special committee investigation of the Iran affair.

You may be surprised to hear that I do not support totally the method used to spring the hostages and to supply the contras.

The president is commander in chief of the military forces, not the congress; and, my plan would have been a surgical attack on Nicaragua, dumping the Sandanista dictatorship for once and for all, and a show of force in the waters off Iran with the broadcast statement, Americans freed or Iran and Syria vanished.

If the president goes into a shell on the issue, then I must fault him. He is the president, not a two-bit congressman or left-wing blabbermouth. He should make the statement that he takes responsibility for the plans to get the hostages freed and damn the critics. Likewise he should give orders to clean out the communist nest in Nicaragua and give the country back to the people.

I still have faith in the president&apos;s ability to take bold, strong steps in this case, maintaining the respect of his friends and confounding his enemies. The Demolibs attempts to Watergatize the situation should be nipped firmly in the bud. The use of any clandestine means to get Americans freed, and Communism out of Central America, should be utilized. Of course the two groups against this policy are leftists in the congress and the leftist media - two entities that would rather be switched than fight.

Joseph Conrad wrote a book about a boat called the Narcissus; Joseph Conyors, Democrat representative of Michigan, could fit the description if the flower were changed to the white feather. This poor excuse for a congressman, whose exploits in elected life add up to a minus, has the nerve to question the president&apos;s actions with regard to criminal activity and impeachment already as &apos;fact&apos; in his eyes.

Conyors biggest claim to fame has been his black caucus baloney and his friendship for leftists. This is a level of anti-Reagan sentiment akin to a jackel&apos;s attack after the fighting is over, and typical of Demolib approach. I mention Conyers after seeing his antics on TV of late. He is yet another that votes against military funding and assistance for the anti-communist fighters, but supports revolution in South Africa.

The noble thoughts expressed on that subject likely would never suggest that there be prosecution of the nuns that smuggled of illegal aliens to the US?

My opinion is that either the president is commander in chief or he is not; and the thought of congress trying to make war and foreign policy is ridiculous; they can&apos;t even contribute to domestic policy. I hope that the president does indeed assume responsibility for all, regardless of whoever actually pulled the strings, and, in view of what some left-wing weasels in congress are yelping, say: &quot;I did it, impeach and be damned, if that&apos;s what you want!&quot;

And you know, that&apos;s what they want.



RIGHT?

If one is walking down the street and notices a perp about to knife an unknowing victim from behind, and runs across the street and stops the murder, thereby saving the live of the potential knifee, is that ok with you?

Or would you prosecute the guy for jay-walking?

It&apos;s the law, you know.



GOOFED UP!

Yes, I goofed up.

I had given the Israelis a kudo for helping out with the hostage release out of the goodness of their hearts. Poor, simple, me.

Late accounts say that in the weapons transaction, 10 million in parts were sold by the Israelis for 30 million. 10 million went to the Contra swiss bank account, 20 million went into Israeli pockets.

This from a country, supposedly our great friend in the middle east, who has sold American spare parts and arms to Iran before, during, and after the American hostages were finally released, it figures. Israel - still the same warm-hearted, altruistic bunch, the best friends money can buy...

Anyone&apos;s money.



DEPRESSING THE PRESS

I thought the full-page ad in USA Today which excoriated the sleaze-bags of the Washington press corps was appropriate for the time and too long in coming.

People have been searching for a term to describe the present situation; I have developed one, namely - Mediagate.

The real problem is that media has the mistaken idea it is running the country via the Washington Post, New York Times, NBC,CBS, and ABC.

They are wrong.



MIDEAST QUERY

Doesn&apos;t the First Amendment and the freedoms thereof also allow us to bitch about the philistines if we care to do so? Just like the T-shirt says?

I predict that the Demolib attack on the prez for recovering hostages and fighting Communism, after the hearings, will die a slow death.



THE EARL OF GRACIOUS

Tonight, defeated Democrat governor Tony Earl exhibited a class I never thought he had in his praise for the integrity and character of newly elected GOP governor, Tommy Thompson.

It must have hurt when he said it -- but he said it anyway.

But, on the other hand, it does seem somewhat chintzy that Earl would try to hammer through a &apos; comparable worth&apos; package that is destined for the scrap heap of NOW history, some no mean heaps of scraps themselves.



INTRIGUING

That best describes words from the speaker of the Iranian Parliament, second in command to Khomeni, who was quoted as saying the US Congress and the US media had blown the so-called &apos;crisis&apos; way out of proportion to what it really was. Do I see an olive branch waving in the eastern wind?

Probably not....



DIABOLICALLY CLEVER!

Did anyone notice that those fiendish white South Africans are accused of sending out another phony aircraft signal to cause yet another Aeroflot crash - just as was said they did in Africa.

They must really have powerful transmitters to reach all the way to East Berlin.



RIGHTS AND LEFTS

Yes, it&apos;s a lot different from Watergate. For one thing, the grass roots people have learned how congressional committees operate, primarily, coercing with honeyed words just to &quot;hear the story,&quot; and then waiting for a slip in order to prosecute before an inept Democrat hanging judge like Sirica. And Durenburger, (R. Minnesota), along with some other lamebrains, are saying that just because some witnesses are in the military, they should give up their constitutional rights on self-incrimination.

I can understand Durenburger, he&apos;s from Minnesota where they play a lot of Rugby bareheaded, but Lugar and Dole? They&apos;re running for president, but should know better.

It sounds like Kemp is the only one that makes sense, but I can&apos;t wait until some of those committees call up Pat Buchanan to hear his story......

There will be a lot of singed toes in the hearing room that day.



DEMO-GATE

Should be exciting to hear what Donald Regan says to the mis-named committee, if anything much. Is the committee looking for the &apos;facts,&apos; or are they only stockpiling ammo for the nomination battles to come?

In this entire affair, what really irritates me is not the fact that steps were taken to release Americans, or that they were taken to provide arms to the Contras, who in reality are our first line of defense against Communism in Central America or Mexico, those were worthy objectives; my dispute is with arrogant rags like the Washington Post who is releasing classified information on CIA operations.

I feel that an investigation into how the Post got its information on the Iraq/CIA information tie-up, and prosecute whomever received it and who allowed it to be printed. If it was done with the connivance of Ben Bradlee, he should be indicted along with the leaker and the leakee. What the Post did by publishing classified information was to break federal laws simply in an attempt to develop another so-called scoop. Bradlee should be given free federal room and board for his anti-American antics.

From deep throat to shallow brain in only 14 years.



FUTURE RESPONSE-GATE

Washington, D.C. 7 April, 1208: From its bases in northern Mexico, the Revolutionary People&apos;s Party launched a nuclear missile attack on several Minute-Man sites in the American southwest. Seconds afterward, the US responded by destroying all Soviet operated missile bases in Mexico, Central and South America, and Cuba, meanwhile warning the Soviet Union not to begin an attack of its own unless it wished to be annhilated.

President Reagan reported that the situation was in control and that proper radiation treatment teams were on their way to the target sites.

Response from the Democrat controlled congress was immediate:

Senator Kennedy: What did the president know and when did he know it?

Senator Byrd: We&apos;re not trying to embarrass the president for killing all

those innocent communists, we&apos;re only trying to establish what really occurred and take steps to make certain the presidency is not weakened.

Cong. Wright: Here we are with a Missile-gate on our hands. How do we know that the simultaneous firing of those nuclear missiles from Mexico Cuba, and Central America weren&apos;t just the accidental flip of a switch by some young communist lad who was playing around with the controls?

Cong. Kerry: Another attempt by the administration to cover up what really happened. It all goes back to the president&apos;s refusal to stop the Star Wars research as requested by our friends the Soviet Union.

Cong. Leahy: You all know that I believe in having a strong America, but this indiscriminate slaughter by the military is unjustified. We&apos;ll get to the bottom of this. Reagan and his staff have a lot of explaining to do!

Senator Glenn: The president is wrong, wrong, wrong! And if I wouldn&apos;t have opened the hatch on my space capsule for too long I&apos;d be able to tell you why. All I know is that if the president did it, it must be bad.

Cong. Solarz: Obviously an impeachable offense. We cannot let this sort of thing go on where simply because there is a conservative Republican president that he thinks he can run things. I will introduce legislation tomorrow that will remove the president from any command process other than picking out colors for the oval office walls.

Senator Durenburger: I don&apos;t care that if it weren&apos;t for the president I would still be a two-bit politician in South St. Paul, he still has to account to me for his blatant actions in this affair. I know better than he does on all these law things.

Cong. Studds: What&apos;s all this clap-trap about missiles and impeachment? What we have to do is get more money for AIDS research. I, I mean they, don&apos;t have time to sit around and wait while some military people are shooting off fireworks.

Senator Dole: The president has to put this behind him. All of his White House staff must be fired immediately so this is can be resolved and I can get the nomination away from Bush. Nancy must go!

Senator Cranston: What&apos;s going on? Did I miss something?

Senator Proxmire: This week&apos;s golden fleece award is going to President Reagan for spending all those millions of dollars in missile hardware in just a few short minutes. All that money, up in smoke; no wonder our military spending is so high.

Ex Cong. O&apos;Neill: This is just another result of the President&apos;s not listening to our good liberal/Democrat/union advice. All we would have had to do is give in on the SALT treaty and stop the space research, and have a summit meeting with the Soviets so they could explain how it was a result of Reagan&apos;s adamance that their Central American satellite states got a little eager and wanted to catch our attention.

Cong. Moody: Duhhhh, I got on the committee, I got on the committee. Didn&apos;t I do good. Down with the president and his guys. What&apos;s a missile?

The Washington Post: Again American imperialism has raised its ugly head. The administration has used the accidental missile attack from Mexico and points south and east as a pretext to blast away opposition in those peaceful countries, whose standard of living under the communist system has surpassed ours in every way.

The New York Times: No matter how the administration tries to say otherwise, those were not communists that fired the missiles. Reagan sees communists under his bed, thus accounting for his pinning the red label on every benevolent government that freely chooses socialism over the failed capitalistic system we have here.

The Milwaukee Journal: Ditto! Post Ditto! Times

Harrison Salisbury: I was right on Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Honduras. There are no communists fighting in the hills. Pravda told me so.

Walter Mondale: Say, are the returns in yet? Seems I been waiting a long time. Get Gerry on the phone.

President Reagan: Pat, get the supply office on the phone and see if they are stocked with all the nets and long-sleeve jackets the hill will need during this congressional crisis. The sizes for all Senators and Representatives should be listed somewhere in the Record. Don&apos;t forget the anti-foaming agent for the committees, and the anti-sleaze gel for Solarz and his cronies.



THE HUAC IS MISSED

 

We had once in this nation a valuable committee called the HUAC - the House Un-American Activities Committee. Its purpose was to seek out and expose those who would wish to see the United States government overthrown and replaced by some totalitarian form of government, namely the forces of world Communism.

After the fifties, the House of Representatives lost many of its most staunch anti-communist members. A new wave of ultra-liberal thinking began to replace the old guard, a new wave whose theme seems to be one of capitulation to the communist way of thought, and whose policy is that of surrender rather than attack. It is an amalgam of craven thought, abetted by the anti-US media of the nation itself, with respect to the defense of our country, where the sinister proponents of liberal persuasion perceive no harm in the creeping threat of Communism - even in our own hemisphere, much less our own border.

The situation became such that the cowardly doves in the House eliminated the HUAC as an anachronism.

But left over, was a law which deals with a sitting administration&apos;s right to prevent someone from entering the US whose past record has proved the individual to hold precepts inimical to our nation&apos;s interests. The law was used recently to keep out a female Colombian &apos;reporter,&apos; who was a part of the M-19 guerrilla group and who worked hand in glove with the Cubans on various communist projects. Our intelligence sources verified her activities.

When she tried to enter the US without a visa, she was detained at a federal jail for a few days, then deported. Her mission was to attend a writer&apos;s group ceremony for whatever purpose. I&apos;m sure we could guess her motives.

However, one of those eastern liberal doves, Barney Frank of New York, said there was no reason why she, or any other, person of anti-American ideology should not be admitted, communist or not. He was all for opening the doors to anyone of any political nature, and said he may try to legislate for the law&apos;s repeal.

The state department stance (and mine) was that no one has the absolute right to enter the United States other than its legitimate citizens who have been out of the country.

It makes sense that we keep away from our shores those who would do us harm in any way, whether it may be a terrorist group or a female writer who has been in bed with those groups and does their bidding. According to Public TV, the woman has filed a $5 million lawsuit against the US because it upheld one of its laws, in a typical Kunstlerian gesture.

However, getting back to the point - the unfortunately defunct HUAC - it is sad, tragic, that once we had a House Committee on Un-American Activities; and now we have the ultra-liberal, leftist, northeastern US House members who seem to form a loosely defined House Committee to Promote Anti-American Activities.

Barney Frank is one of them in good standing; he joins those who junket down to Managua to get their collective farm ears bent by that revolutionary paragon, Daniel Ortega, the two-bit Nicaraguan Stalin.

I can hear it now: Frank si, America no!



BEWILDERED LIBERALS

And why are they bewildered as usual? Because after the US media, the US black &apos;leaders,&apos; brought pressure on the Congress to legislate sanctions on trade and air travel against South Africa, SA had the temerity to react by disdaining the sanctions and taking the steps necessary to hold their country together and not turning it over to the communist-ridden African National Committee, a black, terrorist group who wants to take over the government.

All of the major news media of the world whose raison d&apos;etre was sensationalizing any scrap of unrest in South Africa for their own purposes, who put on international TV any street corner scuffle for strict propaganda reasons, who tended to blow up any issue to denigrate the South African leaders, and who arrogantly considered it was their right to report in any biased manner they wished, are now under a type of constriction brought onto themselves.

They don&apos;t like it!

Their position is, who is the SA government to restrict their movements and reporting whatever they like? The media has a God-given right to say what they wish in order to overthrow any government they don&apos;t like, right?

Wrong!

The muzzle on the international media hounds was of their own fashioning, and a long time coming. They have no one to blame but themselves, which still leaves American liberals confused because SA failed to react as they would have wished.

Poor deluded souls. Wrong again, as usual.

(So far it hasn&apos;t worked in SA; but, that is not halting their efforts to bring down the GOP administration here in the US. May the liberal-left always be deterred from that goal, along with their media lackeys)



STRICTLY A DUD!

Democrat Senator Dodd is down in Managua rapping with his good friend Danny

Ortega, supposedly about contacting Sam Hall, who was arrested by the Sandinistas for allegedly spying on an air field.

What Dodd is looking for is not an interview, but the publicity inherent in the trip.

Why?

Because Sam Hall is an American patriot trying to aid in the fight against Communism in Central America. Senator Dodd is just the type of liberal that a person such as Sam Hall would hold in the lowest esteem, probably characterizing the senator as one in accord with the communist goals for this hemisphere. It may be that he might refuse to speak with Dodd. But that might be better for Dodd who seems to be a lot more comfortable with a communist like Ortega than he would be with a patriot like Hall.

I wonder if anyone has heard that old song that might be appropriate for this situation, without regard to its origins:

&quot;My name is Sammy Hall, and I hate you one and all,

You&apos;re a bunch of bastards all, damn your hide!&quot;

There are a number of verses following most apt for describing the Sandinistas and their US congressmen friends.



CALLING THEIR BLUFF

In strained harmony, the Democrats of the congress have been butter mouthing a plea that if only North and Poindexter would come and testify all would be cleared up in a short time. Well, the president asked the intelligence (sic) committee to grant limited immunity so the two could testify as to exactly what happened.

Out the window went the rosy glow of Leahy and his bunch; no, there would be no immunity at this time; it might hamper later prosecutions. Gone was the &apos;let&apos;s just hear the truth, we aren&apos;t out to embarrass the president or put anyone in jail&apos; business. It&apos;s typical liberal flatulence, aided and abetted by those Republicans who seem to lack the loyalty towards Reagan that he had for them.

I want to hear what really happened also. But, as you know, I don&apos;t care what had to be done to get Americans out of hostage, or to aid the Contras fighting against the communists. In these cases the ends justified the means.

And addressing the Iran terrorist angle; it was said by one of the principals, perhaps McFarland, that since the US and Iran had been in negotiation, there had been little or no terrorist activities by Iran. I don&apos;t know if that is or is not true, but I hope it is. Iran is of major geopolitical importance to the western world, and, if they come around it will be to our advantage. And recall, if you will, that the Iranian revolution was successful in the main because the peanut brain from Georgia wanted it to be that way, along with some weirder elements of the US congress.

There is an embarrassing missing link to all of this: the activities of Israel, our great friend, who sold arms to Iran throughout the hostage crisis.

 

Hatch touched on it a bit this evening, and it may be that Israel had a bigger part in this game than has been realized, and people are scrambling to soft pedal it. The cat started to emerge from the bag tonight when it was mentioned in what seemed like a deliberate aside, that it was Israel who first brought up the idea that better US-Iranian relations could be achieved if certain actions by the US were forthcoming.

But I can&apos;t fault Israel if that were the case. Anything to get our hostages returned, and if Israel&apos;s motives were pure in the situation, that&apos;s just fine with me.

Now I realize that you and other liberals look on this as only an opportunity for Reagan bashing, but I think you may be in for a surprise. If not, I&apos;ll swallow my words, but this issue won&apos;t be ended until the Navy/Marine Corps sing.

You may not like the melody.



PROBLEM

The Democrats have a big problem; how can they make political hay on the Mediagate farce without having public opinion backlash on them.

Answer: Without any tapes ala Watergate, they cannot. And if the president orchestrates a glorious finale to the situation, calling a press conference, relating the events, and nipping the whole thing in the bud (which I hope he will do), the Demolibs will be weeping and wailing until your bovines are back.

And so will you.



POSITIONS

They haven&apos;t changed much; your last is a masterpiece of subjective criticism, looking at what you wish to be correct instead of what really is correct; but, we are all prisoners of our philosophies.

I have masterpieces of my own along the same lines.

But I have some history on my side: it&apos;s always been Dieu droit instead of you draw, if that means anything.....



REPLY

The following was written in response to the question of why I thought Communism and the Soviet Union was so evil.

With regard to the evil empire known as the Soviet Union:

I was in the British Museum once, sitting in the same room that Karl Marx used when he was writing about the death of capitalism. In that room were a number of representative publications by Marx which provided a reasonable picture of his precepts and thoughts.

In general, the Marxian view of Communism smacked more of idealistic fervor rather than a rigid set of rules for a benevolent, socialist society. It did outline the view of from each according to his ability to each according to his need; what Marx did not address was the human nature factor with its positive and negative qualities, each capable of exerting pressures from every aspect on the communistic situation.

As I mentioned once, the internecine squabbles of given family groups in many instances becomes magnified as the groups become larger, and are at their most deadly when the group is a nation.

My point is this: the inherent greed and quest for power in any group has the ability to negate the aims of the group no matter how lofty or noble the original purpose. Thus it would have been even with pure Communism.

And to reinforce that thought, since Marx there have been any number of groups, large and small, that have tried to provide an existence based on the Communism of Marx&apos;s published philosophies.

They have all failed.

Then, you may ask, why is the Soviet Union and its satellites, and mainland China able to exist in the states they do?

To address China: The sino-Communism approach has been trying to follow Marxian Mao for quite a while. What it was up against was six thousand years of past culture. It would seem that Chinese Communism, according to Chairman Mao and his little red book, has been weighed in the balance of Chinese history and found wanting. Late reports from China seem to indicate a shift of thrust towards a more capitalistic oriented society. Small straws in the wind, I grant, but there nevertheless.

And to the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire, the conglomeration of subject nations that composes it into a sum lesser than its parts. How and why is it evil?

My thought would be that the ruling party in the Soviet Union has shifted far away from the basic concepts of Marx and become a dictatorship pure and simple. The citizens labor in a society of chains under the yoke of totalitarianism. Freedom to talk, travel, and perhaps think are all forbidden to the communist citizen under penalty.

They move in a puppet society, going through the motions, hoping their actions conform with whatever rules of the period exist, without freedom, without hope, without real future - unless a member of the elite class, the communist party.

So when you speak of Communism as an ideology you are speaking of an ideal that so far in the world has never been realized as a success. And when you do dwell on the Marxian Communism, you are speaking of a concept completely alien to what is actually extant in the Soviet Union.

And when I speak of Communism, I speak of the typical totalitarian and dictatorial states of the world who are only prisons, whose gates are national borders, and very seldom open. I speak of the bully mentality of those communist governments who want only the little piece of land next to theirs, and want only to control their near neighbors in a gigantic con game, who supply terrorism throughout the world, whose greatest inventor is Regus Patoff, whose athletic teams use drugs and cheat at every opportunity so as to proclaim the benefits of their great empire. That is the Communism of which I speak.

I don&apos;t really think it is the Communism that you may think you see.



THE FIFTH!

Were you implying that utilizing one&apos;s rights under the fifth amendment is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing, and that use of that amendment to avoid any sort of self-incrimination is restricted only to those in organized crime, SDS types, and any who would use violence to overthrow the government?

 

If so, your thoughts mesh well with those of liberal stripe, who want always to proceed with fairness to all - except where philosophical opposites are concerned.

One standard for youse, another standard for them.



BUT YOU DON&apos;T REALLY KNOW

During the second world war, all the propaganda mills were going on both sides, but especially here in the US.

We saw movies like Bataan, Corregidor, and any number of flicks that showed the Japanese putting captured Americans to slow torture, and others that depicted the horrors of the Gestapo, how children were so indoctrinated they would inform on their own parents.

We hated the dirty Jap and the lousy German. If only we had the chance we would kill them without compunction. The only good Jap/Nazi was a dead one.

It came to a halt on May 7th, 1945.

Within months attitudes changed. There came into existence a Marshall Plan to help Europe. We began to rebuild German industry, and later, Japanese industry.

And now, four decades later, it appears that we can count Germany and Japan among our most staunch allies.

So Reagan and Iran began a tentative relationship, and during these meetings some hostages were released and some small arms were passed on; however, the president says one was not contingent on the other, and, depending on your politics, you either believe him or not.

When Nixon sent Kissinger secretly to China, it was the beginning of a relationship which has prospered. Had the media got the story of Henry&apos;s travels in those first contacts, the hue and cry would have gone up, and the negotiations would have died still-born.

This was the point where I was going to begin a rebuttal to your statement, mentioning the on-going Israeli arms shipments to Iran, covert overtures from Iran via arms dealers, money to the Contras from secret Swiss accounts, all of that.

But I can&apos;t!

Why?

Because so far the president has admitted knowing about one arms shipment, and it seems it may have been one of many from our friends to Teheran. The media, and especially Sleazy Solarz has made blunt statements that there was indeed money passed on to the Contras; that Reagan knew everything in advance and set up an illegal operation, meaning that the president is guilty of all.

Yet we still don&apos;t know much of anything dealing with cold, hard fact; it simply hasn&apos;t come out yet. None of us here really know, except for who already has the president drawn, quartered, and hung, plus 10 lashes, for his guilt in the matter.

I, for one, will be happy when the entire story is out, and the sooner the better, but all I know is what I hear. You aren&apos;t privy to the secrets of the oval office any more than I am, so what you can comment on what Reagan knew and when he knew it is only conjecture at this time, and all you can actually do is believe what you believe, you can prove nothing.

And yet, if it does turn out that the president made a deal to get the Americans back for a load of arms, or if he set up and ok&apos;d channeling money to the contras so they can fight the Sandinistas and their communist cohorts, I will be in front cheering him on.

If the leftist cowards in congress, those who can&apos;t turn around without showing their yellow streaks, chicken out of confrontation with the commies, and try to prosecute a few brave men for trying to effect a double rescue - hostages from Iran and Nicaragua from the Soviets, then it is those in the congress masquerading as Americans who should be removed.

The same traitors who brought us a stalemate in Korea, a retreat in Viet Nam, and cried so hard about Grenada, are in the forefront of those snarling, ankle-snapping jackels trying to get the president and his men. Ah, if only they could exhibit that much bravado and nerve when it really would count - in the fight against Communism&apos;s efforts to take over the world.

But, if we were taken over, those same cravens would probably fit right in with the conquerors, with Solarz the Commissar of New York.

Who would be Commissar of Wisconsin?



DIFFERENCES

I&apos;m not saying that the performance of illegal acts by anyone in the US government, or without - for that matter, should go unpunished; however, perhaps punishment should fit circumstances.

If it is indeed proved that North and Poindexter were responsible for the arms shipments, and that during the process, some hostages were released, and as a result of some millions of dollars paid by Iran, there was enough to provide some arms to the Contras fighting against the communists, and President Reagan knew about it right from the start, then it is my feeling that they should all of them be punished!!

How about a $5.00 fine - that should cover it!

I know it would make the liberals, some Democrats, leftists, communists, fellow travelers, and the media weep, wail, and gnash their teeth, but that&apos;s tough! Someone in the US ought to have the fortitude to fight the communists and try to bring back American hostages; those just mentioned surely do not.



BABOONS

Heard from again! Those baboons of the sports world who can&apos;t control their libidos and think it nothing to force their intentions on helpless women.

You know who I mean.

First it was two of them from pro football right here in Milwaukee. Then it was the three Minnesota baboons assaulting the girl in Madison after a basketball game. Now it&apos;s one of the same baboons who assaulted another woman in Green Bay.

Prediction:

The baboon&apos;s high priced attorneys will say the woman enticed him into a stairwell and sexually assaulted him.

I think that, unless the trial is held in Milwaukee and the jury is chosen from the near north side, the baboon will be given a vacation at state expense for a number of years - the more the better.

And I feel sorry for his wife and the children who must go to school in Green Bay - they will probably leave soon for mother&apos;s house.

Add to that infamous list the baboon who is accused of raping an elderly woman visitor who felt towards him as an aunt, again one of the Packer football team.

Animals! Animals all.



NOBLES OBLIGED...

It all boils down to this: you hate Reagan, we like Reagan. All else is smoke and puffery. And with regard to some of the people in the country who seem to have beliefs that transcend yours in an ever port-sided view, they all appear to have such high ideals when it comes to Iran/Contra situations.

If a president, especially a conservative president, dares to effect any action against the rules they have laid down for his conduct, they are in immediate howl, rapturously declaiming on the nobleness of their resistant cause to his obvious malfeasance, employing the full weight of the liberal congress and media in a daily pressure cooker of hype.

These are the types of individuals exemplified by the Haydons, Fondas, and the Ramsey Clarks, who see nothing wrong with giving aid and comfort to an enemy, such as in the Viet Nam tragedy, who would rather die than see Reagan antagonize the Soviet Union and its satellites, who hated it when Nixon opened up the door to Red China, who gnash at the possibility that Reagan might do the same with an old enemy - Iran.

We are getting a vast left-wing orchestration now, harmonizing on that theme; whose crescendo is aimed solely at assassinating Reagan, figuratively first, literally if required. They are the weaklings, the cowards, the political hacks of America. Their lair is the northeast, also sited in LA and Frisco, and who appear in quisling quorums throughout the country.

Their assumed mantle of nobility doesn&apos;t really fool anyone. It&apos;s simply gutter left-wing politics all over again from those cretins who gave us Korea, Cuba, Viet Nam, and are now trying to bring about another retreat from communistic advance in Central America.

To those I say, spare me the mealy-mouth platitudes shaped by liberal artifice. Try and remember, if you can, the thrust of the presidential actions in the immediate affair was to institute relations with Iran, get back some hostages, and help a small group of freedom fighters to overthrow a communist regime.

They&apos;re giving their lives; you are giving liver-lip service.

And to you, I say that it is to the nation&apos;s benefit to have a president able to formulate foreign policy unhampered. The liberal toadies of past congresses have passed legislation to inhibit presidential options, laws which I feel would not stand the test of constitutionality with regard to the separation of powers, and should be removed from the books, allowing congress to do what they do best - relatively nothing while passing bad law, then crowing about it.



POLICIES

You are more right than you know! It depends on which president is doing the formulating. When Kennedy was president, he was the darling of the liberals and could do no wrong. There were not the stringent laws on the books hampering his attempts to make policy. If Jack did it, it was fine.

Since Kennedy&apos;s day, an interfering line of congresses have bypassed the separation of powers inherent in the constitution, and have taken it upon themselves to inject their incoherent thoughts and methods to influence American foreign policy. This is wrong!

And with this issue, I am not addressing the Hostage-Contra crisis, but speaking in general. No president, Democrat or Republican, should be restricted by laws limiting his powers to conduct foreign policy. Congress is but an oversize committee, and much of the legislation it does generate has the odor of camel - and precisely in that particular policy field.

But speaking to the Hostage-Contra crisis, each of the Senators or Representatives that have provided opinions in the welcome glow of the tube, Demo or Repub, has had a different view on what should be done.

Some want immunity for North, Poindexter, and perhaps Secord; most Demos don&apos;t, Repubs do. Demos are trying the ploy of getting the president to pardon in advance, but the president will not react in such foolish manner.

With the congress we have in the US today, it&apos;s a wonder that anything of value ever got completed. And with the next group, controlled by the Demos, it will even be worse.

And touching on the Kennedy era again, when JFK set the Bay of Pigs into operation, he would have been the hero of the western hemisphere had he simply followed Eisenhower&apos;s advice. All he needed was to provide USAF air cover for the invaders and it would have been probable that today Cuba would be free of Communism and there would be no soviet Nicaragua. All it took was some guts, but Kennedy&apos;s spirit failed, putting Cuba into subjugation.

And was there an outpouring of indignation from the people of America?

Some small voices from the right.

They were drowned out by the waves of admiration from the liberal left and their media clones, saying Kennedy had done the &apos;right thing&apos; letting the popular front of Castro to take over.

And do you know whose fault it finally was?

The CIA&apos;s.

Just as in these days........



VOYAGER

Our grandchildren will be celebrating the names of Rutan and Yeager, the Voyager crew, even as our grandfathers cheered the Spirit of St. Louis.

What an achievment, so monumental that even the Soviet press acknowledged the feat.

There will always be some in America that are of heroic stock, in spite of all the deadwood we see extant - thank goodness for that.



SANTA

YANA, that is: &quot;Those who do not learn from the mistakes of history are doomed to repeat them....(sic)

In the 1960&apos;s, the 1740&apos;s, or the 1980&apos;s.



ARMS&amp;RELATIONS

You were indeed politic not to ask about why it was all right for our great &apos;friends&apos; in the middle east to have shipped arms to Iran before, during, and after the Carter hostage crisis, but it was not proper for the US to send some in the process of developing relations and jointly getting some hostages returned. They also have said many times that Iran is a bastion of terror, but still continued to ship while they were talking. When gold talks, they have ultrasensitive hearing (they&apos;re not the only ones).

Won&apos;t it be fun to hear the entire story, and see how deep those &apos;friends&apos; are involved. Rumor only has said, up to their ears, and some of cynical nature have implied that perhaps the story has not emerged as quickly as it should have because a lot of people are in the background trying to cover up the Tel Aviv connection, which, if found out, would have a disastrous effect on the funds methodically flowing there.

However, let me make my position clear: If the Israelis actually were shipping arms to Iran as a part of a package to develop American-Iranian normalized relations, and if as a result of Israel&apos;s efforts in shipping arms, the Iranians released some American hostages, then more power and much appreciation to Israel if that were the plan.

Which illustrates the core of my thought on the subject: Let&apos;s treat Israel and all the countries of the middle east in a balanced manner, including Egypt; those two nations who get the bulk of the outrageous amount of funds which we send to that region. It&apos;s time to call a halt to those exorbitant expenditures.

Let&apos;s deal with Israel and Egypt as we would deal with Britain, Italy, Morocco, Australia, and the like, on a basis of mutual expediency, not by throwing our tax dollars at them, which are never to be seen again. Our farmers could use the money more than they.

Like I said, it will be fun to see what happens - along with what really happened.



IRAN-BUCKS

On the wires today it said the US and Iran were meeting on the half-billion or so that Iran had frozen during the hostage crisis. More releases will come out of that meeting. Also, the anti-Khomeni elements that the liberals say do not exist in Iran just blew up an ammunition dump killing and wounding over 500 pro-Khomeni militia. Not bad from non-existence.



BAGELS&amp;BONZO

I love bagels, especially the plain, water bagels from that place next to Benji&apos;s; with regard to &apos;Bedtime for Bonzo,&apos; I always thought it was a documentary about how Reagan trounced Mondale.

Your implication is understood, but wrong with regard to a particular fragment of our American society, who represent some of the best and the brightest, and who are embarrassed by the actions of Tel Aviv and some of the Kahane types. Israelis are Israelis; Americans are Americans; religion is unimportant in that comparison.



COMMENTS

Down south it was always maintained that the whites disliked blacks in general, but really had high regard for them on an individual basis; the south said that up north, they had a high regard for the blacks in general, but disliked them on an individual basis.

I tend to have a high regard for people on an individual basis, meaning I prefer to like those whom I like, am indifferent to most of the rest, and hate the black or white killers, rapists, and other criminals. As I&apos;ve stated in the past, I am a selective bigot, and like and dislike without regard to race, creed, or color.

We just set a record for murders in Milwaukee; guess which group committed most of them.



ARRANGEMENT

OK, I&apos;ll try to arrange it so that there will be more white murderers and rapists in the Milwaukee area so as to provide for countless references.

I just don&apos;t know how to do it.

There is only one qualification important enough to discuss: that of reason and intelligence. If, in the course of my activity, I meet one who has the reason and intelligence to offer some common ground for discussion, and I happen to be in the mood to discuss anything, then communication can be established without regard to hue.

But if I don&apos;t care to develop any rapport - with any one - that&apos;s up to my judgement.

So, when it comes to liking or disliking individuals or groups, doing so is strictly up to me. Don&apos;t confuse that with the citation of statistics on the activity of whites, blacks, or anyone - especially those that are taken from the newspapers or TV.

If my disdain for any group, black or white, is an irritation, well, you can be the balance; however, addressing specifically the blacks, it&apos;s difficult to achieve any general respect for a group whose members live by the terms, honkey, ofay, and the like, and waste no opportunity to utilize the names in any context or setting.

You may learn some day not to trust anyone until they have proved worthy of your trust, and do not intend to harm you or yours. All of my selective bigotry is based on implementation of that knowledge.

And you may be looking for something in my writings that does not exist; even while denigrating Loften, Ivery, and Cade, I can cheer for people like Willie Davis, Walter Stanley, and Mark Lee.

I told you it was selective.



NO CONCESSION

The best thing about America is that no one can force me to interrelate to anyone else, regardless of... etc.

If you consider one&apos;s being in a cafeteria, or an airport, one can exist amid the varied shapes, colors, and etc.&apos;s, but I don&apos;t consider that interrelating. Perhaps a suspension vs a colloidal suspension. Perhaps exposure is what you really mean.

In daily life we are exposed to the etc.&apos;s in social and business intercourse, and there can be no interrelationship unless on mutual terms. And those terms may be defined as acceptance of a relationship wherein there is communicative flow from one to another, and by communicative flow I imply willful exchange of mutually appreciated information.

In any situation, you yourself determine interrelationship; you can turn on or turn off the communicative flow.

Distilled to the essence, interrelationship is a mutual exchange of communicative flow!

A new, philosophical thought in only a brief exposition.



INSTITUTIONAL BIGOTRY

It depends on a definition of &apos;institution.&apos;

A governmental institution, on any level, should offer services equally to all, regardless of, etc.

An insurance institution offers its services only to those they consider of equitable risk.

A hospitalic institution, private in nature, confines its services to those who prove they are capable of reimbursement for service, personally or through insurance institutions.

The NAACP cannot allow white members, by title definition, and it is a long-time American institution.

Not to mention the Knights of Columbus or the B&apos;Nai B&apos;rith, two institutions catering to specific types.

Mensa is a particularly bigoted institution. Good for them!

There is nothing wrong with the concept of Selective Bigotry as I have defined it, on a personal basis. And, from the examples above, you may infer even certain institutions are perforce bigoted.

Considering the military forces as governmental institutions, in a variation of line 3, are bigoted against individuals over 70; they probably feel 75 year old recruits might not be up to basic training.

The idea of primary importance I am trying to impart is this: every individual is bigoted, at least to some extent; and every institution is bigoted, because institutions are composed of and run by individuals, who may be bigoted in defiance of the institution&apos;s non-bigot rules.

And all are gauged on their level of bigotry, by those whose own level is either above or below that who is being judged.

And how wonderful it is to note that if one&apos;s level of bigotry is above that of the judge&apos;s, he is adjudged a bigot; if one&apos;s level of bigotry is equal to or lower than that of the judges, he will never be adjudged a bigot - at least in that judges eyes. Or am I just bigoted for saying that?



SOME CONCURRENCE

I&apos;d like to add some clarification to the thought expressed. When you employed the word &apos;personal&apos; bigotry when a situation exhibited rejecting an individual on the basis of race, color, etc., I think what you implied was that the individual in that sort of empowered decision making should not make the rejection on the basis of his personal bigotry for the institution, or on the basis of a bigoted institutional policy, which is illegal. I would believe a personal one-on-one bigotry is still usable in individualized, non-institutional situations.

And, in fact, here in Milwaukee, a landlord has the right to choose to rent or not to rent, if he lives in his own two-family building, to anyone he wishes. This could be construed as personal bigotry - legalized - pure and simple.



POVERTY

If one defines poverty as having an income of less than about $12000 per annum, then I think poverty is being over-stated. $12 grand a year equates to $230 a week; many small families are making it on that right now. In my opinion, $230 a week is not abject or starvation poverty.

When you say this country deals inadequately with poverty and its ensuing problems, do you imply that we should feed, clothe, and pay chronic non-workers such that they have a standard of living equal to that of middle class workers?

Some welfarites get about $700 a month for a mother and four children; at a 15% tax factor, this is equivalent to $824 a month. Now, that family can survive on $700 a month; however, there will not be a lot of money to provide allowances to teen-agers. If the teen-ager does not get an allowance equaling that of his peers, and he commits crimes in order to have more spendable assets, do you imply that poverty has forced him into criminal acts?

I never thought the allowance I got was a big deal, but we had adequate food and clothing at home, and I never turned to thievery to augment an allowance. It just wasn&apos;t done, even though other kids had much more to spend than I did.

This business of poverty, in the black communities, as an excuse for never-ending crime is simply not valid. Reports have indicated that envy is induced in the poorer black &apos;ghetto&apos; dwellers by the cadillac-affluence syndrome of surface success exemplified by the drug dealer, pimp, and thief, whose transitory trappings provide a wrong role model for the black kid who doesn&apos;t have much other than food and shelter provided in a welfare matriarchy.

Back in the Madison &apos;30&apos;s, our family was poor too. We got over it without welfare, by all of us working, including our father, even when jobs were tough to find. So, let me make to some a pertinent suggestion: Go to work!



RESPECT

Respect is like a shaft of light - the respect inherent in a communication reflects back in the manner it was sent.

Lack of respect is also like a shaft...



RANDOM THOUGHT

First there is Miller Lite.

Then there is Coors.

Then comes Coors light.

Then comes water.

BLUE RIBBON

Alas, there is no longer a stable working environment at good old Pabst; they are using trucks now......



LAYER TWO...

Apun my phylogenetic word.

Philogyny (which I think I miss-spelled) means a fondness for women, which got us into those ontogenetic problems in the first place, etymologically speaking.

(played to the tune of some igneoethnomusicolgist tribe of Liverpudlians)

You sharp-eyed devil you!



PHILOGYNY

Page 854, spelled correctly at last, Webster&apos;s New Collegiate; fondness for women. That&apos;s us all right! Phylogeny (recapitulated or not) as you have so graciously mentioned. Moral, I shouldn&apos;t get clever unless I remember how to spell..



UW-MADISON

Many still are not aware that the University of Wisconsin was and is one of the great agricultural and dairy institutions of the world today. It has a counterpart in the University of Wageneningen in Holland, whose faculty greatly respects the Madison campus.

The UW engineering department is on a par with that of Purdue and MIT, and the science and math departments equal that of the University of Chicago and Cal Tech; but, I won&apos;t mention the Poly-Sci department.



OLD MEMBERS, WHERE?

As Villon almost said, Where are the schmoes of yesteryear?

As Chico would have answered, dere membaships prolly espired.



KIDNAPPERS

The prediction business is tough, but here goes anyway:

Again some middle-east thugs have kidnapped four people from the University in Beirut, this event occurring even while Terry Waite is supposedly negotiating release of American hostages from another set of thugs.

There is a lull because of the negotiations.

So, while Waite is at work, things are quiet; however, should the Waite attempt fail, the lid may be off, and the following may happen:

1. A US Navy battle squadron may weigh anchor and head for the waters off

Lebanon in a show of force.

2. Quiet efforts will be made to impress upon the kidnappers and their sponsors that it would be in their best interest to return all those taken hostage, not just the Americans.

3. If the results are negative, then parts of that area of the middle east will undergo a military massage, including the war machines of several local militia, principally around Beirut and in the Bacqua valley, but perhaps even the air forces of Syria and Iran. Iran has demanded more military supplies - let&apos;s give them some.

4. This may happen if the administration develops some firmness and does not bow to the liberal forces in the US not to do so. I hope the President simply doesn&apos;t inform them of what he wants to do, then goes ahead and does it.

Telling Congress is like telling the NY Times.

5. Yes, we will probably lose the hostages, but in the various military actions of the past, and in the Buckley case, better men than they were considered expendable.

It is time for the President to disregard the weaklings of the US left and take strong action, disregarding the inevitable whines from the media.

This is the action that must be taken, and soon upon the results of Waite&apos;s activities. There has been too much dilly-dallying since the relationship between Washington and Iran was prematurely exposed; it is time to act, and to impress all the middle-east thugs that they, and those around them, are in harm&apos;s way.

As far as the congressional circus hearings are concerned, Reagan should disregard them and do what must be done. Let the liberals have their little dog and pony shows that they do so well, and while they are performing, let the US military impress upon the hostage-takers the error of their ways, letting the liberal hearts bleed as they will.

The prediction is: A waffle! Some action will be taken between the stance of doing nothing but talk, and strong military pressure on the thugs. If it is the former, too bad; if it is the latter, I&apos;ll be surprised pleasantly.

Gee, that wasn&apos;t so tough!



OFF THE LIST

From that time-worn Alpha list of liberals who compose a convenient clutch of whipping boys for the conservatives, kindly remove, for at least this moment, the name of Claibourne Pell, Democrat.

A flash of inspiration struck this senator like a bolt of lightning, and in an interview he went on record as saying military action against the bullies of the middle east might be appropriate, even with qualifiers. May this attitude become catching in the left aisle ranks.



REAGAN&apos;S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH

Response was predictable.

Byrd and Wright sounded like second-rate whiners talking to a third grade class of students, making even less sense than usual. Even President Reagan&apos;s usual detractors praised the effort, and most Republicans were in agreement with the thoughts expressed. Democrats, on the other hand, learned to their dismay that contrary to what they&apos;d hoped, Reagan was in charge and it would be business as usual, in spite of mediagate.

Note with reference to a past thought: Late yesterday a US battle fleet was sent to the waters of the middle east, including two aircraft carriers.

Finally, one of the most satisfying scenes of the speech - the Chappaquiddick flash squirming in his seat while the President spoke, not having the courtesy to applaud even the President&apos;s entrance or exit. He probably didn&apos;t want to expose the blood and salt water on his hands.

One or two seats away, another Kennedy, elected only because of his name and money, smiled vacuously thoroughout. Gauche of the evening - Ted Kennedy sitting with his head down even when brother Jack&apos;s name was mentioned, carrying on with the attitude that earned him the title of old-time liberal flake, in his seat only with the support of wealth and local state power.

One high point, when a majority of Democrats and Republicans rose to applaud the references to American progress, past and future, and the need for defense against Communism - except for Teddy, of course, but he was likely weighted-down by his deficiencies.

All in all, a good speech - normal reaction from all sides.



DEMOLIBS

Can you believe it? The Democrats, on a voice vote, castigated America for performing a nuclear weapons test, a test which is part of a program to insure that the US has an efficient and capable nuclear weapon arsenal that is constantly being upgraded.

What a sad lot - political idiots joining in a yappingly familiar chorus of &quot;Lenin Bless Amerika,&quot; and probably not even realizing it.

There are liberal Democrats crawling all over the Senate and House these days, doing what each does best - crawl!

It gives the regular Democrats a bad name.....



THE AMERICAS CUP

It&apos;s in the Australian tradition to win with flamboyance and lose with admiration for the winners - no matter how it hurts. They are very much like Americans.

The navigator of the losing Australian craft said, &quot;Dennis is 20 years older than I am and he knows things I still have to learn. He was great!&quot;

Real class....



BUSING, BUSING, BUSING..

It&apos;s irritating to pick up the siblings at Hamilton and see all the buses out in front waiting to pick up north side kids for their long trip home.

It&apos;s irritating in many ways:

Primarily, it doesn&apos;t do those kids any good to have to get up so early just for an hour&apos;s ride to school.

Any of those bused who want to participate in after-school activities must make their own arrangements for rides home in the evening. When football practice was over, my kid just had a few blocks to walk; the north siders could not get home before 8:00 pm. The busing program thrust upon us is simply not fair to those transported from that part of town.

In addition, seeing that fleet of buses, along with the buses that service Bell Junior High, with their drivers, a bus transport supervisor, one or two squads, and realizing what the daily cost must be for all schools, and knowing that all of that comes out of our taxes, is one of the biggest irritants of all.

Who are the cuckoos who got us into all this un-necessary expense? If they are still in office, why are they? Both black parents and white parents are in the majority that believes busing is a proposed solution to a contrived problem, and that busing has failed miserably to bring about its purposes - whatever they actually were apart from the liberal view that mixing the races would benefit one race during contact with another.

It didn&apos;t work; it will never work; and we have to keep paying and paying while the idiocy continues.

It&apos;s time for us to return to the concept of neighborhood schools.



LATCH-KEY KIDS

Add to that deterioration the number of kids who are too young for school, but who must stay home alone while the parents both work.

Kids left home alone get into trouble of one sort or another; I know I did once in a while when home with the luxury of solitude and no control. In my case it didn&apos;t happen often, but I managed to do enough damage; kids exposed to this freedom every day are time bombs.



EGGED ON

Did anyone notice the egg on the Ayatollah&apos;s face.

Here he invited a bunch of eager journalists to see the war, almost solely for the ploy of picking a Jewish reporter out of the group and accuse him of spying for Israel. Not a bad idea of sorts, if you&apos;re an Ayatollah in lala-land.

So he chose a WSJ reporter with the Jewish name of &apos;Seib.&apos; Here was the one who would be scapegoat for all the US-Israeli sins against Iran. And what did this paragon of Ayatollahism do? He got a Wall Street reporter from a Roman Catholic family in the heartland of the United States.

I wonder how the Holy Koran provides instruction on getting a Moslem foot extracted from a Moslem mouth - sideways, yet!

The Iranians finally let the reporter go back home, waving to him, I surmise, with the same towels with which they were wiping the yolk off their faces.

They might have kept him anyway, out of spite, but &quot;there was this massive, American task force off-shore, and, what the hey! we don&apos;t want to pick on them inasmuch as our human wave doesn&apos;t work running over seawater (I knew we should have included that Jesus guy in our pantheon).&quot;

I hope the Ayatollah understands that all his ranting and raving doesn&apos;t mean camel-dung in the face of aircraft carriers, Navy jets, and Marine combat forces.

Maybe he always thought we were kidding?



DEATH AND TAXES

And a few other tax items......

Some notes on taxes - they have us arriving, living, and leaving:

1. If you receive a $59,999 gift upon birth, it is taxed $8,200 plus 24% of the difference between 40,000 and 59,999 (59,999 - 40,000 x 24%) or $4,800, a grand total of $13,000 before you have had your first bottle of milk, leaving you a net of $46,999 to keep you in diapers. But when you grow up you will have the small satisfaction of knowing that $13,000 supported 1.35 welfare matriarchies at a rate of 9600 per annum, an average sum for this benevolence.

2. If, in your productive years, you are a single taxpayer with a taxable income of $88,270, your tax is $17,388 plus 48% of the difference between $88,270 and $59,670 (28,600 x 48% = 13,728) your total tax is $31,116, leaving you $57,154 to buy all those rich people&apos;s mansions and swimming pools and Mercedes. Of course the 31 grand taken from your hard-working efforts are supporting 3.24 welfare matriarchies getting the equivalent of $800 a month without doing a damn thing except conceiving, birthing, and collecting.

3. If, you have overcome the tax bites and saved some money, when you die you will pay, on an estate of $499,999, the sum of $70,800 plus 34% of the difference between $499,999 and $250,000 (499,999 - 250,000 x 34%), or $85,000. $70,800 + $85,000 = $155,000, leaving your heirs a grand total of $344,999 to be divided, along with the knowledge that in your final exit you will support, allowing for 15% inflation, at $920 at month, the equivalent of 14 welfare matriarchies as you pass into the great beyond.

(Those were from the Federal rate tables; Wisconsin hasn&apos;t even been included; it was too dismal, but there is talk of change)

4. State motor vehicle fees:

License: Auto is $25 + $10 for personalized plate; Small truck is $30; Semi Tractor and Trailer, 80,000 lbs, is $1700 (not enough in my opinion); Motor cycles and mopeds are $7.00. Semi-trailers have a $50 registration fee.

5. Wisconsin ranks 11th in tax per capita, just under Maryland and above Michigan, and 7th per $1000 of personal income, just under Vermont and just above Utah.

6. OK, let&apos;s include the Wisconsin Inheritance Tax rate anyway: Over the personal exemption of $50,000, on 50 to 100 thousand the tax is 7.5%; on 100 to 500 thousand the tax is 10%; over 500 thousand the tax is 25%; all of these apply to lineal descendants. If you happen to be other than direct lineal, then the tax ranges from 7.5% to 20%; if you happen to have been a friend of the deceased receiving a bequest, it&apos;s a straight 20%.

7. The new W-4 form released is to be filled out by taxpayers. All those filled out correctly will have the names dropped into a hat and one blindly chosen. This taxpayer will be the new head of the IRS.

8. Refunds of Federal Income Taxes are not considered taxable income. Neither is the State refund - maybe.

9. Quote: &quot;Gross income less adjustments equals adjusted gross income&quot;

10. Non-deductible contributions: Gifts to relatives or friends including needy or worthy individuals; contributions to labor unions; donated blood; tuition or amounts in place of tuition, even though paid for children attending parochial school.

11. Various other federal taxes:

Social Security: 14.3%; Self-Employed - 12.3%

Liquor: $12.50 per proof gallon.

Wine: still wines per gallon,&lt;14% alcohol - 17 cents; 14 to 21% alcohol - 67 cents; 22 to 24% alcohol - $2.25; champagnes&amp;similar - #3.40; artificially carbonated, $2.40; Liqueurs and cordials - $1.92. Beer: $9 per barrel, except that breweries making less than two million barrels a year are taxed $7 on the first 60,000 barrels. Cigarettes: 16 cents per pack of 20. Cigars: Those weighing less than 3 lbs per 1000 is 75 cents per thousand; on those weighing more the tax is 8% of the wholesale price, but not more than $20 per thousand.

Snuff: 24 cents a pound.

Gasoline: 9 cents a gallon.

Diesel: 15 cents a gallon.

Aviation fuel: 12 to 14 cents a gallon.

Firearms&amp;ammo: 10 to 11% of selling price.

Fishing equipment, bows, arrows, etc: 10 to 11% of selling price.

Communications: 3% of bill.

Airline transportation: 8% of fare + $3 if international.

Truck use tax: 55,000 to 75,000 lbs is $100 per year plus $22 per 1000 pounds or fraction thereof over 55,000 lbs. Over 75,000 lbs - $550 per year.

Coal sales: 55 cents to $1.10 per ton sold.

Crude oil windfall profit: 22.5% to 70% of profit.

Private foundations: 2% of net investment income.

Wagering tax: 2% of amount wagered.

12. Various state and local taxes:

Liquor and wine: 25 cents to $3.25 per gallon.

Cigarettes: 25 cents a pack.

Other tobacco products: 20% of manufacturer&apos;s list price.

Beer: $12 per barrel.

Motor fuels: 17.5 cents per gallon.

Aviation fuels: 6 cents per gallon.

Then there are various state taxes on such items as mink farms, coal dock operators, insurance, iron and steel, petroleum products, grain storage, forest crop and woodland, minerals, bingo (2%), and boxing (5%).

Hiding in the legislative weeds are such local options such as Room Tax (as a percent of charge, with no limit) and a county sales tax of .5% - wait for it!

These will be in addition to the present 5% sales tax.

Include in these the present Real Estate Transfer tax, unknown to most until you buy your first house. It is 30 cents per thousand (.3%) of the value of the property transferred. It doesn&apos;t seem like much, but the 1985 - 1986 collections were $17,990,000 dollars

13. Conclusion:

Pay every cent you owe for taxes, but not one cent over. Take advantage of every legal deduction, and make sure they are legal.

14. Smile, but if you can&apos;t, stop voting for those liberal proponents of tax and spend - getting rid of them can only help.

Pre - April 15th comments!



LIBERALS&amp;UNIONS

The unholy pair, as usual....... along with taxes and production.

It has been said that when a great Republic arrives to the point where it is taxing its citizens at a rate of more than 38% of their income, it begins a period of deterioration, inasmuch as those who must work spend their efforts providing for and supporting those who will not.

We are getting closer to that critical level.

Even worse, we have just elected a Congress in which the Democrats control both houses, and will make the attempt to spend our nation into oblivion, cutting back needed defense programs, cutting back or trying to cancel the flow of funds to our non-communist allies everywhere except Egypt and Israel, especially the funds badly needed by the Contras fighting against the communists in Central America.

But just watch those Demos deftly pass on the pork to their constituencies, a strictly businesslike procedure of funds and services in exchange for welfare votes. That is, when they have times-out from their phony Iran/Contra show, which is a contrived vulgarity with which they hope to influence the elections in 1988.

The union actions assured that the US would be out-priced in the world markets because of their outrageous annual wage demands, a war on society&apos;s producers which led to the dissolution of many businesses and light&amp;heavy industry plants, as a result of their more-more-more tactics, and now they are trying to blame a conservative administration for past union follies.

Between the unions and the tax-spend liberals, inflation and interest rates exceeded 22% under the last Demolib president; because of liberal philosophy, about half the tax proceeds go to the social-welfare programs. In spite of that, because of this president&apos;s policies, the interest and inflation rates are extremely low, business is up and gross national is up.

Yet, we have those big-mouths like Rudy Kuzel in Kenosha saying the union would rather close the plant than accede to wages set by the owners, just because he wants to sledgehammer his way into controlling whether or not that AMC will get new business allowing it to survive. It is a microcosmic example of the tactics used by the overall union leadership that brought this country

into a non-competitive status in the world market, the union rationale of greed over all.

We can pass non-restrictive trade laws to put our trading relationships with other nations on a fair basis; however, it is the Kuzels and other trade union leaders of the country that are its greatest economic danger, not the overseas manufacturers. The Kuzels have brought to us the concept of 8 hours a day and damn the quality or output. AMC has always been known as a sweet vacation retreat, a nice place where good union members could spend a quiet day, have a little fun, and, if a few cars got built, that was great too, but don&apos;t depend on it. Not my opinion, that last, but the words of some acquaintances who were AMC employees, now retired. They told a number of tragi-comic stories of shoddy construction, parts falling off, and the contempt of the employees for the product.

Unfortunate.

Our country was once known for its prowess in new ideas, in research, design, and development, its energies and abilities to produce. We must not allow the union/Democrat/liberal attitude to stop us from again achieving that status.

It is fortunate for the nation that the president has veto power, even if not line-item veto power. It&apos;s the only weapon against the coming attacks on our collective pocketbooks.



ONCE BURNED...

There was a fellow named Joe McCarthy, who nobody seemed to like except the anti-communists of the country. He was a senator from Wisconsin who got sick one day, went to the Naval Hospital where he seemed to die mysteriously.

When it was time for President Reagan to have his latest operation, his wife Nancy made certain that responsibility for the president&apos;s health was in private hands.

Not a bad move!



AIR BATTLES

In the days of the Korean troubles, good R&amp;R meant a trip to Japan for a weekend. I remember watching Japanese kids and adults flying what they called real kites, not the traditional diamond shape, or even box type, but kites in all sorts of designs and colors.

The more interesting were those called &apos;fighting kites,&apos; in the shape of dragons and tigers, which were used to combat other kites, attacking them in the shy and trying to disable them so as to emerge victorious.

One I recall was a black dragon kite which ate up all the rest; Charley Brown&apos;s kite eating tree wouldn&apos;t have stood a chance!

It would have ended up as chop sticks.



200 YEARS?

I don&apos;t think that a unique political system such as we have in the United States is truly a Democracy - it is a Republic.

But in any case, do you know of any Democracy/Republic like America&apos;s that has actually lasted 200 years? Lots of nations are older than that, but have any been Democracies? Most have been Royal, Dictatorial, Feudal, Tribal, and the like, and many still are. I do not include Switzerland in the group because of size and topology, although they may be eligible for the 200 year class as an aberrant example.

The 38% figure was not mine, and I forgot who first quoted it.



AMERIKAN IDIOT

In the rag this morning, Kris Kristofferson said he took the part in Amerika to make sure a left-wing representative was in a lead role so that it would negate a right-wing approach to the series. What a simpleton, a generational son of the Hollywood 10.



SPOKEN LIKE

Spoken like a true union believer!

When the good times rolled, the unions sent wages through the roof in an inflation spiral. When foreign countries undersold us, it was the fault of management. When inflation drops, as has happened, inflated wages should also drop to reflect the economic climate. If workers refuse to accept re-adjustment of wages to match deflation, and go on strike, then management should have the right to replace them so as not to be blackmailed into operating at a loss. If a company must cut costs in order to stay alive, then it has the right to ask for wage cuts. If the workers refuse to lower rates in exchange for continuation of their jobs, they are free to go elsewhere.

Simple and logical.



TWO-WAY

Perhaps it may become apparent to you that you may not have the capacity to even carry it, much less drop it. You may be entering a battle of wits with a minimum of armament.

You could start out by explaining your use of the term &apos;double standard hypocrisy&apos; if you feel like it, or not if you don&apos;t.

Either side of your mouth will do; singly or simultaneously.

(just keep it relatively clean - no doltish perverted description or accusation allowed in the name-calling)



OH YOU SIBS!

Sib #2: (fortissimo) Where the heck is my tape player?

Mother: Speak a little lower young man!

Sib #2: (fortissimo) Where the heck is my tape player?*



(* two octaves lower)

you can&apos;t win, but you can&apos;t get mad either.....



ANY EXCUSE WILL DO!

What happened was this!

A man with a knife was terrorizing some people in an area of Tampa. The police arrived and struggled with the man; one officer got a choke hold on the man who still fought the policeman. Unfortunately for the would-be killer, he died from his struggles.

Next, the black community of Tampa heard that a white policeman had killed a black with a &apos;choke hold.&apos; Like Pavlov&apos;s dogs salivating at whistle-time, blacks poured out on the streets and did their customary looting and destroying until more police arrived to quell the rioters. This went on for two nights.

Is the action of a rational group of people that when they chant they shall overcome, does it mean by force?

And does it mean that they would overcome and destroy whitey by force if they had the numbers and means?

You better believe it.

These are the same people who denigrate white activities in South Africa but sit back and smile when Tutu devine says there will be violence against whites.

The sad part concerns all the blacks who distance themselves from that type of social disorganization but are still lumped with those who act as though they just jumped out of the jungle.

It&apos;s a shame.

If this thought outrages you, just think when it last was that whites in this nation went out on a rampage, burning and looting, simply because a white man was killed while in a struggle with the police.

I&apos;ll bet every shyster in Tampa is licking his lips, hoping he will be the one to try the case against the city and the killer cop, who deliberately slew an innocent black who was only using the knife to clean his finger nails.

Yet another black family man was killed and his wife robbed here in our city yesterday. Nobody but a few of us seems to care about that. It was black on black, and no big money suit is in the offing, so forget it, right?

Comment if you wish - I&apos;m still mad about it.....



IN THIS WORLD

The world owes no one a job or a living. Those who want to work at a given plant must work at levels set by management. They don&apos;t have to accept the terms of employment; they have the option to move on to another job. If it&apos;s the only job in town, and they want it, let them play by the rules of the company. Any union that thinks it arrogantly can come in to set company policy should be stopped cold.

Speaking of thugs, I haven&apos;t seen management people trying to browbeat job-seekers, beating up anyone they can to throw a scare into potential new workers, shooting holes through some poor lady&apos;s window, or burning up a hotel and killing a hundred or so people.

Who could it have been? Some disgruntled company vice president?

Or some union bully-boys? One guess!



MORE ON MEIR

Some friendly quotes from some of Rabbi Meir Kahane&apos;s latest talks in the US and Canada:

&quot;We must raise money for a new Israeli underground that must be ready to strike our enemies wherever they threaten us.&quot;

&quot;We have been losers for centuries. Now we are winners, and I don&apos;t care whether the world likes it or not.&quot;

&quot;We must guard our strength and increase it every day. And the best way to show strength is direct action: Hit your enemies before they hit you.&quot;

&quot;Advocates of American even-handedness in foreign policy are a menace to Israel that must be exterminated.&quot; (On his list are several Arab nationalist groups and right-wing news magazines who have said we should treat all middle east nations in the same even-handed manner. He attacked them as &quot;anti-Israeli, amplifiers of Arab arguments, and spear carriers of Arab attacks on Israel.&quot;)

Responses:

Intelligence and security specialists at the United Nations who have ignored Kahane in the past said they are concerned about his latest efforts to develop a terrorist network.

&quot;If this man ever targeted me for a hit, I think I&apos;d move, &quot; said a UN aide with responsibility for protecting Arab UN delegates. &quot;When this man talks of &apos;hitting adversaries&apos; he is as menacing as any gangster. This man means murder.&quot;

&quot;It seems absurd, senseless, but in reality it Demonstrates the pervasive infiltration of the White House by Israeli agents, many of whom got their start in politics as terrorist hitmen. Their latest victim seems to have been the credibility and international standing of the Reagan administration itself, &quot; said the deputy chief of a Persian Gulf nation&apos;s UN mission.

Incidentally, Meir Kahane, although representing and serving in the parliament of a foreign nation, has successfully retained his US citizenship, thus enjoying the status of being a citizen of both the US and Israel.

How can we permit this?

My position is that one is either a citizen of the US or a citizen of a foreign country, but should not be allowed to hold both citizenships simultaneously.

If an American citizen tried also to obtain German citizenship, and be elected to the Bundestag representing Bavaria, there would be an uproar so loud it would shake the northeast coast, and much of it from the same sources who see nothing wrong with Kahane and other Israelis holding dual citizenship. There would be headlines in Kirkland&apos;s Jerusalem Post.

The question is, should dual citizenships be allowed?



LOYALTY

Dual citizenship implies dual loyalty, taxes notwithstanding.

And can there be dual loyalty? When there is friction between the nations to which is an individual is citizen, to which nation does he cleave?

My position is that one is a citizen of one nation, the nation to whom he wishes to owe his allegiance. How can Meir Kahane stand up and recite the Pledge of Allegiance before the US flag and also recite Israel&apos;s version of the Pledge before the Israeli flag, and be sincere in both efforts.

No way!

I read Kahane&apos;s remarks that simply because of religion, Jews in the US should give up their homes and jobs here and move to Israel - just because they are Jewish. Does he think because I&apos;m Catholic I should pack up and move to the Vatican?

I think the Jewish response to his call is going to be one of supreme indifference. The vast majority of us are Americans first, regardless of religion, and won&apos;t heed the cracked cranial cry of the half-baked idealist who has a number of screws loose.



ONE AT A TIME

We agree with the one country at a time citizenship proposal. And with regard to those with permanent residence status, they don&apos;t feel second class (those I know) by any means. In the US they have the right to work and pay taxes and succeed even as any natural born citizen.

To amplify on the dual citizenship pitfall: Tonight in the Journal, Jonathan Pollard, the Israeli spy who always stated his loyalties were to Israel, said also he was absolutely loyal to the US. This ambivalence must have driven the poor guy paranoid. One of his statements was that he couldn&apos;t see why the US Navy didn&apos;t turn secret and classified information on Arab forces and movements over to Israel, even though it&apos;s a foreign government.

Think of how he was torn between what he probably felt was a deep loyalty to the United States and a deep sympathy towards Israel; he possibly didn&apos;t feel that he was being disloyal to this country because of his ties with the other.

I think this situation best illustrates my concerns on holding dual citizenship, and even though Pollard was convicted as an Israeli spy, I still have to consider the pressures exerted by nation/nation/religion to which he was subject.

The act of releasing secret information to a foreign government cannot be dismissed; thousands of documents were involved, some of which may have found their way into soviet hands; however, it is easy to see how he may have been led into the path of espionage by agents playing on his emotional qualities dealing with faith, and his desire to protect the historical homeland of that faith.

Many of those coerced into espionage have been led down the garden path for significantly less noble reasons.

Note: I think that in spite of dual citizenship, if one joins the military service of a foreign country he can lose his American citizenship. But I&apos;m not sure.

And, they had Jonathan Pollard&apos;s wife on 60 minutes for an interview segment, discussing the two spies&apos; upcoming sentencing for espionage.

Talk about arrogance!

Her view was that the US was wrong in not turning over American secrets to the Israelis, so that&apos;s why they did it. No shame, no compunctions, no feeling that she was an American, it was all for Israel.

Her biggest complaint was over the three months she spent in jail, and how the others called her a no-good traitor, among other things. She said she didn&apos;t see anything wrong in what she and her husband had done - after all they weren&apos;t doing it for money - except for the $2500 a month and the $7000 diamond and emerald ring she herself got, and the trips to Israel and Europe, none of that entered into it.

Mike Wallace sure handled her gently, with kid gloves; if it would have been someone like Jack Kemp&apos;s wife, or Nancy Reagan, no holds would have been barred.

She said she thinks that they both had been set up by Dirty Rafi Eitan, the infamous Mossad spymaster, but couldn&apos;t give a good reason why he may have done so. I was waiting for her to blame the whole thing on Reagan.

I hope the Judge gives them 30 days.

And then executes them!



HESS

Rudolph Hess is still in Spandau Prison, under control of the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, which raises some questions....

Why are they keeping in prison the only German who escaped from Nazi control and tried to see Churchill to end the war?

Why is he allowed to write his memoirs in periodic spurts, only to see what he&apos;s written confiscated and destroyed by the Soviets?

Why are the Soviets so intent on keeping this old man, never described as a &apos;war criminal,&apos; in prison for life?

What secrets does Hess know that would embarrass governments, namely the governments of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union?

After Hess parachuted onto English soil in the early part of the war, and his identity and aims were established, why did not Churchill meet with Hess and receive the argument Hess brought which may have shortened the war?

Don&apos;t hang by your thumbs until you get answers from Britain or the Soviets.



REAGAN&apos;S SPEECH

I liked it, but I think he admitted to too much culpability.

I would have stone-walled until all jackson broke loose!

(Brokaw almost had an orgasm when Strauss, the Democrat, praised Reagan as he did, and voiced the opinion that Demo and Repub alike wanted the Pres to succeed. They cut to Brokaw unexpectedly at intervals, and the Brokaw scowl was very much in evidence. All in all, I think Reagan learned what Nixon did too late - you can&apos;t please your enemies no matter how you try, and his talk reflected that. I know that Donaldson, Rather, and the rest of that media gloom-crew were really irritated that the president showed his usual vigor and command; it took away their chance to be presidents by proxy. Tough luck, you patrons of primordial ooze)



MORNING AFTER

All of the president&apos;s mouth-foam critics snarled with one voice right up to last night. The only thing they wanted was for the president to admit his mistakes, grovel a little bit, and all would be well. So his enemies said, and a few of his &apos;friends.&apos;

As I said before, you can&apos;t please an enemy short of suicide.

No sooner was the broadcast over when the pathetic jackels of the media and the congress began their heel-nipping all over again, and in the Sentinel this morning, the next movement of the orchestrated chorus of kooks began with, well, why didn&apos;t he tell us about the money to the contras, and who got it?

Typical liberal loony-tunes logic.

Well, the prez didn&apos;t grovel and he didn&apos;t apologize; it&apos;s difficult for some of the knee-jerk politicians of the left to realized that when an action is undertaken by a man of basic integrity which he feels is the correct action for a given purpose, and it goes wrong, that doesn&apos;t imply requirement of an ipso facto admission that the objective was wrong, even if it was not successful.

Basic to the liberal philosophy is the tenet of switching viewpoints at the drop of a eyebrow from the ADA or the New Republic, without the slightest qualm, for fear of retribution from the left - at least on the hill and inside the beltline.

Take Wisconsin&apos;s Les Aspin who flipped in accordance with the liberal flops of the congress; he got his wrist slapped, but later was elected committee chairman when he promised to be a good little Democrat hack and follow the lead of the Kennedys and Leahys on defense and contra-aid issues.

He could have said:

&quot;When it comes to the defense of the US against Communism wherever it threatens us, no matter what constraints you liberal hacks want to put on it, I will promote it. If you don&apos;t want to vote me in as chairman, so be it. I&apos;m for strong military defense, and if funds must be voted to defend against Communism in an threatening situation then I&apos;ll vote for them no matter what the Demolib party line happens to be.&quot;

Did he do that?

No, he just set another D.C. waffling record in the coelenterate finals.

But back to the enemies subject......

Byrd-droppings from the majority leader were predictable, and in tune with the Demolib libretto, on the same &apos;why didn&apos;t he tell us about the money&apos; theme. You will hear variations on that lyric for the next few months, right up to about 1996 when it may be time for the Demos to dig up Herbert Hoover to run against again.

My advice to the president?

Damn the mosquitoes, full speed ahead.

And let Baker use the Yard Guard when necessary to keep down the media and congressional insects.

(Too bad about Aspin&apos;s being weighed in the balance and found wanton; there were times when I thought he might switch parties because of his conflict with the left on issues of national defense. Turns out he would rather toady than fight. It may help Wisconsin in some respect to have him on the committee, but that help may turn out to be using the AMC plant to make replacement parts for Sandinista equipment. It would serve them right)



COOLER HEADS

Those may prevail in the AMC negotiations. The union biggies have muzzled Kuzel and reset the union-management talks on new jobs for the Kenosha area.

That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about - whether the people of the area will have the opportunity to work, or whether the thick-headed AMC locals will close the plant before coming to an agreement.

I remember my contacts with AMC in the past. When visiting the plant to look at an assembly line, I was told that there was one union steward for every twenty five workers at the time; all the stewards seemed to do was stand around and drink coffee, and make sure no one worked too fast.

While I was there observing the body line, four stewards came over and demanded to know what I was doing there, what was I looking at, what changes was management contemplating, and where I was from. I told them to shove it, whereupon they retired to an adjacent area and tried the old evil eye technique. It didn&apos;t work; they had come up against a superior evil eye.

In any case, some will say that the problems stems from the company demanding give-backs from the employees. Based on my observations in five visits to the plant, if the company offer were based on actual productive output by the AMC workers, it would not have come up to minimum wage.

In fact, the union stewards would have had to pay to &apos;work&apos; there.

Anyway, for the sake of those in the AMC area who really want and need a job, I hope the International is smarter than the local - then again, it has to be.



LESSONS OF NAM

On 20/20 last evening, Bud McFarland and his wife were being interviewed by Baba Walters, and he seemed to come off rather well. His attempt at suicide, so he said, was based on what he felt was his absolute failure to head off the Iran-Contra situation. He had taken the entire blame for the situation on his own shoulders and couldn&apos;t handle it.

But the most important point, almost lost in the discussion, was when the motives and activities of Lt. Col. North were touched upon.

McFarland said that the actions of North, and perhaps Poindexter, might have grown out of the trauma of the Viet Nam war; that is, it was a war where we had promised funding, support, and arms to those who were fighting after the congress forced a withdrawal of American military personnel.

We had promised help to the South Viets!

But the liberals had their own way in the end, aided and abetted by the vicious voices of the media, who hammered away at convincing Americans that the war was a lost cause.

And it turned out to be a lost cause only because those congressional and media cowards pressured a retreat in a war where we were not allowed to win. The north did not even come to the Paris peace table until Nixon went against the liberal &apos;wisdom&apos; and mined the harbors of Haiphong and Hanoi, cutting off the supply lines. This so upset the liberal left that they brought about the surrender by proxy in the south.

Craven bastards!

McFarland felt that Col. North was trying to ensure that we would not make promises to another group of people fighting for Democracy in their own country and then fail to keep them, just as the Demo-libs are trying to do right now. A plan to utilize surplus funds from an arms sale, and using then for the contras, may have been North&apos;s plan to keep the Demo-lib cowards from causing a surrender to Communism in Nicaragua.

These funds, along with private funds, may have kept the contras alive - figuratively and literally.

However, at this time, I don&apos;t really know if Ollie North did in fact channel arms-sale funds to the contras. I just hope he did, if that was what was needed to keep them going.

Also revealed by McFarland that President Nixon paid him a visit in the hospital to reassure him that even the greatest of crises were resolvable if met in strong fashion, and that he should continue to live for himself and his family. Fine gesture on Nixon&apos;s part, another individual who was fatally battered by a combination of liberal/leftist congressional and media jackels.



REACTION

In the aftermath of the Pollard case, NBC journalist Martin Fletcher was interviewing Israeli citizens on the street about the situation, asking a group where mistakes, if any, were made.

Just at the end of the interview, as though it were skipped over, one Israeli said, &quot;The mistake was in getting caught.&quot;

Not only that, but the Israeli government took a slap at the US by promoting Pollard&apos;s control, an officer in their air force, to command of a major Israeli air base.

As Illinois representative Henry Hyde said, &quot;Let&apos;s stop treating Israel as though they were the 51st state.&quot;

Let&apos;s face it, Israel is a &apos;friend&apos; of the United States only as long as the dollars flow from Washington to Tel Aviv, and as long as they are allowed to pressure Americans of Jewish faith to contribute to the various Israeli money drains.

American Jews have enough problems without having their funds drained by the Israeli bloodsuckers under the guise of supporting a foreign government.....

Note: The first thing that Pollard&apos;s wife screamed out after the sentences was &apos;anti-semitism.&apos; That just won&apos;t wash as a justification for turning over to Israel 360 cubic feet of American secret documents. My question is this: it would seem that Pollard was only one phase of a very sophisticated Israeli spy network in this country, so why are we not investigating this situation as thoroughly as, say, the Iran-Contra affair; or is the Iran-Contra affair contrived to take the heat off Israel? But perhaps not; Israel&apos;s part in the Iran-Contra situation was one of initial instigator, and maybe ultimate profiteer.

So far, the Israeli part has been ignored by all the networks except as an extremely casual afterthought. Even on the McNeill-Lehrer news hour, as soon as one of the interviewees mentioned the name of Israel, he was cut off by Lehrer and the subject was never brought up again.

The Israeli apologists and their PR groups, professional and amateur, are in full swing throughout the TV, radio, and print media, singing the praises of Israeli/US friendship, and seemingly making every effort to see that the full scope of Israeli treachery will be suppressed. The theme is that if you dislike Israel you are anti-semitic and dislike all Jews. It is a dastardly concept and will not work this time.

Some have said that Israel has a shadow presence in the Congress of the United States because of the vast amounts of money they have caused to be given to the campaigns of those they considered &apos;friends&apos; of Israel. If this is true, and indications are that Israel does indeed have more clout than any other foreign country.

Just ask John McCloskey, ex-senator Fulbright, Adlai Stevenson, Charles Percy, John Finley, and any number of ex-senators and representatives what happened when they questioned our unbalanced treatment of Israel. Why are we allowing it to happen? Is it the power of the Israeli purse that brings this about?

Many of the liberals elected to the US congress were helped by Israeli funding. Most of these same congressmen are against aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters, complaining that we have said we were giving them 100 million dollars in aid. There have been years in which we have given Israel over seven billion dollars in aid, with no return. That&apos;s only 70 times as much as the Contras were reluctantly voted.

The Pollards were being paid for their spying activities with funds given to Israel by the United States. The Israeli air force spymaster was rewarded by being given command of an air base built by funds from the United States. Israel has a substantial supply of nuclear weapons produced as a result of funds and data given to them by the United States.

The US has supported this beggar nation for years; when will we stop? The canard that we need them in the middle east is wearing thin, but they will drain our resources until we catch on. Maybe that process has begun with the Pollard case, and will be finalized when Israel&apos;s part in the Iran/Contra affair is fully known.

Let&apos;s hope so.

(Get ready for a flood of anti-German re-runs, new movies, and TV shows in the wake of Pollard/Iran/Contra, all telling us about the holocaust and other Israeli guilt-builders; why don&apos;t they tell about the 13 million Christians that were killed in WW II? Maybe they don&apos;t count)



A BRIEF RESPONSE

Ever the essence of liberal thought (even though somewhat moderate at times) is to wax holy when the right or the military are concerned, but to wink and skip where the Demolib left is concerned - such as the criminal wrongdoing by Geraldine Ferraro in her flouting of the ethics laws in which she was let off scott free - in spite of her crimes.

However, to balance this travesty, George Hansen, conservative representative, was prosecuted under those exact same laws and sentenced to prison, even after he had proved he had no knowledge of any purposeful crime. Immediately after his sentencing, 86% of the congress changed their records to reflect an accommodation with the law, with no retribution following.

A common criminal is one who commits common crimes. Neither description fits Richard Nixon nor Oliver North. Nixon covered up for his friends in the Watergate affair, who were trying to pinpoint that McGovern and the Demos were getting contributions from the Castro camp, which conventional opinion says they were. North was trying to keep the anti-communist Contra movement from being crushed by the marxists in Nicaragua.

Do you think it would have been proper for Democrat party to have received clandestine funds from Castro? Do you feel it was improper to have tried opening relations with Iran, working or not? Is it a bad thing to try getting rid of the communist abcess in Nicaragua?

Are those sane policies? Well, sanity is still a matter of event perspective, with differing interpretations from the left, center, and right; I prefer the center-right definitions - common sensical versus uncommonly nonsensical. (You should hear me when I&apos;m not brief)



THE UNION

Do you feel that the union should hold out to the bitter end, holding tenaciously onto their stance even if a Chrysler or a Jeep line is lost forever, and workers lose jobs?

Or do you think the company should give in to the union demands even if it means operating the plant at a loss. (I didn&apos;t say the answer would be easy)



YOU REACTIONARY!

Like they say, you can always tell a liberal, but you cannot tell him much; but, keep arguing anyway.



PHONY DUE PROCESS

Another topic again raising its ugly head is the attempts by the left to promote the so-called Genocide Treaty. What is it for? Well, for the first time (if passed in the US) it would allow a US citizen to be taken out of the country and prosecuted by another country if the citizen broke any of a number of rules not having much to do with genocide.

Example: One of the provisions is that saying something bad about an entire group would be punishable. So if a writer said the Soviet Union is evil, he would be subject to extradition for penalty. If a broadcaster stated that the sham Zimbabwe government was a farce (which it is), then he could be taken there for punitive action. If a magazine editor said that the Indian government was racked with corruption (which it is), then he could be jailed in Delhi.

Is it the American way to have our people under the thumb of some foreign government? I think not, and any of our congressman that votes for the Genocide Convention would not have the rights of Americans in mind. If the nonsense were passed, Nicaragua and Cuba would be the first to try American citizens that said things the two commie lands didn&apos;t like. The nasty forces in the world are ever trying to erode the bastion of liberty; this is just another of their insidious plays for power.



POSITIONS

I understand that when someone lacks either facts or ability they fall back on innuendo, and you have fallen back so many times it&apos;s a wonder you get anywhere walking (and thinking) backwards all of the time.

Let&apos;s take a few of your labored points for answer:

The first rule of government is for that government to survive. This means having the brains and foresight to know the enemy. The Soviet Union is the evil force behind most of the international problems of the world today, and has set up bases in Cuba, tried to in Grenada, and are trying to in Nicaragua. They must be stopped from expanding their totalitarian activities.

Nicaragua, in the person of the puppet president there, offered nothing. The aim of the revolution was to overthrow Somoza and bring peace and democracy to Nicaragua; they brought marxist-leninist Communism for themselves and are trying to bring it to their neighbors - along with the peace of the grave.

I feel that most of the US citizens know that the Soviet Union is the real enemy no matter what passes for government in Nicaragua. If you don&apos;t realize it then you&apos;re naive, perhaps deliberately so. Joe McCarthy, one of your whipping boys, said there were communists in the state department, and he was correct; now it seems there are communist sympathizers in the congress but we&apos;re too blase to call them to account.

Reagan is still the president no matter how you feel about it. If he wants to visit any place in the world he should be free to do it without having to listen to all the furor from the worlds special interest groups. If you can&apos;t accept the idea of his doing so, too bad.......you still have your Carter vote to keep you warm.

The war was over in 1945, 40 years ago, but we still see those who were too weak to resist actively charging us to continue a punishment. Baloney! It&apos;s over!

There was an interesting AP story in the paper last saturday. It said that there were 525,000 Jews in Germany in 1933, and that some 300,000 fled to escape the nazi terror, with almost all the rest being sent to concentration camps, about 225,00. Even now the West German police are protecting the Jewish schools and synagogues. What are the Soviets doing?

Your implications concerning Germans, neo-nazis, and facism are the wanderings of an inadequate mind. Since you&apos;ve been on the boards you have constantly identified with the far left and the communist way, and it would seem that you prefer the Soviet system to Reagan and the American system.

About those neo-nazi groups, the thing about the US that you always forget is that this is a free society, and any group that stays legal has to right to think what they want to think, right or wrong, no matter how it is where you came from. You mentioned that a large American-Nazi group is based in Milwaukee; they can&apos;t be too large or visible if most of us haven&apos;t heard of them.

To reiterate, I feel that America is best served by having a strong defense capability, and should have the moral resolve to continue the fight against totalitarian Communism, especially in this hemisphere.

We in the US have a dual obligation; we have to control the communist aggression against us and our friends on one hand, and we have to resist the communist party line by the subversives in this country, where our very freedom makes their clandestine and overt work easy.

And don&apos;t use the Jews as a club in your discussions; they have enough trouble without your adding to it.



BETRAYERS?

What can we call persons who put politics ahead of national security for the sake of their own gains? In the US congress there are a number of these ad hoc turncoats who think only of their party instead of the future well being of the United States.

Most obvious of these pink blowhards is Congressman Tipsy O&apos;neil, who seems more at home visiting the Kremlin than he does in Washington. He and his party, along with a few renegade Republicans, are using obstructionist tactics to kill aid to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua. The latest from these dovecote dolts is that they would allow non-military supplies to the fighters. Isn&apos;t that generous! Then when the marxist-communist armies of Managua attack, the contras can beat them back with pillows and blankets.

If the fathers of the American revolution are watching these cowards in action they must be sad; it&apos;s always been said that America can only beat itself from within. Korea, South Viet Nam, and now Central America may be indicating the truth of that statement. What country needs clandestine traitors when they have people like O&apos;neil and his gang to carry the communist ball. It&apos;s bad enough to have a nation betrayed; it&apos;s even worse when the process is visible, and done by congressional vote.



VOICE OF THE TURKEYS

It&apos;s a sight I hadn&apos;t seen since the democrat Viet Nam fiasco. Remember that one, where the inept demos couldn&apos;t finish what they started, then waited for a Republican administration to get in so they could vote down military and economic aid to South Viet Nam, thus letting the communists take over there, while our people were forced to depart ignominiously?

Well, it&apos;s springtime, and the voice of the turkeys are again heard in the land. On the tube are visible the hordes of unemployed, benefit-drawing unwashed carrying their posters and chanting simplistic slogans, while on camera, that is. Of course the straight people have to work, and do not have time for that nonsense.

It doesn&apos;t matter what the cause happens to be: Central America, Investments in South Africa (peculiar that those in favor of the entire US divesting itself of South African holdings usually don&apos;t have a dime&apos;s worth of any kind of stocks or bonds), anything that doesn&apos;t conform with the left-wing line of the day.

Remember: Ho-Ho-Ho Chi Min? Now it&apos;s tougher because they haven&apos;t found anything to sound alliterative with Ortega or Gorbechev. Too bad.

The latest trail of sleaze is being left by the same bunch protesting the Reagan&apos;s visit to a cemetery, aided and abetted by the TV and print media people. NBC slipped up friday, however. They showed a picture of a nasty SS man&apos;s tombstone for effect: it said born 1927, died 1944. That SS man must have done a lot of evil in 17 years.

Do I condone the nazi terrors? Of course not. But war dead are war dead, and visiting their graves is not to be construed as advocating their actions or philosophy, especially after 40 years has passed. Hitler was a leader inevitably installed by the events of the first world war, and both stupid and brilliant in his rise to power; his path was parallel to that of Joseph Stalin, except that Stalin was responsible for more than 13 million deaths in his tenure.

Both the nazi system of Hitler and the communist system of Stalin should be condemned because of their common totalitarianist government. Hitler was appropriately defeated, eliminated, and his system destroyed. The marchers seem unanimous in agreeing it should have happened that way. Why don&apos;t they seem to feel the same way about the Stalinist communist system still active today?

CUT TO THE QUICK

I&apos;m sure your party was cut to quick, saying no one should blindly support any leader; but, when your demos blindly supported Franklin Roosevelt, the people got the following:

More socialistic programs than in all of American history.

Thrust into WWII when FDR, to satisfy the foreign banking house interests, allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to take place when he knew a day in advance it was coming.

Were sold out, along with eastern Europe, when FDR, aided by his communist helper, Alger Hiss, let the Soviet Union gain tremendous amounts of territory they didn&apos;t deserve.

The list of nefarious deeds by FDR is too long to be posted here; the most positive accomplishment of Roosevelt&apos;s life was his leaving it, albeit much too late. Had Harry Truman been President during the Yalta conspiracy, the face of Europe today would be much changed, and for the better.



PERSUASIONS

Your points are well taken concerning the crossing of voting lines on various issues, and of course many local factors impact on the yea or nay of a given vote.

The fact is that there really are no democrats or republicans any more; there are liberals and conservatives. No one could objectively call Lowell Weiker a republican unless tongue in cheek, much less a conservative; he is another flaming liberal in wolf&apos;s clothing. The boll weevils (bless their hearts) are named democrat, but are conservative in philosophy.

The party labels today are a sham; the only accurate division is liberal and conservative, with local issues causing sometime cross-overs.

Concerning your thoughts on the limitation of terms. I think the founding fathers in their wisdom sought the very situation that exists today in the relationship of house and senate. The senior body, the senate, considers decisions more in the long term than not, or at least have the ability to do so. With the longer term they can vote for a good bill, party notwithstanding, in the knowledge that their more vocal constituents will forget over the long haul.

The house, with its two year term, tends to reflect the immediate situation, or would if, as was rightly stated, they didn&apos;t spend 90% of their time running for re-election. My view is that, politics aside, the house should be elected for a single four year term. No second term unless another is between. This probably would be more reflective of the immediate wishes of the electorate. No worrying about re-election - just do your legislative work.

One last note, I feel the President should be given the right of line veto, just as our Governor has. Certainly there would be wailing on the left as to how Reagan would use it, but there would be equivalent wailing on the right in future years with a democrat in that office.

And, what do you think of legislation that would gently pressure every eligible voter to vote, with some sort of incentive to do so, such as an income tax benefit of say fifty dollars? Perhaps if everyone voted, the nuclear freeze item would never have passed.

(And I love the way the pro-freeze pollsters couch their questions: Would you like to see a nuclear war begin with atom bombs exploding over all our cities, killing women and children, husbands and fathers, destroying the entire planet, eradicating civilization, and returning the survivors, if any, back to the stone age, or are you for a nuclear freeze? Well, you can make almost any poll say what you want: it&apos;s a matter of whom you ask, and how you ask it)



GOLD RUSH REVISITED

Can I believe I actually found a few rare nuggets of truth and common sense in your last few declamations? Yes (be still my beating ganglion), I actually did.

Even though they were well hidden, I agree with the points on retaliation. However, in order to shoot down a Soviet plane in exchange, which would be a flat-out declaration of war (which would never be accepted by the flacks in the Congress even if the missiles were on their way). And as I stated on another occasion, there are wheels within wheels turning with relation to every Soviet move, and we can only guess what measures were or are being taken that would lose their effectiveness if made public.

President Nixon, not a friend of yours, developed one of the premium foreign policies for the United States, and I think that Reagan draws on some of Nixon&apos;s knowledge and foresight, along with Carter&apos;s. I don&apos;t want to rehash Nixon&apos;s errors of judgment in trying to protect his friends (the real issue), but you must remember that there was a democrat majority in congress when Watergate was blown up out of proportion, and also when Lyndon Johnson&apos;s peccadilloes with Bobby Baker that the GOP was trying to investigate but were voted down by the demos. Just recently, the demo majority in the house voted to seat the Indiana demo with an actual steal of the election, using a fraudulent method to count votes.

Nixon&apos;s head was on the line because he had beaten Helen Gehagen Douglas, the red from California for the House, and then prosecuted Alger Hiss, the darling of the liberal left. My only criticism of Nixon is that he should have dumped the Watergate crowd, burned the tapes, and told the demos to go ahead and impeach him if they could. He faltered in the end. Too bad. I think history will be much kinder to him than the present liberals and their media. In Europe, they look at the Watergate affair as the excuse to legally assassinate a sitting president hated by the left. They may be right.



GOVERNMENT BY CRONY

Government by cronyism, and appointments brought about by pressure groups, have not worked. FDR had his cabinet of cronies and also tried to pack the supreme court - &apos;the nine old men&apos; he called them. None of that stuff will work, especially &apos;packing&apos; the court.

Just as for Roosevelt, Republican court appointments have moved away from their stern ideological base and gravitated towards the middle, just as all presidents do when elected. My personal feeling on supreme court approach is that they should interpret the law instead of make it. It doesn&apos;t matter the basic philosophy, just tell us what the law says and don&apos;t break new ground as to what they consider it can mean if stretched.

LETTING WELL ENOUGH ALONE

If the axis had left well enough alone, they would have come to an agreement with Britain and France, and got their former lands back in the east, again having a border with Russia. Hitler would have been assassinated by his officer corps, and in 10 years there would have been a war against the communists with Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the rest on the same side. This western European force would have won, instituted a democratic form of government in the Russia, and... take it from there. Would the US be a friend or foe to the European Powers? Who can tell? But, it&apos;s only a theory...



CONTROLS GOING

A bill was passed in the Senate yesterday which will alleviate the gun control laws passed by a frantic congress in the hysteria accompanying the murders of the Kennedys and King. As though all the laws in the world would have prevented those particular killings.........

What should happen is the repeal of all the control laws except those dealing with automatic firing weapons and silencers. No one has been hurt or impeded by controls except the honest sportsmen. Criminals couldn&apos;t care less what laws they break by carrying guns.

Concerning the County Board nonsense, if the veto is over-ridden by the dolts on the board, many (including myself) will do all they can to defeat them in the next board elections. There are a lot of hunters, sport shooters, and collectors around who will join against the board members who think they are the sole guardians of our morals and the sole interpreters of our Constitution.



POLITICAL NOTE

The Democrats are in worsening straits these days.

A poll taken by the AFL-CIO showed that 30% of their membership now identifies with the Republican party, thus horrifying union head Lane Kirkland, for whom the message is devastating.

And in another blow to the Demos, Louisiana State Senator John Scott resigned from both the Democrat National Committee and the Democrat Pary, becoming Republican. It is a striking sign of the times.

The Republicans are taking out TV ads in Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Louisiana urging Demos to discard Ted Kennedy and Walter Mondale and their party of the past, and register as Republicans.

From the underwhelming news department:

Lefty liberal George McGovern, who views the world through red-tinted glasses, said that if his choice was between the Contras (Pro-US) and the Sandinistas (marxist-communists), &quot;with the interests of both Nicaragua and the United States in mind, I would go with the Sandinistas.&quot; We would never have guessed!

By the way: A Washington Post/ABC News poll indicated that 75% of the American people like the way Reagan handled the hostage crisis. 36% thought that he had not been tough enough, however, retribution is inevitable, like it was for the commie killers in El Salvador. You can bet that money changed hands, and the killer&apos;s identities were exposed. It was a heart-warming story.



ET TU, QUOQUE

Concerning good, old Leviticus, I don&apos;t even recall asking you to comment; I think it was that other chap, a truer Christian scholar than yourself, that was requested to provide some chapters and verse - which he did in a timely objective manner.

Thank you for explaining that in the Leviticus talk you made it as simple as you could: I really didn&apos;t detect much difference between that and some you may have thought complex.

Please note that reasonable to you may be unreasonable to others; most of my lines bear qualifiers, if you had noticed, while yours hypothecate any text as fact. My opinion is what it is, whether you like it or not. You have fallen many times into the morass of attacking opinion instead of suggested fact.

If you&apos;re so anti-soviet, it certainly hasn&apos;t been represented much by your rhetoric; the Walkers did act as soviet agents - they should be executed! Are you against all Arabs or just those you don&apos;t like?

I can&apos;t believe you categorize me as pro SS on the basis of reports which were published in newsprint and wire services. There were many units of the SS that were parallel to our battle forces, and both fought well in conventional battles.

Finally, I don&apos;t recall saying directly that you were hmsl or anti-republic (I do consider you liberal to the core), but if the socialist closet door opens from the port side, then...

What you think are flaws, others may think are virtues. Your primary problem is an inability to see the humor in much, or poke fun at yourself. You have this vast array of books that you quote and push as gospel without caring to establish your own opinions in the cold light of print. In fact, I think Alexander Pope had you pegged very well in his Essay on Criticism:

The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,

With loads of learned lumber in his head!

The art of insult is to brazenly accuse with untrue disparaging remark. I looked over my stock of the worst insults I could think of, those being accusation of intellectual inferiority, and found none that would apply in your case.

Now, will you use the foregoing to justify an absence from Alpha, where personal attacks on others, or their stances aren&apos;t objectionable, and retire to the lofty pontifical halls where the love feasts occur, proving the old axiom about entering battles of wits unarmed?

I hope not!



GOBLIN, HOBBLED

Taking your points in sequence:

1. The Leviticus was a simple needle to your complaints about the Relativity Theory material by Berry that I posted in the circular discussion on the subject to relieve complexity of terms, in which you quoted point by point your having done it FIRST (I learned shouting from you).

All The &quot;Arabs&quot; was to indicate your method of outrageous accusatory charge, followed by a castigation of the terms of the charge. Hoist by your own bombard, eh?

3. I have read and seen first hand much concerning the KGB network; have you studied them?

4. 17% of US funding to other world nations goes to Israel. They use the money to build their military and develop new settlements and still have over 1000% inflation. Can the U.S. afford this any longer?

5. Benbow to me is simply one of a fabulous number of tragic situations in the world; just because they were black and white didn&apos;t make them heroes, it was their choice to do what they did, and suffering the consequences of their actions was not particularly heroic, except to you because of a personal interest.

6. No comment on the intelligence of the Nigerian engineers, but they were all reasonably competent, if guided.

7. I guess you just don&apos;t realize that classifications or events as you define them aren&apos;t nobly engraved in stone. You utilize subjective hyperbole to develop a point as none other do. All of the sincerity and emotion of your words still can&apos;t make it so, if it isn&apos;t so.

8. Concluding, does the fact that you say you were speaking honestly suggest that you haven&apos;t in other discussions?

You are such a sweet person, basically; one can tell from the words employed: petty bigotry - racial&amp;sexual, insults, nastiness, thugs, bullies, barflies (barflies?), Klans, Nazis, Fascists, hate-mongering, obnoxious, worthless justification, Tory! (Tory?), radicals, foulest terms, casual disregard of mutual humanity (what&apos;s that?), etc., etc.

What I expound on in this forum is generally a reflection of my immediate opinions, and I don&apos;t feel I have to sugar-coat those opinions for general consumption. And I don&apos;t expect you to do so either.

You can say anything you wish in Alpha, even as I, as your opinion. If disagreement is present it may manifest. I can recall asking for position rationales on various items and receiving only reactionary response, and a demand for reply to the reactions.

The result is that you have your opinions, I have mine; both appear unchangeable, regardless of packaging. But why can&apos;t you understand that that&apos;s fine, and an end in itself. There exists unconvincibility here that is comfortable in itself. Just because I refuse to be molded to your viewpoint, or you to mine, need not call for all those heart rending statements involving the innate rights of man.

My statements have always been an honest reflection of what I thought; I never categorized myself as an angel, just one trying to be on the side of the angels in most things - except where I think the angels might be going overboard.

When I agree with your thoughts, you think I&apos;m reasonable; when I don&apos;t agree with you, well, choose a name somewhere from above.

(Keep picking on me and it will be &apos;no more Mr. Nice Guy!)



PULL-OUT

Don&apos;t peddle that pull-out baloney when it&apos;s well-known that your stripe of liberal was clamoring for a pull-out at any cost, and that if the president would have mounted an all-out attack on the anti-US elements in Lebanon they would have passed legislation allowing the Harts and Weikers to hang him from the Washington Monument.

If you had the guts of a slug you would be behind the president instead of picking from a distance with mealy-mouthed words.

(but summer is over, which explains your attitude towards the military)



SAME OLD LINE

It&apos;s unfortunate that the right side of your mouth never knows what the left is doing; your gibberish is a tribute to double-standardism, and not worth this these lines of reply.

You are going to believe what you want regardless of facts, in your subjective port-sided manner; reading your implication and innuendo based tirades are like a sequel to 1984, but without the Orwellian flare.



NAME TAGS

When push came to shove, Sam Ervin was as democrat as they come; perhaps some of his boll weevilism came to the fore when some of his redneck contituents told him how they stood on local and state matters, but otherwise it was demo-liberal all the way.

I realize Ervin came from your part of the country, but it doesn&apos;t apply that you should think he was conservative in nature. Perhaps you had him mixed up with Huey Long.

My point, that you are trying to evade, is that Ervin, the great constitutionalist, knew all along that what he and his fellow democrats, aided and abetted by the media, were doing to a sitting president was wrong and uncalled for, and that if it were a Johnson or a Kennedy in office, there would be few waves.

Also, Ervin voted against every investigation of democrat chicanery while he was in Congress, including the Republican&apos;s try to get at the facts of the Bobby Baker affair. Sam Ervin&apos;s indignation only became righteous when it was Nixon that was involved.

Isn&apos;t it strange that the same congressmen that are the live and let livers vis a vis the Soviet Union and its clones are the same ones who were so intent on getting Nixon, and who would try to get Reagan the same way if they only had a chance.



PEARL HARBOR REMEMBERED

Forty four years ago when I was a mere stripling, our family was listening to the Packers broadcast on WTMJ, with Russ Winny calling the game.

A news bulletin broke through the football action, and an excited announcer broke in saying that the Japanese had attacked our military base at Pearl Harbor, catching the American forces by surprise, and sinking the battleship Arizona with many hands still aboard.

In a few hours, we heard then President Franklin Roosevelt say the words, &quot;a day that will live in infamy......&quot; Little did we know then that the infamy would not turn out to be the Japanese action of the time, but the man who spoke the words.

Every Japanese military science graduate had been given the problem of an attack on Pearl; all of our military knew that&apos;s where the attack would take place; it was only a matter of time.

Where does the infamy really lie? In the lap of the scoundrel Roosevelt, who knew in advance that the Japanese fleet was on its way to Pearl, but kept the news under wraps because he wanted to get the US into the war against Germany to help out his ideological allies in Europe. He had promised to keep American boys out of the war, and had to have the Japs make the first move in order to drag America into the conflict.

Roosevelt had insulted the Japanese in a calculated manner since the middle thirties, thus setting up a provocation which would lead to war when he wanted it.

Because Roosevelt wanted war, hundreds of American soldiers, sailors, and marines died at Pearl; many more died in the Pacific and in Europe, all to allow the infamous Roosevelt to pull European chestnuts out of the fire.

Roosevelt recognized the outlaw empire of the Soviets in 1933, giving them an undeserved world status; he send millions of dollars of equipment and supplies to the Soviets during the war, which were never paid for; he gave away eastern Europe to Uncle Joe Stalin while senile at Yalta, with his commie keeper, Alger Hiss, at his back. Hiss was later prosecuted and convicted for perjury when he said he wasn&apos;t a communist spy. Nixon was the one who accomplished this, thereby certifying that the liberal/commie/ leftists of the nation would one day depose him with Watergate used as the excuse.

If the above seems unbelievable to you, read the book titled, &quot;Infamy,&quot; by the eminent historian, John Toland, which exposes the way a US President was responsible for the killing of many young Americans, and then consider the real meaning of Pearl Harbor, and the villain who brought it about.

One broadcast word about the approaching Japanese fleet on the air waves would have negated the tentative attack and sent the fleet steaming back to Yokohama. The treasonous Roosevelt kept the knowledge secret - until exposed by Toland and others many years later, when it was too late.

It still hurts to think about it.



TAWAIN TROUBLES

The following is excerpted from the Economic News Overseas Weekly of Taiwan:

Lead story: &quot;Textile pact puts unfair limits on Taiwan exports - US is winner in ROC-US 3-year trade agreement.&quot;

On same page: &quot;Government must get serious about nation&apos;s trade surplus - According to the latest statistics, the trade surplus in June reached a record US$1.36 billion, bringing the total for the first six months of this year to US$6.83 billion. This is nearly one-third higher than for the same 1985 period.

&quot;As a result of the continued trade surplus increase, the Republic of China&apos;s foreign exchange reserves have accumulated to a new high of US$31 billion.&quot;

The problem is that the accumulation of foreign reserves is causing the value of the NT (New Taiwanese) dollar to rise in value, resulting in higher prices to the rest of the world for ROC goods, and to combat this, the Central Bank has released about NT$240 billion into the economy.

This is to inflate the NT dollar so their goods remain competitive on the world market. We should have such problems...



NATIONAL SOCIALISM

I&apos;m in minor agreement with your point asking how a country which generated people like Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven, Von Braun, Diesel, etc. could take the path of National Socialism. Addressing that thought, I looked into one of my far right publications (Funk&amp;Wagnalls) to see what they had to say on the subject.

The National Socialist German Workers Party (known as the Nazis) was begun in 1920, and included as its theorists and planners, General Haushofer, Alfred Rosenberg (who based his racial theories on the work of the Scottish Anthropologist, Houston Stewart Chanberlin), Financier Hjalmat Horace Greely Schacht, and Albert Speer.

Quote:

The immediate origins of National Socialism are to be found in the consequences of the German defeat in World War I. Under the terms of the treaty of Versailles Germany was charged with sole responsibility for the war, stripped of its colonial empire, and forced to pay heavy reparations. German political and economic life was seriously disrupted as a result of the treaty.

Severe inflation, which reached its climax in 1923, all but destroyed the German middle class, leaving many of its impoverished and despairing members vulnerable to the appeals of the host of radical political groups that sprang up in the postwar years.

Only a few years after some measure of economic stability and progress was achieved, the worldwide economic crisis that began in 1929 plunged Germany into an apparently hopeless depression. During these years the democratic Weimar Republic was subjected to increasing attack from both left and right.

The Republic proved unable to cope effectively with the desperate condition of the country. By 1933 the majority of German voters supported one or the other of the two major totalitarian parties, the communist and the National Socialist.

Unquote.

Consider that the World Wars I and II, the rise of Hitler, the repartioning of Europe, the establishment of the Soviet Union as a power (on our money), and the general global unrest in the world today all may have begun with the assassination of a second-rate Archduke by a madman.

And in retrospect (always the easiest way), perhaps it would have been better had the United States stayed out of the First World War to begin with, as promised by Wilson. Perhaps then the second would never have happened.



MILITARY TARGETS

On the various news programs it was noted that there actually were military targets in Hiroshima and also in Nagasaki, but the targets in Nagasaki were admitted by the Japanese officially as military only in recent years. I think the military targets were a pretext for the use of the bomb as an example, rather than bombing civilians alone. But I would have condoned the bomb use even if no military targets were involved, in order to save the millions of lives that otherwise would have been lost.

By the way, it&apos;s been thought by historians that Pearl Harbor never would have occurred except that Roosevelt used the method of insulting the Japanese to goad them into attacking. He knew the Jap fleet was on its way to Pearl but wouldn&apos;t release the news because he wanted to get the US into the European war via the back door. All it would have taken was to broad-cast that we knew where the Jap fleet was and the fleet would have turned back. Japanese admirals involved have stated this. If you really want to place some blame for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, put it on the machinations of the conniving Roosevelt and his banking interest mentors.

Pearl Harbor was a day that would live in infamy all right, the infamy of a democrat president who was responsible for the killing of thousands of US military people in WWII.



VALUES

If dropping the two bombs ended the war sooner, it was worth it. I&apos;m not certain that Japan was on the ropes as much as was indicated; they were a worthy foe, tough as they come. They might have fought to the death with all at their disposal.

The main reason to offer thanks to the Deity is that the US developed the Atomic bomb and not the Nazis or the Soviets.

Thanks to Albert Einstein!



GENEALOGICAL SEARCH

In order to obtain a clearance for a government project. I was forced to find out where my father and grandfather were born, and their birth and death dates, which took a trip to Marshalltown, Iowa. During the search I subsequently learned that a distant Massachusetts relative, Judge John Richards, presided over part of the Salem Witch Trials.

Wow!

Note: The search for our Richards ancestors was stimulated by that long ago event in Salem, continued on past the existence of the Society of Alpha-Omega, and culminated in our finding where the line began in 1635 Weymouth. It is explained in some detail on my 1999 web site, in the Richards Genealogy section, the address of which is:

MAU-MAU&apos;D

Tom Wolfe described it first in his piece, &quot;Mau-Mauing the Flak-Catchers,&quot; which described the flow from the bleeding hearts in New York&apos;s liberal circles, where the limousiners held parties for the black revolutionists just to hear them rant and rave over how nasty the white folks been to dem, and what ofeys, honkies and worse they were, while the libs, in an orgasm of self-flagellation, were nodding their heads in agreement.

One of those bleeders, ex-President Jimmie Carter, was in Rhodesia cum Zimbabwe, yesterday, for a US sponsored conference on Liberty or some such outmoded concept in African politics. Carter, as we all know, was instrumental in forcing a white, anti-communist, well-run government out of Rhodesia in favor of letting a black marxist and his tribe into power.

But instead of the kudos Carter expected, he just got more mau-mau flak from a black Zimbabwean official, a diatribe against the policies of the United State, a nation without which that black official would still be living in the bush, talking the dialectics of treason in Swahili.

Even Carter, one with first class do-gooder credentials, couldn&apos;t stomach any more of the black fella&apos;s hogwash, and walked out of the conference, followed by the Americans present, and most of those from western governments.

&quot;Zimbabwe,&quot; another artificial country torn from white settlers government in favor of black rule simply by arithmetic, would still be mud hut oriented were it not for Cecil Rhodes and his white followers. However, it is rapidly, under black rule, retrogressing to the stage of tribal rule, and when everything wears out, there again will be mud huts on the boulevards of Salisbury, with the attendant spearing and dancing.

This is what the liberals want to do to South Africa in the name of do-gooderism, and what the Soviets want to do to South Africa in the name of extending Communism when they get rid of anyone in SA who is against the precepts of Marx.

May it never happen, but, based on the contemporary encroachments of the Soviet&apos;s evil empire, because of the wavering in western fairness, it might soon come to be.





2.0 South of the Border

The communists were highly active in South and Central America in what experts stated were an attempt to Cubanize smaller countries there one at a time. Reagan led the fight against them in El Salvador, Nicaragua, anywhere the communists were active, and set up the attack on Grenada that eliminated the Cuban threat in the country.

Of course there was a hue and cry from communists all over the world, along with screeches emanating from the doves in the American Congress, who appeared to prefer marxism in the hemisphere rather than constitutional democracy.

However, Reagan was successful, and maintained the spirit of the Monroe Doctrine as far as he was able.

Moderator&apos;s comments follow:



SO RIGHT!

If the liberals had gained control of the US government in the last election, Grenada would be a communist bastion right now! Nicaragua would have its armies invading its neighbors, or at least supporting so-called rebels to attempt a takeover. The democrats would be wring their hands and wiping blood from their hearts while the first shots were being fired at the southern Mexican border.

You are absolutely correct about not dealing from a position of weakness; even with the military capacity of the US, the demlibs would be still trying to talk to the enemy, promising they wouldn&apos;t raise a hand, their position of weakness being their lack of mental toughness. Sickening!

If you care to identify the communist dupes and sympathizers, just listen for the buzzwords typical to the group: fascist, racist, imperialist, reactionary, capitalist, etc...

By their words ye shall put the finger on them!



APPEASERS

I guess most of the Alphans know my personal position on what the United States should be: The continuing republic that it is with strong defenses, dealing in the world from that strength rather than weakness, with the flexibility to oppose the totalitarianists in any part of the world - and especially in our own back yards, etc. etc.

It is with this attitude that I must report on the cries of the American Weirdo about to be heard today. Senator Thomas Dodd, one of the more pusillanimous of the effeminate eastern democrat establishment, is in the Midwest to speak on behalf of a local demo, James Moody.

Here are a pair of strange birds ideally mated. Audubon would have classified them thus:

1. Basically pink to red, with streak of yellow down back.

Through the natural selection process, has developed but one left eye, one left leg, one left wing (very large), and flies only in circles.

3. This weird species is found in the northeastern US primarily, but some are prevalent in the Great Lakes area. Breed is known to always be willing to give up his nest to an enemy.

4. Physical defects: suffers from the bleeding heart syndrome.

5. Mental defects: Apes his predators, mocks his betters.

Listen for the call of this bird (I surrrrrrrrenderrrrrrr) in meeting places everywhere. It is the cry of the Fellow-traveling Flatulent, and is always heard during delegation trips to Central America.



MORE LOONEY TUNES

On the news this morning: a couple of democrat senators just came back from visiting their Sandanista friends in Nicaragua. One of the statements made by them said our policy should be live and let live with the other governments of South and Central America. This is the same type of fool who will be saying down the line that the border incidents along the Rio Grande curtain should be overlooked by our government as the normal pugnacity of the communist rule there.

With senators like this, the Soviet Union and its supporters don&apos;t have to worry about fighting the United States, the congress will just sign over the Constitution to them in the name of keeping the peace.

Can you imagine during WWII some of our congressman and newsmen going over to Germany to talk about the war? They would have been shot as traitors.

Good thought!



ORTEGA&amp;DEMS, INC

News headline this morning:

Daniel Ortega, democrat congressman from Nicaragua, exulted in his colleague&apos;s defeat of the aid program for the anti-communists. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Yes, I knew my friends like James Moody of Wisconsin and Tip O&apos;Neil would come through for the party down here. Now we can starve out the contras and eliminate them. With friends like O&apos;Neil, Moody, and the democrats, we won&apos;t need the Soviet Union or Cuba as much as we thought we would.

&quot;Those democrats and liberals in the US are really people after my own heart. Did you see how their majority in the house stole that election in Indiana? A work of art! They used our own tactics; they recounted the votes until their man was ahead by four, then declared the rest invalid. Karl and Vladimir would have been proud of them.

&quot;Yes, Those are my kind of guys! Too bad our plans are to shoot them all when the Soviets finally take over...&quot;



INTERNAL DISORDERS

By now we all must know that the congressional cowards and wimps prevailed temporarily in the House&apos;s vote against aid to the contras in Nicaragua. Ortega, the darling of some democrats, must have chuckled in his scraggly mustache at the sight.

I think that in the final analysis, the Americans who have a high regard for the future of their country will win out, and that we will allow funds in the form of military supplies reach the contras.

And perhaps those congressional wimps, and those who support their nauseous position, should read some words by a past American patriot who once made a speech on the, &apos;Perpetuations of our Political Institutions,&apos; institutions from which the American people still draw their greatest strength and their promise of survival:

&quot;Shall we expect a transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a single blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years.....

At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher.

As a nation of free men we must live through all times or die by suicide.&quot;

The flaming radical that issued these words was Abraham Lincoln, and in spite of some changed circumstances, they are as valid today as in the 1860&apos;s...



NEWS ITEM 4/21/61

&quot;Washington, D.C. AP. President Kennedy, declaring that the US will not abandon Cuba, warned the communists that this country will act on its own if necessary to block red aggression in the Western Hemisphere.&quot;

It&apos;s possible that some of the members were not even around at the time of that bold statement, or at least weren&apos;t as much keeping up on foreign affairs as Captain Kangaroo; however, the speech was made, and all of the Kennedy supporters nodded and smiled and waited for the vaunted Kennedy action to take place.

History notes that Cuba indeed went totally communist, and a large part of the continuing communist existence is attributable to the fact that Kennedy got weak in the knees, not to mention the brain, and would not allow the US to provide air cover for the brave men trying to overthrow Castro in their invasion at the Bay of Pigs.

Some say his hapless decision was based on advice given by Adlai Stevenson, the flaming liberal from Illinois, the father of the democrat jackass presently embroiled in yet another inept, demo fiasco there. A fine example of like father like son.

But I digress...

Can you believe that the same people, and their next generation clones, who denigrate any activity on the part of the US to throw the communist rascals out of Nicaragua, and who hated the liberation of Grenada, are the ones who were most supportive of Kennedy in 1961?

And among them can be found a hard core of international scope wimps who decried the Libyan raid. They are the same individuals who always charge the US with aggression, but never the Soviet Union.

On the local level, prime examples of the wimpiness factor can be noted by observing the likes of Jim Moody, Gerald Kleczka, and Bob Kastenmeier, all of whom blasted the President&apos;s punitive action towards Libya.

As though they had any concept of real world realities.



THE REAL ENEMIES

The answer to the query is that the real enemy of the United States is the totalitarianist system of the Marxist-Leninist communist Empire. Is there another name besides the Soviet Union (and I consider Cuba and Nicaragua just as much a part of the Soviet Union as Bulgaria or Rumania) who shoots down commerical air liners, American soldiers, people on their side of the worker&apos;s paradise trying to escape to the west? No, we have no militarily oriented enemies except for that particular evil system.

And along with having Soviet Empire as an enemy, we have those who think so little of the United States and its governmental activities so as to side with the Soviet surrogates, either deliberately as a matter of philosophy or unwittingly as a result of some warped and twisted liberal ideology.

What are the signs of this warped thinking?

That:

1. The anti-communist fighters in Central America:

a. Rape the women

b. Kill the women and children

c. Burn the food supplies of the peasants

d. Torture all whom they can lay their hands on

The benevolent communists on the other hand:

a. Must get all those arms from Cuba and Russia to protect themselves from their vicious neighbors, one of which doesn&apos;t even have an army.

 

b. Have the love of all their people who voted overwhelmingly for them in the last election, in spite of the nasty opposition who had been neatly suppressed just in case.

c. Don&apos;t even know the revolutionaries trying to topple the legitimate government of El Salvador, much less thinking about those who will next be in Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. Who us?

d. Have such a cozy relationship with all those red-tinged nuns who come to the great bastion of freedom in Managua and return with all those tales of how wonderful it is living there and how terrible it is that Uncle Sam is picking on that poor little democratic republic. Only a skeptic would wonder what they get from the reds on those long, hot nights that they couldn&apos;t get back at the convent.

This is a case where black and white positions really come into play. What it boils down to is this: is an individual pro-communist or anti-communist, with the corollary implied, pro-US or anti-US.

I say that you cannot be pro-US and still give aid and comfort to the communist enemy, unless you are a democrat like O&apos;Neill, Leahy, and that scum, who may be in petto patriots, but just want to embarrass a President at the cost of non-communist lives.



NEWSFLASH

AP MOSCOW 29 APRIL

Daniel Ortega, former democrat from Nicaragua, resigned that post yesterday to become the Nicaraguan delegate to the politbureau here in Moscow where he had arrived for the purpose of groveling before the Soviets for more arms and money.

His decision, just after his ideological colleagues in the US Congress voted to protect him from the administration anti-communists, embarrassed those colleagues to the point where they sent out for bed sheets to wipe the egg from their collective faces, but not the collective bent from their minds.

A high placed democrat source was quoted as saying, &quot;well, he has a right to control his own destiny, and we can only applaud his initiative. He will be back in the fold with us some day soon.&quot;



INVASION!!!

On TV this evening there was an interview with the &apos;defense&apos; minister of marxist Nicaragua; his position was that there would be an invasion of &apos;his&apos; country next month by the armed forces of the United States.

Of course the rationale for his attitude was the keeping busy of the Nicaraguan people so they wouldn&apos;t realize the lack of freedom in that poor communist controlled land. But he was vehement in his belief.

Now my own small opinion is, by all means let&apos;s accommodate this tin Ceasar, and send a carrier group to eliminate all those nice soviet toys he showed off so proudly, the attack helicopters, the 100 mm guns, etc. And perhaps it will put a crimp in the marxist indoctrination of those sweet little 4 to 8 year old school kids who are being taught to mouth the anti-yankee slogans.

What the Commandante really came off as, was someone scared sexless by the thought that the bad yankees really would invade, blowing away the commy cosa nostra, and ruining the good life.

Lots of bravado, little sense of actuality.



DEMOCRAP RESPONSE

After President Reagan spoke on the need for aid to the freedom-fighters of Nicaragua, in their quest to force free elections on the communist bosses that had taken over their country, Tennessee democrat James Sasser went on the air to agree that, yes, the communist had taken over and scorned the aims of the revolution, but that the demos of congress would not vote money to help the contras.

To put it bluntly, Sasser is one of the young democrat wimps whose guts must be in blind trust. With representatives such as him in this country, the Sandanistas need not worry about support for their cause. Sasser like many of his demolib partners, decry the communist activities, but won&apos;t do anything to halt them. If being a traitor means giving aid and comfort to the enemy, the label fits Sasser and his siblings like a glove.

It would appear that the only hope of the United States in the world of the future is to rip out these cowardly cancers via the ballot box, and elect a congress with the backbone to resist the red aggression. Sasser, like Solarz, is quick to vote billions for Israel, but not 10 million for the contras with which to fight for freedom. Where do the loyalties of these people really lie? In America or in Moscow?

Clem Zablocki was an old-time democrat who knew what the communists were after and voted to hold the line militarily during his term of office. Where are the democrats like Zablocki, Scoop Jackson, and Harry Truman today? Probably learning to eat borscht quiche for their proposed millennium.

As far as I&apos;m concerned, a vote against the contra aid package is a vote against the future safety and interest of the United States, no matter which political party the congressman may belong to.



WHERE WERE YOU?

I don&apos;t know where you were, but the democrats were helping the Sandanistas throw out Somoza, just like they discarded the Shah of Iran, among many others they didn&apos;t like. Right now they&apos;re trying to keep the marxists of Nicaragua in power, and if we don&apos;t watch out they&apos;ll be trying to hoist a hammer and sickle over the white house. Not all of them, maybe, but enough to make patriots uncomfortable.



STRATEGY

It would appear that the President Reagan&apos;s strategy is to give Ortega and his marxists enough rope to hang themselves, and then attack in some way, military or non-military, with the real prizes being both a democracy in Nicaragua and a devastating election issue with which to beat the liberal democrats over the head in November. Being a democrat who voted against giving aid to freedom fighters against Communism is a position precarious in these days of conservative-leaning America. How would one in that stance answer his opponent during a debate?

However, it becomes apparent that the left is about to put on a campaign of national and worldwide propaganda relating supposed outrages committed by the Contra Forces, using the favorite commie buzz words for these occasions, murder, rape, pillage, etc., etc. You know, all the things they do themselves, and of which they always accuse others.

If you are forty years old, then you would have been 7 years old during the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations which was chaired by Senator McCarthy; I don&apos;t think you remember much of them. And if what you saw was edited clips of the hearings, filtered through liberal scissors, you saw everything McCarthy did in the worst light possible.

Not too many people ever said that McCarthy was wrong in his accusations concerning communists in the State and Treasury Departments, and working, as Hiss did, in the White House itself, they only held that his tactics could have been more precise. In fact, the hearings were covered by a left-wing blanket of bombast orchestrated by the NY Times, Washington Post, and creatures of that ilk, simply to smother the truths unearthed. Our own dear evening rag, had but one picture of McCarthy it used on every occasion, a picture taken during a 9 hour floor stint, where he was unshaven and unkempt. But that was typical of the Socialist Journal of the times.

The McCarthy hearings were held in a whirlpool of communist and fellow-traveler propaganda, all designed, aided, and abetted by the media, to denigrate the committee and stifle the facts it brought to light.

Too bad you weren&apos;t old enough to have seen and understood the whole thing.



FINE, BUT.....

I can&apos;t really object to any of your proposed solutions; all have a degree of merit; but I don&apos;t agree with the idea that we never use our military might to invade if necessary.

One of the ideas proposed by the joint chiefs in closed session was similar to yours, that is, a total blockade of air and water ports until the Sandies got the message.

But the real kicker in any of these is this: even if the President would order the blockade, as is within his power, the demos would immediately try to bring all forces to bear against such a proposal. Legislation would be introduced by the pound; Kennedy, Leahy, Cranston, Hart, O&apos;Neill, and the rest of that set of wimps would be whining and squealing; the liberal rags, TV, and mags would be in full cry. The global commie propaganda machine would be in full bloom. Already the wimps are warning about another Viet Nam, regardless of whether it&apos;s on our doorstep or not.

If that Iraqi Embassy article was correct about the 4.3 billion going to Israel, I&apos;m sure the US could lop off a mere 100 million to protect our hemispheric interests, that is if Tel Aviv gives their permission for us to do so.

Why is it that we in the US suffer these idiots and elect them to high office if it becomes obvious that their greatest quality is to roll over and play dead before the communist menace? I can see how it can be in places like Massachusetts, whose voters condone killing and homosexuality in their candidates, but why should it happen in other areas of the nation? I guess the answer in its simplest form is that the majority of citizens are not really too bright, and believe what they see on TV and read in the papers, using these media to do their thinking for them.

It would seem that populations are composed of masses of instinctive stupidity, swayed by those who control the dissemination of information, and duped into tagging along with the bunch so their brains won&apos;t be hurt from the impact of an original thought striking the cortex.

There aren&apos;t enough knotted hankies in the world to keep the pain away.

And returning to the concept of blockade or invasion, if you would recall, when Grenada occurred, the left-libs were outraged that we would have the temerity to kick out a marxist government. There are yet a plethora of articles condemning the US action, and denigrating Reagan for the crime of anti-Communism. Think what hue and cry would go up if we finally took some decisive action in Nicaragua.

However, when we do take the action, the Nicaraguan people will be just as grateful to the US for freeing them as were the people of Grenada - left wing media pundits notwithstanding.

Let it happen soon.



JAZZY JACKSON

Saturday, in the wee hours, Radio Havana had a telephone interview with a very sympathetic &apos;Reverend&apos; Jesse Jackson, who accused President Reagan of being in complicity with P. Both of South Africa in holding down the blacks there. He also said that SA would invade Angola if it weren&apos;t for the Cuban troops. During all of the interview he was completely in accord with the Cuban government policies and Fidel Castro.

This is the cuckoo that aspired to the highest office in the land as the head of a group of nuts called the rainbow coalition, and as Jesse said, &quot;My constituency is the damned, disinherited, disrespected and the despised.&quot;

This sympathy for the communist cause is not extraordinary for Jackson. He has said, &quot;capitalism is a bad system.....the United States has to be one of the most vicious nations in the history of the world....black progress in America has to be patterned after Africa&apos;s great leaders, from Nkrumah to Machel.&quot;

We know that Nkrumah was the communist prime minister of Ghana, and that Machel is the communist dictator of Mozambique.

This is presidential material? The demos have repudiated LaRouche; why do they put up with Jackson? They are against the Arab terrorists; don&apos;t they realize the commies and the PLO have supported Jackson in his radical career?



3.0 EXTRAORDINARY

Alphans are extraordinary people who appreciate extraordinary facts. Their minds are open to all possibilities.

Some travel in vicarious time travelers, others explore the regions of the solar system and beyond, soaring through universes and galaxies, to unknown planets with unknown beings, and unkown intelligences. The blackness and distance of light years hold no dread for them. The can sense the presence of &quot;visitors&quot; from other dimensions, other worlds.

Alphans are aware of the strange creatures that still seemingly walk the earth, the Yeti of Tibet, the Sasquatch and Bigfoot of the northwest forests, and the mysterious bipeds still at large in the caves of Illinois, the midwest, and unknown elsewheres.

They sense the spirit world and its inhabitants, from shades to poltergeists to demons, and understand the vagaries of Kirlian photography. They percept in extra sensory mode.

And, they conjecture: Are there dinosaurs still living, hidden in the Matto Grosso or other areas where the vegetation cannot be transversed? Is Nessie a plesiosaur left over from the Triassic Period of 65 million years ago, her family trapped in a Scottish lake, safe for all time in those all but impenetrable depths?

PYRAMIDS

What is it about the shape of a pyramid that might cause it to focus energies in such a way as to affect an object within it regardless of pyramidic size? And the Egyptian pyramids, how were they built? Can one believe that it was the labor of thousands of men for hundreds of years, or was there some sort of device for cutting and lifting the massive stone blocks into place, using a principle lost to man in this day?

The pyramids in the world, most in Egypt, have endured for centuries, and there may be others yet undiscovered. Lately pyramid power has been discussed in books and magazines. It is said that fresh meat placed in the pyramid field will merely dessicate instead of spoiling, and that razor blades will maintain their edges without external sharpening. This is supposed to occur no matter how small or large the pyramid. Has anyone tried this? But getting back to Egyptian pyramids.....some say the Egyptians built them, but my question is how? How did they move masses of stone block that weighed hundreds of tons in some cases? If they did it with manpower, where did all the workers come from? How many years and how many men? Who fed the workers?

Did the Egyptians do the construction or was it a group long before them? Did this group build the Mayan pyramids? What was their real function? Were anti-gravity devices used that we still haven&apos;t discovered? What do you think?



BUILDING A PYRAMID

If you feel like building your own pyramid to perhaps establish the razor sharpening theory, or the food dessicating theory, you can construct one from cardboard or plastic. The pyramid itself should have a base-to-height ratio of 1.5708, or about I/2 Pi. The items should be placed on a platform within the pyramid at about 1/the height. Some schools of thought say the pyramid should be placed in line with true north, others say magnetic north. The razor blades should face east-west. Results, if any, should occur in two weeks. Give it a try and see what happens.



MONSTERS

What is a monster? Now give it a millisecond of thought (leaving out your relatives and old girlfriends). We have a number of physical freaks in the genus homo sapiens such as dwarves, mongoloids, midgets, giants, those with 12 toes (bad luck at the shoes store) or more than 10 fingers.

While people like that may be (but shouldn&apos;t be) physically repugnant to us, they still should not be called monsters in the truest sense. Perhaps physical size is the criterion. A bacterium does not scare anyone watching it through the microscope, but if it were somehow enlarged to 16 feet long and 8 feet tall, it might give some of us a mild shock. My point is, anything large and ugly-looking will generally be termed a monster by the people, no matter what it really is.

To ramble on, let&apos;s discuss some familiar monsters. We all know Nessie who lives in Loch Ness and is a shy old thing. Some folks say they have seen her of from lake to shore and return. Some pictures exist which show some indication of &quot;something.&quot; Is Nessie really a monster, or is she a throwback to pre-history, living and breeding in the loch, content to mind her own business.

A quick look at the abominable snowman, or in Tibetan, the Yeti. He has appeared to be humanoid, two arms, two legs, and other human-type appurtenances, and who leaves footprints of gigantic size. Is this a monster? Or is the Yeti another vestige of times past, who may have been hunted or shot at on sight, and has learned by this to keep away from us civilized people.

In northern California, and parts of Oregon and Washington, There seems to exist a Bi-pedal creature which the indians of the region have named Sasquatch. They are about 7 to 10 feet tall (estimate, not measurement) and about 300+ pounds. The last one seen was noted to be a female with definite mammalian characteristics, reddish hair, and had an extremely unpleasing odor. Some hikers got a picture on 8 mm film, supposedly, but it has not been released to the general public.

Other bi-pedal humanoid types have been observed in Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, and also in parts of the globe other than the US.

Are these beings monsters?

Let us assume for the sake of argument that they are reasonably intelligent creatures. Here they are, trying to exist, in a hot-bed of humans who might destroy them on sight. They have to live, breed, and continue on under very trying conditions. Are they the monsters, or are we?

On another tack. Suppose we consider what a real monster might be. My feeling is that some sort of being having super-intelligence co...&apos;&apos;&quot;&quot;--(tm)(c)(r)1/41/23/4ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúüýÿÿÿýþÿmpared to us, with the capability to mimic the human form without detection, who could exert control over what we consider normal human minds, and who has none of the positive qualities that make humans human, and has no compunction about being ruthless.

This to me would constitute a real monster. Are there any around?



MORE ON MONSTERS

One would think that Murphysboro, Illinois would be a quiet mid-western town, resting along side the Big Muddy river - and so it is, most of the time. A young couple was sitting in a car about midnight on June 25th, 1973, when there appeared a light-colored manlike creature about eight feet tall which resembled an oversized ape. It had long and shaggy, dirty, white hair, matted with mud and river slime, and smelled foul. As it came towards the car, the kids took off, shaken at the sight.

The police investigated, but saw nothing except some footprints.

The next night, two teen-agers were talking on their back porch when the monster again appeared, stared at the petrified kids from 15 feet away, then turned and shuffled back to the river. It came to be known as the Murphysboro Monster, and haunted the city over the summer. People brought out their rifles and shotguns and went out in bands to hunt it. After the summer was over, the thing disappeared, probably returning to its hideaway in the Shawnee National Forest, in some hidden cave.

Who or what are these man-like creatures? There have been some 750 sightings over the past 100 years. More striking is the fact that there have been more than 300 sightings in the last 10 years alone. How many times are these creatures seen, but not reported, out of fear of ridicule?



PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

There are some occasions when the staid city of Milwaukee has its Alphan moments, and one of these occurred in November of 1935 (were you around?). The &quot;Milwaukee News&quot; had a lead story on Arthur Price Roberts, who was known as John Roberts. It seems that 70 year old Art Roberts had an avocation as a psychic detective, and he had told the Milwaukee Police that the area was in for some bombings, two banks, perhaps the city hall, the one in Menonomee, which was then south of the river.

The first blast was in Shorewood&apos;s city hall, killed 2 children and injured scores of others. The hall was destroyed by the fire. On October 27th, two banks were blown up, and embarrassingly enough, two police stations. Milwaukee detective English asked Roberts to use his psychic powers to determine when the next blast would be. Roberts said that it would come on November 4th, 1935, and that it would be a tremendous blast.

The police sent about fifty men into the Menomonee area, fully armed, and ready to apprehend any bomb-carrying individuals. November 4th, late in the afternoon, a gigantic explosion in a south side garage disintegrated the structure, and was heard over eight miles away. All that was found at the scene was a bagful of human tissue scattered over the blast area. What had happened was that two fellows, 21 year old Hugh Rutkowski, and 19 year old Paul Chovonee had blown themselves up with fifty pounds of dynamite while trying to construct another bomb.

All of the events were foretold by Art Roberts, who worked closely, but informally, with the Milwaukee Police on many other cases. He psychically located the body of Duncan McGregor, of Peshtigo, after McGregor had been missing for months. While Roberts was staying in a Fond du Lac hotel, the local police asked him to help on an unsolved murder. He said he would sleep on it and talk to them in the morning.

The next day he entered the rogues&apos; gallery room in the station and looked through pictures of various hoodlums. He pointed to a photo and told the amazed police that this was their murderer, and that the man was presently working for the Mounted Police Service in British Columbia.

Art Roberts passed away in his small Milwaukee home, far from his native Denbeigh, Wales, on January 2nd, 1940. All he left was many filing cabinets filled with documents of all his remarkable cases. What he did was a matter of record; how he did it - we still don&apos;t know. Today&apos;s police could use a man like John Roberts, whose talents in 1935 must have generated much discussion among the law enforcement agencies of the time.



MUSIC OF THE SPHERES

Which is a dubious, but classy, title. Somewhere I have heard of the theory which suggests that our own realtime macro and microcosms are not limited, but infinite.

The thrust of the theory was that we are aware of the atomic particles and of gigantic suns and planets in the solar system, but that is not where all stops. It proposed that we and our solar systems were merely the units in another unthinkably larger plane, perhaps part of a dust speck in some other undetectable existence.

And do the atoms and their parts, that we have tried to know, reflect the being of another universe with its own stars and planets whirling about, in a speck smaller than the smallest dust mote.....and will we ever know?



MONSTER REVISITED

You touched on movie monsters, most of whom were quite laughable, especially the Japanese versions.

But there was one movie produced which was more a Shakespearean tragedy than a monster movie. This was the classic, &apos;Creature from the Black Lagoon.&apos; It generated sympathy in the watcher, who knew that the creature only wanted to exist in its tropical backwater, and that the creature had a right to defend itself from the interlopers.

The movie did not develop the depth of the creature&apos;s intelligence (by design, perhaps?), but the audience knew that in its own way the creature was a thinking being. When finally escaping from its human tormentors, the creature returns to the sea, never to be seen again (except in low-grade sequels), and the cheers of the viewers went with it.

My question is (you knew there would be one after all that), are there any real-life counterparts to the fictional creature? You heard me expound on the Yeti, Sasquatch, etc., are they also in the creature category? What do you think?



MORE MONSTERS

The initial definitive term of &quot;monster&quot; provides a meaning of: any plant or animal of abnormal size, a wicked creature, a fabled animal combining human and animal features, any animal or thing of huge or enormous size......That&apos;s good enough for me!



HOME-MADE

If you&apos;re going to get picky, and I know you are, the actual definition of creature is, anything that has been created; therefore, monsters can also be creatures, and vice versa. The differentiation factor (as far as I&apos;m concerned, anyway) is whether or not the creature/monster is or is not malevolent. I&apos;ll take the creature from the black lagoon over a thirsty Dracula any day.



MIB&apos;s

If you have had some interest in UFO activity, and have read some of the existing literature, you may be aware of the Men In Black, or the MIB&apos;S as they have come to be called.

For those Alphans unaware of the subject, the MIB&apos;s are a group of three individuals wearing black suits, who usually travel in black Cadillacs, and who call on individuals who have either had 2nd or 3rd kind contact with UFO&apos;s, and who report the contacts at length, or write books about their experiences.

It seems to have begun in 1953, when MIB&apos;s called on Albert K. Bender, director of an international UFO bureau. Bender had gained access to some information that he felt provided substantive clues pointing to the origin of the flying saucers. The MIB&apos;s told Bender that the data he had would have an adverse effect on the populace, and that it was not yet time for the public to know.

Since that time, dozens of UFO researchers had reported encounters with the MIB&apos;s who also had been cajoled or threatened. The meetings seemed to rise in proportion to the number of saucer sightings. The MIB&apos;s have posed as federal agents or air force officers, saying they were empowered by the government to enter, search, and seize property without warrants or court orders. Legitimate federal groups stated that none of their personnel were involved. Another reaction to a visit from the MIB&apos;s was a feeling of nausea, confusion, and fever, and the thought that there was paranormal manipulation by the visitors.

The MIB&apos;s have been described as being male, short, with eyes slanted, but not oriental, and with pointed or strangely shaped ears. They seemed to have a breathing problem, gasping for breath on occasion.

Contactees have reported that after a visit from the MIB&apos;s, weird things began to happen; radio and TV signals were interfered with, and on the TV screen could be seen images of robed figures who warned the watchers to keep all info confidential, and their silence would be rewarded by key roles in many projects beneficial to mankind.

The phenomenon may not be new. Historically it has been reported that men of scientific importance had been contacted by black-robed individuals for whatever purpose, new technical information, perhaps. And there is another group in eastern lore known as &apos;The Brothers of the Shadow,&apos; whose purpose appears to be the prevention of learning occult lore. This lore, known as &apos;The Great Secret of Isis&apos; is synonymous with the so-called &apos;Great Secret of Maeterlink,&apos; whatever that bee.

All reports on the MIB activity to date stress the fact that MIB&apos;s are real and should be considered a danger to the individual contacted by them. The present knowledge insists that the way to combat the MIB&apos;s is to ignore them and their threats, or to treat them with disdain, not taking them or their efforts seriously. This has seemed to work in the past. Even in cases where poltergeist type activity occurred, seemingly MIB induced, ignoring the physical action caused it to slowly disappear.

Have any of you Alphans had encounters of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd kind? Was there a black cad in your past......or will there be one pulling up in the future?

Note: In his novel, Through The Lines, the author has used the MIB theme.



ESPER

I wonder if any of the Alphans know about an individual who lives, or has lived in Milwaukee in contemporary times, named Peter Hurkos? Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch house painter who injured his head in an accident while doing some work in Holland. When he regained consciousness in the hospital, he found that he had become fluent in the Spanish language, and subsequently learned that he had been blessed with ESP capabilities covering many areas.

In fact, Mr. Hurkos&apos; ability to touch objects and determine the owners identity and location was utilized by many police departments to find the bodies of murder victims.

The reason for my bringing this matter to light is not the proven abilities of Peter Hurkos, but to consider what must be done to the human brain to bring about these capabilities in a person. With Hurkos it was the damage to certain areas of the brain. Could this physical impact on the cerebral centers be duplicated by surgery?

This is a question whose answers lie in empirical experimentation, and therein lies the problem. Even though tremendous good might be generated from a successful surgical technique, the failures leading up to that technique would be so repugnant that there is little chance a program would ever begin.

Rumors have indicated that the Soviet Union is conducting these types of experiments in their so-called &apos;mental hospitals,&apos; and are also delving into occult and paranormal experimentation. Unfortunately, there is no solid report data on their activities to date.

Are there any more Hurkos type people in the world? If Hurkos would have known some of the problems he would have, would he have displayed his &apos;gift&apos; to the world? If you were so blessed with paranormal talents, would you admit it to anyone, or simply and quietly use them for your own advantage? Are there any people in public life that you might guess have used talents as these for their meteoric rises in wealth or power?



NO HOPE FOR THIS DIAMOND?

With that deucedly clever intro you must know already that the subject of today&apos;s discussion is the &apos;curse&apos; supposedly on the Hope Diamond. This is a beautiful blue diamond that weighs 44.5 carats, which has inscribed a history of terror, disaster, and death since its being stolen from the golden forehead of the Rama Sita idol in Burma. The inside man on the job was a priest, subsequently tortured to death for his part in the robbery.

This stone is the only blue diamond ever found that when exposed to ultra violet light glows with a malevolently eerie red aura. It is also said to conduct enormous amounts of electricity.

Mineralogical scientists have discovered that the Hope Diamond emits some sort of unknown subtle emanations that seem beyond the presently known electromagnetic spectrum, penetrating all objects. Perhaps these waves have lengths in the same spectrum as telepathy or ESP?

Here are a few facts of gory interest:

The postman who delivered the stone was struck by a number of calamities. Within two weeks, his house burned down, his dog was strangled, he was thrown from his car and injured, and his wife died of a heart attack.

A star of the French follies who owned the stone was killed by her lover.

A Greek jeweler bought the stone, drove off a cliff, and was killed along with his wife and children.

Some governments who owned the stone were brought to collapse and ruin.

Louis the XIV garnered the diamond and his glorious sun-king reign ended in a series of defeats - political, military, and personal.

Princess De Lamballe wore it and was beaten to death by a Parisian mob.

Marie Antoinette (let them eat cake), who had worn it, and Louis the XVI who had owned it, lost their heads over the rock.

A gangster named Miette stole the diamond, along with the crown jewels, and lost his head to the Guillotine with five others of his band.

It turned up again in the hands of a Dutch diamond cutter who later died of heartbreak when his son stole it from him.

A man named Beaulieu sold the stone to a shady London jewel dealer named Eliason, but Beaulieu and his money disappeared forever.

Eliason had his health ruined and most of his money gone when he finally sold the stone to Henry Thomas Hope who felt by naming the diamond after his family it would stop the curse.

Sadly enough, the stone passed through the ownership of a son, a nephew, and a grandson, bringing about their ruin, one by one. Hope&apos;s son actually changed his name trying to avoid the curse, but he not only lost the diamond, but all his money too, and his wife ran off with someone else. Another Hope relative got the diamond and was also wiped out.

The next member of the Hope family to get the stone was convinced of the curse, and quickly sold the thing to the Duchess of Newcastle, who also swiftly sold it to a New York jeweler named Henry Frankel, who almost immediately lost most of his wealth, finally having to sell the diamond at auction.

Jacque Calot, a French jeweler, bought the stone, and went totally insane shortly afterwards, committing suicide. The next owner, a Soviet Prince, was stabbed to death; Catherine the great wore it just before she died of apoplexy. A German lady wore it and wound up as a scrub-woman in a shipyard; a Turkish sultan was stabbed by his favorite wife.

It was purchased in 1911 by Evelyn McLean. The ink was hardly dry on the deal when her son was killed in a mysterious auto accident, her daughter committed suicide; her husband suffered a mental breakdown, became completely insane, and died in an institution.

However, Mrs. McLean herself was seemingly not affected by the diamond and refused to part with it except at one point when she pawned it to raise money for the Lindbergh baby ransom. She then sold it to Harry Winston who then had a series of monetary setbacks which caused him to turn over the diamond to the Smithsonian Institute.

Are these all coincidences? Why did the diamond seem to affect men more than women? What is the strange radiation given off by the gem? Does the stone have some kind of crystalline life-force of its own, a strange sort of intelligence that allows it to control its destiny? Is it an example of psionic forces concentrated in the lattice structure? As of now, no one can prove yea or nay.....and perhaps no one wants to try!

(Which brings to mind the classic cartoon where the young beauty, wearing a magnificent diamond necklace, was talking to a woman friend at a party. Next to her was a decrepit old codger, over 90, and looking like it. Her line was: Yes, this is the famous Hoke Diamond, and this is the curse that goes with it. Best of all was the smug smile on the face of the old guy. (I guess when they got married, the newspaper had to say that the groom&apos;s gift to the bride was an antique pendant.)



BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN RACINE

It seems that the State of Wisconsin has many strange things happening on occasion besides Tony Earl&apos;s being governor. There seems to be a fey quality about the area that defies analysis. Wisconsin has had its share of monsters, ESP occurrences, such as the event in Cedarburg described a short time ago on 60 Minutes, and other types of spiritual and occult manifestations.

In June of 1969, a young couple named Smith moved into a Racine apartment. Mrs. Smith was in the hospital in the process of having their first child, and Mr. Smith was taking a nap on the couch at home.

He had the weird feeling he was not alone, and when he opened his eyes noticed a man-like shape standing next to him, but when he got up, it vanished. The next evening it happened again.

One night Smith felt as though he had received a burn on his leg, but could not explain it. He and his wife thought there was some kind of thing with them in their apartment. They went to bed early that night.

Smith said that he was in bed about 15 minutes when he felt what seemed to be hands around his neck, choking him. He struggled, and finally managed to get them away from his throat. When he turned the light on, he saw the room was empty except for him, his wife, and the new baby.

Being of sound mind, Smith took his family and left at once. He went back about 11:30 pm for some babble clothes and saw at the time some sort of humanoid shape, almost fog-like in appearance, moving across the room.

Smith mentioned the happenings to a member of the Racine Police, Sylvester Harris. He and Harris went back to the apartment the next evening.

Again Smith saw the form in the bedroom; he ran out calling Harris, but by the time they got back the being had vanished. Harris did not see the creature, but there was no way for it to disappear except through one of the walls.

The Smiths said they really didn&apos;t believe in ghosts, but they were going to relocate in any case. As a reporter for the Racine paper noted, there may not have been any ghost or creature in the apartment, but it was difficult to explain away the finger marks on Smith&apos;s throat.



SOUL SUPPORT

I suggest that if there is a soul, it would expand to fill the confines of the physical body, no matter how big or small. Perhaps, if it indeed does so, and maintains a phantom shape even through a loss of limb, it would account for the amputee&apos;s feeling that the previously lost limb is still there, and can hurt on occasion, even if it is apparent that there is no physical presence.

Kirilian photography indicates that when a part of the existing form is removed, from a leaf or flower for example, that the Kirilian image still remains, showing the entire organic structure as long as the basic unit still has life. Maybe this concept holds true for soul parts still existing where the physical limb is missing.



CONSPIRACY/MYSTERY/DEATH (JFK)

Was anyone ever put on trial for the assassination of John F. Kennedy?

Remember that New Orleans districk attorney, Jim Garrison, who thought he had some answers to the JFK mystery? He indicted a man named Clay Shaw, whom Garrison accused of being involved in the killing along with a group of Castro-Cubans, and actually tried him in a New Orleans Parish court.

Clay Shaw was acquitted, but soon afterward was found dead in his home under circumstances which could only be construed as suspicious. Shaw was only one of the many individuals connected to this greatest of contemporary mystery/conspiracies surrounding the murder of JFK, whose death followed an unusual pattern.

Despite the many reports and books written about the Kennedy case, it would yet appear that the tragic events on and after that tragic day are still a knitting mills horror of loose ends, of timely coincidences too well placed to be coincidental. For example, the inexplicably high mortality rate for individuals unlucky enough to have been associated with the case. Oddity? Or design! For example:

John F. Kennedy, the president

Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged killer of John Kennedy.

Jack Sangetti, A lounge owner who told friends Ruby would kill Oswald.

Betty Mooney MacDonald, Carousel Club Stripper, picked up by the Dallas Police, found hanged in her cell.

Darrel Garner, accused of wounding witness who saw officer Tippet shot.

Officer Tippet.

Hank Killiam, husband of stripper Wanda Killiam.

John Underhill, Life Magazine Editor, CIA Agent, who begged for protection because he said he knew who killed JFK, found shot in left temple, called suicide even though he was right-handed.

John Hunter, reporter, who had met with Ruby&apos;s lawyer a few hours after the killing, shot &apos;accidentally&apos; by a policeman at the Long Beach, CA station.

John Koethe, killed by karate chop to throat, present at above meeting.

Mary Meyer, one of JFK&apos;S girlfriends, shot while taking a walk in a D.C. park, her dairy confiscated and destroyed.

Frank Chavez, friend of Ruby&apos;s, killed by his own bodyguard.

John Howard, Ruby&apos;s lawyer, died of &apos;a mysterious heart attack.&apos;

Rose Charami, Carousel stripper, who told her psychiatrist that JFK would be killed, 48 hours prior, who had often seen Oswald with Jack Ruby.

Dorothy Kilgallen, famous writer and TV personality, who spoke to Ruby for over a half-hour, afterwards saying she would &apos;break the JFK case wide open,&apos; of an apparent overdose of alcohol and barbiturates.

William Whaley, who drove Oswald home, killed in auto crash.

Karen Carlin, Carousel Club entertainer, last to speak to Ruby before he killed Oswald, killed herself by gunshot to head.

Navy L. William Pitzer, photographer of JFK autopsy, gunshot to head.

Jack Ruby, supposedly of cancer.

David Ferrie, witness in Shaw trial, suspicious suicide.

Lladio Del Valle, Cuban, shot through heart.

John Mary Sherman, shot.

Robert Kennedy, supposedly shot by Sirhan-Sirhan (who only remembers hitting Kennedy in the shoulder. Guard E. Cesar had the same caliber pistol with him.

Clyde Johnson, who had attended parties with Ferrie, Ruby, and Oswald, shot to death near Greensburg, La. Clay Shaw, as described previously.

Ex-Deputy Roger Craig, who said he had seen a man resembling Oswald leaving the assassination site, found shot to death, ruled a suicide.

Mod figures killed to halt possible revelations: Sam Giancanna, Johnny Roselli, William Harvey, Sheffiedd Edward, Mickey Cohen.

George DeMorenschildt, sought by a house committee, shot, alleged suicide.

Carlos Prio Sacarras, ex-Pres. of Cuba, Ruby&apos;s casino partner, suicide.

Lou Staples, TV talk show host who interviewed the JFK investigators, found shot and killed in Oklahoma.

This particular list is up-to-date as of 1978, almost six years ago. Since that time more people have vanished from the scene in numbers too high to be considered a normal attrition rate. Were the above mentioned people eliminated because of what they may or may not have known, or would they have died anyway in due course? Did Oswald really make a miraculous shot and kill Kennedy who was riding in a moving car, or was it someone else?



THE SLEEPING PROPHET

What Hamlet said to Horatio was certainly borne out by the phenomenon of Edgar Cayce, his healing accomplishments and his prophecies.

Cayce was a small-town photographer, Presbyterian sunday school teacher, and a family man. Quite ordinary. But he had a particular psychic gift, a gift which allowed him to pass into a &quot;sleep&quot; and diagnose the illness of a subject, prescribe a successful treatment, and recommend the medicine and dosage required, all while asleep.

Cayce had not gone far in school, yet he was able to use descriptive medical terms to elaborate on the illness of a sufferer, and to offer comprehensive and detailed analyses in words far beyond those of an unlettered photographer.

Without going into a great deal of biography on Edgar Cayce, suffice it to say that his diagnoses were interpreted and accepted by physicians as being highly accurate, and applicable in cases where the doctors themselves had given up.

He didn&apos;t claim to be a miracle worker. He always considered himself to be an individual with a fortunate gift which was to be used for the benefit of humanity. He was a devout believer in the Bible and its rules for life and living.

His analyses were called &quot;readings,&quot; and those thousands of readings were all faithfully recorded and kept by a foundation called, &quot;The Association for Research and Enlightenment,&quot; in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where it is still in existence, living on its own and not looking for contributions or handouts - an approach which reinforces foundation validity.

The pattern of analysis was this: Cayce would pass into a sleep and then he would &apos;see&apos; the patient&apos;s body, examine it psychically, and offer his solution to the problem. He would answer direct questions concerning the sufferer as to the person&apos;s life style and causes of his problem, with an accuracy far transcending mere guess.

It was this last ability to answer questions that proved most interesting. He was asked about events as diverse as the origin of the Earth, Atlantis, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the future of nations, and reincarnation.

We live in thrilling times.

One of Cayce&apos;s prophecies had to do with Chine, had been asked in 1942 when the forces of Mao were taking over, and Communism was beginning to dominate that country.

Cayce said that in the next quarter century or so, the Chinese, who were then so favorably impressed by Communism, would realize that man does not live by bread alone, that trying to improve a nation&apos;s ills with the evil of Marx and Lenin would not work. That China, with its history of basic spiritual thrust, would eventually turn again to Confucianism and to Christianity, becoming at last a primary bastion of Christianism.

The outlook for this appeared far-fetched in view of the ruthless rulers espousing the communist dictatorial rule. Mao&apos;s red book of philosophy, idiotic as it was, brought the so-called cultural revolution, resulting in backyard blast furnaces to make steel, and such regimentation that the Chinese weren&apos;t able to produce adequate food supplies. Cayce&apos;s prediction certainly seemed without merit as far as the future of the Chinese were concerned.

Then, lately, a most unexpected breath of fresh air from the East!

The Chinese government announced that the principles and precepts of Marxism-Leninism were outmoded and had no place in an emerging society that was really sincere about raising the living standards of its people. The government is allowing its people to embrace capitalism in the marketplace, raising food and selling at a profit. Relaxation of the stringent Marxist rules has been established. Mirable dictu!

Those of us skeptics who have read and enjoyed the accomplishments of Edgar Cayce, but who weren&apos;t thoroughly convinced of validity, might see in this Chinese turnabout a substantiation of Cayce&apos;s prophecy. As I said, we live in thrilling times, and if the Chinese continue on the path they seem to be taking, it will be a positive event in world history.

If any Alphans are interested in learning more about Cayce and his history of success, here are some publications:

There is a River John Sugrue

The Sleeping Prophet John Stearns

Edgar Cayce on Prophecy Mary Ellen Carter

The Outer Limits of Edgar Cayce&apos;s Power E.E./H.L Cayce

Edgar Cayce on Atlantis E.E. Cayce

Edgar Cayce on Reincarnation Noel Langley

Venture Inward H.L. Cayce

These publications will most likely be found in stores dealing with used books; however, some are being republished and will be found in general book stores. No matter if you are a believer in the psychic or not, these make extremely fascinating reading. Is it true, or isn&apos;t it? Some of it might be coming to pass...



POLTERGEISTS

It&apos;s redundant to say that there is a great deal we do not know about the potential power capabilities of the brain, but we&apos;ll say it anyway. What gives rise to this ponderous utterance is a recent reading of case histories involving poltergeists, or mischievous ghosts.

How does one explain a phenomenon whereby solid objects are seen flying around a room with no obvious form of impetus? Parapsychologists think that the ghost part of the activity does not exist, and that because events of this nature occur most frequently in homes where troubled teen-agers reside, the younsters may be the cause.

Now, considering that this might be valid, what is there in the brain of said teen-ager that can unleash a force, unwittingly or not, that can cause real objects to move around? Why does this happen where young people are concerned? Why can&apos;t we measure these forces and take advantage of them?

What is your opinion? Ghost or mental force?

And provide some reason for your position on the matter!

If you can...



DEMONS

I&apos;ve been perusing a little-known book about demons and demonology. The authors firmly believe that there are indeed demons in existence who try to upset the normal flow of things in the human world. Their histories of just plain people who have been controlled by demons are spine-tingling, and they write with such homely sincerity that it&apos;s difficult not to take them seriously.

One of their admonitions is not to let any demon have a chance to take control over oneself, meaning the individual should not play around with books on witchcraft (or the amateur practice), ouija boards, calling up demons, etc. It will give the demon entrance and opportunity. Kind of a scary book.



QUEER OLD FOSSILS

No, that doesn&apos;t describe these four prospectors that were looking for gold in Spring Valley, a spot near Eureka, Nevada, back in 1877. One of the spryer geezers climbed a hill to check out a strange object sticking out from a rock ledge. It was the leg bone of a humanoid creature protruding out of solid rock. The others helped him cut the rock section out and brought it down to the valley.

They chipped away at the red quartzite which was hard as flint. When the leg bone was free of quartzite, the men saw that it consisted of about 4&quot; of bone above the knee, the knee itself both joint and cap, the lower leg bones, and the complete bones of the foot. In other words, part of the femur, the tibia and fibula, and the metatarsals, all still together.

The miners brought the bones to town where they placed them on display. Doctors examined the find and agreed that it appeared undeniably human. They also maintained the original human was a giant, as the length from knee to heel was 39 inches.

Two museums sent people to look for the rest of the skeleton but they had absolutely no success. Today, no one even knows where the leg bones are.

In a Hammondsville, Ohio coal mine, ca 1868, a mass of coal was dislodged which revealed a long, smooth wall of slate, covered over all of the surface with some kind of hieroglypics unable to be read by local scientists. Experts were sent for to examine the slate but unfortunately the slate crumbled before they arrived.

Other finds have been made in the past during mining excavations of all types, for example, the famous stainless steel bolt found in another vein of coal; the small, bronze machine with its gears and spindles found in solid limestone; the crystal rod, reminiscent of a lazer crystal, found encased in a layer of sandstone.

All of these items were found, but none seems to be traceable today. Where are they? Is someone, or something, collecting them to keep them out of the hands of our scholars? Who can tell?



MISCHIEVOUS GHOSTS

There are a number of books concerning poltergeists, some of which examine case histories, some merely touch on the phenomenon itself. One of the books that relates authenticated events in this field is a publication by Brad Steiger called &quot;Strange Guests.&quot; It is a popularized set of tales by a writer who deals in this sort of thing, but as a first step it suffices well enough.



AURA BE WITH YOU ALWAYS

Back a few meetings, the question was raised concerning Kirlian photography, and the concept can be viewed as a mixture of science and mysticism due both to its physical and ethereal manifestations in the eyes of its beholders.

Some history: In 1939 an electrician named Semyon Kerlian was asked to repair some hospital equipment. He notice during his time there that when one of the machines was moved close to a patient it would send off what seemed like miniature lightning bolts or sparks to the patient&apos;s skin.

Kirlian made a duplicate of the machine and placed a negative near the electrically active spot and put his hand over the film. When developed, the film showed a glowing outline of his hand. With black and white film the result was a halo around the object; with color film the light was an array of hues which surrounded the body part.

Going on, Kirlian found that everything had some sort of particular glow, and in living things the glow was variable in proportion to the life force of the object. For example, a freshly picked leaf had a strong and bright glow; as it withered and dried the glow would diminish, finally disappearing when the leaf was dry and dead. This phenomenon amazed him. For hundreds of years people who claimed psychic powers said they were able to visualize the &quot;halo&quot; that was around all living things. They stated that this glow was an &quot;aura&quot; reflecting the energy of life, and when the life died, the aura died.

One theory has it that living things have around them a sort of bioplasma and it is this that shows up when exposed to the Kirlian camera. Others say that the glow is some sort of static electricity, and say the Kirlian camera effect is not real.

But the odd fact is that if a freshly cut leaf is torn in half, the aura still shows up as a whole leaf, and the aura from a human body is thin if the body is unhealthy. Difficult to explain.

Later we will elaborate on the equipment and experiments that have been done in Kirlian photography - and you can make up your own minds.



MORE ABOUT UFO&apos;S

For what it&apos;s worth, the Soviet trade union newspaper, TRUD, reported on January 30th last that a mysterious green cloud flew next to a Soviet air liner for a few hundred miles, emitting extremely bright and powerful cones of light.

The pilot, Captain Igor Cherkashin, who has over 7500 flying hours, noticed a elongated yellow object over Belorussia. The object was at an estimated altitude of 25 to 30 miles, and sent downwards three cones of brilliant light that clearly illuminated houses and roads.

The yellow object then changed into a green cloud that zoomed around the plane, and then flew in tandem with it, maintaining a fixed position at one side.

From Minsk to Tallinn, about 400 miles, the cloud stayed with the aircraft, and was visible on Soviet radar according to traffic controllers. The deputy head of the Soviet government&apos;s UFO commission stated this was only one of a number of UFO sightings.

My comment is this: The Soviet Union obviously takes UFO&apos;s seriously, and does have a commission which monitors these incidents. It appears to be generally in the open. The United States, on the other hand, seems to suppress any UFO news, and has gone to great lengths to explain away first kind phenomena with irrational description.

I feel that the US also should have some sort of government sponsored UFO bureau which publicly reports on such occurrences. Americans are these days sophisticated enough to assimilate such information in stride, the War of the Worlds broadcast notwithstanding.



THE JFK MYSTERY (CONT&apos;D)

Since the last Alpha-Omega note discussion of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, hitherto unknown facts have come to light. I say &quot;facts&quot; because they were brought out in depositions and testimony in the libel suit which was brought by E. Howard Hunt against a small, Populist newspaper published in Washington D.C.

The newspaper is meaningless in the great scheme of things, but the court testimony evolving from that suit was of interest. The testimony in question was given by a woman, Marita Lorenz, who at points in her career worked for the CIA and the FBI. Her father captained an East German ship which called at Cuban ports, and later she became a mistress to Castro.

Her testimony included the following:

1. In November 1960 she worked on behalf of the CIA in the Miami area where she knew the man called Frank Sturgis, also with the CIA.

2. Sturgis made cash payments to E. Howard Hunt in that period.

3. Lorenz traveled from Miami to Dallas in a two-car caravan; one of the

cars carried weapons.

4. In a Dallas motel, there was a meeting with Hunt, and later a meeting with Jack Ruby. She saw Hunt give money to Sturgis on November 21st, 1963, the day before JFK was shot. This is the first knowledge that Sturgis, Hunt, Ruby, and others met in Dallas close to the assassination date.

5. In the deposition, Marita Lorenz said she &quot;stole secrets from Cuba,&quot; and &quot;was trained to kill.&quot; It was also brought out that in the second car of the caravan were two Cuban brothers - and Lee Harvey Oswald. He also was in the Dallas area with Hunt, Sturgis, and Ruby the night before the killing.

An inference could be drawn that the theory of three assassins firing at once could be valid, and that Oswald was merely the dupe. During the libel trial, when these facts came out, one of the jurors said she was positive that a government agency was responsible for the assassination. Another question was, why wasn&apos;t Marita Lorenz called as a witness by the Warren Commission? Perhaps she had too many embarrassing answers.

And in another strange turn, it appears that the brain of JFK, which was not interred with his body, has been stolen. Forensic experts have stated that if they could have access to the Kennedy brain, they could have determined the angle and direction of the bullets, something reportedly not done, or not revealed.

The attorney for the newspaper stated: &quot;We have a letter from J. Edgar Hoover which says that Jack Ruby worked for the FBI in Dallas in 1959, and had worked for them for four years before he was given the assignment to engineer what was the most important and dramatic part of the cover-up; the murder of the alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.

The mystery - still tantalizing...



PSYCHIC SURGERY

I read an interesting article last evening about the psychic surgery technique as allegedly practiced by adepts in South America and also in the Philippines. According to the text, certain people have the ability to pass their hands over the ailing section of the patient&apos;s body, whereupon the body opens up and allows the tumor, appendix, etc., to be removed. After removal, the person passes his hand along the incision and it closed up again with very little if any bleeding, leaving only a thin red line.

Now I&apos;m as skeptical as anyone when it comes to events such as these occurring, and I&apos;m sure John will have a few words to say about the stories. It&apos;s just that published modern reports are not the first ones about these types of operations happening, and that over the years cured patients have reluctantly reported them. I say reluctantly because the people involved did not wish to be scoffed at or thought crazy.

And yet it seems that something is going on along those lines. And it does not appear to be a mere fabrication. Could it be that some persons actually have the talent to perform this so-called psychic surgery? I don&apos;t know; it could be. Do you think it&apos;s possible?



CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

I recall some of the close encounter descriptions when the movie was released, or escaped, whatever happened (I heard it got bigger and got out again).

So in glancing through one of the UFO publications, I noted some brief description of encounter classes, and would like to pass them on:

Close Encounters of the:

First Kind (Simple):

This involves a sighting at close range, generally under 500 feet away, where a small craft is seen. It is usually lighted brilliantly, and has the ability to hover or leave at low, or exceptionally high, speed.

Second Kind (With Physical Effects):

The Second Kind sightings are usually similar to the First; however, in this type sighting there are effects on both living and inanimate matter. There can be effects on engines, scorched ground and vegetation, or electrical systems being disabled. The phenomenon of the truck engine stopping was a typical II in the movie.

Third Kind (Sighting of Craft Occupants):

These types of sightings are complete with the noting of craft occupants, which come in many shapes and sizes, from the grotesque to the beautiful. Many times the craft seem to be parked while its crews are out gathering samples or spare parts.

To these categories may perhaps be added a Fourth Kind which involves actual abduction of humans. Cases have been reported where couples have been taken into the craft and examined. One individual reported that he had been &apos;force&apos; to cohabit with an attractive humanoid from the crew, but maybe this was only wishful thinking. Others less fortunate have had only contact with robot-like creatures who attempted a capture but were unsuccessful and left at daylight.

Even in drudgy old Milwaukee we have a phenomenon where a like-described event occurs each morning about 2:00 am on weekdays.

It&apos;s called Closing Counters of the Thirst Kind. So much for trying to open a serious subject.



SATANIC PROGRAM

Last evening on ABC&apos;s 20/20 there was a review of Satanic worship in the United States; it was unbelievable!

The grisly show touched on Satanic religion and its symbols, Satanic cults, the usage of Satanic philosophy in modern music, and other subjects too depraved to mention. I only hope that ABC shows this program again, and if they do, Alpha will list the time and date.

It seems that there are more Evils in the world than we really are aware of, and a group that preys on children to take their lives in sacrifice should be ground to extinction.

Perhaps some of the Alphans can give us some more information on Satanic worship in the United States; go to it!



HVY MTL

If wearing those T-shirts are any indications of prevalency then the so-called satanic forces must be going hot and heavy. Most of the kids, even the very young, have Crue and similar type logos on their clothes. The pictures alone are scary - until you see the faces behind the pictures and see that most are just ordinary kids (or old geezers) behind the makeup.

For example, all of the negative stuff I heard about Ozzy Osbourne built him up in my mind as one of the more evil of the pro-satanists because of his wild, on-stage activities, and wouldn&apos;t have let my kids go to one of his concerts. However, after we videotaped one of Ozzie&apos;s concerts, the truth became apparent. Ozzie was a short, chubby kid who was a fine musician, with a normal wife and kids, and was funnier than hell on stage. Most of the audience just looked like they were there for a good time, and had one.

I guess it&apos;s like the mystique surrounding a legendary football player or other sports hero. We used to go bowling with Tony Kubek before he became a star with the Yankees, bigger than life. Seeing him on visits to Milwaukee, he was just the same old quiet kid without a halo. It&apos;s the same with the rockers - take away the makeup and wild stuff and you end up with the Four Aces, or some such.

I think the worst phase of the heavy metal offerings is the lyrics that appear to advocate the satanist approach. Yet, I also think that most kids know it&apos;s all tinsel and noise, and can accommodate it without adverse psychological effect.

It would seem that it is the organized satanists and devil worshippers and their unspeakable practices that we must watch for.

Ever hear of any of this stuff in the Milwaukee or Wisconsin area?



WHAT YOU SEE......

Or hear, is what you get - when you want it. In my own skeptical way I also could believe that the backwards phrases are placed in the songs and then leaked so someone can have the pleasure of searching for and finding them. It wouldn&apos;t be the first time that sort of marketing strategy was employed to sell wax or tape.

They did play the &apos;my sweet satan&apos; bit on the 20/20 show, and it had an impact on the show hosts. Even Barbara Walters lost her overage cutesy look and seemed grim as the rest. It wasn&apos;t a pretty show, because its message was to the effect that, if this is true, then there&apos;s trouble ahead somewhere; and secondly, if this is really going on, let&apos;s flush it out and put a stop to it. The &apos;it&apos; that I&apos;m speaking of is the ceremonial murder of children and the dastardly use of the bodies later.

I think the show woke up a few police departments and law enforcement agencies who would have in the past shrugged off any connection between a murder or kidnapping and a potential satanist activity.

One of the show&apos;s messages seemed to deal with the morbid attraction for death, people lying in used coffins, collecting parts of bodies for some unspeakable use (where have I heard of that lately?), where the satanists are concerned.

We live a short distance from a small church; in the past six months its property has been vandalized and the satanist term &apos;666&apos; posted with spray paint. And it&apos;s not the only area church getting this treatment.

As far as the kids becoming satanists, it&apos;s just possible that what they wear and sing is the old rebelist activities of the young in order to shock the parents. But if there is a real satanist movement, they might unwittingly be doing the devil&apos;s work.

I&apos;m surely not a gung ho religionist, as you may have perceived, but when it comes to satanist attitude, I&apos;m on the side of the Angels!



SATANIST ACTIVITIES

Can you add anything to the discussion on satanists and their activities here or in other areas of the US? It seems that the groups are active in the more free-thinking parts of a given city (I&apos;d include the east side in that description) and in less populated suburban areas.

When I visited the British Museum (what a name-dropper) I found they had a comprehensive section on devil and satan worship, and it was there long ago I learned first about the infamous Hell Fire club. It seems that chapters of that club still exist in England, as evidenced by the scandalous reports of such activities within the last five years.

Do you know of any bookstores that carry the satanist books, or of places that handle satanist paraphernalia here in town. I&apos;m certain there will be several in the Chicago area.

From what I saw in that 20/20 program, satanism is a function completely in disagreement with the noble purposes of man, and its practice should be exposed when its rituals include ceremonial sacrifice and other low, degrading practices involving the kidnapping and killing of children.

I am totally against satanism, and perhaps in that position I have finally discovered a subject on which we can agree.



LES FEMMES

There&apos;s a big sign posted at a Baltic Sea resort named Palanga in Lithuania. All it says is, &quot;Women&apos;s Beach.&quot; What it really designates is a foreign goods black market, run by women.

Not very interesting?

Well, the gimmick is that all of the female vendors, and their female customers, are nude. Men are barred because it was feared they might be policemen, among other things.

It was mentioned that some police officers are women; the answer was, not many women are attached to the police, and how could one prove she were a cop if she had nothing on? My question was, where do they keep their money? Probably on a little bag around their necks, the bag being too small to hold a gun, handcuffs, badge, and I.D.

Thus do Lithuanian women bare all for capitalism!



LOVE IN THE CHINA HILLS

It seems that some creatures stalk the backwoods, mountains, and forests primeval of China. They are called Yeren, or wild people by the Chinese, and could be related closely to the Yeti of the Himalayas, or the Bigfoot of the northwestern United States.

There have been over 300 sightings of the homosimian creatures, both male and female. What has this to do with the feminists? Read on:

A male school teacher in the Hunan Province of China claims to have been courted by one of the female Yeren. She grabbed him in her strong arms and began to carry him away, probably with romantic malice aforethought.

Wriggling in her arms, the teacher managed somehow to hit the wild women in the forehead, whereupon she dropped him and walked off.

Talk about miffed! What does a girl have to do these days?



SHOE SIZE 26

While shopping at Sentry today (just scabbing along) I saw one of the national rags in a rack at checkout; the front page headline was something to the effect that a tribe of Bigfoots had killed two people in the northwest. I couldn&apos;t bring myself to spend 50 cents for the paper, even under an assumed name, but if it is true, why doesn&apos;t the national TV news have it?

And because the name Bigfoot pertains to that alleged stone-age throwback, I was hard pressed to determine to call a tribe of them Bigfoots or the Bigfeet, and settled on Bigfoots.

Kind of like the scientist in London who was ordering mongoose from India and wanted a pair. He sent the following wire:

Gentlemen: Please send me a mongoose. Regards, Professor Smyth-smyth

P.S. While you&apos;re at it, you might as well send me another.

I, myself, don&apos;t see any peril in ordering two mongeese. But, I didn&apos;t have the courage to say Bigfeet, so, as always, I am at my best in rising to crises after the fact. Or is it crisises?



WARS

While in the midst of our union-busting (very low-level) at Sentry Foods yesterday, I saw one of the national rags with a headline proclaiming &apos;thousands watch gigantic UFO battle&apos; or something to that effect. Again I ask, if it were such a tremendous battle, or confrontation, why wasn&apos;t it reported in the major media?

Is there some informal understanding among the news services that anything falling into the category of UFO sightings is routed to an appropriate government agency for examination prior to possible release? Many reports of UFO activity were reported in the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s, dropped off in the 70&apos;s, and appear to be at an inordinately low level in the 80&apos;s.

Or are they low? Is it simply that they are going unreported by the major media, or even the observers, because they don&apos;t want the military to deride the reports as hysteria.

There was many a phenomenon in the 50&apos;s that when reported by an observer was described by some authorities as swamp gas, the planet Venus, an Army weather balloon, or drunkenness on the part of the observer. With reaction like that, who cared to report?

Perhaps when the extraterrestrial watchers land their craft on the White House lawn, we may see some belated Television coverage. Until then, it looks pretty grim for hard news on UFO&apos;s.



STOPS ON THE WAY

We have mentioned here in previous discussions the phenomenon of the great Edgar Cayce (pronounced kay-see). He was the gentleman who had the power, under a hypnotic trance, to visualize the ailment of another human being, and prescribe a treatment to cure the illness.

He was successful in almost every case; in the trance state, he had someone recording what he said for future reference. When awake, he could not recall what he said, or how he knew what to say. His explanation was that it was a gift from God to be used to help people who were ill.

No one was able, although many tried, to prove that Edgar Cayce was anything but what he was, a God-fearing man, Sunday school teacher, and professional photographer. He never became rich because of his gift, and felt it was inappropriate to try to do so.

When the sufferer was brought in, Cayce would simply slip into the sleep or trance state, and begin to speak, usually starting with the words, &quot;I have the body .&quot;

Cayce would relate the manner of the illness and prescribe the proper medicines to be taken, and in almost every instance the person became well again, although some of the treatments were unusual.

Now, all of the preceding was preliminary to the day&apos;s subject. While Cayce was in the sleep state, someone got the idea to ask him about other incidents and occurrences in history, and Cayce began describing past peoples, events and civilizations as far back as Atlantis.

Among the topics touched on was reincarnation, and came up when Cayce casually mentioned that the patient he was helping once was a slave girl in the Palaces of Rome during Caligula&apos;s time.

This opened up an entire new field for research. Cayce would be asked about each new sufferer, and who they were in the past. Documentation was kept on each, and a body of literature developed on reincarnation by his foundation, The Association for Research and Enlightenment, in Virginia Beach, Va. (Note: The location of the A.R.E. has been changed)

These are the basic concepts concerning reincarnation as established by hundreds of Cayce trance-state sessions:

1. After the spirit originates from God, it passes through many separate lives. In each life it is treated in accordance with the actions of the previous life. If a person has lived by the golden rule, he generally is rewarded in the successive life. If a person has done evil things in a previous life, he pays in the subsequent life.

Cayce had treated a man blind from birth, who wondered why he should be so afflicted. It was found that the man was an executioner in a past reincarnation, who delighted in blinding his victims before execution.

A woman who had a paralysis was found to have had a perfect face and body in an existence in the courts of Atlantis, and who flaunted her physical beauty and used it to the detriment of others.

A man who was a crippled beggar in the Eastern lands, but who had lived his life to help others, was returned as a rich and successful business entrepreneur, who also was a good Christian.

2. Cayce brought out the fact that the spirit beings gain or lose merit in each reincarnation. If the spirit reaches a life where the degree of Merit has surpassed a given point, the spirit no longer returns to the physical human existence, but transcends the temporal plane and achieves the next higher step.

This interpretation, Cayce said, did not conflict with the Christian teachings, but augmented the real purpose as explained in the Bible and other Holy works. However, the spirits who continued to fall short of accumulating the necessary merit were force to continue the reincarnation cycle until they fulfilled the requirements of merit.

The higher step that Cayce mentioned, was not described in detail, being one of the ultimate truths that he was not to relate to those of the present earth. Hints of it seemed to indicate that the next step along the way to some grand and glorious future goal, was the joining of the spirits of merit become one in order to overcome yet one more obstacle on the path.

It can be noted how near the Cayce interpretations are to certain of the Eastern philosophies and beliefs. They seem to draw elements of the Koran, the Bible, the B/Vita, and the Torah into a single fundamental principle of sequence, correlating the conception of the spirit&apos;s passing through life and death in an inexorable journey to an inevitable goal. Cayce also said that our marriage partners in each life generally tend to be the same, whether that&apos;s a blessing or not to you.

Does the Cayce theory make sense in terms of what we have all been taught in our various exposures to religion. Does the concept indicate any discord in the face of what we have been thought?



CAYCIAN PORTENTS

I think California is still there physically, but that&apos;s all I can say on it. Now don&apos;t get the impression that I&apos;m a Cayce true believer; all that I know is he seemed to actually have the talents described when he was alive; but, concerning the Atlantis thing, it was mentioned that in this era there would be discoveries made in the Bimini area. I seem to recall that observers and some divers have seen blocks of cut stone that looked like walls or parts of buildings. Maybe this will be explored in more detail sometime soon.

Another &apos;prophecy&apos; he was supposed to have made was the emergence of China as a Christian Nation in the years to come, and a turning away from the present social philosophy. This progress would appear to have started with the actions of the Chinese with regard to the allowing of capitalist programs, and the easing of many of the communist doctrinaire restrictions.

Even though I&apos;ve disclaimed a believer status with all of Cayce&apos;s words, I really do hope what he said with respect to China was true, and his thoughts on reincarnation, if valid, make more sense than a lot of what I learned in Catholic school.

It certainly would make kicking the bucket somewhat more palatable.



LIFE AND DEATH

On such a profound subject, I can&apos;t, or perhaps don&apos;t wish to, believe that death is the final step. There are hints, mostly circumstantial, that something else does indeed lie beyond; however, I would rather accept Cayce&apos;s version of the transitions than those of the various world religions, most of which are on a sin-no sin salvation basis, and on the rules posited thereof wouldn&apos;t give me a 3-day pass to Limbo.



MARILYN MONROE

A beautiful and tragic subject. Most of the Alphans know that MM was romantically involved with John and Bobby Kennedy, and that she was about to call a press conference in which the facts of the matter would be released.

In a baffling coincidence, Marilyn Monroe was found dead two weeks before the press conference was to take place. The facts in the case were covered up in the same manner that the nefarious deeds of Chappaquiddick were covered up - by Kennedy money and clout; at least according to many historians.

The saddest of all is that the media, who knew what was going on but would not expose it because of their Kennedy ties, are the ones who caused MM&apos;s death, indirectly. Because no facts were released, the sinister forces involved were able to silence MM in the ultimate manner, and put the blame on pills and alcohol.

When will the American people be able to learn all of the facts about the MM tragedy, the Chappaquiddick drowning, and the other bones in the Kennedy closet. If it would have been Nixon, the media slimes would have been in full ooze.



WEIRDO!

Mentioned was the name of Helen Blavatsky, a guru of the New Age.

I have read some of her jolly stuff, and my feeling is that if her writings constitute the bases of the New Age philosophy, that movement will be short lived. Blavatsky is one of the more weird of the pseudo-occult writers, and will be dismissed by anyone with a smattering of scientific education. She&apos;s on a sub-par with Velikovsky only in a different perspective.



4.0 The Middle East Morass

As in the Balkans, India, Africa, and other hot spots of the world, the Middle East has always been an area existing through centuries of conflict, not solely between different ethnic groups, but between different religions and philosophies.

Consider Jerusalem itself! The ancient city is the holy home to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and each can make a claim to a part of it on theological grounds. For Jews, the Wailing Wall is sacred; for Moslems, the Temple Mosque is held in undying reverence; for Christians, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the tomb of Jesus after the Crucifixion.

Consider the Holy Books of the three faiths. The Christian Bible with its New and Old Testament is held to be the word of God. The Holy Koran represents the words of Allah to the Islamic faithful; and, the Old Testament, or Torah, of the Jews is the true word of Yahweh to them.

Compounding the difficulties lying therein, are the offshoots of the three great faiths. The Moslems are fragmented into sub-groups such as Shiite and Sunni; the Jews into Orthodox and Reform; Christianity into Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox. And each has its own set of mores to which the faithful must adhere.

The title of this chapter indeed suggests a morass, an area in which the unwary may become entangled in an amalgam of religion and philosophy that have no perceptible dividing lines, and where faith and secularism are as one.

Thus we must present the sense of the Alpha discussions without regard to philosophy or religion and describe the events of discourse which rose to prominence in the time frame under discussion, no matter when they occurred.

Some may suggest that the middle east arguments made were merely exercises in so-called anti-semitism, and an excuse to bash Israel.

Not true! We bash anyone!

Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Israel, the PLO, the IDF, Egypt, the United States, Libya, assorted terrorists, and other countries did what they did, and their actions noted for discussion. Some countries or individuals do not dispute the facts of the events, they merely dislike anyone&apos;s mentioning them.

This is why, in the Alpha-Omega tradition, there is always enough controversy to anger anyone, any faction - without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin.

Alpha consists of opinions, surmises, conclusions, inferences, accusations, deductions, attacks, and defenses.

Controversial?

That&apos;s what Alpha is for!

AN ISRAELI VIEW

The Consul for Press and Information at the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles, ILAN ELGAR, has commented on the subject of Arab-Israeli relations, and which group has the right to what is now called Israel, and why. These are excerpts from his statements:

&quot;To seek an equitable resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the first priority must be to establish a clear historical basis in principle for rights and claims. Only on the basis of such a truthful historical perspective can pragmatic questions be approached for negotiation.

&quot;...The truth is that the place called Palestine was never the ancient homeland of the Arabs who live in Israel and the &quot;West Bank.&quot; Neither in history nor in international law has &quot;Palestine&quot; ever been a country, still less an Arab country.

&quot;For millenia the historically decisive term for the area was Eretz Israel - the land of Israel - a name given to it not by extremist nationalist Jews in 1948 or 1967, but by the emancipated children of Israel after their exodus from Egypt under Moses, some 3,500 years ago.

&quot;Certainly, the story begins with the Bible - with the account in Genesis of the patriarch Abraham and the covenant he forged with his God and his land - a covenant that Jews continue to recall in the ritual circumcision of their

8-day old sons.

&quot;The Jewish claim to Israel begins with the Bible, not because the Bible is a political document, but because it shaped the consciousness of the Jews for 3,500 years and made of them a distinct people; because every day for 70 generations Jews turned to Zion in prayer, study and yearning.

&quot;The Jewish people&apos;s right...is a right grounded in the most ancient and unbroken &quot;...another widely disseminated myth: that a place called Palestine is the ancient national homeland for the Arabs of the West Bank...

&quot;The territory of Palestine was conquered by many different armies, including those of the Arabs, but the whole of Palestine never really belonged to the Arabs, and it is far from clear historically that the present Arab population is all indigenous to the land.

&quot;Palestine was never exclusively an Arab country, even though Arabic gradually became the language of the majority population after the Arab invasions of the 7th century. There never was an Arab state in Palestine, and there never was a separate Palestinian Arab nation.

&quot;Palestinian Arabs never created their own self-contained unit or any form of political or social identity; they were not autonomous at any time.

&quot;...the Arabs of Palestine did not constitute a distinctive national group.

&quot;...Palestinian Arabs may well have felt a profound kinship and tie to their native town or village, or to the piece of land they lived on and cultivated. But never did they conceive of &quot;Palestine&quot; as their &quot;homeland&quot; - which it never was.

&quot;One of the basest canards of anti-Zionist propaganda has been that, whatever else the Jews may have accomplished in Palestine, they ignored or were indifferent to the existence of an Arab population there. Nothing could be further from the truth.&quot;



AN ARAB VIEW

Statements on the Middle East problems by Mrs. Bushra Kanafani, minister council and charge d&apos;affaires for the Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C. as told to reporter Charles M. Fischbein:

On the roots of terrorism:

&quot;The roots lie in the Arab-Israeli conflict, in the grievances of the Palestinian people, and the massacres committed against them, in stripping the Palestinians of their identity, in denying them the right to their heritage.

&quot;Those are the roots of the problem and we deplore them.

&quot;The Syrians have a just cause. It is to solve the Arab-Israeli problem and to help the Palestinians.

&quot;We don&apos;t want to see any more violence. We want this problem to be solved not by causing any more killings, not by answering the terrorism of desperate people by state terrorism, but by addressing the roots of the problem.&quot;

Discussing problems with the Israeli government:

&quot;We would talk to the Israelis through the framework of an international conference, with the two major powers there, and with other members of the UN Security Council.

&quot;It is a conflict that affects international security. Therefore it should be solved through such a framework.

&quot;We want to discuss the root issue, the key issue: the future of the Palestinian people. We want them to have a state from what is still left of Palestine, namely the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians are not opposed to such a settlement. This, by itself, is a major concession.

&quot;If such a conference takes place, and Israel agrees to withdrawal of the forces occupying the lands taken since 1967, and recognition of the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, which means the right to have their own state, then the question of borders will have been solved, and the roots of the problem will have been solved.&quot;

On issues:

&quot;We think that unless there is a Palestinian state, then everybody is stuck. This is the main issue. It is not the Golan Heights; it was never the Sinai; it is a Palestinian state.&quot;

On religion:

&quot;I want to stress the fact that our problem in the Arab world is not Judaism as a religion; it is Zionism as a political movement.

&quot;Let me tell you that in Islam we consider Judaism a holy religion. There are three holy religions. The first is Judaism, the second Christianity, and the third Islam.

&quot;Throughout history Jews were not persecuted in the Arab world. This is an historical fact.

&quot;As a Moslem I am taught to respect Judaism as a holy religion. The Koran is full of verses referring to the prophet Moses. We have never persecuted Jews. Let&apos;s face it, throughout history Jews were persecuted in other parts of the world, under other flags, not the flags of Islam.&quot;

&quot;When the Jews were in Andalusia, in Spain, they were protected by the Arabs. They were prospering while they were living with the Arabs. The roots of many Jews in north Africa are from Spain because they lived and prospered with the Arabs.&quot;

On anti-semitism:

&quot;How can an Arab be an &apos;anti-semite?&apos; I am a Semite. The Arabs are all Semites. Look at the distortion of facts by the Zionists.&quot;

Closing statement:

&quot;Today we are paying the price for persecution that was done by others.&quot;



BOMB THE TERRORISTS

Some think that bombs would be best delivered to Damascus, who is now controlling Lebanon, and to Teheran who is promoting the Shiite terrorist activities, and to Algiers because of their terrorist training schools.

And even then, keep the targets military.

Sources from the mideast indicate that many of the Iranians are sick to death of the Ayatollah and his religious weirdos, and would love to have the Shah back; this may happen. Iranian mothers don&apos;t want their 12 and 13 year old sons used to blow up mines in a mine field just so the main troops can advance. The women there dislike intensely wearing the black shawls of the ancient Persian females; the men don&apos;t like the anti-alcohol views of the government.

It has not been widely reported, but there are riots in the streets by dissident Iranians, protesting conditions; the rioters were not killed out of hand, but allowed to get their frustrations released. It may be that when the Ayatollah gets his just deserts, the infighting after the funeral will turn into a factional bloodbath, and the interest of those who want to see the Pahlevi&apos;s return may be fulfilled.

Much of the middle east unrest has been caused by our lop-sided backing of the Israeli governments. We have furnished them the weapons with which they blew up the reactor of a sovereign country, out of hand. Our money has allowed Israel to maintain a military posture of strength and invasion. When you give a child a new ..22 rifle, he wants to use it.

 

What we need in the middle east is a more even-handed policy towards both Israelis and Arabs. But, this suggestion of reason does not include the head of the Algerian government who is a turkey that should be considered in open season.



MONKEY WRENCHES

It seems that a middle east peace meeting was getting too close to reality for the Israelis. Because of an incident where 3 Israelis were killed in an attack on a boat, the Israeli government saw fit to attack a sovereign nation, Tunisia, 1500 miles away in the name of revenge.

They did this in spite of the fact that it was not proved the boat killers were members of the PLO.

We can only assume that the Israelis wanted to weasel out of peace talks so they chose the way that would most irritate the Arabs. They committed an act of war in order that the battle would continue. Many responsible people in Europe have said that Israel is simply a bandit nation with arms supplied by the US, whose only aim is to become dominant in the middle east. It&apos;s getting more and more difficult to argue against that position. Cut off the US money supply to Israel and Egypt!



HOSTAGES

What will anyone wager that the Achille Laurel terrorists will claim that the sole victim had a heart attack so they threw him overboard?

Wait for it.

As soon as I heard what had happened I turned on short wave. The BBC, Radio Nederland, and Voice of Germany all carried play by play news casts much of the night. I didn&apos;t get much sleep.

So far there has been no identification of the terrorist group.



THE ATTACK ON THE USS LIBERTY

It was reported recently by a Zionist publication that the USS Liberty must have accidentally sailed into a zone where the Israelis were holding target practice.

A report from someone who allegedly was on the scene does carry some weight, and I think has presented the Israeli-backed version very well.

But, research is till continuing, and there will be reports posted. The data seems to suggest, however, that reports of heavy fog and clouds in the area were incorrect.



TERRIFIED TURKEY

You can bet a good part of the ranch that Mumu KaDaffy is shaking in direct relationship to the distance between him and the US strike force.

KaDaffy Duck&apos;s vaunted armed forces, about which he brags so much, are probably in the same league as the Swiss Navy when it comes to actual fighting. Remember how a few hundred French troops kept his thousands of elite from over-running another small African country a few years ago. If the Libyan army were as strong as he states, they would have thrown Kadaffy out long ago; the army is just strong enough to repel peasants with pitchforks, but not strong enough to get rid of the Duck.

And his Soviet Bloc weapons have been around for some time, and if the Kadaffy maintenance program is as efficient as the country usually is, there may be sand in all the mechanisms.

It&apos;s well to note that Reagan has not got into a war of words with the hapless bigmouth Duck, but instead is letting the actions speak. Perhaps there will be no overt US strike (although I hope there is), but the aim will be to irritate Kadaffy into making the first attack move, whereupon the minaret will fall on him.

It appears as though even the Soviets have taken a negative stance with regard to Kadaffy&apos;s terrorist posture, leaving the door wide open for western retaliation.

All we can say is, duck, Kadaffy Duck!

(and I wish I hadn&apos;t said it, but, ces&apos;t la canard)



DOWN THE DRAIN

It seems as though Radio Nederland was correct about a huge appropriation going to Israel. The New York Times said that the grant to Israel was being increased 1.5 billion dollars. This mean that the outright grant (no payback) to Israel will be $7.5 billion dollars over the next two year period. This is equivalent to over $1500 to every man, woman, and child living there. And that doesn&apos;t even count what the Egyptians are going to get out of us. What a gigantic con game!

I&apos;m certain there are poor people in the U.S., Jews, Arabs, and other ethnic groups who could better use that money. Is the release of this information anti-semitic? Not at all. It&apos;s just a suggestion that our money is best kept at home where it can do US citizens some good.

Why don&apos;t we just make Israel and Egypt the 51st and 52nd states and let them take their economic lumps the same as the others do? Funny, but sad...



WAIT A MINUTE!

Don&apos;t even try to equate our Americans of Jewish faith with the government of Israel; it&apos;s like saying our German-Americans are loyal to Bonn instead of the United States. Simply because I was brought up as a Catholic doesn&apos;t mean that I approve of what the Catholic IRA is doing in Ulster. Leave religion out of it!

Your statement about Israel supplying us with the latest technology just doesn&apos;t hold water; it&apos;s been the other way around. And it&apos;s been proved that Israel has furnished information on our weapons systems to agents of the Soviet Union (want some facts and figures?). This is why I dislike the government of Israel; one of its face smiles at us while the other sneers as we hand over the money. Israel has put up roadblocks to every peace effort in the past 8 years, always setting conditions for peace, and then always asking for a little more.

Instead of giving that 6 to 8 billion dollars of to-be-forgiven aid to Israel, let&apos;s provide it to our own farmers and poor. If Israel is so great at advancements in technology, as some say, cut off the financial umbilicus and let it sink or swim on its own merits. Likewise Egypt, Syria, Iran, India, and any other place we&apos;ve thrown money down a rat hole.

I suppose there are some Jews who put Israel ahead of America because of religion, but there were Lutheran Germans who put the Nazi movement ahead of their American loyalties in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s. I say to hell with both their houses, pox and all.

The Israeli government at present is merely a number of factions whose only cohesion stems from a hatred of the Arabs, and if the Arabs vanished mysteriously overnight, the infighting in that religious/communal state would be wondrous to behold.

Peace in the middle east? Just wait until Begin and Sharon get back into power and start shooting up people with American-supplied armaments. Will we hear criticism from the Jerusalem Post? Not a chance! Just a request from the Israeli armed forces to speed up the delivery of munitions, no checks, please.

So, as far as I&apos;m concerned, a person can be either German, Israeli, Irish, English, Mexican, or whatever in his citizenship, or he can be an American, but not both at the same time, with identical loyalties; a choice has to be made.



DAFFY DUCK, PLUCKED

The stage is already being set to hammer Daffy in his own back yard. The administration spokesmen have pinned the blame on daffy for both terrorist acts. It&apos;s simply a matter of time before the US takes action against his military in retaliation.

My opinion is that Jesse Jackson, along with his liberal friends, should travel to Libya and be observers at all the Soviet-furnished SAM batteries. This will allow them a first-hand look at whether or not US forces have functioning systems, or if they are the ill-equipped pushovers that the liberals have accused them of being.

If Daffy could read, he would see &apos;mene, mene, tekel, upharsin&apos; on the nearest wall, superimposed over the anti-American grafitti.

In glow red, white, and blue.



THE INFAMOUS EICHMAN

The name of Adolph Eichman was brought up in a discussion. Does anyone feel that it was legitimate for the Israelis to kidnap him from his home and put him on trial for crimes against a state that did not even exist during the period of time that the crimes took place, subsequently executing him?

Does anyone believe that John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian emigre, should be deported to Israel to face trial (and probably execution) for &quot;crimes&quot; he was supposed to have committed, based on evidence provided by the KGB?

Does anyone think that any of the labeled Nazi War Criminals should be captured and shipped to Israel for &apos;treatment&apos; instead of to Germany, where the alleged crimes were committed?

Does anyone think that the hard-liner Israelis who were guilty of setting up the slaughter in the Arab refugee camp should be turned over to some future Palestinian government for prosecution as war criminals?

With my Jewish friends, there is a great diversity of opinion on all of the possibilities.



KANGAROO COURT

Mr. John Demjanjuk, a retired auto worker, was put on trial in Israel today on what many say are trumped-up charges. The prosecution has accused Demjanjuk of torturing and gassing 850,000 Jews in a concentration camp.

Here is what the defense says are the facts:

The ID card that supposedly identified Demjanjuk was totally different from any card of that time issued to military or civilian personnel. No one can furnish any other card similar to it. But the US government used the card as evidence in Demjanjuk&apos;s having his citizenship withdrawn. It was then turned over to the Israelis for use at the trial. Where did the card originate? It was produced by the Soviets and given to our State Department for use against Demjanjuk.

Two alleged eye-witnesses have identified Demjanjuk as the prison guard known as &apos;Ivan the Terrible&apos; because of his cruelty towards prisoners. They have given sworn testimony to this effect in US Government civil hearings against Demjanjuk in a US court. Unfortunately, these same two witnesses testified 40 some years ago that the guard known as Ivan the Terrible was killed in an inmate riot back then, and his body was thrown into a blazing building. Why has their story changed?

The majority of Israelis have an abiding hatred for Ukrainians, and it is feared that because Demjanjuk is Ukrainian by birth he will be found guilty and be executed simply because he is a Ukrainian. Does that sound reasonable? Here is what Mordechai Fuchs, an Israeli, shouted out after the first phase of the trial today:

&quot;Demjanjuk strangled with his hands my entire family. All the Ukrainians are murderers. I was there. They stomped on me like a rag.&quot;

Fuchs failed to note that Stalin, in a true holocaust, killed about 12 million Ukrainians by starvation.

The trial is not being held in front of a jury, but before a three-judge panel. This is the only way that Demjanjuk could hope to get a fair and impartial hearing based on hard evidence, and even so it is the fact that the world will be watching the Israelis to see if the evidence is weighed fairly, or if it will be simply another Israeli propaganda show.

The trial is being held in a theater, appropriately enough.

Note: In a talk show on the subject originating from WMAQ, two representatives from Simon Wiesenthal&apos;s group stated that they had a list of over 70 Nazi war criminals who are living in the US, of which about 20 reside in Chicago.

However, the last Chicago &quot;nazi war criminal&quot; they hounded into poverty, along with his family, was found innocent of all charges. No reparation was ever paid to the man by the &quot;nazi-hunters&quot; for his ordeal.

&quot;Kill him for his bad verses!&quot;



DOUBLE STANDARD

The Israelis, in their zeal, are trying Demjanjuk for an alleged crime of 40 some years ago.

However, they are trying to get their spy, Jonathan Pollard, away from the US because he &apos;only was trying to help out his true country.&apos;

The Associated Press today said that further revelations indicate that Pollard turned over US secrets of vast import to Israel, secrets that will have a profound and chilling effect on our military capabilities.

He should be executed as a warning to other spies, from wherever!



FROM MEIR KAHANE

Qoutes from some of Rabbi Meir Kahane&apos;s latest talks in the US and Canada:

&quot;We must raise money for a new Israeli underground that must be ready to strike our enemies wherever they threaten us.&quot;

&quot;We have been losers for centuries. Now we are winners, and I don&apos;t care whether the world likes it or not.&quot;

&quot;We must guard our strength and increase it every day. And the best way to show strength is direct action: Hit your enemies before they hit you.&quot;

&quot;Advocates of American even-handedness in foreign policy are a menace to Israel that must be exterminated.&quot; (On his list are several Arab nationalist groups and right-wing news magazines who have said we should treat all middle east nations in the same even-handed manner. He attacked them as &quot;anti-Israeli, amplifiers of Arab arguments, and spear carriers of Arab attacks on Israel.&quot;)

Responses:

Intelligence and security specialists at the United Nations who have ignored Kahane in the past said they are concerned about his latest efforts to develop a terrorist network.

&quot;If this man ever targeted me for a hit, I think I&apos;d move, &quot; said a UN aide with responsibility for protecting Arab UN delegates. &quot;When this man talks of &apos;hitting adversaries&apos; he is as menacing as any gangster. This man means murder.&quot;

&quot;It seems absurd, senseless, but in reality it demonstrates the pervasive infiltration of the White House by Israeli agents, many of whom got their start in politics as terrorist hitmen. Their latest victim seems to have been the credibility and international standing of the Reagan administration itself, &quot; said the deputy chief of a Persian Gulf nation&apos;s UN mission.

Incidentally, Meir Kahane, although representing and serving in the parliament of a foreign nation, has successfully retained his US citizenship, thus enjoying the status of being a citizen of both the US and Israel.

How can we permit this?

My position is that one is either a citizen of the US or a citizen of a foreign country, but should not be allowed to hold both citizenships simultaneously.

If an American citizen tried also to obtain German citizenship, and be elected to the Bundestag representing Bavaria, there would be an uproar so loud it would shake the northeast coast, and much of it from the same sources who see nothing wrong with Kahane and other Israelis holding dual citizenship. There would be headlines in Kirkland&apos;s Jerusalem Post. Should dual citizenships be allowed?

Note: I wonder if Kahane is a proponent of the theory that Jews were not of this earth, in accordance with Marc Dem&apos;s book, The Lost Tribes From Outer Space.



LOYALTY

Dual citizenship implies dual loyalty, taxes notwithstanding.

And can there be dual loyalty? When there is friction between the nations to which is an individual is citizen, to which nation does he cleave?

My position is that one is a citizen of one nation, the nation to whom he wishes to owe his allegiance. How can Meir Kahane stand up and recite the Pledge of Allegiance before the US flag and also recite Israel&apos;s version of the Pledge before the Israeli flag, and be sincere in both efforts.

No way!

I read Kahane&apos;s remarks that simply because of religion, Jews in the US should give up their homes and jobs here and move to Israel - just because they are Jewish. Does he think because I&apos;m Catholic I should pack up and move to the Vatican?

I think the Jewish response to his call is going to be one of supreme indifference. The vast majority of us are Americans first, regardless of religion, and won&apos;t heed the cracked siren cry of the half-baked idealist who has a number of screws loose.



TAKE ACTION!

I must agree with the proposed disintegration of the Beirut airport; what I don&apos;t agree with is the warnings that the action will occur. Prewarning an enemy that an activity will commence is tantamount to giving him time to defend.

And I don&apos;t mean defend the airport. In the middle east arsenal there must be a number of Exocet missiles that could harm the Nimitz and its crew. It only takes one to cause an embarrassment.

There are a number of marxist states who have touchdown facilities for the hijackers; Beirut, Libya, Cuba, etc.; they should be warned that any hijacked planes landing will automatically call for massive retaliation to the airport itself if the plane is allowed to be refueled and/or reprovisioned. Fairly soon they would run out of places to land; and if they landed in the Soviet Union, they would not get a welcome because of global political considerations; the Soviets don&apos;t want to destroy the image of peace they falsely project for protecting some two-bit gunmen.

Reagan is relatively obvious in the fact that he is letting popular opinion reach a pitch where he can act without drawing extensive fire from the liberals and pinkos; when the public demands action, action will be condoned, and there&apos;s not much the crybabies will be able to do.



HI JACK!

Being the bloodthirsty type that I am, I say let the United States issue a warning to those bandit states who train the terrorists, such as Iran, Libya, and Syria that if the hostages are not returned within 24 hours that the airports of those countries, civilian and military, will be turned to rubble as a first step, with others steps to follow.

This type of action will bring wails from the liberals and communists, cries from the third world idiots, and cheers from most everyone else.

This entire situation may or may not have come about if Israel had not illegally taken Shiite hostages from Lebanon over the border into Israel. Why does the US continually support these actions by a tiny country whose only claim to fame is its military power, which is supplied by us? Israel would dump the US as a friend in a second, if it suited their needs; if we turned off the money supply ($3400 this year for every Israeli family) they would disdain us as they disdain the Arabs.

It&apos;s been said that if Israel were on friendly terms with their neighbors in the region, they would tear themselves apart because of the many factions in the country; it seems they always talk peace, but abhor its actuality. Whenever a chance comes up, they inevitably find fault and talk it to death. My view of the Israelis (and many successful Jews in America have the same view) is someone with a smile, holding his palm out for more, and more, and more...



NEVER GIVE IN!

It&apos;s easy to say that the US is giving in to middle east terrorists when what we do behind the scenes is not apparent. And the reason the administration must work behind the scenes is that the liberal press and its liberal lackeys in the Congress and elsewhere would scream their chicken heads off if overt actions are performed by our military.

Laws have been passed by these left-wing cowards that completely inhibit the president&apos;s options, and must be completely justified, such as in the case of Grenada, by events and with the blessing of the people.

If it weren&apos;t for the fact that the polls were overwhelmingly in favor of the Grenada incident, there still would be hearings in the House and talk of impeachment by the yellow-bellies.

Almost all anti-terrorist activity must be performed clandestinely these days to stem the inevitable hue and cry from the left; perhaps the effects are not yet visible, at least not enough to satisfy the ignorant critics, but they will be in the future, in spite of the strident wailings of the phonies that keep saying nothing is being done. Those weepers in the wilderness are the last ones that any prudent leader would inform as to what was actually planned.



PARANOIA

I&apos;m not trying to politicize the situation in terms of paranoia whether or not it comes from Israel, Egypt, Iran, Libya, or any number of countries that seem to be operating in a subjectively political system. In concise terms - they are all cuckoo!

Too many fall into the trap of confusing being of the Jewish religion with Israeli identity; they are far from being one and the same. I&apos;m not accusing you of doing so; my major point is this: we are bankrolling the Israeli military and domestic economy beyond the point of reason, on the flimsy basis that they are our close &apos;friends and allies.&apos;

I submit that they are our friends, just as many other countries are, right up to the last dollar, and if the flow were cut off today, the so-called friendship would immediately become frigid. It&apos;s the same with Egypt. It was the same with India, down whose rat hole we poured billions of dollars so they could achieve the status of a &apos;non-aligned&apos; nation, with the typical arrogance of a world welfare recipient. It is only with Rajiv Ghandi that they have a chance to become a &apos;normal&apos; nation, on their own.

And in the past, when I did call attention to the fact that India was a beggar nation, grasping for our aid, and sneering as they accepted it, no one objected to the criticism. It has only been when Israel was involved that the real objection started.

Of course, I couldn&apos;t care less about the objections; I feel the same way about other giveaway schemes wherein our dollars flow to the beggar countries, and I&apos;ll probably continue taking the heat, which is fine because that&apos;s what Alpha is for.

I can&apos;t know for sure, but I&apos;ll wager if Albert Einstein were forced to live in Israel today, he would be on a plane to the US as soon as possible. Einstein was passionate in his anti-war stance, and would have objected most strenuously to living in a war-like, military/religious state such as Israel is today, and such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the like also are.



MURDER IN EGYPT

Not much has been said about the murders of the visitors from Israel while they were in the Cairo area. The slaughter was claimed by some Egyptian terror group, as though it were something creditable, instead of the reprehensible and cowardly deed it was.

If two groups are fighting each other, and both sides are armed with whatever, the death that ensues can be accepted as the inevitable occurrence accompanying the type of action involved, as has been proved so many times in so many wars.

This was out and out murder, and should be condemned just as much by those who condemned the refugee camp murders.

I may disagree with policies of the Israeli government, but to snuff out the lives of Israeli visitors in another land just for the sake of doing it is dastardly - whether done by the KGB, the Mossad, the PLO, or any of the various crazies out there.



BLACK HATS AND EGG

There are a lot of people in the US, and the world, who are wearing black hats with respect to Reagan&apos;s policies; many of the wearers are also wearing egg.

Reagan&apos;s use of the phrase &apos;self defense&apos; is a travesty on intention, but a necessary one. Since a past liberal congress installed some complex rules on fighting a military action by committee, any president will be forced to fall back on &apos;self defense&apos; as a rationalization for use of the military to achieve an end.

It is unfortunate that a country such as ours has to rely on equivocation in order to act; however, tangled as the rules may be, they are the difference between the deliberate responses of a rational nation and the paranoid lashings out of a Khadafi or a Khoumani (however it is spelled). Of course I agree with the action; it was precise; it was well executed. The next Lybian terrorist act should evoke a similar, yet more pronounced, reprisal, as should all verifiable terrorist acts.

The real problem lies in definition and identification. Who and where from? Bombing willy nilly is a concept without merit; punishment must be based on proof of guilt. In the recent instance verification seems to have existed, even though we may never know for certain.

On another, yet related theme, the response from some countries initially was one of distancing from the event, with a reluctance on the part of a few to aid the anti-Khadafi punitive strike approach. It appears that the dollars from American bases abroad, and the deterrents which exist by means of the US military presence, are acceptable as long as America maintains a low profile. Perhaps it is time to rethink the idea of stationing troops in countries that are not reliable allies when the chips are down. Britain and West Germany mildly approved the action as grudging afterthought.

Sad reinforcement of the commentary that the more things change, the more they remain the same, among sibs, families, and nations.



FRENCH Ph.D. THESIS

Paris - Henri Roques, 65, a well-known French engineer, was awarded a Ph.D in the discipline of document criticism in June, 1985. Inconsequential? Not really, considering the subject matter of Roques&apos;s doctoral thesis: The late blooming scholar&apos;s research concluded that the famous &quot;Kurt Gerstein&quot; documents - which constitute a veritable foundation for all the major historical works dealing with the &quot;holocaust&quot; of WWII - are in no way any reliable basis for the belief that National Socialist Germany utilized gas chambers in a mass extermination campaign against European Jewry.

The panel of professors who reviewed Rogues&apos;s thesis gave it the highest citation. This was an effective repudiation of the Gerstein papers, which provided in-depth technical information regarding the alleged structure and operation of the gas chambers. Gerstein&apos;s documents, which Roques studied in detail, considering the technical information therein, have been heavily relied upon as a major source by noted historians (such as Raul Hilberg), who have promoted the mass-extermination-by-poison-gas story, which is accepted as an article-of-faith by otherwise responsible historians and by millions of people worldwide.

When news of Roques&apos;s authoritative study leaked out, historian Georges Wellers, himself a noted Marxist, begged the French press not to report the findings. Wellers asked for time to rebut Roques&apos;s thesis, and the press complied.

It took the historian (who is affiliated with the Center for Jewish Documentation in Paris) nearly a year to prepare his response.

In the April issue of a quarterly journal, &quot;Le Monde Juif,&quot; which is published by a French Zionist organization, Wellers went public with his rebuttal, creating a brouhaha that has left Establishment historians spinning.

The French press responded to Wellers&apos;s efforts by proclaiming it weak and ineffective, in short declaring that Roques&apos;s thesis was far superior in quality and far more convincing.

&quot;We have been taken by surprise,&quot; compained one spokesman for a major Zionist organization. &quot;We should not have any discussion on this end at all.&quot;

Roques, a man not driven by political ideology - one who had decided late in life in an entirely new field - had done his homework, and apparently done it well, so much that he almost single-handedly disrupted 40 years of virtually continuous promotion of the mass-extermination-by-gas-chamber story, which historians have long accepted.

End of quote....

Question: Has anyone seen any information on Roques&apos;s doctoral thesis in the American press? A copy of the thesis would make interesting reading. This is the first I&apos;ve even heard of Roques, but considering the theme of his doctoral work, it is not surprising. The author, Richard V. London, is a conservative/populist author and political scientist who has written for a number of conservative publications.



GOOD GOD?

Where did you get the impression that Daffy was revered as a God by the Libyan people? Was it not Libyan army personnel who have tried to assassinate Daffy a half-dozen times?



ISRAELI ANTI-SEMITISM

I mentioned previously that anti-semitic activities were occurring in Israel itself, not Arab inspired, and was asked for substantiating data, as usual, along with the sources, the time, the precise spot, and the name of the person that did the anti-semiting, the accusation being that if complete data were not provided, acceptable in a court of law, then the report was not acceptable.

Well, there is a conflict between sects in Israel, and it&apos;s a sad thing because it doesn&apos;t really concern politics, but views of the Jewish religion.

The Orthodox attack the things they see as indecent, some advertising, sports events on the Sabbath, and the like. They have vandalized bus stops where the ads appear and burned the offices of those secular politicians they hold responsible, even threatening the politicians&apos; lives.

But the secular Jews have fought back, painting swastikas on synagogues, wrecking orthodox religious schools, desecrating sacred Jewish institutions, and ripping prayer shawls.

The publication wherein this news was found said this:

&quot;...Israel has also protected the rights of orthodox Jews as well as the rights of its religious minorities. This has been a practical and fair arrangement that ought to be quickly restored and permanently maintained.

&quot;Orthodox Jews have a right to observe their religious customs, to educate their children and in other ways to live their lives without interference from anybody, most of all from swastika-smearers and book-burners. If a Jew cannot be safe from anti-semitism in Israel, where can he or she be safe?&quot;

The article went on to say that neither group should try to force its religious views on the other, or that a minority should insist that its precepts should be followed by the majority.

&quot;The rule can be expressed simply: Live and let live. It&apos;s the job of the government to enforce that code.&quot;

If you care to read the entire report, it appeared in the Accent section of Sunday&apos;s Milwaukee Journal. And if you&apos;re interested in argument, read the inevitable letters to the editor columns in the coming Journals, and note the fire from both sides on the subject.

Note: I do not capitalize the &apos;S&apos; in anti-semitism; it is a hyphenate word in itself that does not deserve capitalization, like nazism or zionism, or any of many -isms unworthy of a capital, unless leading a sentence, and even then capitalized with reluctance.



SELECTIVE RETRIBUTION

Remember to differentiate between the weirdos congo-ing in the streets and the average Libyan citizen trying to scrape out a living and viewing those placard-waving zombies as nuts on the loose.

It&apos;s the same here in the US, or in Bonn, or in Amsterdam. The identical hairy, unwashed, with a penchant towards anarchy, socialism, Communism, or whatever ism is in fashion at the time, march out (after notifying media) and perform their thing in a knee-jerk reaction of unanimity.

We watch them on TV each evening; in Tripoli they watch out their blinds.

Again, my feeling is that the average Libyan citizen with a family is much like his American counterpart, and in fact does not consider the US the enemy that daffy and the marxists do. So, our strikes at daffy must be very well planned so as to not harm the ordinary Libyan, and in light of past events, not harm the regular army structure. The intent must be to harm daffy and his cohorts, as surgically as possible, to deter them from their terrorist stupidities, killing them outright, if possible, which is a remarkable deterrent.

Let&apos;s do it with finesse.



EVEN WHEN

Even when the Israelis try to do something right, it seems to come out wrong.

Tel Aviv has caused the departure of several Israeli officials in the case where Israeli constabulary beat to death some Arabs after a hi-jacking incident. Why did they do something stupid? Placate the bleeding hearts in the US?

What happened was, some Arab terrorists had kidnapped a bus-load of school children and were preparing to use them as hostage in some sort of terrorist scheme, when they were captured by the Israelis. They were set upon and beat to death while in custody.

It was too good for them. Flaying, comes to mind, as a minimum.



LIBYA/TUNISIA

Libya has had a history of anti-American terrorists acts, with continuing plans for the same, and bases at which terrorists were trained.

Tunisia has had a history of pro-American rulers and people, and committed no terrorist acts against the US or Israel.

Tunisia&apos;s only crime was that it allowed Arabs of the PLO to have a legitimate headquarters on its soil. For this &apos;crime,&apos; its land was attacked by Israeli&apos;s US built war planes, and Tunisian citizens killed.

The Israeli response was over-reaction in choice of a retaliatory site; they had plenty of targets in their part of the world to go after; they had no business in Tunisia; it was just another act of Israeli arrogance with American weaponry.

Of course Israel supported the American action; it had to do so. No use taking a chance on cutting off the free funds from the US which keep their military and economy from sinking into the sand.

I realize those who are ardently pro-Israel, and can rationalize support for their behavior at the drop of a beanie. Therefore I expect the nuance of Lybian/Tunisian difference to be psychologically incomprehensible to you

What I would wish to see is not any pro-Israeli or pro-Arab United States foreign policy, but simply an even-handed policy towards all in the region.

I venture that might be too much to ask.



THE USS LIBERTY AFFAIR

Here are some notes on the Liberty affair quoting Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Moorer has publicly charged many times that the attack was deliberate; however, his story has been ignored by the establishment press, whose controllers have concentrated on getting the American public to believe it was simply a tragic mistake, as proclaimed by Israel at the time.

Moorer, among other military experts, believed that the Israeli command was extremely concerned that the Liberty, with its radio monitoring capabilities, would learn that Israel was in the process of massing troops near the Golan Heights preparatory to an invasion of Syria.

You have posted information that the day was cloudy and foggy, low visibility, and such, and that under those circumstances it was easy to make a mistake.

This nonsense is belied by the crew of the Liberty, among which were survivors of the sneak attack, Cdr. James Ennes, who documented the attack in his book, and Flag Officer Joe Meadors.

The attack rationale is that Israel was afraid that pressure would come from Washington to stop the attack on Syria, just as Eisenhower forced Israel to withdraw from the Suez under threat of cutting off US aid. Inasmuch as free American money ranks high in Israeli government opinion, they backed off Suez, but they didn&apos;t want to back off the attack on Syria, and their attempt to sink the Liberty was to forestall disclosure.

US officials in Washington, with close ties to Israel, contorted the news into outright lies, such as the &quot;6 minute attack&quot; falsehood, saying the cowardly attack ended when Israel realized the Liberty was an American vessel.

The real facts, verified by the crew and officers, is that the Israeli air force had reconnoitered the ship completely, photographing the vessel before the final attack.

The day was clear, visibility was excellent. The United States flag was fully extended, flying in the breeze. All of the ship&apos;s markings were clearly visible, and it was obvious that the configuration of the ship was definitely American.

The final assault on the USS Liberty lasted more than one hour.

Andrew Kilgore, a US diplomat in several mideast countries for over 20 years, stated that Israel had attacked deliberately, and that the issue should be reopened.

The Liberty crew&apos;s last reunion, which was held in Washington in 1982, were unanimous in their observation of attack details; they knew the attack was deliberate, they said.

At an Annapolis press conference, Dale Crowley, a religious broadcaster at the Naval Academy graduation services May 21st, stated that, &quot;Israel&apos;s attack on the USS Liberty was an act of terrorism, but the cover-up by US political leaders is a greater crime.&quot;

Crowley went on to say, &quot;The collaboration is demonstrated by the great lengths establishment leaders in the US have gone to in helping Israel portray the attack as a mistake, when, in fact, it was a deliberate attempt to sink the vessel and kill the entire crew.&quot;

The attack did occur in international waters; 34 American sailors were killed by the Israelis, and 171 were wounded.

The sponsor of the press conference was Haviv Schieber, founder of the Holy Land State Committee. His goals concerning America and Israel? He said, &quot;I want to get Congress to think first of America before international affairs, and I want to get American Jews to break with Israel.&quot;

Scheiber is Jewish, and is the former mayor of Beersheba, Israel. One of the points he strongly stressed was,

&quot;America perceives Israel as an anti-communist democracy and a staunch United States ally, and there cannot be a bigger lie.&quot;



US STATUTES

The distance traveled by the Israeli&apos;s US-built war planes on their attack against so-called PLO group in Tunisia was over 1500 miles; they were on an offensive military mission. According to United States law, the military equipment given to the Israelis is only to be used for immediate defense. That is my major gripe with the Israelis; they operate on our tax funds; all else is hot air.



YOUR US TAX DOLLARS FLY EAST

Again we touch on the marxist garden spot of Ethiopia. And it affects all, even those who did not donate to the commie coffers because the US in its charitable wisdom expended funds so the starving blacks of Ethiopia would not succumb to the drought.

Where is a great deal of the supplies those funds represent? It&apos;s on the docks, rotting away, because the marxist idiots that run Ethiopia want $12.50 per ton to unload food for the people, or $150,000 for every 12,000 tons shipped in. Those who criticise South Africa for the situation there seem to be very quiet about treatment of starving blacks in Ethiopia by marxist blacks. I guess that&apos;s different.



WHITEWASH?

Perhaps in your zeal to ever whitewash the actions of the Israelis you may overlook the fact that I did not originate those facts, but has quoted from sources that say those things, even though he feels the points are valid.

Of course you have your own sources, in the main, who are complete apologists for any Israeli actions, and your pathetic defense of Israeli actions comes across so shallow that it becomes more than obvious where your sympathies lie - no matter where the truth lies.

I especially appreciate your picking out bits of quote here and there from the Cdr. James Ennes book, Assault on the Liberty, to reinforce your viewpoint; it&apos;s the ploy of the weak defensive position. Another ploy you engage frequently is that of quoting your sources, yet deriding those of another, or when presented with main sources fall back on demands for yet more detailed information, as though that demand implied the sources were invalid.

What you can&apos;t seem to comprehend is this: The Israelis attacked a United States Naval vessel in broad daylight, under conditions where it was impossible not to note that it flew the American flag and had American markings. An Israeli torpedo boat stopped less than 500 yards from the Liberty and observed it at length. Do you suppose they were so inept as to mistake the Liberty for an Arab craft? Were they getting the order to attack from the Israeli high command, or Israeli Intelligence? Was the phrase &apos;Israeli Intelligence&apos; a contradiction in terms? You seem to have swallowed the Israeli version hook, line, and sinker, and nose to their story line like that famous mackerel in the moonlight.

My position is this: Based on all the facts at hand, even some from Israeli sources, the USS Liberty was attacked by the Israeli IDF after having come under Israeli surveillance for hours prior to the attack, and the attack came in international waters. The excuse that it was an accident is ludicrous, as is your defense in this affair.

Anyone who still claims the attack was an accident is either a dolt or a liar, and if a liar, is more inclined to the Israeli point of view than that of the United States, and perhaps has loyalties to Israel instead of this country.

It will be interesting to see the predictable barrage of words forthcoming from your cranial pudding-pot quoting yourself at length - at long length, if it is a typical word cloud - in the usual feeble attempt, in the Liberty affair to buttress an untenable position having the same solidity as the sands of the middle east, specifically those around Tel Aviv.

Shakespeare might have said, &quot;Something is rotten in the state of Israel.&quot;



OVERKILL IN TUNISIA

If Reagan and State agreed with the Israeli bombing, they were dead wrong; however, even as you said they were falling over one another to change their minds on the issue. Wishy-washy, and we know why.

The raid was really overkill on Israel&apos;s part, and looks as though it were a deliberate attempt to scuttle any mid-east peace talks. What Israel is doing only makes the terrorists more in earnest about planting a nuclear device in Jerusalem, and traveling atomically to Arab heaven.

Israel is fine on pronouncements where others are concerned, but weak on common sense where they themselves are concerned. The Israelis, if they really want peace, should start talking and stop shooting ants with a bazooka.

It would seem that a schedule of Israeli air raids exists, set up with scenarios in place, and all that&apos;s looked for to initiate is some kind of excuse. The thought was adequate as retaliation against terrorists, but it was overkill, and served to put up yet another stumbling block to the plans for peace in the middle east. If I were a moderate Arab right now, I would have to think twice before going on record as supporting &apos;peace&apos; talks.

I think they must all be crazy in the middle east, and except for the oil, and innocents -men, women, and children - wouldn&apos;t care if they all blew themselves to bits, with fair warning to those who were smart enough to leave.

Just watch for the next provocation and the next already planned &quot;defensive&quot; strike with American planes and weapons, in defiance of the rules under which they were sold.



QUESTION

You might try to answer the following, if you can:

 

Israel controlled the skies after their attack on the Egyptian Air Force; none other than Israeli planes were in the air space in and around the Israeli-Egyptian &apos;battle-zone.&apos; If the Liberty could have been mistakenly identified by the Israelis as an enemy ship, they would have known that the Egyptian ships did not have surface to air missiles of any sophisticated sort.

Merely by flying around the unidentified ship they could have determined that the only armaments were .50 caliber machine guns. There were a number of Israeli aircraft carrying the latest in US weaponry; they had a fleet of torpedo boats out of Haifa to work with.

The &apos;unidentified&apos; ship was completely out-gunned by Israeli air and sea fire power. The ship had not fired on the Israeli planes or boats. Why then did not the Israelis call to halt the &apos;unidentified&apos; vessel? Capture of the vessel would have been a tremendous propaganda coup for Israel. The ship could have been forced into Haifa and the crew interned - that is, if it had been an Egyptian warship.

Can you answer that?

Based on the equivalent fire powers, the ship offered no threat at all to the Israeli forces, even if it had been Egyptian. There was no apparent reason for Israel not to take the time to identify the ship, and if an enemy, to capture it, or if an identified foe, to then try to sink it. They had the time. There was no apparent military threat to Israel.

What it really was, was a deliberate, calculated, premeditated attack on an American vessel, that the Israelis knew in advance was American, having identified it in earlier hours as a surveillance/reconnaissance vessel, a vessel who could relate to Washington what the Israelis were up to in Golan and the West Bank, and whose information might have caused the US Government to pressure the Israelis into stopping the attack on Golan and the West Bank, and Jerusalem, and was carried out with the apparent goal of sinking the ship and killing every last American sailor aboard.

Your latest arguments to the contrary are flimsy, and border on absurdity.



THE ISRAELI - IRANIAN CONNECTION

Listen to this scenario:

1. Israel has been selling arms to the Iranians, unknown to most, in spite of Israel&apos;s so-called fight against terrorists, since Khomeini took over some five or so years ago. This was a fact kept highly secret.

In New York, a ring of arms merchants headed by an ex Israeli general and some Israeli civilians were apprehended trying to get $2 billion in arms sent to Iran. It is suggested that the plot to sell these arms had origins in the highest levels of Israeli government, Sharon for one.

3. During the arms shipments, Israeli arms merchants became aware that their secret sales to Iran were going to be uncovered, and that the Israeli nationals would be subject to US prosecution, as they are now.

4. Disclosure of the ongoing arms sales would be highly embarrassing to both Iran and Israel, inasmuch as Iran would be forced to admit that they depended on American weapons, and Israel would be exposed as selling the US weapons they got free for a price to an enemy of the US.

5. An Israeli agent approached elements in the US to set up a plan whereby the US would ostensibly be opening future diplomatic avenues to Iran, and possibly achieving normal relations. Release of the hostages would be a token of good faith for Iran, and releasing some of the already paid for spare parts and weapons would be a token of good faith for the US.

6. Afterwards, Iran releases through the Beirut mag the news about the shipments, knowing full well, as did Israel, that the media would leap on the is and go into full howl.

7. Then both Iran and Israel would be off the media hook for the past arms shipments, with the wolves only snapping at the heels of Reagan et al, and after it was over, their participation would be minimized, lost in the clamor of the various investigations.

Why?

Because Iran had much face to lose with Muslims, and Israel had much face to lose in their selling arms to an avowed enemy of the US. The coming controversy would allow pro-Israeli elements in the congress, the media, and in big business to whitewash the events of the Israel-Iran dealings, and get the indicted Israeli arms dealers off the hook.

Don&apos;t be surprised how close to that script events play out.



BASHING ISRAEL AGAIN?

Perhaps, because Israel pretends to be a holier-than-thou nation that certainly is not.

Anything wrong with that?

Not in my book; they can pretend to anything - just as long as my tax dollars don&apos;t go to support them at the rate of billions per year that go out, never to return.

Here are some items of interest to historians:

ITEM: The ex-atomic worker from Negev, Mr. Vanunu, was enticed by a female Israeli Mossad agent to Rome where he was then kidnapped and forced to Israel to stand trial. Clever Mr. Vanunu wrote the information on the palm of his hand, then placed his hand on the prison van window for all to see. I&apos;ll bet this burned the Israelis; the next van had black windows.

ITEM: The frame-up on a US citizen, Dejamjuk, sent to Israel for trial on trumped-up Soviet evidence, is complete, and he is waiting. However, an actual murderer, William Nakash, who killed someone in France, will not be extradited from Israel to France to stand trial.

One of Nakash&apos;s supporters in Israel, Rabbi Eliazer Waldman, said: &quot;Jews should never be handed over to gentiles under any circumstances.&quot; This from the stonewalling bunch that tried to sink the US Liberty some years ago.

It is the kind of arrogance not to be expected from leaders of a nation who beg for American money to support themselves. The Israelis feel that it is all right to have an American citizen sent to Israel for trial on 40 year old &apos;evidence,&apos; but will not send one of their own for trial regarding a crime with fresh, solid evidence.

ITEM: Israel has lied for years about its nuclear weapons, saying time after time they had none. Even now that Vanunu has exposed the truth, it is still denied, although Vanunu is being prosecuted for telling a British newspaper about something the Israelis say does not exist.

ITEM: Israel is killing teen age Arab children by firing into a crowd of youngsters who throw a few stones. The death count on 13 to 15 year olds is up to six in the past two weeks. If you are Israeli, it&apos;s all right to protest; if you are Arab, wear a bulletproof vest. Is it true, as some are saying, that the Israelis are the new nazis? Never Again vs. Sieg Heil?

ITEM: Israel and South Africa are building an air strip on a lonely island off their cape which experts (?) say will be used in the process of testing atomic weapons. This news tears apart the bleeding hearts who love Israel and hate South Africa.

What is my opinion? Well, I don&apos;t care what Israel or South Africa does with any kind of weapons testing, or any kind of secret deals - just as long as Israel uses its own money, not US taxes as gifts.

ITEM: Convicted Israeli spy, Jonathan Pollard, is in a US jail waiting to be sentenced for turning over US secrets to the Israeli government. His wife said yesterday that Israel should bestow Israeli citizenship on her husband to help him get out of the sentence. Nauseating!

The point I&apos;m making is this: Israel is like any other nation in the world. It is composed of good people, militarists, priests, rogues, and what have you - just like any other. It should not be considered a &apos;holy&apos; nation that we must give sufferance to in every situation, that we should prop up via tax dollars so they can build settlements in territories that are not theirs, that we should provide funding to establish their military and their weapons dealing world-wide. Let&apos;s just treat Israel as a foreign country, the sixth largest nuclear power in the world, but not as an extension of the United States, which it never will be.

The sad part of all this is that good and patriotic Americans, who happen to be of the Jewish faith, may suffer in the feedback from all of this.

They don&apos;t deserve to do so!



CONSISTENCY

Let us suppose that all of the officials and spokesman for the administration got together in a room closed to the press and were given an agenda which outlined, word for word, just what each&apos;s response should be to questions from the press.

As soon as this were learned by the media vultures, and the demo dims, there would be cries of criminal collusion, with the attendant gnashing, weeping, and wailing, all in the most righteous of tones, with immediate calls for special prosecutors, tribunals, etc. Plus conspiracy charges.

Do you not believe that from a number of reasonably intelligent men it is possible to get any amount of differing responses on the same subject, even though they basically agree as to the thrust of what occurred?

What is happening is that the liberal elements of the demos and their biased press lackeys are calling any nuance of interpretation a real difference. It won&apos;t wash; already public backlash to the demo screeching is becoming manifest.

Take any 12 people and expose them to an event; you may get 12 different interpretations; with democrats you may get 15.

So, bearing in mind your questions, which I respect, but also having knowledge of the democrat manifesto, that states if a republican president does &quot;anything&quot;, put the worst possible interpretation on it whether it may be good or bad, for political reasons, I really don&apos;t think the contrived liberal hullabaloo has much credence. It&apos;s obvious that Aspin emissions are in that flatulent category of those by Leahy and Byrd, and are nothing about which to be worried.

Want to know what some think? That the Israelis were secretly selling tons of American arms to Iran, just for the money, and got caught at it, and that the American-Iranian flap is a cover-up for that fact.

Any merit to that? Heck, I don&apos;t know, but I wouldn&apos;t place it out of the realm of possibility. The US has covered up for the Israelis many times, even to giving them a clean bill on the USS Liberty affair.

So no matter your opinion or mine, subsequent events should prove interesting, and as the people&apos;s polled 68% or so confidence in President Reagan hasn&apos;t changed much, in spite of Iran, life and politics will retain their sparkle and conjecture. My bet is that Reagan will emerge even more powerful than ever for his last two years.

I&apos;m sure you may disagree - a triumph of hope over actuality.



HAPPY SUMMER CAMPERS

An ad appeared in a Midwest publication that said, &quot;Do something different this summer,&quot; and went on to ask for volunteers on an Israeli Army base camp for three weeks. Air fare, room, board, and uniforms would be subsidized.

One former attendee said it had been an opportunity to encounter and help Israel from the perspective of the Israeli Defense Force. Another said it was a source of great satisfaction, and the last, said she wanted her grandchildren to know their grandmother wore army boots - in the Israeli Army. Two of the three were woman.

The name of the group was &quot;Volunteers for Israel.&quot;

Now that&apos;s all well and good; however, what would be the response if an ad appeared asking for Volunteers for Germany, or for Egypt, or any Arab country? And for the armies of each? The fans would be impacted.

And who is subsidizing the fares, and why? Could it be to try molding young American&apos;s opinions to fit the Israeli party line?

This same publication highly criticized American Jews because in a New York poll taken by the American Jewish Committee, 50% of Jews asked agreed with the statement, &quot;Palestinians have a right to a homeland on the West Bank and Gaza, as long as it does not threaten Israel.&quot; 24% were against the statement, and 26% were not sure.

The poll seems to bear out that Americans, who happen to be Jewish, have minds of their own on the subject of Palestinian rights, and do not necessarily follow the aims of Israel. Their country is the United States.

The point to all of this is, Americans are Americans, Germans are Germans, Israelis are Israelis, etc. Just because any of the above happen to be of the same religion should not be the important factor. State politics and religion should and must be divorced. Because I was brought up in Catholic traditions does not mean I should volunteer for the Irish Republican Army, or the Vatican Swiss guards - even if I wanted to. A man&apos;s country is his country, and his religion is his religion. Although important, the religion is secondary to the national affiliation.



MILITARY SUPPLIES TO ISRAEL DEFINED

It is a matter of US law that the military supplies given to Israel not be used for offensive warfare. Flying 1500 miles to defend one&apos;s self does not have the appearance of defensive tactics, no matter how you stretch it.

And try to keep things in perspective; I really don&apos;t care what Israel does, I just don&apos;t want this country to pay for their every whim. That&apos;s the basis of my criticism. Because of the fact of Israel&apos;s refusal to negotiate, no matter what lip service they give to the concept, there will be no real peace talks; instead, we will get more terrorist acts similar to the present one.



ONE-SIDED

Now, perhaps, you can see the point of some of the rhetoric. Why is it that the US is tolerated in any case where it helps Israel, but not so, by the same people generally, who decried our efforts in Viet Name, Grenada, and Central America.

If it&apos;s all right for Israel to take steps against its enemies, why can&apos;t the US take full measures against its foes in Central America without being bound by all the liberal-generated constrictions?

Do not fall for the propaganda of the old double standard which is just as rampant today as it was in the Nam/Watergate eras.



HOOD, WINKING

The liberals and the do-gooders in all possible combinations base their life histories on being hoodwinked. It happened at Pearl Harbor, in Cuba, Panama, Berlin, Korea, Viet Nam, and now its going on in the Philippines. And note that the fur will really fly after the next discussion about our latest case of hoodwink by Tel Aviv. And, your comments are always welcome.

IRAQI PROPAGANDA

The following piece of Iraqi propaganda was found in the Milwaukee Journal printed 3/17/86, on page 5 of part one.

U.S.S. LIBERTY

THE WATERGATE THE PRESS NEVER COVERED

On June 8, 1967 the U.S.S. Liberty was attacked deliberately by Mirage jets and a torpedo boat of the state of Israel.

This attack was made because Israel did not want the U.S. or the U.N. to know it was going to attack Syria on June 9, 1967. Since the U.S.S. Liberty was a surveillance ship it would have detected the attack on Syria.

The attack on the U.S.S. Liberty cause 34 deaths and 171 wounded, but the ship survived attacks. As a reward for killing 34 Americans, the U.S. taxpayer gives Israel $4,300,000,000 a year.

Dr. Martin Luther King once said, &quot;no lie can live forever.&quot; If you don&apos;t want this cover-up by the government to live forever call Robert Kasten, William Proxmire, Gerald Kleczka, or James Moody.

Paid for by Mr. Steve Link Jr. Iraqi Embassy 801 P Street Washington, D.C. 20000

The reason this is posted is that the advertisement is unique in its being the first of its kind ever seen here in a Milwaukee newspaper. I said it was propaganda, but this does not mean it is not true in essence, because the attack did happen as described, for whatever reasons.

The ad is bound to generate a great deal of response from those who resent the remarks made, and Alpha, in its enjoyment of controversy, may report on the print media rebuttals which are certain to come, and of course furnish a sounding board for comments on the subject by the Alphans.



6 DAY WAR

It was during the six day war that our good friend Israel shot up the USS Liberty and killed 34 US sailors. And with military supplies that we paid for. With friends like that...



THE DIFFERENCE

As mentioned before, Tunisia was not the sponsor of terrorist activities. Shall we attack the soil of any sovereign nation who has a group we don&apos;t like that lives legitimately within its borders?



THE USS LIBERTY AFFAIR

Another explanation, in lieu of the target area concept, is that the Liberty ran into a mine field which was inadvertently laid by a US Navy minesweeper; or, did what really happen is the Liberty was nearly sunk when it ran into a gigantic barrel of whitewash?)



OLD HABITS

They are difficult for you to break; again, in deference to the ancient quotes concerning stats, numbers, liars, and figures, your continuing diatribes against Reagan and the administration follow the same tired path, strewing numbers and shovels along the way. The more slanted verbiage you utilize to belabor a number of what are only your, and those who think as you, set of opinions, and, as in the past, I must ask you to separate what you think - which emerges as conjecture - and what actually was, the easier target you become; however, reading the same rehash doesn&apos;t inspire drawing back the bow.

You draw the long bow well enough for two.

Of course you wouldn&apos;t provide any research on the USS Liberty; you are incapable psychologically of considering anything that might erode that structure of innocence as regards your Israeli views. Instead we may hear a recapitulation of the Vehmgericht and how they grew; that doesn&apos;t give you any pain at all.



STRANGE EDITORIAL

The following was printed in a major daily newspaper on Monday, 5/5/1986:



SELL MISSILES TO SAUDI



The Reagan administration wants to sell $354 million worth of missiles to

Saudi Arabia.

It&apos;s a deal that makes sense.

The Saudis, who feel threatened by Iran and other revolutionary forces, are among the few strong allies the United States has in the Middle East. If they need help they should get it.

Predictably, however, the democrat congress is inclined to say no. Both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have approved legislation to block the sale. The mood in the rest of the Congress is negative.

Some members express concern that portable stinger missiles in the package could fall into terrorist hands. That is possible, but unlikely. The Saudis would protect them with a fervor if only to avoid the adverse Washington reaction to a failure to do so.

The major reason for opposition in any case is not terrorism. It is lop-sided fealty to Israel and Israeli groups in the United States.

Some members of Congress categorically resist any assistance to nations that have not made peace with Israel and disregard the fact that Israel is not completely blameless either.

Ironically, one of the powerful pro-Israel lobbies in Washington has indicated it won&apos;t fight the sale. Its decision was apparently taken in order to conserve resources for the pending fight to block delivery to Saudi Arabia of five AWACS radar planes.

Opposition to sale of both the missiles and the AWACS represents a flawed vision. The position implies erroneously that the United States cannot be friends with Israel and Arab states at the same time. It implies that foreign alliances are to be conducted and cherished like junior high school romances - till death intervenes or one partner moves from the neighborhood.

The administration has the more mature view that alliances should be balanced and should serve the self-interest of the United States as well as that of its allies.

The missile sale needs to be made and the planes delivered.&quot;

Note: The radical newspaper that dared to print this opinion in the face of all those powerful Israeli lobbies was the Chicago Sun Times, K.K. Gaur, Editor of the Editorial Pages.

But the real stigma attached to the Saudi situation is the fact that a small, foreign country, Israel, has the power to coerce our United States Congress into voting their way, while another small foreign country, Saudi Arabia, has to fight just to pay us money for our military hardware. The Israelis only take from us; at least Saudi Arabia provide us with much of the oil we need, even if at a price.

When reduced to the basics, the question is, who can we get along without, the Israelis who drain our resources or the Saudis who have the oil that we need in our industrial society? It doesn&apos;t take a genius to determine the answer.



BONDING WITH ISRAEL

No, this isn&apos;t &apos;pick on Israel out of hand&apos; month; it&apos;s just that Israeli activities, both overt and covert, are questionable in many respects.

Let&apos;s discuss Unions in Israel.

The Israeli labor union movement is the most segregated and restricted in the entire world. The Israeli unions discriminate against all minorities, those including Israeli Arabs and Oriental Jews, with the Ethiope Jews not even receiving a whisper of recognition in the movement.

And yet, the Israel Bond Organization, the IBO, is putting pressure on American Union leaders to use the money from the dues levied on American workers, in their pension funds, to buy more and more Israeli bonds, as they have done in the past.

What this does is tie the security of American workers, who had no say in where their pension funds were being invested, to the existence of the state of Israel. Would the workers have acquiesced to this by vote?

The government of Israel has sent Aryeh Makleff, Director of the American-Israeli Chamber of commerce (yes, that&apos;s what they call it), to Washington to pressure senior Union officials to buy new Israeli bonds.

Substantial bond purchases in the past have been made by the Electrical Workers of America, International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, the Confectioners Workers Union, and others, including some major life insurance firms in the US and Canada.

IBO has stated they want no publicity concerning their bond sales to US Unions, especially about heavy purchases by the teachers, police, and other municipal unions.

The point is this: Why should American Unions take the pension funds of dues-paying workers and invest in anything other than American investments, be they stocks, bonds, or US Savings Bonds? Why invest in a country that would be broke if it weren&apos;t for the money given to it by the very nation whose Unions are being pressured to buy the bonds. If the US ever stopped the money flow, Israel would default on the bonds, and vast amounts of Union and small American Jewish investors (who come under tremendous pressure to support Israel) would go down the financial drain.

There is no record of our American Unions buying German bonds, British bonds, Norwegian or Dutch bonds, or any other foreign national bond issue.

Why should US workers allow their pension funds to be used for propping up the Israeli economy? And at substantial risk.



IT SEEMS

That the USS Liberty must have sailed into a zone where the Israelis were holding target practice, according to what I just heard.

It&apos;s my opinion that a report from one who was on the scene does carry some weight, but I think the Israeli-backed version was presented very well.

My research is still continuing, and there will be a full report posted, with views from both sides of the matter. It does seem to appear, if you will allow a small-caliber round, that some of the fog and clouds have been dissipated since the first apologetic.



NOW IT&apos;S ALL CLEAR

The planes that attacked the Liberty were really Egyptian planes with phony Israeli markings; I just never understood that before. And it&apos;s obvious that because of careless handling on-board, some munitions blew up and damaged the ship and killed some men.

Now it&apos;s all clear; the Arabs did it again.



OBTAINING NUCLEAR BOMB MATERIALE

The nuclear weapon materiale is only a side issue to the fact that Israel tried to sink the Liberty, and was brought into the matter as a possible reason for the attack. It may or may not be true, but, as you may note, the possibility was there, and was brought out only as a possibility.

But, where did Israel, a nation with only one major &apos;friend&apos; in the entire world, get the material to make their atomic weapons?

Consider that point.

The conventional wisdom is that certain people in the US government, and the nuclear industries, stopped at nothing to certify that Israel would get the nuclear material to manufacture atomic weapons.

When a check was made of nuclear material production, it was discovered that a significant quantity of the material had been &apos;lost;&apos; how does one &apos;lose&apos; a quantity of that type of radio-active weapons-grade material?

Did Karen Silkwood transport it in her bra or compact and bury it in some still to be disclosed site? Do the powers that be in government know at this very moment how the material got to Israel, but refuse to disclose the information due to &apos;security&apos; reasons? Did it come from the US?

I don&apos;t know, and if the stuff didn&apos;t come clandestinely from the US, I don&apos;t really care. But if it did come from the US, I would like to know details on how it was sent to Israel, and why.



200 BIG BANGS

Speaking of powers, it&apos;s been reported that Israel has a stockpile of 200 or more nuclear weapons, enough, it is quoted, to wipe out all her Arab neighbors and still have enough to inflict damage on the Soviets if attacked.

You know that the Arabs are going to get their own bombs also, so could we look for mushroom clouds over the Jordan some day. It is a building tragedy if the political system in Israel stays as it is today.

It was stated that Israel got the reactor from the French and stole the nuclear material from the US. Between the crazies in the IDF and the PLO, the Holy Land may become really holey.

Too bad; it all could have been different.



SPOT LIGHTED AGAIN

It was in your favorite publication, the Spotlight, that the news Israel had over 200 atomic weapons was first printed. At the time, the liberal rags that took notice said it was untrue, Shamir said it was untrue, Peres and Sharon said it was untrue. All of Israel said it was untrue.

Except that it was and is true, with the truth exposed in the London paper by Vanunu one of the workers at the Israeli nuclear site. I suppose you think even that is a lie; however, I haven&apos;t heard any rebuttals from the Israeli government nor its apologists.

Note: 65% of all the physicists in the world don&apos;t mean a thing versus 72% in poll of all the American people with regard to backing of Reagan and SDI. Even that idiot Bowman who gave an at length lecture on why SDI wouldn&apos;t work finally said that nothing is impossible. Even the Jobs for Peace group could some day become rational, along with the other anti-nuke and environmentalist crowds. Try apples for apples some time.



AMERICAN ECONOMY AND ISRAEL

If I seem to have had a brainful of Israel it&apos;s only because they are draining our economy of 3 to 8 billion dollars a year, meanwhile lying to us about little things like 200 nuclear weapons, and using the weapons we gave to them for offensive purposes. Our farmers could use that money.

 

And if you think I am singling out Israel, then realize that I am in favor of stopping all foreign aid except in the form of surplus commodity.

To anyone.....

And in similar manner to my statement of the past that the Arabs could eat their oil, I say the Israelis can eat their atom bombs, both ingestions in lieu of more funds from the US.

You did mention that you loved your country right or wrong, in some recent text; to which country do you refer as yours? Seriously!

You never did specifically name it.



COMMIE HELP

That&apos;s what the nazi-hunters have been getting lately. In several cases what have been identified by some as forged documents were being turned over to our &apos;official&apos; nazi-hunting department (headed by Sher) for use against alleged war criminals here in the states. Many of the so-called war criminals were in fact anti-communist fighters during WWII, and the Soviets in their own inimitable blackguard style are trying to exact a revenge using the Weisenthal types to do so.

I have no argument with prosecuting real war criminals, those responsible for many deaths in non-military situations, but I don&apos;t accept the witch hunters, who break up lives with phony evidence, such as that allegedly used to get rid of Demjamchek, and another senile old man who doesn&apos;t even know what is happening to him. Some revenge.

EASTERN WISDOM

The Ballads of Gilgamesh, an eastern epic hero of times past, give us this bit of wisdom, which can be applied to contemporary actions:

If you wish to be rich, make friends with the police.

If you wish to be famous, make friends with the reporters.

If you wish to lose your faith, make friends with the priest.

If you wish to be full, make friends with your mother-in-law.

If you wish to sleep, make friends with your wife.

Not bad for peasant aphorisms, a 3000 year old report from the Valley of Kars (eastern Turkey).

ARE YOU TIRED TOO?

We have run across some absolutely irrefutable statistics that show exactly why you are tired, and brother or sister, it&apos;s no wonder you&apos;re tired either. there aren&apos;t as many people actually working as you may have thought, at least not according to the recently completed survey.

The population of this country is 200 million, with 8 million over 60 years of age, which leaves 116 million to do the work. people under 20 years old total 75 million, which leaves 41 million to do the work.

There are 22 million who are employed by the government, which leaves 19 million to do the work.

4 million are in the armed forces, which leaves 15 million to do the work.

Deduct 14,800,000, the number in state and city offices, leaving 200,000 to do the work. there are 188,000 in hospitals, insane asylums, etc., so.....that leaves 12,000 to do the work.

Now it may interest you to know, that there are 11, 998 people in jail, so that leaves just 2 people to carry the load. that&apos;s you and me, and

I&apos;m damn tired of doing everything myself!

 

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT

To begin on a sad note, it has been reported that one of our Wisconsin Indian Chiefs died recently; well, not too recently, it was in 1866. His name was Chief:

Lepodotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimuupotrimmatosi

phioparaomelitokatakeclummenolichleipkossuphophattoperisteralektruonopte

gkephalokighlopelsiolagoosiraioealetraganopterugon.

Long Name! But then there is the gentleman in France, a certain Monsieur O. That&apos;s it! In polite circles, he would be addressed as M.O.

Another Indian, from the other side of the world, seems not to have heard of the chief, inasmuch as he claims to have the longest name, which is:

Diwan Bahadur Tiruvalyangude Vijayaraghavacharya.

He says that all his friends call him Diwan.

From India, one of the longest Poems ever known, The Mahabharata, which is four times as long as the Bible, and eight times as long as the Iliad and the Oddyssey combined. It is in eighteen massive volumes, with a total of 5400 Pages; it has 220,000 lines and 2,009 chapters. It tells the story of King Bharata and his descendants, and is really a treasury of Indian History, primarily Hindu. The poet Vyasa arranged this work into a logical form, but the writing was done by generations of Brahmin writers over a thousand year period.

In Wales lies a little town located on the island of Anglesey. Its name is:

 

Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogeyrchwyrndrobwllliantysiliogogogoch, North Wales.

What this mouthful means is: The church place of St. Mary by the pool of the white hazel by the rapid whirlpool of the church of St. Silligog of the red cave.

What would really have been impressive is Chief Lep. getting together with Diwan, to write the Mahabharata, in Llanf., North Wales.

But, I guess that&apos;s asking too much.



RAMBLINGS

That title was supposed to be &quot;Ramblings of a Deranged Mind,&quot; but I figured I&apos;d get too much acquiescence, and the sense that some would hold the description wasn&apos;t strong enough. In any case, listen to this:

1. Essay from a precocious 6 year old:

&quot;My father asked my mother if she thought he was made of money. She said, I&apos;m not sure what it is you&apos;re made of but I&apos;m sure it isn&apos;t money. This amused my father so much that he hauled off and whammed her into the china closet, much to the surprise of the cups and saucers.&quot;

2. Lines on a wall at UW-Madison:

I love all the grils!

(next day) I mean I love all the girls!!!

(next day) Hey, what about us grils?

3. Poem from English 501

My analyze over the ocean,

My analyze over the sea.

Oh, who will ride over that ocean

And bring back my anatomy.

(probably a pre-med at the University of Texas)

4. Ginzberg&apos;s health is much improved

Since he had those things removed,

Purified of lewd desire

He sings soprano in the choir.

(writes a few lousy poems too)

5. And lastly, a gem from Rod Terrill:

The good old days, the good old days,

We all so fondly speak of,

Which, if they ever should come back,

No one could stand a week of.

6. And finally,

Spring is here, the grass is riz;

I wonder where the flowers iz?

Help!!

WEIN, WEIB, UND GESANG

That attractive subject phrase is German for &quot;Wine, Women, and Song,&quot; but who has time for that much singing? Anyway, in reading one of the more quotative authors, and looking up some quotes he furnished while in his pedantic mood, it occurred that many readers see some quotes in other languages that have become familiar over the years, but haven&apos;t yet been defined. And choosing from many, I will list a short list which you might find of interest:

NO COMPROMISE!!

Politicians may come and go, but they will always be known for their redoubtable, steadfast, uncompromising, unyielding, monolithic, and totally unswerving wishywashiness!

Once before, somewhere, I related the Tennessee legislator&apos;s reply to a constituent who had asked him about the &apos;whiskey situation.&apos; He wrote back as follows:

Dear Friend:

I had not intended to discuss the controversial subject at this particular time. However, I want you to know that I do not shun a controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it may be. You have asked me how I feel about whiskey. Here&apos;s how I stand on the question:

If, when you say whiskey, you mean the Devil&apos;s brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster that defies innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty - yes, literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children; if you mean the drink that topples the Christian man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous living into the bottomless pit of degradation, despair, shame, and helplessness, then certainly I am against it with all my power.

But, if, when you say whiskey, you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer; if you mean the stimulating drink that puts the spring in an old gentleman&apos;s step on a frosty morning; if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasury untold millions of dollars which are used to provide tender care for our crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, pitiful aged and infirm, to build highways, hospitals and schools, then, by God, certainly I am in favor of it.

That is my stand, and I will not compromise!

This story was quoted by a Washington Post columnist to demonstrate the Mondale position taken on tobacco excise tax in which he found the tax at once an important source of revenue and a burden on the taxpayer. Anyway, Mondale wasn&apos;t the only politician who takes a firm stand with regard to the direction of the prevailing wind.

GEZUNDHEIT

There&apos;s a lot more to the sneeze than a mere ah choo.

Some have believed that sneezing forces an evil spirit from the body, and

others say that when Prometheus stole fire from the heavens to animate his

clay figure, the figure sneezed, whereupon Prometheus blessed it. The

Romans appear to have regarded a sneeze as a portent of illness, or the

plague, thus invoked blessings of the gods on the sneeze. (Was his name

really Julius Sneezer? Sorry, but remember I didn&apos;t say Eric was a thing

of beauty and a Choi forever, and I could have)

However, like the devil, sneezing has its day, such as the following:

Sneeze on:

Monday, you sneeze for danger.

Tuesday, you kiss a stranger.

Wednesday, you sneeze for a letter.

Thursday, for something better.

Friday, you sneeze for sorrow.

Saturday, your sweetheart comes tomorrow

Sunday, your safety seek, the devil will have you all the week!

I think it was S.J. Perleman who was responsible for this:

I&apos;m going to sneeze!

At who? Atchoo!

The best response is, God bless you - and that last quip could use it.



THREE

You must have some soft spot somewhere for the number 3 or else you might not have mentioned it. Shakespeare may have had you in mind when he said, &quot;There is a divinity in odd numbers!&quot;

But 3 may be considered lucky by some (eg: someone named Leo), and they have a few points to back them up, namely:

Three in the Holy Trinity

Three Fates

Three Graces - Faith, Charity, and Hope

Three Furies

Three pilgrim feasts in Jerusalem&apos;s temple.

Jonah&apos;s three nights and days in the fishmobile.

The Ressurection in three days

Three cheers

Three readings of the banns

The three natural kingdoms, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral

Of course, we must take into consideration, three on a match; three strikes and out, menage a trois, etc., which may offset some of the above.

And speaking about numbers, statistics indicate that an accident is caused by a woman driver every one and a half minutes in the United States.

We must find that woman and take away her license!



ROBESON&apos;S CHOICE!

Ever wonder who really is the Boss in a company? Let us examine the possibilities:

Chairman of the Board:

Leaps tall buildings in a single bound; is more powerful than a rushing locomotive; is faster than a speeding bullet; walks on water; gives policy to God.

President:

Leaps short buildings in a single bound; is more powerful than a switch engine; is as fast as a speeding bullet; walks on water in a calm sea; talks with God.

Executive Vice President:

Leaps short buildings with a running start and favorable winds; is almost as powerful as a switch engine; faster than a speeding BB; walks on water in an indoor swimming pool; talks with God if special request is approved.

Vice President:

Barely clears a quonset hut; loses tug-of-war with switch engine; can fire a speeding bullet; swims well; is occasionally addressed by God.

General Manager:

Makes high marks on wall when trying to leap buildings; is often run over by a switch engine; can sometimes handle a gun without inflicting serious self-injury; dog paddles; talks to animals a lot.

Manager:

Runs smack into buildings; can recognize a switch engine two out of three times; is not issued ammunition; cannot stay afloat with a life preserver; talks to walls.

Trainee:

Falls over doorsteps when attempting to enter buildings; says &quot;Look at the Choo Choo!&quot;; wets himself with a water pistol; plays in mud puddles; mumbles to himself.

Then there is the world class Executive Secretary! She:

Lifts buildings and walks under them; kicks locomotives off the tracks if they are in the way; catches speeding bullets with her teeth and eats them; freezes water with a single glance; she IS God!!!

I&apos;ll bet all of you corporate types listening already knew that!

(The Exec Secty generally has contempt for the ERA and the NOW, and couldn&apos;t be bothered with their shrill, plebian nonsense! There is obviously no one equal to her, man or woman!)



NUMBER THIRTEEN

If there is one number that&apos;s universally considered unlucky, it&apos;s 13! When it comes to thirteen, strong men blanch and weak men may cry, or at least tremble. Only the brave scoff at the number thirteen, and when they do, all believers will bring it up to them as the cause for any possible mishap.

It may all have started when Christ ran into some bad luck after sitting down to the Last Supper with twelve disciples. Judas also had a spot of trouble after the final feast, and some of the disciples were martyred, which one could consider ill-fated.

Even before this occurrence, however, it was said by the ancient Norsemen that at a godly banquet in Valhalla, the uninvited spirit of pranks and mischief, the demigod Loki, turned up unexpectedly and brought death to Balder, a mortal favorite of the gods.

A hostess must be exceedingly brave to have a dinner party of thirteen. Some say that at such a dinner, one will die; legend has it that it will be either the first or last to leave the table. Actually speaking, it might be a valid prediction that all will die -- sometime. The question is, how long after the dinner might it happen? And was it the cook&apos;s fault?

The hotels are especially sensitive to the mystic thirteen. Usually, they have no Room 13, and no 13th Floor. Even annual board meetings seem to be held any day but the 13th, and Friday the 13th is out of the question.

And yet, Herr Vorster, the former Prime Minister of South Africa, feels very positive about the number 13. He was born December 13th, being the 13th child in his family, and was 13th in senority of the Cabinet before being elected to the Premiership, after serving 13 years in Parliament. His golf handicap is 13.

But most teenagers say that they were the unluckiest when they arrived at the age of 13. They had all the responsibilities of a teenager, and none of the privileges.

 

I think fear of the number 13 is triskadekaphobia, but I&apos;m not sure of the spelling; I know someone will help us out with it.



MORE ABOUT SEVEN

It is said that there are seven Bibles in the world; these are, The Holy Koran of the Mohammedans, the Three Vedas of the Hindus, the Zend-Avesta of the Persian sects, the Eddas of the Scandinavians, the Tri-pitaka of the Buddhists, the Five King (webs of cloth) of the Chinese, and the Holy Scriptures of the Christians, described briefly as follows:

The Koran is supposed to have been dictated to Mohammed by the Angel Gabriel.

The Three Vedas are in Sanskrit, and number about 1000 hymns and prose passages, and are regarded by the Hindus as containing the true knowledge of God, of His religion, and His worship.

The Zend-Avesta contains the doctrines of the ancient Persian religion founded by Zoroaster.

The Eddas of the Scandinavians consist of old mythic poems, and contain a narrative of the exploits of the gods and heroes, and some account of the religious doctrines of the ancient Scandinavians.

The Tri-pitaka consists of three books containing the entire Buddhist code, discipline, aphorisms in prose, and metaphysics.

The Five Kings, or webs of cloth, contain information about Chinese poetry, history, philosophy, and jurisprudence.

The Christian Scriptures are their Bible, and consist of 39 books known as the Old Testament, and 27 books known as the New Testament.

Missing from the above list is a description, or classification, of the Hebrew Torah. I know the Alphans would appreciate it if one of Judaic persuasion could offer some enlightenment on what the Torah is and how it fits into its religion. It certainly would be of interest to all, believer or non-believer, and especially to some of us who know a little about Bar-Mitzvahs, but not much else. It also would be most appreciated coming from someone who is actually Jewish, and not another who would simply research and report.



MORE DAMN SEVENS...

I&apos;ll try to make this the last of the famous groups of seven for a while, but until that future time, here are some more to ponder:

The Seven Hills of Rome were, the Aventine, Capitoline, Caelian, Esquiline, Quirinal, Palatine, and Viminal.

The Seven Wise Men of Greece were, Thales, Bias, Periander, Cleobolus, Pitacus, Solon, and Chilo, all of whom lived in the 6th century B.C.

The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were, the Lighthouse (Pharos) of Alexandria, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Madam at Ephesus, the Statue of Jupiter at Olympus, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and the Colossus at Rhodes.

The Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages were, the Coliseum at Rome, the Catacombs of Alexandria, the Great Wall of China, Stonehenge, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Porcelain Tower of Nanking, and the Mosque of St. Sophia.

The Seven Champions of Christendom were, St. George for England, St. Andrew for Scotland, St. Patrick for Ireland, St. David for Wales, St. Denis for France, St. James for Spain, and St. Anthony for Italy.

The Seven Churches of Asia (Revelations i-iii) were those at Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

The Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost (Isaiah xi, 2) are wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of God.

The Seven Deadly Sins have two versions. One lists pride, covetous, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. The other lists anger, pride, envy, unchastity, vainglory, gluttony, and avarice.

The Seven Principal Virtues are also in two lists; one is, faith, hope, charity, prudence, temperance, chastity, and fortitude; the other is, love, hope, humility, obedience, purity, faith, and benevolence.

The Seven Sleepers were the seven youths of Ephesus who, according to Christian legend, slept for 200 years.

The Seven Seas are, the Arctic Ocean, Antarctic Ocean, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and the Indian Ocean.

If there is one function Alpha seems to have on occasion it is the preparation of the Alphans for a major league game of trivial pursuit, or, more about a given subject than you really wished to know.

(I wonder why they had gluttony on both bad lists up there? Lucky it doesn&apos;t apply to me; at least we didn&apos;t see luxury as a detriment this time, a little luxury is good for everyone)



FANNING THE PASTEBOARDS

It&apos;s inevitable that most of the Alphans have been exposed to poker in one or more of its forms, so here&apos;s some data on why you lost your dough or your clothes in that last game.

Here are the chances of getting dealt the following hands in the first five cards:

Royal Flush: 49,740 to 1

Straight Flush: 4,97 &quot;

Four of a kind: 65 &quot;

Full House: 69 &quot;

Flush: 8 &quot;

Straight: 5 &quot;

Three of a kind: 47 &quot;

Two pair: 20 &quot;

One pair: .5 to 2.33

Yup! The odds are against you all the way; but you&apos;re going to play anyway, aren&apos;t you!

Well, if that&apos;s your attitude, here are a few more odds concerning the chances of making a particular hand; don&apos;t say you weren&apos;t warned:

Drawing:

One card to a straight of four, both ends open: 5 to 1

One card to a straight of four, one end open: 11 to 1

One card to a four card flush: 4.5 to 1

One card to a four straight flush, both ends open: 2 to 1

Two cards to a 3-card straight flush, both open, trying

for a flush or a straight: 12 to 1

One card to an inside four straight flush for making

a straight flush: 47 to 1

Four cards to an Ace, chances against making a pair: 4 to 1

Chances of making aces up: 12 to 1

Three cards to an ace or king, chance to pair either: 3 to 1

Two cards to a 3-card straight, both ends open,

to make a straight: 23 to 1



Now with all that info you&apos;re ready to hit the tables, right? But just remember, information is not all: I&apos;d rather be lucky than good!



LAZY AS THEY COME

If one were as enterprising a lazy lout as I, one would have discovered a way to be champion class lazy. All one has to be is completely ecumenical.

The main days of rest in the week fall as follows:

Sunday, for most Christians.

Monday, for the Greeks.

Tuesday, for the Persians.

Wednesday, for the Assyrians.

Thursday, for the Egyptians.

Friday, for the Mohammedans.

Saturday, for the Jews.

Just change your religion or nationality as you see fit to match the proper day of rest, and see if your wife or mom let you get away with it. For the Welfarites, it doesn&apos;t really matter; every day is rest day.

PHONETIC ALPHABET

When I was in the military (no, not WWI) the phonetic alphabet went Able, Baker, Charley, Dog, etc. Needless to say, pilots didn&apos;t care for such a mundane set of words for radiocom, so somebody devised a new set.

In its effort to shower you with info that you don&apos;t really need, Alpha will list this new list, so listen:

Alfa

Bravo

Charlie

Delta

Echo

Foxtrot

Golf

Hotel

India

Juliett

Kilo

Lima

Mike

November

Oscar

Papa

Quebec

Romeo

Sierra

Tango

Uniform

Victor

Whiskey

Xray

Yankee

Zulu



NOCOJONES, GREECE

Do you remember that scene in &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum&quot; where Phil Silvers is berating the fat slave: &quot;Look at you, no ambition, you&apos;ll be a eunuch all your life.&quot;



SCENE IN SHERWOOD FOREST

Onto a gigantic limb of an old and stately oak tree (enter branch left) steps a small bird with a parchment sheet under his wing. He holds up the parchment, clears his throat, and begins reading:



SUMMER IS ICUMEN IN

Anonymous Ballad

Sumer is icumen in, Lhude sing cuccu;

Groweth sed and bloweth med and springth the wude nu.

Sing cuccu!

Awe bleteth after lomb;

Lhouth after calve cu;

Bulluc sterteth, bucke verteth;

Murie sing cuccu.

Cuccu, cuccu,

Wel singes thu, cuccu,

Ne swik thu naver nu.

Sing cuccu nu! Sing cuccu!

Sing cuccu! Sing cuccu nu! (Beginning of a 550 line repeat)

(The report from a 12 gauge British Holland and Holland is heard echoing through the forest. A few feathers and tiny pieces of parchment waft slowly to the ground. All else is silence)



PARADE VIGNETTE

Here we are at the end of the parade route and we&apos;ve really had a time, almost fifty cars on the circus train and all kinds of brass bands, cheering crowds, and spectators lining the walks. Let&apos;s see if we can get some reaction from the visitors. You sir, can I have a word with you?

Sure, why not? Is this some sort of poll?

No sir. I&apos;m Freeble Demeany from TV Channel 28 and I&apos;d like to have you tell our audience how you feel about the parade.

What parade? I&apos;m on my way to work.

Well, I see you are wearing a 4-piece suit and that you&apos;re carrying a genuine vinyl brief case.

Yeah! It has a spring clip top and comes apart when you want to put papers inside. I keep a note pad and a liverwurst sandwich usually.

You say you&apos;re going to work, what were you doing next to that red circus car with the gold trim? What did you say your name was?

Jacob T. Warczak, W-a-r-c-z-a-k, the c is silent. I&apos;m going to City Hall.

Do you work for the City, Mr. Warczak?

Yeah, I&apos;m in charge of the Linear Orientation Department, we handle those round, steel things that you see in the street all the time.

You mean manhole covers.

I can never think of that name. But that&apos;s essentially it.

But what do you mean, &apos;orientation.&apos;

You see, I have crews out all over the city 24 hours a day. The writing on the man....hole.....is that what you said they were?

Right, sir, please go on!

Well the writing on those man...those round steel things has to line up with the street, the long way. On a north-south street, the writing has to be with the beginning of the line to the south, and on an east-west street the writing has to be with the beginning of the line to the west.

That&apos;s fascinating!

Yeah, and it&apos;s a full time job. Cars and big trucks and those large smelly orange and green things.......

You mean buses.

I think that&apos;s the technical term for them, but at the office we just call them large smelly orange and green things, they shake and vibrate them all day and make them spin around. Some concerned citizen calls in a report and we get a crew out there right away.

But Mr. Warczak, why do they have to be oriented in that position; it seems to me that it wouldn&apos;t matter which way they were turned as long as they held up under the weight of the vehicles.

Confidentially, I think that one time in about 1933 some mayor&apos;s brother was coming home from a south side wedding and he fell into an open manhole, and this was the way the mayor made sure it wouldn&apos;t happen again, especially since his brother was in uniform at the time.

I see! Well, Mr. Warczak, it&apos;s certainly satisfying for the Channel 29 audience to see a public servant such as yourself working on Sunday.

Today&apos;s Sunday? Holy shit! What happened to my watch? Stupid batteries!

Anyway, Mr. Warczak, Channel 27 congratulates you on getting to your appointed rounds, even if it is (chuckle) late on Sunday afternoon.

Hey, I can explain that, I jumped on that crazy red and gold bus trying to get to the office and it took forever. Not only that but they had these nutty rockenrollers playing tubas. We got stuck in traffic for hours.

But Mr. Warczak, that wasn&apos;t a bus, that was the circus wagon carrying Sonia the viciously petite gorilla.

Geez! No wonder she got so mad, it must be her own private car. Boy, what a temper on that broad. Look at the wrinkles in the polyester.

Did she hurt you in any way?

Naw, it was OK after we talked a while and we both got, ah, settled down.

Mr. Warczak, you had a close call; lucky you escaped with your life.

You mean lucky I gave her that old business card of mine with the expired phone number. Heck, I was going to be busy next Saturday night anyhow....

There you have it folks, another exclusive interview by Freeble Demeany of Channel 26, and you heard it here first...........



NEWS ITEM

Milwaukee City Hall, 7/17: Mayor Meier issued a statement today that in the interest of city financial betterment he has closed down the Office of Linear Orientation permanently and transferred the Department Supervisor, Jacob T. Warczak, to the Lake Front Sculpture Planning Commission. When asked if this were a direct result of Channel 25&apos;s expose of the manhole scandal, the Mayor said no, but that all city manholes from now on would have a uniform pattern of dots, or something non-controversial, on their upper surface.

When asked which way the hole for lifting the manhole from the street would be oriented, the mayor struck the reporter from Channel 25 with a sample of the new manhole. Mr. Demeany is expected to recover soon, but the physician in charge said the pattern of indents on the skull might be a permanent side effect of the blow.



DISCLAIMER

This is to notify all Alphans, and pertinent legal counsel, that the individual noted as Jacob T. Warczak is no relation to Russell Marczak, even with the W turned upsidedown. Russell would not be caught dead working for the City of Milwaukee, much less anywhere else, as an orienter...



DIMPLES

You had to give away the fact that those round dimples on your cranium were a mayoral rebound, sort of a bubblebotomy.



NMCA

They can have my manhole cover when they pry it from my cold, dead hand!

(above bumper sticker available from the National Manhole Cover Association. It is sponsored by the Manhole cover collectors of America, whose latest advert can be seen in Manhole Cover Digest, and Street and Manhole. Get yours today! And then join MHCA)



BORED ACTION

The County Board is writing legislation which would outlaw the carrying of concealed manhole covers on county property. Betty Uno, author of the proposal, stated that concealed manhole covers were a threat to the community, and denying their use would save thousands of lives. Her organization, Mothers against Manhole Covers, was out on the streets in force, waving their banners, when the march was broken up by a brutal attack by one of the manhole covers against a high-heeled shoe. Betty said, this will not daunt us! One of the Mothers in our group is married to a shoemaker.

YETI HIGHLY INSULTED

&quot;I just received by telepathic wire service a notice that you have compared the news instincts of Phyllis George to my own. I am highly insulted that anyone in the so-called civilization of the west should dare to associate her name, or talents, with mine. She couldn&apos;t even leave a good footprint in the snow.

MILWAUKEE AT WORK

This is Marty Fletcher of TV 24. Today we are bringing to you an interview with James Winkler, Gruppen Fuhrer of the Ethnic Foods Committee, City of Milwaukee Festa Group.

Good morning Mr. Winkler. That is an impressive title, would you mind telling the TV audience exactly what you do. Just disregard the camera.

Gee, that little red light they talk about actually is on!

Yes, that tells you which camera is hot at a given shot, but as you can see we only have the one camera. But about your job.....

Well, I report directly to the Mayor, usually that is, he only finds time to see me during German Fest.

But what is it you actually do in performance of your duties?

Well, in the actual performance of my duties I report to the Mayor...

Yes, you&apos;ve told us that...

Well I also have the responsibility of choosing the foods that will be sold at the various festas.

That must be a herculean task.

Well no, the vendors do all the work themselves, no outside people.

What I meant was that there must be a tremendous array of foodstuffs that you have the responsibility of picking out recipes for, there&apos;s Italian Fest, German Fest, Irish Fest, Polish Fest, Mexican Fest, etc....

Well, it isn&apos;t really that difficult, there aren&apos;t that many.

What do you mean, there must be hundreds of combinations that......

Well, not really, you see, there are only a few basic food groups that we have, sausage, stuff in or on dough, spiced meats, breads, beer and wine.

But how can that take care of all ethnic lines, I mean, look at...

Well, it&apos;s easy. For German Fest we make meat blintzes, fresh dough wrapped around the meat and then baked or fried. For Italian Fest we just make them smaller and cook them in tomato sauce and call them ravioli, for Polish Fest we add some cheese and call them Pierogi, for Mexican Fest we add cheese and sauce and call them tacos, for Irish fest we make them plain and call them pasties. For sausage we just change spices, same meat!

You mean they are all the same basic recipe, with some minor changes in what&apos;s added?

Well, that&apos;s right. We change the beer labels to reflect the Fest day, but we sell mostly wine at Italian Fest, in those funny bottles, looks really authentic.

You mean it&apos;s imported from Tuscany or someplace.

Well, no. We get it in 20 gallon lots from Gallo. Say do you want to hear a joke about Gallo and the Ice cream maker? It seems that this guy was making ice cream, and his wife...

Not on camera, Mr. Winkler. Are you telling me that all of the food is made from the same ingredients?

Well, she said pour me a cup. Yes, all items are made months in advance and frozen ready for use. All except the pierogi this year; they were hijacked by a person or persons unkown. But we&apos;ll get them with Captain Zarnick on the case. Anyway, how can you hide 14,000 pierogi? Especially in this heat?

You are saying that the only thing that changes is the sauce and a few pinches of other things?

Well, that&apos;s essentially correct.

Mr. Winkler, you don&apos;t have to say &apos;well&apos; to start off every sentence.

Well, Howard Cosell does it and I sort of pattern my life after his.

Is this a full-time city paid job?

Well, of course! They wouldn&apos;t give me $35,000 a year to work for only nine months. I ain&apos;t a school teacher you know.

Well folks, there you have it. Another story concerning the little-known departments of our great city of Milwaukee from your TV 29 reporter Marty Fletcher. Until next time.......(ouch, goddammit watch those cables or else...



A LITTLE LIGHTER

Reminds me of the story where the hill-billy mother has just given birth to her 11th child, and as she was leaving, the Doctor said, &apos;well Mrs. Clampett, I suppose we&apos;ll be seeing you about the same time next year.&quot;

Mrs. Clampett, her teeth clenched in grim determination, said, &apos; No you won&apos;t Doc, we just found out what was causing it!&quot;



SOBERING THOUGHTS

I have in my library an 1887 publication entitled &quot;Platform Echoes,&quot; written by a former member of the universal drinking fraternity, Mr. John B. Gough.

It is the recapitulation of a number of temperance lectures given by Mr. Gough who had given up the demon rum. Contrary to what one may conceive of Gough&apos;s temperance lectures, they were full of humorous anecdotes and tales of the times.

For example, Gough discusses ladies&apos; fashions of the era in this way:

&quot;I am not sufficiently acquainted with ladies&apos; dress for criticism; but I know their apparel requires ribbon, insertion, braid, lace, silk, whalebone, steel springs, buttons, muslin, tassels, velvet, beads, spangles, worsted, fringe, tatting, ruffles, gimp, flounces, foundations, tucks, puffs, skirts, ruches, waists, belts, padding, collars, cuffs, frills, undersleeves, spit curls, nets, veils, rosettes, bracelets, finger and ear rings, mitts, furs, capes, victorines, muffs, gloves, switches, plumpers, chains, brooches, pins, hooks and eyes, plumes, hair-pins, combs, powder, rouge, artificial flowers, chatelaines, parasols, handkerchiefs, perfumery, newspapers, and many other articles too numerous to mention.

&quot;An old man with a rag-bag in his hand, picking up pieces of whalebone and other matters in the street, was asked, &apos;How did all those things come here?&apos;

&apos;Don&apos;t know; I &apos;spect some unfortunate female was wrecked hereabouts somewhere.&apos;&quot;

Let us be thankful, both male and female, for the bikini!

Gough also mentioned the sin of lying, telling the story of the man who was charged with highway robbery. During the trial, the man yelled out, &quot;I&apos;m guilty,&quot; whereupon the jury immediately pronounced him not guilty because they knew that he had never spoken a word of truth in his life.

One of the things Gough tells about is the way gin was advertised in the streets of London, where public house keepers guaranteed to get you drunk for a halfpence and dead drunk for a penny.

Prices have gone up since the 1870&apos;s, but the drunks linger on.



IF

In honor of the date, may we present the following wisdom falling (collapsing?) into the Alphan category of Conjecture:

If Tuesday Weld married Hal March II, she&apos;d be

Tuesday March the 2nd.

Even on Sunday.



WHAT PAGE?

The only page I saw was some questionable kid dressed up in funny clothes and a hat with a feather in it; I threw him out in a poof of smoke.

Remember the two tough knights that came to a castle where a lisping Duke said they could spend the night there if only they would perform some slight service.

One knight turned to the other and said, Promise him anything, but give him Arpege.



NAIROBI LETTER

Dear Editor:

A police report carried recently in the press showed that somebody named Onyango Awino had suddenly died in Nairobi. Following the report I have received numerous calls from friends and relatives wanting to know if I could have been that one.

I would like to take this opportunity to inform everybody that I am alive and in good health.

J. Onyango Awino

Nairobi

(if he wouldn&apos;t have been there to answer, no one would ever had known for sure)



COUTH

Who says engineers have no couth?

Four engineers down in Texas on a hot saturday night were drinking away into the daylight hours of Sunday, left the gin mill, and walked down the road feeling no pain...

At last they came to a little church which was holding early services. They went in and were handed hymnals, and joined in the singing with the enthusiasm that only alcohol can bring.

After about 6 or 7 rousing hymns, the minister raised a solemn hand:

&quot;Brethren, let us now bow our heads in prayer.&quot;

One of the engineers raised his voice in protest, crying out,

&quot;Aw hell no! Let&apos;s sing some more.&quot;

That should settle the engineers couth question!

Driving on Saturdays is most dangerous.

A woman is less likely to get appendicitis.

Weight of the Statue of Liberty - 225 tons before the plastic surgery.

Common house flies do not breed in Alaska.

PUZZLED AUTHOR

I was wondering why many of my own masterpieces of fiction and nonfiction were not accepted for publication. Finally it came to me that possibly a little more thought in title selection might have been in order, but I&apos;m really not certain. Perhaps some of the Alphans who are author-oriented could help out with some advice, and in that vein I herewith shall list some of my own books that never did make it:

Last Horizon Teahouse of the January Moon For Whom the Bell Rings Ivanplow

Some Came Walking The Lord of the Bracelets A Christmas Song Lost Skyline

There are a few more up in the attic, musty old manuscripts that I can&apos;t even remember any more. I&apos;m sure that some of the Alphans have books of their own that didn&apos;t get published for the same reasons, and we all would like to see them listed here on Alpha.

As one of my characters said in Torn Tide, here comes the flotsam!



OH YOU SIBS!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

A few of the shorter letters from the Moderator to the liberal Milwaukee Journal and the conservative Milwaukee Sentinel that were printed on their Editorial Pages over the years.



1. On every concert program down at the Performing Arts Center, it seems that Kenneth Schermerhorn manages to sneak in one of those avant-garbage things that try to pass for music. On February 28, the &quot;composer&quot; was Gunter Schuller. He used as his inspiration seven modern art pictures of Paul Klee. A color slide of each picture was projected on the screen just prior to dissonance. My 11 year old daughter Marilyn, aptly summed up the audience reaction by saying, &quot;That composer must have really hated those pictures.&quot;

2. The stupid Coast Guard&apos;s mishandling of the Lithuanian sailor&apos;s attempt defection should lead to an investigation of other United States Coast Guard responsibilities. In the national interest, the President should appoint a commission to determine if any of the coast is missing.

3. The vague analysis of the so-called &quot;peace symbol&quot; by Father Mathias Cremer in a recent Journal article omits the latest and most accurate definition. The &quot;peace symbol&quot; is simply the footprint of the American Chicken.

4. Recently it was announced that the pulp and paper industry has found a way to convert trash into newspaper. Someone should notify (cartoonist) Bill Sanders and The Journal editorial writers: They still do it the opposite way.

5. I note that some big city newspapers have their editorial comment signed or initialed by the writers. It would be a service if The Journal also could institute this practice, if only to let us know what cuckoo is out of the nest that day.

6. There&apos;s no understanding all the clamor raised by the press and networks over legislation that supposedly gags the media. Inasmuch as the media has been gagging us for so long, turnabout should be fair play.

7. I just can&apos;t believe businessman George R. Dreske when he states that for $100,00 he could buy enough votes in the state Legislature to pass any law he wanted. My bet is that it would probably take two or three times as much.

8. The perversity in man that compels him to call bald people &quot;Curly&quot; and fat people &quot;Slim&quot; has to be justification for naming Frank Church head of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

9. One of the minor puzzles of the recent gubernatorial campaign was that a good Catholic family man like Tony Earl got the support of all the gay groups. It seems to be a case where strange bedfellows certainly make politics.

10. In a recent issue of the Journal, you informed us as to the writers behind the editorial &quot;we.&quot; Next, would you mind telling us who in management is behind all of that editorial

&quot;we-we?&quot;

11. In view of Gov. Earl&apos;s latest remarks on mob demonstrations, I suggest that he have an optical quartz lens installed in his navel. Considering where he seems to have his head most of the time, it would allow him to see where he&apos;s walking.

12. The movie, &quot;Bedtime For Bonzo,&quot; which was televised recently by a local station, was of significant historic interest to political scientists. It resolved the question as to where President Reagan gained the expertise to deal so effectively with the democrats.

13. If, in fact, saccharin is liable to cause cancer in rats, then the Food and Drug Administration staff better stick to sugar.

14. The one significant accomplishment of the Carter administration has been to provide an answer to the plaintive lyric question, &quot;Where Are The Clowns?&quot;

15. I see that President Carter sent his son to Buffalo to report on disaster conditions there. It appears to be a classic case of using a Chip off the old blockhead.

16. Alicia Armstrong in a front page Journal story, stated that Wisconsin may be the yo-yo capital of the world. Keeping in mind the two US Senators we have, the governor, the mayor of our largest city, and the fact that George McGovern won the state&apos;s Democratic primary, her statement cannot be challenged.



6.0 REAGAN AND BITBURG



Even the most noble motive by a leader - visiting the graves of war dead who had fought with honor - can be turned from a simple to a complex issue if enough emotion is involved. The President&apos;s schedule to visit the Bitberg cemetery was known long ago. Why did the concerted criticism erupt all at once? Participants on both sides lost friends and family in WWII; thus, is it not time, after 40 years, to stop the continuing clashes? It is clear that groups who did not even fight during that war do all they can to continue the strife and approbation.

Moderator&apos;s comments follow:



VICTIMS

I guess I got irritated at the criticism of President Reagan inasmuch as I have cousins who flew for the 8th Air Force in England and cousins who flew for the Luftwaffe, and lost some from each side. When I visit relatives in the old country I&apos;m still shown pictures of the kids who were lost, flying precision machines when they were 17 and 18, and just not up to staying alive in the process.

It irritates me even more to have someone suggest that someone&apos;s dead family is better than some other one&apos;s dead family. Usually the winners of a war get to write the history, but in WWII the bit players are still doing the writing.

It&apos;s axiomatic that power corrupts, just as the nazi power corrupted them, and the same is happening with Israel today. All of their good intentions, it seems, are being trodden upon by the Beginists, especially in the Sharon handling of the Christian massacre. In 30 or 40 years, will there be agents from a super Arabian Empire searching out the &quot;war criminals&quot; from the invaders of Lebanon? God help Israel with people like him.

What I&apos;m saying is that I&apos;m not against any country that minds its own business and tries to operate in an honorable fashion, like most of the nations today, including West Germany; however, I yet maintain that the Soviet Union, its evil leaders of aggression, and its sympathizers and fellow travelers throughout the world must not be allowed to take over. Nicaragua is a small cancer in this hemisphere which if allowed to spread will infect Central and South America to the detriment of the United States. Anyone that thinks the contrary lives in a fool&apos;s paradise of his own making.



PRESIDENT&apos;S SCHEDULE

The President of the United States should have the ability to visit or not visit wherever he damn pleases, without regard to the tender feelings of any pressure groups. Let those who wish get upset; there are a lot more of us who didn&apos;t. This goes for any president, not just Ronald Reagan.



VISITING DEAD SOLDIERS

The point is, the Bitberg Cemetery is visited periodically by representatives from Britain, France, and the US; the difference is that in this case a President of the United States is making the visit in the spirit of good will.

It is to his credit that he has stood fast in the wake of the calculated global blitz instigated by anti-German interests with the help of the press. In Europe, they are wondering what all the fuss is about. Last night, Radio Nederland (and Holland was one of the first to fall to the nazis) said the fuss was all political to insure that the extra money would flow from the US to Israel to &quot;make up for the visit.&quot; My Jewish friends, many of whom are opposite to me in political thought, think that we are sending too much there without any hope of getting it back. I think they are right.

If you listen to short wave radio, BBC, Radio Nederland, Voice of Germany, and such stations, you generally get a much more objective view of events than from our side of the ocean. The press media in this country not only distorts the news to their own ends, but also fails to report events in other parts of the nation and world that they don&apos;t like to see made public.

There&apos;s more to the cemetery power struggle than meets the eye; it is a question of who is in control of events, the President or the pressure groups.



REAGAN IS FIRST STRING!

Some of us have been accused of adulation with respect to President Reagan, but it my case I refused to accept that critique. While I feel the President has performed well in leading the country out of the malaise and economic depths, I can&apos;t say that I agree with everything he wants to do, or wants not to do.

My position is, however, he&apos;s the best President and national leader that&apos;s been in office for quite some time. Even the likes of Eugene McCarthy had some grudging good to say about the President on the Today show this am; that&apos;s more than the resident hack, Bryant Grumble ever did. Of course Bryant never seemed to operate with a full deck anyway!



WAFFEN SCHUTZ STAFFEL

Just as a matter of information, and not to laud the exploits of the death&apos;s head SS, let&apos;s take a look at the Waffen SS which is so controversial these days.

Waffen Schutz Staffel means armed protection unit, and was similar to the national guard of many countries. At its best, the Waffen SS was about one million strong, all combat personnel - and all were volunteers.

Almost half of the Waffen SS were non-Germans; there were 60,000 Islamic volunteers from Albania and elsewhere in the mideast region; there were even Hindus from India forming a small contingent. More than 250,000 of the Waffen SS were killed, and they were respected as tough opponents by Eisenhower and other Allied generals.

In the war, the Waffen Schutz Staffel were in the midst of the battles everywhere, and their casualties were the highest of any unit in the war of either side. They were true soldiers. But it seems that 49 of these brave men were buried in the Bitberg cemetery, and that&apos;s what the big fuss is about.



REAGAN VISIT

I hope that Reagan doesn&apos;t cave in to the pressure being put on him to bypass the German cemetery visit. It would seem from all the weeping and wailing that they&apos;re afraid the soldiers will rise and fight again. War dead should be honored because they fought for a cause they thought was right, no matter which side they were on. We have congressman who visit the Soviet Union and lay a wreath on Lenin&apos;s tomb, or the tomb of the Soviet unknown soldier; I disagree with honoring Lenin, a person of much dishonor to the world, but I agree with paying heed to the unknown Soviet soldier.



YOUR WAFFLEN SS

It took you long enough to come up with some ersatz tale of Waffen SS participation, but it was too little, too late.

Did it ever occur to you that after these Waffen SS were transferred from their battlefield outfits into whatever group that was you brought up, that they were no longer Waffen SS? I suppose not. You are part of a specific mindset that feels every German should be made to pay for events which occurred during a time of war, when the enemy for Germany was not only the Allies, but elements within their own country.

I for one reject your silly hypotheses; I was, and am still, anti-nazi, anti-communist, anti-socialist, anti-totalitarian, and anti-anarchist; what you stand for, I&apos;m not sure.

All I see in your statements is anti - United States Policy, in whatever form except for what suits your leftish bent, and completely anti-German, protest as you may with that butter unmelted in your mouth. Never have I heard you say a really positive thing about this country since I&apos;ve been looking at your warped output.

I again checked one of your interminable monologues.

I&apos;m not sure you should be using another as a sounding board; if it came to a continental struggle against invasion, he probably would be with me up in the hills fighting, while you were in the valley surrendering. Did you ask if you could take up all that time with mere repetition? It may be soon that you will repeat yourself as often as possible in a vain attempt to buttress your flimsy position.

Anyway, you can say anything you want here on Alpha, intelligent, obtuse, attacks, whatever; just don&apos;t get lazy and repeat yourself at length; you will be disregarded. Reiteration of previous rantings are the ploy of the desperate, as you have proved again and again, and again, and again, and again...

BITBURG REVISITED

There are some pompous newspapers in Israel, Yediot Achronot, Ha&apos;aretz, and Ma&apos;ariv, who very harshly condemned President Reagan for his visit to the memorial proceedings at the German cemetery in Bitberg, as though it were their place to pass judgement on what the head of the world&apos;s greatest nation plans to do, or on where he travels, or who he visits. They&apos;re all living off our tax money over there; the least we could expect is for them to keep their mouths shut on occasion.

However, they do keep quiet when it suits them. For example, the Bitberg local newspaper reported that the Israeli ambassador to West Germany was also present at the memorial ceremonies. Horrors! Where were the world&apos;s and Israeli newspaper and wire services when it came to reporting this paradoxical event? Where was Reuters, UP, AP, and the rest? Does the Israeli tail wag the dog in all of the western countries? Where was Dan Rathead, Tom Broken, and Corn Kalb when this was going on? Am I against Israel? I couldn&apos;t care less about them except for the fact that billions of our citizen&apos;s tax dollars are supporting their economy, their military buildup, their high tech industrial production, and their new settlements on Arab property.

Let&apos;s stop pouring money down the Israeli and Egyptian ratholes, money that could be best used for our own economic well being in the US. The farmers are one group who could use some help, the teen-age unemployed and others out of work due to foreign imports could also use assistance. The Israelis are intelligent enough to sink or swim on their own; are we smart enough to let them do it?



7.0 JUST ENOUGH HISTORY

Many of us enjoy the tales of history up to the point where it becomes boring. This lead-in, and the following snippets, are just enough.

FROM EAST INDIA

What I said is true; many Indians today consider the Bhagvad Gita as fact along with the Mahabharata, which is a poem of some 200,000 lines. The Mahabharata is an epic which describes the great Bharata in northern India which was fought about 1400 BC. It could be construed as portraying, in the deficient terms of the day, tremendous battles which were fought by aircraft using weapons that can only be described by laser technology.

The battle between one of the heroes of the day, Arjuna, and the giant, Rakshasas, is told about in the narrative prose of the Samsaptakabacha, and describes a celestial car which moves in diverse motions, and a weapon called tashtva which is capable of slaying large bodies of foes together. The Drona Parva, another classic, tells about vessels called Shataghnis equipped with wheels that appeared in the sky. The Bhisma Parva tells about a weapon Brahma-Danda (Brahma&apos;s Rod) which can &quot;smite whole countries and entire races from generation to generation.&quot; Is this an H-bomb, in simple terms?

Space doesn&apos;t allow descriptions of the other air vehicles and weapons used in the indian wars of the ancient east, but they were many and powerful. Could they really have existed, and the technical knowledge lost, leaving only the works of the poets to mark their employment?

 

Consider that from 1400 BC to the present is about 3400 years, enough time for clay or parchment to deteriorate. Was some of this knowledge lost when the huge libraries of Memphis, Thebes, Alexandria, and other cities were destroyed by conquering armies, or insecure religious cults, Is there grounds for belief that one of the pyramids still contains records which may throw light on ancient technologies that do not seem to be of this planet. Have the records and data already been found, and suppressed. Can we ever know?



BLACK&amp;BEAUTIFUL

What could the tar lines on our streets and highways have in common with the tower of Babel? Answer, the tar itself, still in use for various applications after thousands of years.

It was called &apos;esir&apos; by the Sumerians, &apos;iddu&apos; by the Akkadians, and in Iraq its known as &apos;zift&apos; or &apos;gar.&apos; In English it&apos;s know as bitumen or asphalt, and was the first petroleum product used by human beings.

Even thousands of years before Sumer, man was using tar as an adhesive, fastening spearheads to shafts with the material. Thousands of years later, it was used by Nebuchadnezzar II to complete the famous tower of Babel, a splendid engineering feat of the time. It soared 300 feet up to the sky, a seven-staged pyramid having each side a different color, with all of its bricks cemented together by tar.

The beginning of the tar civilizations began where other more grand civilizations began, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Settlers in the area used the tar to build permanent dwellings of marsh reeds, an unlikely material, but with tar to cement the structures in a watertight mode, the dwellings became truly livable. It was only a step from using tar to construct reed house to doing the same for paddle boats. Did it work well? To this day boats called &apos;guhhah&apos; are made of woven reeds covered with tar, and are used to ferry passengers and goods across the rivers of Baghdad and Babylon.

The improvement of clay bricks paralleled the progress of tar usage. The first bricks were hap-hazard in shape, not able to support a really large structure, and having the dismal ability to fall apart in prolonged rain or flood. Chopped straw was added to strengthen the bricks, and helped somewhat. But it was not until tar was used in the brickmaking process that the Sumerians were able to erect massive temples and palaces, even dams, and the impressive stepped ziggurats, in such antique cities as Ur, Kish, and Uruk.

Nebuchadnezzar built a bridge over the Euphrates river almost 393 feet long. It was set on piers of burnt bricks coated with tar. He also constructed a sewer system and subsequently paved streets consisting of stone slabs set on a base of tar.

The Assyrians to the north of Babylon had stone and didn&apos;t need to make their own bricks. The great Assyrian King, Sennacherib, reclaimed farm land for his people by building a dam of rushes, stone, and tar.

Along with the tar flows, the Arabian people discovered that the more volatile liquids occurring with the tar were flammable, and began to use them for heating and cooking purposes. In the year 675, volatile tarry liquids were combined with quick-lime and sulfur, making an extremely deadly mixture to be known as Greek fire, though it was the Byzantines that first used it. The battle fleet of Constantine Pogonatus used pumps to squirt the volatile mixtures on enemy ships to set them on fire.

An offshoot of the tar liquids, what we call naphtha, was produced first by an Egyptian scientist named al-Masudi, in a process now called cracking, or distillation. Production became so refined that in the 12th century one could buy naphtha or kerosene in the byways of Damascus.

Our modern petroleum industries have developed any number of wondrous products from crude oil, but we still use tar as tar, a wondrous substance itself, little changed from the reed huts of pre-Sumer to the streets of 20th century cities.

And speaking of things remaining the same, a fragment of Sumerian clay in cuneiform was written in the dim past by some ancient engineer which said, Has-abul, the contractor, is a robber and a thief! Nothing, it would seem, ever changes.



MIDWESTERN LORE

Perhaps a billion and a half years ago, give or take a day or two, the northern highlands of Wisconsin were part of a gigantic mountain range which towered over the great sea that surrounded them completely. This range is called &quot;Isle Wisconsin&quot; by geologists, and was an extension to the south of the Laurentian shield of Canada, comprising the continent&apos;s core.

Changes in the geology of the region over the vast span of time caused the sea to almost vanish, and wore the granite tops from the mountains. All know the effects of the last ice age&apos;s glacier remnants which manifest themselves in the moraines we see in the southern part of the state.

In the cambrian period, many crustaceans existed in the Wisconsin seas, of which the most important was the trilobite, whose fossils are found in strata as late as the silurian period.

The devonian period gave rise to types of shark, and armored fishes with bony plates and backs with jagged spines. These latter types were progenitors of our present day sturgeons. Fossils of ancient fish such as these have been discovered in the rock strata of Estabrook Park here in Milwaukee, dug from below the level of the Milwaukee River.

It would appear that Wisconsin missed the creatures and vegetation of the carboniferous period, with its lizards, its greenery such as mosses, ferns, primitive flowers, and coniform trees, thus failing to develop underground deposits of coal and petroleum. And there seem to be no Wisconsin fossils of the dinosaurs and great reptiles.

However, the age of the mammals, the next significant age of life on the Earth, began in Wisconsin about 60 million years ago. The plains and forests of this area were home to mastodons and the hairy mammoth; the saber tooth tiger roamed the terrain, and huge deer and caribou with tremendous racks abounded. Horns found in a Wauwatosa peat bog had a 6 foot spread.

In 1897, a mastodon skeleton was discovered in Richland County, suggesting a beast about 11 feet tall and weighing nearly 4 tons. It had 12 teeth, and a single tooth was about 4 inches wide and 9 inches long, weighing about 4 pounds. This mastodon had 12 of those teeth plus curved tusks over 6 feet long. Both the saber tooth tiger and the mastodon lived here right up to the pleistocene period, at which point the coming ice age forced the great creatures south where the species slowly died out.

The last ice age can be thought of as almost yesterday, 17,000 years ago, a mere drop in the bucket of time, and it might be that we now are living in between ice ages. The age caused glacial drifts that buried huge ice blocks, which later melted and formed the moraines. Long, cigar-like hills of drift are called drumlins, and ridges of drift where the glacier came to a halt are labeled terminal moraines.

The glacier missed a good deal of the southern part of Wisconsin, but as it melted it generated great volumes of fast waters which cut channels in the sedimentary rock through which it flowed, producing spectacles like the gorge of the Wisconsin River in the Dells area. Devil&apos;s Lake is a gem of water surrounded by quartzite bluffs, landlocked by the glacial action.

Statistically, Wisconsin&apos;s total area of land and inland water is 56,154 square miles, with about 9000 more square miles in Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. Its widest point is 295 miles, and the north-south dimension is 320 miles at its longest. The highest area runs through Forest, Oneida, Vilas, and Price counties, dividing the state into three primary watersheds that flow into Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the Mississippi River.

Mineral deposits include copper and iron in the Penokee-Gogebic range in the north, and lead and zinc deposits in the southwest. The forests have pine, spruce, birch, hemlock and cedar up in the northern sections, and oak, ash, basswood, hickory, maple, beech, elm, walnut, willow, and many others in the south. Many are the creatures that still roam the forests of Wisconsin, and many are the fish found in the countless lakes.

It appears that homo sapiens arrived in ancient Wisconsin about 10,000 years ago, having crossed a land bridge which is now the Bering strait.



MIDWESTERN INDIANS

It would appear that the first people arrived in Wisconsin territory even more than 10,000 years ago across the Bering strait and down through what is now Alaska. These prehistoric peoples developed many distinct cultures over many thousands of years, and without any written histories, left contemporary man to reconstruct cultural hypotheses from the sketchy traces left in the ancient villages and cemeteries.

In that great group of human beings which were mistakenly called &apos;Indians,&apos; five main divisions existed. These were the Woodland, the Old Copper Industry, the Upper Mississippi, the Hopewell, and the Lower Mississippi. We will keep to the name Indians for descriptive purposes.

The Woodland Indians have been in Wisconsin the longest and are considered a native development as opposed to cultures migrating from elsewhere. Indians of the Woodland pattern probably entered the area from Canada between 1000 to 2000 years ago, and have left the most traces of their culture. Pottery artifacts found in Siberia are similar to the pottery made by the

Wisconsin Indians, giving support to the Asian origin hypothesis.

Burial mounds in Wisconsin offer the richest sources for cultural relics, and Wisconsin has over 12,000 mounds located all over the state. The primary centers of Indian culture included the present cities of Milwaukee, Madison, Waukesha, Racine, Beloit, Baraboo, Lake Mills, Prairie du Chien, and the upper Fox River, Lake Winnebago, Lake Koshkonong, and the Wisconsin River. Indians chose carefully their settlement sites, and most of the state&apos;s important cities were built on former Indian village locations.

Woodland Indians in Wisconsin were the Menominees, Potawatami, Chippewa, Sauk, Fox, Mascouten, Kickapoo, and other Algonquian speaking tribes. The most distinctive tribe was the Effigy Mound builders, who constructed the effigy mounds in the shape of animals and birds. At Lake Wingra, in Madison, was found a large bird effigy mound with a wingspread of 624 feet.

Near Baraboo, Man Mound Park has an effigy mound of a man walking; it is nearly 210 feet long and has a shoulder spread of 47 feet. The man is wearing a buffalo horn headdress.

A distinctly higher culture than that of the Woodland Indians was brought into the state by the Hopewell Indians who migrated from Ohio. Artifacts of this tribe included chipped stone knives and arrowheads fabricated by hand from quartzites, flint, jasper, and chalcedony. They made ornaments from copper, silver, and conch shells from the gulf coast. The Hopewells lived in permanent villages, buried their dead, and did not build mounds.

One of the more interesting Indian settlements was a stockaded village on the Crawfish River just east of Lake Mills, known as Aztalan. Discovered in 1836, it was initially thought that this was the Aztalan of the Aztec Indian legends, which said the ancestors of the Aztecs had come from a far north homeland called Aztalan.

The Aztalan Indians were actually contemporary to the Aztecs, but their settlement was nevertheless interesting. A Milwaukee scientist, Increase A. Lapham, studied the area in 1850, and found the remnants of a rectangular, walled, stockade totalling about 21 acres, with the remains of three flat topped mounds in the form of pyramids, with decorations reminiscent of those found in ancient Mexico. In Lake Mills today you can find the Pyramid Cafe, whose logo is a pyramid, and in Rock Lake itself, divers have brought up shards of ancient Indian pottery. At Aztalan there is a state park and a museum with many Indian cultural exhibits.

When the explorer Jean Nicolet came to Wisconsin in 1634 there were many tribes in Wisconsin. The Winnebago were a Siouan group that settled between Green Bay and Lake Winnebago. The Dacotah, another Siouan tribe, lived in the northwest part of the state. An Algonquian tribe, the Menominee, lived along the Menominee River west of Green Bay.

In the next two decades, Chippewa settled along the southern shores of Lake Superior, and by 1660, other Algonquian tribes fled to Wisconsin from the east to escape the Iroquois. These included the Ottawas, the Sauk, the Fox, the Kickapoo, who settled in the south central area, the Potawatomi, in Door County, the Miami and the Illinois along the upper Fox River, and the Hurons, who were a defeated tribe of Iroquoi from the east.

At the time Nicolet first came to Wisconsin there were about 15,000 Indians, and it is estimated that the same amount live here today. It is claimed that Wisconsin was the center of tribal population in the known west, and French explorers and fur traders made this area their goal. An official of &quot;New France&quot; was quoted as saying the area was a mine of beaver pelts. It is obvious that as usual the goal of explorers was the discovery of lands, ways, and means to procure wealth, even as it is today.

And, of course, Milwaukee&apos;s Lapham Street is named for that early Wisconsin scientist, Increase A. Lapham.



ICE AGE FOSSILS

The City of Deerfield is a mere 55 or 60 miles from Milwaukee via I-94 going west - an unlikely place for Museum digs. But in the area lie the farms of John Neath and Elmer Schimelpfenig, and where these two farms touch on one another there is a marshy field in which were found the remains of the mighty mastodons that roamed there about 10,000 years ago.

For the past 20 years, UW&apos;s John E. Dallman and others have investigated the marsh for these eight ton beasts. Dallman thinks that the site was once a lake where the elephant-like beasts met an untimely end, or was a convenient repository where the bones were washed by strong currents. He has extracted three mastodon skeletons, all in excellently preserved condition, and has found the tooth of a fourth such beast.

Dallman is looking for another very large Wisconsin rodent of the past, the giant beaver, which weighed over 500 pounds and was seven feet in length. There has been only one skeleton found of this animal, but it is considered that the rodents were common in Wisconsin during the last Ice Age.

In the University of Wisconsin-Madison Zoology Museum is stored also a near perfectly preserved mastodon skull weighing 175 pounds, a prize which was also found in the marsh. Dallman and his crew are looking for the remains of other animals that lived concurrently with the mastodon, animals that are a part of Wisconsin&apos;s prehistoric past.



BREWERIES, MILWAUKEE&amp;WISCONSIN

Milwaukee has had a number of interesting breweries, most of which have passed into history leaving only Miller Brewing Company and Pabst Brewing Company to represent beer making in the Cream City.

In the past, there was Jos. Schlitz Brewery, the descendant of a small brewing operation begun in 1849 by August Krug, a Bavarian immigrant. Joe Schlitz kept the books for Krug, and when Krug died, he also kept the widow, a novel, but understandable, progression to the top spot in Suds City.

Poor Joe Schlitz was drowned during a shipwreck back in 1875, whereupon the seven Uihlein brothers, Krug&apos;s nephews, inherited the brewery, bringing it to the lead in barrels brewed during the 60&apos;s. As is well known, a stupid brewery strike was the main reason Schlitz closed forever here in Milwaukee, a strike fomented by greedy union bosses, who now have nothing left to boss at Schlitz or anywhere else.

In 1842, Jacob Best and his four sons founded a brewery which later became the Pabst Brewing Company. Best had been a member of a prominent brewing family in Mettenheim, Germany, and Jake&apos;s formulas are still used today.

Charles Best built a plant called the Plank Road Brewery on the far west side of Milwaukee which is now just east of 40th and State Street. Best sold the company to Frederick Miller who established the Miller Brewing Co. in 1855. Since that time, the Miller Brewing Co. has become the largest brewing facility in the city and state, brewing almost 10 million barrels per year at full capacity. Since 1973, Miller has built breweries capable of 10 million barrels per year production at Fulton, New York;

Albany, Georgia; Eden, North Carolina; Irwindale, California; and Trenton, Ohio. It is second in national production only to Anheuser Busch.

Further west on State Street was the Menomonee Brewery, purchased by A. Gettelman in 1879, and operated by the Gettelman family until it was sold to Miller in the 60&apos;s. Gettelman made the famous $1000 beer, which was a promise to pay $1000 to anyone who could prove that Gettelman was made from any ingredients other than malt, hops, yeast, and water, a formula identical to the Rhineheitsgebot laws of Germany which are in effect even today.

Other Wisconsin breweries after WWII included the Independent Milwaukee Brewery in Milwaukee, Heileman in La Crosse, Weber in Theresa, Potosi in Potosi, Fauerbach in Madison, Foxhead in Waukesha, Kingsbury in Manitowoc, Leininkugel in Chippewa Falls, Walter in Eau Claire, Huber in Monroe, Point in Stevens Point, and Peoples in Sheboygan.

There were many other small Wisconsin breweries, whose fine, local product could not compete pricewise with the big breweries, and who went on to that great brew kettle in the sky, leaving only tall, abandoned brew houses pointing to the clouds.

But occasionally a Phoenix will arise from the ashes, with new business feathers, as evidenced by the Fauerbach Apartments in Madison which were built at the site of the defunct Fauerbach Brewery on the north shores of Lake Monona. Perhaps at night the dwellers there can sense the slow cranking of a phantom Buhler-Miag malt mill as it grinds into eternity, or at least until the ghostly rolls wear out.

If any of the Alphans know offhand some names of other of the old, tiny breweries once producing in the State, let us have them for our malty archives.

Note: Milwaukee was called the Cream City because of the prevalent use of light-colored beige brick, not because it was in the dairy heartland. Most CB&apos;rs call it Beer City, which I like better anyway.



KING OF BEAVER ISLAND

Utopia in Wisconsin? Old ways conservative Wisconsin? Doesn&apos;t sound likely, does it? But in the mid-nineteenth century an increasing wave of Utopianism washed westward from Europe and in its wake left about 300 or so brave new colonies in the new world, including two in the Badger State.

King James Jesse Strang was a Mormon prophet responsible for the founding of a communist type Garden of Eden in the area of Burlington, Wisconsin, and an absolute monarchy in the northern part of Lake Michigan on Beaver Island.

King Strang had been a farmer, lawyer, schoolteacher, politician, editor, and postmaster in Chautauqua County New York. He arrived in Burlington full of messianic zeal, was expelled from the Baptists for his heretical thinking, and finally went to Nauvoo, Illinois, then the Mormon capital, and learned about Mormonism from Joseph Smith, who finally baptized Strang in a wooden tub, prior to commissioning him to search out a quiet site in Wisconsin for a new Mormon refuge.

Strang looked upon Mormonism as the short path to glory, and his visions became realization when Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois.

Strang announced to the Mormons that he had been appointed the new prophet of the Church, God having come to him and said &quot;James Strang shall plant a stake of Zion in Wisconsin, and my people shall have peace and rest.....&quot;

To prove his remarkable contention, Strang displayed a letter to the elders of the Church that he said Smith had written to him a week before the assassination, whereupon the elders kicked him out of the church.

Undaunted, Strang retreated to Burlington to lay plans for development of a Walworth County paradise to be known as Voree, or garden of peace. In order to collect more &quot;Saints&quot; for his garden of peace, Strang and some of his trusted followers arrived at the foot of an oak tree on a so-called hill of promise. With some shovels they had fortuitously brought, they dug into the ground adjacent to the tree and unearthed three shiny copper plates with mysterious symbols etched on them.

Strang said a message on one was written by Raja Manchore of Vorito, who made a prophecy that Strang would win a divine election. There were a number of skeptics, some who claimed Strang had cut the plates from an old wash boiler, then buried them, ready to be found.

But Strang&apos;s garden of peace began to look like a western boom town as new Saints arrived in camp by every way possible until a peak population of 2,000 was attained. Strang had envisioned a gigantic two-acre temple with a 200 square foot hall, made from flawless marble, with 12 towers and walls near 8 feet thick. He planned a Voree University of Wisconsin near the tree.

Of course the church owned everything in a totally communistic manner. The members could not partake of coffee, tea, alcohol, or tobacco without being subject to the whipping post. Women had to wear pantalettes or bloomers.

The basis of Strang&apos;s penchant for monarchy lay in a mock order of the &apos;Illuminati&apos;, a group of self-named apostles who swore obedience to Strang and renounced other allegiances. Their investitures were made in a dark and private room, where halos were manifested by Strang&apos;s anointing the Saint&apos;s heads with a toxic mix of olive oil and phosphorous.

But Voree was not to prosper; there was petty fighting and squabbling. It was clear to Strang he could not survive surrounded by hostile gentiles. He moved the faithful to Beaver Island, building shelters and staking out claims in spite of more hostility from the fisherman in the area.

Strang announced in 1850 the discovery of another new set of law tablets called the &apos;plates of Laban,&apos; which required his coronation as King, and the authorization of polygamy.

Word of the coming coronation reached the local gentiles and they planned an attack on Strang for July 4th. Strang obtained a cannon and ammo from Chicago, and when the disorganized attack began, hot cannonballs soon made the attackers leave for quieter waters.

Four days later, Strang was crowned and proclaimed himself, King James I of Beaver Island, apostle, seer, revelator, and translator. This created the strange paradox of an absolute monarchy within the borders of a Republic.

President Millard Fillmore sent an American gunboat to Beaver Island, and hauled off the King to Detroit for trial. With a brilliant defense, Strang was acquitted, and returned in triumph to his throne. In a successive triumph, he was elected to the Michigan legislature twice, and took on three more wives.

But the seeds of destruction were sown internally in Strang&apos;s kingdom. The external enemies couldn&apos;t get him, but within Beaver Island, two dissident Saints, whose wives refused to wear bloomers, ambushed and shot Strang. He was borne back to Voree and died on July 9, 1856. In the space of a week, a drunken mob attacked the Saint&apos;s island; they destroyed the stores, houses, and tabernacle, stole what they could, and burned the rest. Over 2,500 members of Strang&apos;s dismantled kingdom fled, scattered on various islands and the mainland from Chicago to Green Bay, and some of their descendants still can be located in the communities on the shores of Lake Michigan. The King was dead, the last Wisconsin king.

One contemporary cynic asked the question, was the place called Beaver Island before or after polygamy became allowable?



LAKE DISASTERS

Just past midnight on September 8th, 1860, the excursion ship Lady Elgin was returning to Milwaukee from the port of Chicago, with some 550 crew and passengers. Just 22 miles north of Chicago, the Elgin was cruising through a very light fog; its many lights were on and the passengers were singing and dancing. The jovial people were mostly residents of the Irish 3rd Ward who had visited Chicago to hear a speech by Stephen A. Douglas, of Lincoln-Douglas debate fame.

Off Point Winnetka, a tremendous impact jolted the merrymakers off their feet, throwing them to the deck. They had been struck by the schooner Augusta, a large lumber boat which had hit them head-on then went fleeing into the fog trying to escape recognition. Later, the Captain of the Augusta claimed the Elgin had refused assistance and that damages to his own vessel had prevented his standing by to pick up survivors.

Shortly after the mishap occurred, a storm rose which tossed the Elgin up and down so as to make it too difficult for the crew to stop incoming water. The decks had to be chopped up for life rafts as there were only three tiny lifeboats available.

A few passengers got to shore in the boats and rafts, but others were swept against the rock shores and drowned; the rest died with the ship. Saturday morning, wives and mothers wept in the streets of the 3rd Ward while waiting for news of the survivors. It was estimated that of the 550 on board, 400 may have lost their lives, and only 298 bodies were ever recovered.

On November 21st, 1847, one year before Wisconsin became a state, the Dutch immigrant ship Phoenix, a wood burner, was loaded with Hollanders who had chose to make their homes in Wisconsin. A fire broke out on board the ship and it burned out of control within sight of the shores of Sheboygan. Of the 190 persons lost, 130 were immigrants from the Netherlands.

Other Lake disasters:

The steamer Niagara, 4 miles away from Port Washington, burned and sank to the bottom on September 24th, 1856. 100 persons burned to death or drowned in the icy autumn waters. Among them was Wisconsin congressman John B. Macy, who drowned rather than remove his gold-filled money belt, jumping into a lifeboat with the belt on, only to capsize the boat and drown a few other passengers.

The small packet ship Toledo, just after docking in Port Washington, taking on 80 passengers and cargo, was struck by a sudden, intense storm on October 24th, 1856, drowning most of the passengers. Among the few that survived was a baby who reports claimed floated to the shore on some of the wreckage.

On January 21st, 1895, the screw steamer Chicora left Milwaukee for Saint Joseph, Michigan, and ran into a heavy blizzard. More than 24 people were lost with the ship which was never seen again.

October 1929: The steamer Wisconsin sank off Kenosha with 16 lives lost, and two days later the steamer Senator went down off Port Washington losing 10.

On May 11th, 1953, the freighter Henry Steinbrenner was lost off Isle Royal in Lake Superior, drowning 17 crewman. And in the same year, the Prinz Willem was struck by another vessel just off Milwaukee harbor and sank in 86 feet of water.

It has always been claimed by salt water sailors that sailing the fresh water Great Lakes was more difficult than the seven seas. Hardened salts get seasick on the lakes because of the different periods of the wave chop. In a recent article, one old salt said that he couldn&apos;t wait to get off Lake Michigan so his stomach could settle down again.

It&apos;s been said that the sea is a harsh mistress, but any of the Great Lakes can&apos;t be much more kind.



FLAT AS A..........

Just a few miles south of Wisconsin, next to Lake Michigan, lies the city of Zion, Illinois. It has been a town of mystery to some over the years so let&apos;s take a quick look at a portion of its history.

A Scottish faith-healer by the name of Sir Alexander Dowie founded the Christian Apostolic Church in Zion as a religious conclave for his unique theological approach. It flourished.

Unfortunately, about ten years afterwards, Dowie was removed from office by force and replaced by a man named Wilbur Glenn Voliva. Nothing has been said as to what happened to Dowie.

The intriguing fact about Voliva, and about this brief on Zion, is the fact that Voliva appeared to have fixed paranoid delusions about the shape of the world.

Because the Bible seemed to imply the Earth was flat, Voliva preached the insistent sermon that it actually was flat, a disc with the center being the North Pole and the South Pole circling the edge of the disc.

How were ships kept from sailing off the edge? Voliva maintained that a huge wall of ice and snow prevented falling off the rim. He also said that the Sun lay at a distance of 3000 miles and had an apparent diameter of 30 miles.

In spite of this kooky astrophysics, the city of Zion became a vigorous enterprising community, and even now supports a multimillion dollar town economy. Zion products are found in various retail stores throughout the nation, and I remember vaguely that Zion fig bars and cookies were sold in Madison grocery stores when I was in grade school there.

Voliva predicted the world&apos;s end to occur on any number of occasions; the fact that it did not as directed didn&apos;t seem to faze him -- or his loyal followers. Another of his unfulfilled predictions held that Voliva would live 120 years, but he died in his 70&apos;s, back in 1942.

The concept of flat Earth is an interesting one even to those not followers of Voliva. Although the Greeks were aware the Earth was a globe, learned men like Luther and St. Augustine said that the Earth must be flat, or else those living on the underside would not note the descent of Christ on the coming Judgement Day, whatever that was supposed to mean.



ANNIVERSARY

It was the 10th of July, 1953 that the communists were discussing the terms of armistice in Panmunjum while simultaneously preparing for an all-out offensive against the UN forces in Korea.

While so-called final points were being threshed out, the last communist thrust for position began on July 13, when the Chinese communists drove down the Pukhan valley, trying human wave tactics against the ROK II Corps, which had to retreat in the face of the suicidal mass attacks.

This time the air power of the US presence did not wait for meetings to establish a joint decision on response. The full weight of our air forces was unleashed, with Sabrejets, Thunderjets, B-26&apos;s, and other fighter and bomber craft counterattacking the Chinese.

The communists had struggled one last time to gain territory; however, by July 20th, they had lost nine divisions and suffered 72,000 casualties, to gain three miles of land across an eight mile front. It was an extremely useless and bloody end to the Korean land war, a war in which air power was the most significant attack medium.

As the Chinese saw their advantages vanishing fast, they again indicated they were ready to sign an armistice, and subsequently all parties became signatory to the document at 10 am local time, becoming effective at 10 pm that day of July 27th, 1953, 32 years ago today.

Even so the air war was not yet finished, and in the morning, F-86 Sabre jets from the 4th, 8th, and 51st wings were scrambled in anticipation of a last-minute communist attack. From the 49th and 58th wings, Thunderjets flew cover for fighter bombers that struck three air fields in the north. About 15 Mig-15&apos;s were seen briefly, but they quickly shot back across the Yalu river to their safe havens.

Captain Ralph S. Parr, flying a Sabre, spotted an Ilyushin Il-2 communist aircraft flying supplies to the Chicom positions. It took only 2 passes to bounce the Ilyushin, which was the last commie plane to be destroyed in the Korean war, Parr&apos;s tenth kill.

About 10:36pm, a B-26 dropped its bombs on a front-line enemy force who were still on the attack. It was the war&apos;s final close-support mission.

But why weren&apos;t the lessons learned in Korea put into effect in Viet Nam? Thirty two years later there is a South Korea with a vigorous economy that is still non-communist. Viet Nam has been overrun by the reds. It can only be a matter of courage.

There is no question about the courage of our fighting men in Nam. But the fortitude of the Congress in that period certainly was limp-wristed at best. Under the din from the liberal left, the fellow travelers, the leftish media, they folded in the stretch, when it really counted.

Even today we hear the yipping of the media dogs and their cohorts, trying to say the United States lost the war in Viet Nam. It&apos;s an outright lie! When our forces left Viet Nam, the south was still non-communist, and the armies of the south were continuing the struggle.

The US had promised to furnish military and other supplies so the ARVN could combat the communists. The cowards of the Congress, to their ever-lasting shame, cut off the funds for the programs, letting the military equipment of the ARVN vanish by attrition. Those last few American helicopters leaving Saigon were transporting only a skeleton crew of embassy and other US personnel, no first-line military troops.

It took the bombing of the dams in North Korea to bring that war to an honorable close; it was Nixon&apos;s mining of the harbors in Haiphong and in Hanoi to bring those communists to the Paris peace table.

The point is this: The communists understand only one thing, force! When there is a threat of US military might being employed, the communists back down, no matter in what part of the world. The one thing Mao said that has the ring of truth is, power comes from the barrel of a gun (sic).

Great powers don&apos;t often get three chances to make right situations that involve their enemies. But the battlefield in Central America is shaping

up as another great test. So far, because of the fortitude of President Reagan, the communist takeover has been fought to a standstill. Nicaragua is yet run by the Marxists along with Cuba; however, Grenada has been nipped in the bud, and El Salvador is gaining.

Nicaragua and Cuba have been informed that the US will not allow communist expansion, and will be held responsible for aggressive actions. In spite of the weeping and wailing from the liberal left in the US, this is the approach that will prevail.

The lesson is simple. We must stand fast against our enemies, both in our country and abroad. There must be no concessions, and no quarter.

If this is kept in mind, a few decades from now we won&apos;t be wondering how the communists got control of Mexico and Central America, and why there so many incidents are occurring at the border.



ANCESTRY

Far be it from me, as a sometime scholar of the great civilizations of the Aztecs (and their unknown predecessors), Mayas, Incas, and Toltecs, to imply that those mentioned were not in the category of civilizations.

I have walked the ruins at Chichen Itza, and have seen the pit where the bodies were thrown down after the hearts were cut out; in the museums of Mexico I have noted the astronomical achievements of the native indian people, the craft and cultural accomplishments. I&apos;ve seen the truncated pyramid just north of D.F., with its accompanying artifacts, and have strolled the roads of the Incas, admiring the great stonework of the walls and buildings.

There is no point of disagreement between us on that score, and a detailed discussion concerning the rise and fall of the various civilizations of Central and South America would require more space than Alpha has used to date - it is a fascinating subject.

I would make one comment; assuming that a portion of your ancestry is derived from the indians indigenous to the named regions, another part must be derived from the Spanish explorers who conquered those regions for a time.

At the point in history when those indians were making roads, calendars, and human sacrifices, your Spanish forebears were sailing the seas in huge ships, building the Alhambra, making the finest steel at Toledo, developing trade routes, exploring the known and unknown world, already having wheels, roads, and calendars - along with writing and mathematics.



AIRSHIP OF 1897

It was back in 1896 that the first Unidentified Flying Object was observed by Americans, and the sightings grew in a hysteria that fed upon itself, with the preponderance of reports coming in the next year so as to give the phenomenon the title of the &quot;Airship of 1897.&quot;

The New York Herald printed in April of &apos;97 that there had been numerous sightings between California and Chicago, as though the Airship had been on its way to the east coast, and by April 9th had got to the Chicago area.

Thousands of people had gathered in the Chicago streets to observe, and the watchers were in general agreement that the ship did indeed exist, and that it was rather cigar-shaped, had great wings, and a very bright headlight in front, a green light amidships, and a red light astern.

Some Northwestern U. professor said that the UFO was really the star Alpha Orionus, and the star changed color because of atmospheric changes and disturbances. Another professor agreed, saying the motion was an illusion caused by misty clouds in front of the star, giving it an apparent movement. They were given little credence or attention.

The viewers actually out in the streets, who closely watched the object with binoculars, were in complete agreement that the aircraft carried two men who seemed to be steering the craft.

Various newspapers throughout the nation were in accord, saying the craft was a fake, in spite of pictures of the vehicle taken by a dissenting NY Herald which were judged to be authentic. Another doubtful input came from a Frisco lawyer who said one of his clients had built the machine, spending $100,000 on the vehicle, which could carry 15 passengers, and was powered by something other than electricity or steam.

April 13th brought the news that two old soldiers had seen the aircraft sailing along above their heads, but as it passed them, and sailed towards the horizon, it seemed to explode and vanish. At the estimated point of the explosion there was found the next day some fused copper wire and a partly melted propeller blade; workers also found some steel splinters on a barn roof.

Reports of the aircraft&apos;s demise were premature. Two men saw the craft land in a field near Carlinville, Illinois, where it rested on the ground for 15 minutes before lifting and heading north.

At about 6:00 pm, it was seen on the ground again near a mining camp, as though it were making repairs. One miner said he had actually seen a man working on part of the craft, but as the miners approached, the craft took off again.

The national hysteria over the vehicle reached an apex on April 14th. Sighting reports came in from all over the country, with many of the observations being those of fake balloons that some pranksters sent up.

In Appleton, Wisconsin, an iron rod was found stuck in the ground with a letter attached, saying that, &quot;The Airship Pegasus is a success, can go 150 mph, at a level of 2,500 feet. It was built ten miles from the town of Lafayette, Tennessee, with parts secretly shipped from all over the country. Within three months patents will be filed in Washington for a parallel plane airship, which is propelled by steam and lighted by electricity, and able to carry 1000 pounds.&quot;

Other sightings were made, and rumors began to circulate concerning a mysterious inventor who was supposed to be involved in lighter-than-air aeronautical research. The inventor, Frank Brinton, missing for about ten days, was found in D.C., looking through patents, and the news media hinted that Brinton knew a great deal more about the aircraft than he was willing to tell anyone.

Thomas Edison went on record as saying the whole thing was a hoax, and that it was either a star or the work of tricksters, Edison, of course, having not enough experience with such matters to even offer a reliable opinion. In any case, the phantom airship sailed on into history.

So....what was this, hoax, or real? Remember the year was 1897, and in only about 17 years, airplanes would be used in the battles of WWI, and balloons much more sophisticated than those of the Civil War would be extensively used for military observation purposes. Could the aircraft have been constructed by some enterprising group, whose intent was to tantalize the populace for a while before landing at Washington D.C. in triumph?

Did some accident occur to the aircraft? Helium was not in general use, and purchases of it, if it were available at all, should have been traceable. But hydrogen was easily made back then even though inflammable. Was it hydrogen that was used, and was it the cause of the aircraft&apos;s disappearance in some sparse area of the midwest?

The technology of the time was adequate to construct such a vehicle; it was simply a matter of calculating the lifting capacity of the gas bag to accommodate the gross weight. Balloons of the times in smaller size were sealed well enough so as not to leak, why not a larger one? Even as now, all the project would have needed was enough money. Could this have been accomplished back then? Was the Aircraft of 1897 a hoax, or could it have been real?



KENT STATE

You left out the fact that a mass of screaming attackers were charging the vastly outnumbered militiamen, throwing rocks, bottles, and whatever they could get their hands on. Had they reached the guardsmen and beat them bloody because of their greater numbers, would you have said it was all right?

You didn&apos;t mention the fact that small arms fire was heard from a point behind the charging mob of students and radicals, which was one of the events that triggered the fire from the guard.

I still remember that picture someone took of the poor, weeping &apos;student&apos; crouched over a body, except that she wasn&apos;t really a student, just a member of the radicals that initiated the confrontation.

It might be that the &apos;erroneous judgement&apos; is your conclusion of what happened; perhaps you should read another report.



CELLS, LIGHTS,&amp;STONES

There is an ancient document kept reverently by the librarians at the Indian Princes Library of Ujjain. The title is, &quot;Agastya Samhit,&quot; and here is a portion of the instructional area of the text, as translated to English:

&quot;Place a well-cleaned copper plate in an earthenware vessel. Cover it first by copper sulfate and then by moist sawdust. After that put a mercury amalgamated zinc sheet on top of the sawdust to avoid polarization. The contact will produce an energy known by the twin name of Mitra-Varuna. Water will be split by this current into Pranavayu and Udanavayu. A chain of one hundred jars is said to give a very active and effective force.&quot;

Wilhelm Konig, a German archaeologist, located a number of jars coated with asphalt, with internal iron rods covered with copper cylinders, near Baghdad, back in 1938, which appeared to be a variety of wet cell. After the war, GE&apos;s Willard Gray duplicated the 2000 year old wet cell, and filled it with copper sulfate, not knowing the original electrolyte used. It worked.

The assumption may be made that the Babylonians did use electricity from such a source, and that they utilized it for electroplating. To reinforce that conclusion, articles appearing to have been electroplated had been excavated from near the dig.

Another archaeologist, Denis Saurat, found evidence of similar electric devices in the digs of Egypt. Could they have provided the power for the mysterious flashes from the eyes of Isis reported to have been seen by cult members?

Many ancient texts refer to perpetually burning lights: at the temple of Jupiter-Ammon; at the Hieropolis temple of Hera, a jeweled light in the forehead of the goddess; in Baalbek, the temple of Jupiter/Hadad was said to be lit by glowing &quot;stones;&quot; the temple of Minerva had an eternal golden lamp; and St. Augustine, told of a wonder lamp in a temple devoted to Isis, that neither wind nor water could ever extinguish; and an ever-burning lamp seen at Antioch, with an inscription that declared it had been giving light for over 500 years.

Kircher, the Jesuit historian, refers in his Oedipus Aegyptiacus of 1652 of lighted &quot;lamps&quot; found in the lower level vaults of Memphis.

But back to the Agastya Samhita. It is said that we now call the Mitra-Varuna the cathode and anode, and Pranavayu and Udanavayu are oxygen and hydrogen.

And as was, and still is, the priesthood of those representing the gods and goddesses of a period employed various rituals and effects to buttress the existence and the need to be obeyed of those celestial beings. The secrets involved in the &quot;special effects&quot; were to be known only to the priesthood itself, the better to strike awe and terror into the hearts of the believers.

Consider the shining stones, said to illuminate the small New Guinea native village lying near Mount Wilhemina. Traders who have visited the village state that it is lit by spherical stones that begin to glow in neon light fashion after sundown. Ion Idriess, an Australian writer, tells that among the Torres Strait islanders, &quot;booyas&quot; were in use, round stones in a bamboo socket, which provide a &quot;brilliant light.&quot;

Tales of the shining stones have come to us from the Matto Grosso, where they were said to have been observed in deserted jungle cities. In 1601, a writer depicting the journey of the conquistadores, said they had seen a 22 foot high pillar with a great stone light atop it which shone over the entire nearby lake. This was in the city of Gran Moxo where the Paraguay River rises.

We can understand the dissimilar metal concept to produce electricity in the antique batteries of the near and far east, but what was the secret of the glowing stones of South and Central America? Did the precursors of the Aztecs, Mayans, Toltecs, and Incas have an energy source unknown to us even today?

One point that we tend to disregard is the fact that cro-magnon man was almost identically akin to modern man, with the same capacity for intelligence, and it is the mark of the intelligent man that he observes and concludes on the basis of those observations. He could have been as apt to develop objectives in science and art in the same manner as is done today, and what cro-magnon did in immediate scientific areas probably cannot be found; only the cave-paintings indicate the accomplishments of some ancient talent.

In the last five hundred years, our &quot;Cro-Magnon&apos;s&quot; have produced a myriad of fantastic devices, culminating in an ability of this civilization to own a choice of having the power of the atom as servant or as master. Were there like &quot;civilized&quot; periods, vanished in the antiquity of time, and were the glowing stones and the perpetual lights remnants of those lost eras, whose Cro-Magnon&apos;s fell victim to the unleashed energy of the atomic master?

(Maybe I&apos;m younger than I thought?)



8.0 OF SPIES AND SMUGGLERS

Espionage, in all its ramifications, exists in every nation, in every sphere of influence. The US, Soviet Union, Israel, and other countries, have agents working day and night to procure valuable data and information. Soviets have a reputation of eliminating suspected enemies, along with infiltrating, toppling, and subsequently controlling vulnerable governments by installing a communist that they will call a democratic republic.

Although the US and the Soviet Union are cold war enemies, there appears to be a hate-love, friend-enemy, relationship between the United States and Israel, as you will note.

RED NETWORKS

It has been suggested that maybe the Soviet Union was responsible for the shuttle disaster, possibly by hiding some sort of explosive device onto the shuttle and providing for a remotely controlled detonation.

The response to this hypothesis by most would be to ask how such a thing could be done, considering all of the government workers and government security people around the launch site.

This answer pre-supposes that all of the government employees are loyal Americans, which, of course, they should be. And the next statement would ask how could anyone wishing to sabotage a shuttle be involved in the program? It would be silly for the US to let them slip through.

Right!

Except on that basis we have had a number of silly instances where communists and their sympathizers infiltrated the US Government.

Not all of you remember Joe McCarthy, the Senator from Wisconsin, except for what the left wing press has published in their distortions of the man. He repeatedly claimed that there were communists in the government bureaucracy of our nation, and was derided and jeered at by the liberals and the fellow travelers, including those who felt the communist form of rule was far superior to our Republican form of governing.

Was McCarthy right? Let me list some examples of a few people in our governmental structure who were either proved to be communists, were listed as members of a particular communist espionage cell, or who took the fifth amendment when asked if they were communists, during various hearings on the subject:

And on the record are the convictions of those who stole the secrets of America&apos;s atomic programs, Allan Nunn May, Klaus Fuchs, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Morton Sobell. David Oppenheimer&apos;s brother Frank admitted being a communist, just like Philip Morrison, Robert Davis, and Kenneth May, all scientists on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos. Now this was in the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s, when one confessed commie said the total found out were only about 1% of those in place at the time. I wonder how many are in the US Government now?



ALGER HISS

Speaking of Alger Hiss, on PBS Channel 10 recently, there was a sympathetic treatment of the traitor Alger Hiss who passed on US government secrets to the Soviet Union. He was indicted for perjury because he had testified in a previous trial that he was not a communist. Yes, this is the same Alger Hiss that was at Roosevelt&apos;s side in the Yalta giveaway of eastern Europe.

After it was over, Hiss had been found to have perjured himself and was sentenced to prison.

But at the end of the PBS program, do you know who it was that was found guilty by the writers? None other than Richard Nixon, one of those who got the goods on Hiss. More crap from the anti-anti-communists.

We all have to realize that we are in a global war situation, with the Soviet Union pursuing an aggressive policy of world domination. Marx said that peace is just war without active shooting. If we forget this, as some of our fellow-traveling parasites insist we do, the nation will be in deep trouble.

As a footnote to the Hiss affair, a conscientious young writer who had been brought up left of center vowed that he would re-investigate the entire Hiss case for the purpose of proving that the US government, and Nixon, got Hiss on trumped-up charges.

After working zealously on the case for over a year, he came to the conclusion that the evidence proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Alger Hiss was guilty of perjury, and that he was a communist agent.

Some left-wing writers also have tried to prove that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two communist spies employed by the Soviets (and later executed) were as innocent as babes in the wood. That didn&apos;t work either!



WHY A DUCK!

As the man said, if something walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and generally acts like a duck, there&apos;s a good chance what you&apos;re looking at might be a duck.

It&apos;s the same with communists.

Perhaps you weren&apos;t aware of this, but in the communist lexicon there is a feature that states, you are a party member right up to the point when you are asked if you are a member of the communist party. At that particular moment, your party membership ceases to exist and does not become reinstated until the question is over. Handy, right?

The people mentioned on the list generally were identified as communists by others, except for perhaps two or three, and proved so. It was when they were asked about their belonging to the party that they took the fifth.

And you might say that if they were released from party membership when asked, how could we say they were communists; only because we did play by the rules of evidence and had the goods on them.

Can you not believe we have communists in our government, our military, our religions these days, specialists trained in the Soviet Union for that very purpose? And what did the Warren court do but make it easier for the enemies of the United States to operate, in their decision to knock down loyalty oath requirements from the law.

We are the only country in the world that makes it simple for our enemies to steal our secrets and work to spread dissension among us. We not only made it easy, through our supreme court, but we even help, want to or no.

To reiterate, those that vote against aid to the contras are in the same camp as those who visited Hanoi while our POW&apos;s were held there, and in my opinion are traitors to the US that allowed them to take office. And I can only hope they are thrown out of office in the next election.

Where would you be when the commies are at the Mexican border causing incidents daily? On the fence or joining those who would have the fortitude to repel and crush the slimes. I feel it would be the latter.

Too black and white for you? You&apos;ve heard the slogan, better Red than dead; mine is, better a dead Red. This goes for the Sandanistas and their ilk.



A LITTLE LIST

A list to port, I should mention. What I requested for you to do is choose some names from the list you feel might have been maligned; I&apos;m not going through every name willy-nilly and provide reinforcement for each one; it would take too long. If your concern is great for these poor, misunderstood, accusees, read the books mentioned, then speak.

&apos;Logical fallacies&apos; is a pretty oxymoron which really means nothing. I agree with the deficiencies of the phrases, but they cannot be conveniently grouped into a catchall.

I think your &quot;aid and comfort to the enemy&quot; phrase was typical of the activities of those on the list as evidenced during proceedings, whether in court or congressional hearings.



SMUGGLERS

Prior to 1982, the United States had supplied cluster bombs to the Israelis for &apos;defensive purposes,&apos; but withdrew its supply after Israel invaded Lebanon in an overtly offensive move.

It was alleged that Israel tried to get the cluster bomb technology from private firms in the US, which would be a violation of the Arms Export Control Act. CBS news reported that a number of people at the Israeli defense missions purchasing office in New York will be subpoenaed, and do not have diplomatic immunity.

The US Customs Service and the Justice Department are investigating the accusations that Israel smuggled US technology for the production of cluster bombs. Perhaps more of the Israeli espionage network will be uncovered in this portion of the probe, and past reports of Israeli-KGB tie-ups for the transfer of American military secrets to the Soviet Union might turn out to be true.



ARMS SMUGGLERS CAUGHT

The Commissioner of the U.S. Customs service, William von Raab, recently announced the arrest of 17 individuals who were operating a major arms smuggling ring. Raab called it &quot;the largest arms smuggling conspiracy in U.S. history.

Leading the arms smugglers were General Avraham Bar-Am (a senior Israel intelligence officer), arrested in New York City, and Israel Eisenberg, who was apprehended in Bermuda.

The pair were nabbed in the act of purchasing 15,000 wire-guided TOW missiles, 50 long-range howitzers, 15 helicopters, almost a ton of military explosives, radar sets, light tanks, transport aircraft, and F-4 and F-5 jet fighters.

Raab noted that items on the list, such as TOW missiles, were ideal terrorist weapons; he called the Israeli officer and his accomplices &quot;brokers of death who operated a terrorist flea market.&quot;

Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney for New York district, said the conspiracy was &quot;mind- boggling.....confirms our concern about a new wave of terrorists using the latest weaponry.&quot;

What did the Israeli General, Avraham Bar-Am have to say about the situation? Well, he has threatened to cooperate with U.S. officials if the Israeli Government does not intercede on his behalf.

Bar-Am told a Jerusalem newspaper, &quot;The Israeli defense establishment knows about this group, and if the state of Israel does not help us, I won&apos;t sit here for nothing.

Bar-Am also said: &quot;What we (the smugglers) tried to sell was the state&apos;s (Israel&apos;s) equipment. Let&apos;s say there are many people involved in this deal, and in all of this we are just a small part.&quot;

The first phone call Bar-Am made from jail was to the Israeli defense attache in Washington; however, the Israeli government, for the time being, is denying any connection with Bar-Am and his associates.

Sounds like the same method used when the Israeli spy, Jonathan Pollard was arrested. The Israelis only admitted Pollard was their spook when confronted with evidence that was irrefutable.

By the way, no one in the government seems to know, or will tell, where the Pollards are being held pending trial, if they are being held at all. But don&apos;t be surprised if they both commit &apos;suicide&apos; in the near future, like that Chinese agent who may have talked too much at a trial and would have proved an embarrassment to his country, just as the traitorous Pollards might. It will be interesting.



OUR MIDEAST FRIEND

Notes and quotes from the Los Angeles Times:

&quot;Former Navy analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard, whose arrest on charges of spying for Israel was dismissed by that nation as an isolated embarrassment, was in fact one link in an organized Israeli espionage ring in the United States, sources said Thursday.

&quot;The sources, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said serious doubt had been cast on Israel&apos;s claims that its government knew nothing of Pollard&apos;s activities and that it had cooperated fully in the US inquiry of the affair.

&quot;Instead, a federal investigation of Israeli spying activities most likely will produce at least one additional arrest and has brought both American and Israeli citizens under suspicion, sources said.

&quot;The suspects include an unnamed Israeli air force officer - a regular visitor to the US, ostensibly for educational purposes - who is believed to have been the &apos;master case officer&apos; for US intelligence operations, according to officials.

&quot;&apos;The Israelis lied to us. This was no small-time rogue operation; it was much more systematic than that,&apos; one official said. &apos;This was a very expensive operation they ran. There&apos;s no embassy slush fund big enough to cover that sort of thing.&apos;

&quot;Pollard was a civilian intelligence analyst with the Naval Investigative Service when he was arrested Nov. 21 as he tried to crash his car through the gates of the Israeli embassy in Washington.&quot;

End of quotes.

And they did it to us with the money we gave to them; and, it&apos;s only the tip of the massive Israeli espionage iceberg. Some friend!



SWIFT AND HARSH

Was once was dealt out to spies and saboteurs brought to a swift and harsh justice. But, where are Pollards? Where are they now? Is there a coverup? When is a trial going to be held?

Perhaps in view of which country they were spying for, they may be given the equivalent of a D.C. ticket for Jay-walking, and sentenced to 10 minutes at McDonald&apos;s during the rush hour. How cruel and unusual!



USING THE FIXER

The latest on the Pollard case is that they are putting in the fix by having him plead guilty to some charge so that the facts of the matter, and descriptions of Israeli spying operations, will not be exposed in open court.

The truth may come out, even as leaks.



VANISHING POLLARDS

Strange twists in the case of the Pollards who were caught spying for the Israelis. No one seems to know where they are or what they are doing. In the other recent spy cases, the protagonists are locked up for trial, sentencing, or post sentencing. Where are the Pollards? Will the US just let them slip back to their paymasters, unharmed and unpunished?



MORE POLLARD

If you recall some months back that Pollard was caught spying for the Israeli government, then mysteriously vanished, the late word is that Pollard was actually turning over American secrets to Israel strictly out of love for Israel, and not for money.

In fact, unconfirmed rumor has it that Pollard is so incensed at being disowned by Israel, he can&apos;t wait to get on the stand and tell all. It seems that our Israeli &apos;friends&apos; are trying to exert pressure to keep Pollard from coming to trial at all costs.

As I said, the story is in the rumor stage, but if true, we may here some extremely interesting courtroom dialogue.

That is if Pollard doesn&apos;t commit &quot;suicide&quot; before the fact.



POLLARD FOLLOW-UP

The AP news article just mentioned was on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal I read in Madison on Monday; so far there has been nothing in the rag or the Sentinel on the story. Why can&apos;t we in Milwaukee read all of the news? Is the Journal censoring in order to choose what we here can read?



RETALIATION

Don&apos;t think for a moment that retaliations against the tyrants that meddle with American citizens does not take place. It may not be in the headlines, and the government may not speak of it, but it&apos;s there and does occur.

If the weasels in our Congress did not grovel, squirm, and cry every time an overt retaliation were made, the actions would be more visible. Do you think that the Grenada assault would have been made if cuckoos like Solarz, Leahy, O&apos;Neill, Kennedy, Cranston, and that ilk would have been consulted before the fact? Those are the kind of half-Americans that write letters to our enemies in Nicaragua.

The government agencies involved with covert retaliatory operations must operate sub rosa with regard to the above described limp-wrists. Carter and Turner almost dismantled the CIA network, wimps like Solarz and Leahy would love to finish the job. It is their moronic thinking that inhibits our domestic FBI operations in many cases.

When the traitorous Walkers are convicted and sentenced to die, you will hear the bleeding hearts in Congress and the Supreme Court baying at the moon.

It is in spite of these weaklings, in spite of the wimps, in spite of those weeping for our enemies all over the world, that measures must be taken, and are, whether it&apos;s known or not, to ensure the survival of our Republic.



9.0 PHYSICAL- CEREBRAL

Here the Alphans dwell on the mental and physical, the interrelationships therein, the profound effects of one upon the other, and the capabilities beyond. Have you heard of Dimethylsulfoxide? How can you get rid of that headache? Is there a soul? Have you been reincarnated?

Listen to what the Alphans have said.

MIND OVER BODY

What was said about the mental powers of certain Indian and Tibetan mystics has been believed true in that area of the world. We in the west have heard of it but are skeptical because of rarity, while in the east, feats of this type may be commonplace. Controlling one&apos;s heartbeat is a learned function, just like putting the ball through the hoop from the free-throw line. Same practice involved - different result.

Here&apos;s a little trick for you Alphans susceptible to headache, right out of eastern lore. For relief of headache, use your mind to physically cause an increased flow of blood to your hands. By concentrating, you can actually feel the flow as you guide it from your heart to the hands, and will heat up your hands 2 or 3 degrees F. Concentrate on the continuous pulses from the heart. As you do this, you will feel the sensation of the flow along the entire route. As you do this, your headache will diminish, finally settling down to an acceptable level, or vanishing completely.

This is not nonsense, it really works, give it a legitimate try. For more on the subject, glance at &quot;Powers of Mind&quot; By Adam Smith.



TRANSPLANTED LOGIC



The case of Baby Fay has provided some food for argumentative thought. My position is of observing that a human life was involved, thus any type of device which would allow that life to continue, whether organic or inorganic, would be acceptable.

If there is a soul, and if it permeates the essence of the physical body, then it might be logical to assume the soul would handily incorporate the new heart (or any other organ, for that matter) into the structure.

A doctor once had a terminal patient on a bed which rested on a scale. When the patient died, the doctor was amazed to see that the total weight dropped by a few ounces, thus providing, perhaps, an insight into the weight of the soul.

My point is, if the body is discarded like an old, worn-out husk, at the moment of departure, and if the soul is indeed a complete, spiritual-like being, then it should not matter what goes into the body before it becomes a husk. The butterfly leaves the cocoon, the soul may leave the physical cocoon and go on to greater things



RAM/ROM

What might be is that the soul is the carrier of the intelligence and the thought processes, and the physical brain is only the organism utilized for physical action. In that case, brain death would mean freedom for the soul/spirit to escape, leaving the used-up body to mechanically function with outside help.

A few years ago, doctors kept a single chicken&apos;s heart functioning, using typical mechanical means, for a number of years. A human heart could be made to operate in the same manner, but the moral, religious, and metaphysical ramifications would be much to overcome.



PHYSICAL/SPIRITUAL

Friend, you are dealing with two interrelated, yet separate entities here, the physical and the mental, one offering indication of a perceivable existence, and the other an existence manifest only by the physical.

I suggest that positive proof exists that the physical mode ceases due to an extreme malfunction in that mode; I also maintain the mental (mind, spiritual) phase of the relationship cannot yet be proved to succumb or carry on after the physical lacks physical life.

Perhaps it might be argued that the physical phase is merely a vehicle convenient to physical plane activity, discarded after use. This is not related to contexts religious, but merely proferred as hypothesis.



ABSTRACT

The problem in semantics seems to be terms that are actually undefinable. It would appear that mind, consciousness, sentience, awareness, and the like can be captured for use as a generality.

I&apos;m certain that Roget has a bundle of catch-alls for either the physical or the mental labels, and that they must be used in a catch-all way for purposes of discussion. Because of the lack of verified literature on the subject, the mental aspect of the physiocerebral process must be spoken of in a strictly hypothetical vein.

In any case, your point is well taken with regard to ones sesquipedalianist approach to explanation, but, what the hell, all in his particular field generate thoughts in that manner as a matter of course, and we shouldn&apos;t hoist with his own pedant.



COMFORT ASSERTED

None of my statements were assertions in the statement sense, merely conjectures in the hypothetical mode. But perhaps it might be comfortable to consider the physical brain a type of battery, and the conscious as the charge, or even more precisely, a series of memory cores charged by the conscious. An empty receptacle is quiescent (unless dropped on one), but may be operable when filled; the parallels go on.



DREAMS

First of all, you establish the premise that dreams come true as a matter of fact. Many of us peons might disagree; if they did come true, we wouldn&apos;t be peons.

But, as Uncle Siggy once said, dreams can sometimes provide a sort of vicarious wish-fulfillment, leading, perhaps, to a positive action later on which will bring about actual fulfillment. The expert should know more about this than I do.

Concerning day dreams, unless they are too grandiosely delusive, it lies within our powers to implement the actions to also bring their elusive wishes to fruition.



LANGUATIONS

What you are really saying is that we live a life of intellectual visualizations, and that language is a medium to transmit to others, those particular visualizations. Intellectual capability, it seems, does not depend on language, but on the ability to recall and identify for use the visualizations of the past. On another scale, aural impression for a sightless person also can be a form of visualization; however, it is here that language is important for function.



VISUALIZATION I

Instead of your translation of visualization being an immediate and concrete experience, I utilized the term in the context of being a possibility projection of a future event, in the sense of a man visualizing the possibility of placing a string in strategic reference to a bendable stick to provide a device which would propel another stick.

The ability to so conceptualize, at least to a scientific type, is a boundary interface reflecting capability. This parallel can be extended to other creative endeavors on any sophisticated form.



VISUALIZATION II

Again. we may be verbalizing visualization into an early grave; however, the visualization of which I speak is the formation of a mental image or process, in other words, an ideative procedure by which conceptions are formed within the mind, which, if acted upon, may take physical form under the direction of the visualizationist&apos;s hands and tools.

Someone once visualized the idea of a machine to allow typing characters on paper, or contemporarily, on a screen. I think he might have brought his thoughts to fruition. He visualized the keyboard so that you and I have visual communication. Had he known the subjects we were to discuss, he might have stuck with pen and paper - can you dig it?



FUEL

There is no answer to any of the questions brought up about the subject of eating meat or vegetables, one to the deprivation of the other. The only significant thought is that we as human beings (most of us, anyway) must provide fuel of an edible and nutritive sort to our systems in order to keep them operating.

The choice of that fuel is a personal one!

One may consider himself a vegetarian or not under normal circumstances, but when starvation of the body reaches a critical point, any old fuel will do, no matter how disgusting.

Perhaps one of our profound coterie can provide us with the difference by definition of the protein from meat and from beans. Are they chemically different, merely physically different, or what?



PROTEIN

I still maintain that vegetarianism or meatism are both states of mind, and that ingestion of a balanced amount of each is most conducive to nutritional health, and that total fuel utilization of one instead of the other satisfies a psychological, not physiological, need.



SUBTLE IS AS...

I reviewed you talk concerning vegetarianism; I&apos;m wondering exactly what subtle differences that vegetarians experience. Why should there be differences at all? Or is it the good feeling you must get while walking through the park, and experiencing that tendency for your feet to take root?



VEG A VIS

Concerning the feeling of lightness you discuss, I think that it is true based on my experiences with oriental food. It is also true that the digestive process appears to proceed more quickly operating on vegetable fodder. As far as dullness after a heavy meal, it can come with an overload of vegetables as well as with meat.

What you haven&apos;t mentioned is that there is a greater feeling of physical satisfaction for many after a hearty steak as compared to a mangle of mung, and this feeling lasts for an extended time in which the blood sugar is maintained at an adequate level. To each his own.

I like meat, and I don&apos;t really care about the lower animals that went into providing meat for our society; my compassion has a human, not humane, limit concerning that subject. If vegetarians&apos; outlook is based on their compassion towards living things, they are hopelessly naive. Cattle are killed every day for food; vegies don&apos;t have to eat them, pork or lamb either. Animals are animals no matter if they are food cattle or bacteria in the body which are killed by the body itself according to circumstance.

Would you kill a mosquito about to bite you? I think so! Then you have taken the life of an innocent animal - without compassion, I&apos;m sure. There is a sect in India who wear face masks so as not to injure any living thing in the air they breathe - another example of senseless compassion.

The point is, if you are a true vegetarian, and a true compassionist where taking the life of an animal is concerned, don&apos;t step on an ant or get a flu shot. If your compassion doesn&apos;t extend that far, then your compassion is selective based on size, and not valid overall. I don&apos;t have to explain the Latin word anima to you, or its implications regarding vegetarianism, or even sitting on your living room sofa crushing dust mites by the 100&apos;s.

It&apos;s all life.

And how do the vegetarians know that the living vegetable they eat is not a sentient being, sitting out in the garden discussing the universe with their fellow tomato, until some hard-hearted person comes along and plucks them right out of their existence. Of course they don&apos;t even consider it; their world would be shattered.

I hate to cut this short, but I have a meeting with an English muffin named Benedict to discuss days in Holland, Canadian pig meat, and the fruit of the hen.

I&apos;m sure you know eggsactly what I mean.



PRECISELY

It&apos;s precisely those India Indians that would not agree with your thesis of levels - they hold all life in the same perspective. In any case, my exaggeration of the commonality of sentience was aimed at indicating one man&apos;s steak is another man&apos;s tomato, and if you hold life in high regard, is it the life of an intelligent species such as man that should take precedence over the life of a chicken? I surely think so, but I also maintain your position might be one of compassion for the fatted calf but disdain for the chicken.

Do vegetarians consider fish to be a proscribed substance? Why or why not?



DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE

That lengthy scientific name is more well understood as DMSO, a rather controversial substance that first was described in a Readers Digest article some years ago as an extremely promising addition to the list of compounds that make man&apos;s life easier.

DMSO effect was discovered accidentally when a scientist spilled some on his hand and found that within minutes he could taste the garlicky odor of the substance in his mouth. It seems that DMSO had the ability to penetrate the skin merely by being wiped on the surface, permeating the area of contact almost instantly.

The scientist&apos;s initial thought was that DMSO could be a transport device for getting medication to localized body areas as required. Further tests indicated that DMSO on its own was a miracle-like liquid that would take away the pain of bruises, sprains, and burns a short time after application

Doctors were interested in DMSO and many began to use it in treatment. It was not universal in its effects, but in many cases allowed the sufferer to heal a sprained wrist or ankle much more quickly and with less pain. Morrie Wills, of the LA Dodgers was quoted as saying that no professional sports locker room was without this panacea; it was common for football players to use it as a matter of fact. Other people used it for backache with much success.

The question is, where is this beneficial material now? Well, the American Medical Association and the Federal Drug Administration have grouped to keep this material out of the hands of the general public. Despite the preponderance of evidence indicating its potential benefits, the FDA refuses to allow sales for human use.

DMSO is now classified as a chemical solvent, and is sold by certain firms strictly as a chemically pure solvency agent. Most individuals purchase the solvent for home use, usually mixing it 7 parts to 3 parts water. When a joint is strained and painful, a generous application of DMSO is said to reduce the pain significantly. The same concentration used on extremely painful burns can halt the pain in minutes. Used externally, it is said that in combination with other pain-killers such as aspirin it will make the analgesics more effective. My own personal use of the substance has borne out these claims.

Why is it when we do get something as useful as DMSO, the FDA in its bureaucracy, and the AMA in its greed, tend to downplay the effectiveness of the stuff in both scientific tests and pragmatic results? The safety and the benefit of DMSO have been proved, why the delay in the release for general use?

P.S. If any bruised or sprained Alphans are interested in buying some of this material strictly for use as a &quot;solvent,&quot; thats fine; but, remember, I&apos;m not a medical type doctor, nor am I practicing medicine - simply adhering to the Alphan practice of dispensing interesting information.



OCCULTIC REFERENCE

I wanted to mention that the Tarotic descriptions listed were taken from the book, &apos;Astrology and other Occult Games&apos; by M&amp;E Ronan (Scholastic Press).

So when it was said that the descriptions were tailored to fit certain numbers, it was telling us what that person would do in the same circumstance. As though we didn&apos;t know that, considering the mention of Alphonse and Gaston some time ago.



DMSO EXTENDED

I think there is one basic accomplishment any kind of beneficial substance must complete before it is considered beneficial - it must work. DMSO does appear to work.

Many tests have been done with DMSO over the past 20 years. The problem is that the results were ignored by the FDA who chooses to completely disregard any positive usages of the substance. Of course the material must be used with discretion. JM is correct when he says many of the non-medical people tend to overuse drugs. He&apos;s right, but a person in pain doesn&apos;t listen to pontificating - he just wants to get rid of the pain.

As far as legitimate testing is concerned, the FDA banned Cyclamate some years ago on the basis of a flawed testing procedure where pure Cyclamate was not used but instead was a mixture of Cyclamate, Saccharin, and some carrier. As a result of this, some susceptible rats developed tumors, and because some non-medical congressman wanted to see his name on a bill, the best non-caloric sweetener ever was banned.

Tests on Cyclamate in the mean time have indicated that it is a safe substance; however, the FDA is still not moving because of the thick layer of egg on their collective faces. Do you really think that if aspirin were just discovered that we would be able to use it? Perhaps after 40 years of testing, based on the FDA experience. I wager that if mother&apos;s milk were injected into lab rats it would cause tumors, thus bringing an FDA ruling that it could not be used as a nutritional source by babies.

Cynic that I am, I wonder why EQUAL didnt have the same problem?

On one other similar subject, do you think that heroin should be allowed as a pain-killer for terminal cancer patients? As anti streetdrug as I am, I feel that it should be used if it is as effective as some medical people say it is.



MORE DMSO

Where did you get the idea that DMSO was touted as a cure for cancer? Nowhere in the literature does it state that, unless your literature might happen to be the NE Journal of Medicine, or some such.

Your stance in the DMSO situation is reminiscent of someone relating the horrors of war without ever having been in the Service. If you haven&apos;t used it, you can only repeat what other&apos;s opinions happen to be. If you had used it, you wouldn&apos;t be so vehemently against it. My position is, DMSO works for me on sprains, strains, burns, etc., in an extremely effective manner, as it does for many athletes susceptible to joint injuries. Perhaps it wouldn&apos;t work for you, and perhaps you wouldn&apos;t even try it if it were available to you.

The point is, life is a series of situations in which lie different degrees of risk. Some go through life scared of events that never occur, some take a chance hoping for better things. Someone had to eat the first clam or tomato, and I&apos;m sure their contemporaries doom-said throughout the test process. It seems that DMSO use might be more of a philosophical choice than a medical choice, depending on one&apos;s personal odds forecast.



READ!!

Before you get all excited about someone recommending DMSO to others for use, kindly review the talk with the qualifiers attached, and the personal use only as was described.

The concept of the DMSO effect is one that might be interesting to Alphans who in general can make up their own minds about it. It was not prescribed for use, merely given a forum as to its history. Remember the aim of Alpha which is to inform or expound on any subject, which is why whatever you say is welcome.



MEDICAL ADVICE

You may not swallow my DMSO but perhaps you might agree with these nuggets of wisdom from the lexicon of age:

1. Thou shalt not try to be a champion athlete after 50.

2. Thou shalt consider losing thy temper a luxury to be indulged in very sparingly.

3. Thou shalt avoid worry. (The government will probably take care of thee anyway)

4. Thou shalt take regular vacations.

5. Thou shalt keep thy alcoholic intake below the point where it deludes thee into

thinking thou art a better man than thou ever were.

6. After a certain age, thou shalt not take unto thyself a young and frisky wife, nor even

a reasonable facsimile thereof.

Speech like that reminds me of the lady who left for church saying to her hen-pecked husband, Dust thou Art, and dust till I return!)



ENDORSEMENT

Taking last things first, I hope that you and frisky both keep in shape, but concerning the properties of DMSO, my thought was that on Alpha we have the obligation to provide news about interesting things in the world. For some, DMSO is interesting, and my position is that discussion of the material is proper in that context. I can only offer, without prescribing or recommending, historical information on DMSO which includes the benefits I have gained through personal use. Any possible use of the material by the Alphans or others is strictly up to them.

Many of the world&apos;s do-gooders of the liberal persuasion, and I&apos;m not yet lumping you or anyone else that category, would fight to your death your right to smoke pot or use cocaine, but they would stand fast on keeping DMSO away from the plebians who aren&apos;t intelligent enough to make their own decisions, at least in liberal eyes.

And to address other substances of unproved merit, I have read that the powers that be have produced an anti-herpes material and they also are working night and day to produce an anti-aids material. How much time do you think is going to go into the testing of the anti-aids stuff? Not much! Those primarily affected by aids have a much more disgustingly vocal lobby than the athletes and other sprained and strained of the world. I realize that each substance entering the pharmocopeia should be tested adequately; they should also be tested fairly.

With all due respect to your chosen vocation, if someone discovered a universal drug which would eliminate pain, disease, and sickness in general, with the only fatal element left that of old age, the AMA would fight it tooth and nail, test it to death, and bury it forever under the guise of protecting the public, with the real aim to protect their incomes.

We have parallels in the engineering field. An American inventor has allegedly developed a means by which an energy source can allegedly free the nation from its dependency on oil. He has provided a working model to the US Patent Office, but the Office has refused to issue a patent. Recently, a Federal judge has ordered the Patent Office to show cause why a patent should not be issued on the working model. Lined up against the inventor are oil companies and utilities. There will be more on this case on Alpha in coming days.



MORE SOPHISTICATED PHYSICKING

With the thought in mind of helping you out in practice, I am prepared to offer some recipes, cures, potions, and the like, which will be of value to you in treating some selected victims -- I mean patients:

1. To Cause Sleep: Take a small piece of clothing, which the person to be enchanted has worn recently. Fold it into a small bundle, and fasten it with two twigs placed in the form of an X. Then place it in or under the pillow on which he will sleep.

No more phenobarbital!!

2. For a headache: Rub the head, then wash it with hot water or vinegar, say:

 

Oh, pain in my head,

The father of all evil,

Look upon thee now!

Thou hast greatly pained me,

Thou tormentest my head,

Remain not in me!

Go thou, go thou, go home,

Whence thou, Evil One, didst suck,

Thither, thither hasten!

Who treads upon my shadow,

To him be the pain.

(Repeat this two times and call me in the morning)

3. For pain in the limbs: Spit on the place that pains you and sing the following nine times: Malignus obligavit, angelus curavit, dominus salvavit!!!

4. For a sprain if one is out of DMSO: Say, &quot;As St. Agnes went over the moon to the mountain of Moses she fell and her foot turned. But Sinue to Sinue and Bone to Bone, God makes all right to him who has faith; and be thou healed, O man, in Jesus&apos; name.

(What the women&apos;s cure is, I don&apos;t know)



5. To cause the hair to grow wherever you wish: Take the milk of a slut and saturate therewith the spot wherever the hair is desired to grow. (I think I&apos;ll let the FDA handle this one)

6. To cure fever, write the following on a piece of paper between eight o&apos;clock and nine on Friday and suspend it around the patient&apos;s neck:

H B R H C H T H B R H

H B R H C H T H B R

H B R H C H T H B

H B R H C H T H

H B R H C H T

H B R H C H

H B R H C

H B R H

H B R

H B

H

(There must be an easier way)

7. To cure the ague: Five times go to the nearest crossroads at midnight and bury a freshly laid egg.

(I tried that but was arrested for digging up 77th&amp;Ohio)

8. And last but not least, a cure for pain in the bowels and in the fatty part of the

abdomen:

&quot;...when you see a dung-beetle on the ground throwing up earth, seize him and the heap with both hands, wave him vigorously with your hands and say three times: Remedium facio adventris dolorum! Then throw away the beetle over your back; take care not to look after it. When a man&apos;s bowels or belly fat pain him, grasp his abdomen in your hands. He will soon be well. You will be able to do this for 12 months after seizing the beetle.&quot;

P.S. Cure for madness: Give mild honey and salt in a drink from a seashell before sunrise! This will work great for any second or third shift workers taking the cure.



RULES

As always, you&apos;re very easily surprised, and when confronted with sound argument generally turn to flippancy. I stand by all my statements on DMSO in which I said, DMSO works for me on sprains and such; it might even work for you. I&apos;m glad you don&apos;t do all those nasty things to your body with alcohol, nicotine, or illicit drugs, but who cares!

If someone wishes to use anything they want to, I may not agree with their choices - but it&apos;s still their choice! I may not care to do the same but I don&apos;t preach about what they should use or not use (except for that liniment). And if what they use is illegal they should be prepared for the consequences.

One question. Didn&apos;t the FDA approve marijuana for use on people with glycoma? And as for cocaine, hasn&apos;t that been long approved for use as an anesthetic? Or did you say that under the influence of an overdose of Kool Aid?

Hidden in your usual effusion of puff was one comment with which I agree, our mutual antique positions are engraved in stone, thus the controversy, although yours are more sedimentary while mine can be taken for granite.



BLOCK THAT STARCH!

You are totally correct about the thrust of Alpha-Omega; that is why we don&apos;t mind personal attacks made in good taste, or even in fun.

Concerning starch blockers, I tried them and was penalized 15 pounds for using them to block below the waist. What I remember about the concept was that the enzyme involved was derived from kidney beans, a seemingly natural source, yet were still removed from commerical circulation by the FDA because of alleged carcinogenic properties.

I use the term &apos;alleged&apos; because in some of these cases, special interest groups (as in the cyclamate flap) developed a quicky test to get them off the market. Perhaps the Weight Watchers, (a sinister group if I ever saw one, well, maybe some are right-handed) were behind the whole thing.



POISONS

If we consider anything fatal to life a poison, which should be barred from human consumption, then all would succumb to that ultimate poison, lack of life. Anything ingestible is poison; it&apos;s simply a matter of degree or quantity. Water is poison to the body in great amounts because of its dilution characteristics. Meat, potatoes, vegetables, even air can make one over-oxygenated with fatal consequences, and any organics or inorganics.

Some poisons are just faster-acting than others.

(Some might say a huge mass of marble falling on one would be in this category, but that&apos;s stretching (or squashing) it somewhat)



EATING

If your are what you eat then I must be a side of beef! (but not a turkey)

I am certain that the next subject, dieting, will stir some controversy, and I&apos;m also sure the some will have something to say, but whenever I have to lose a few pounds I turn to the Dr. Atkins diet. On this diet, which is high protein, very low carbohydrate, I eat all I care to of protein such as meat, cheese, fish, and eggs, all that some health nuts will complain about.

All I know is that it really works for me, and at the point where I can live on 30 grams of carbohydrate a day, along with my protein, it keeps on shedding pounds. The problem with Atkins, among some other things, is that one is stuck with the diet forever, and there is no gorging on sweets and malts unless one wishes to gain three pounds back in a hurry.

There have been a few complaints about the Atkins diet from others in the medical profession, but it works, and if you&apos;re reasonably healthy you can supplement with vitamins.

And the adjunct to Atkins and any other diet is still an exercise program along with the diet. That&apos;s the hard part, especially in winter. Let&apos;s face it. Exercise is boring, except for basketball or touch football.



SUPERDUPER GLUE

The use of clandestine super glue by physicians to put bones together is growing greater; it will be appropriate when finally legal. I see at the drug store that they are now selling super glue solvent in quantity for the first time. It&apos;s an amazing material.



FDA-DIOTS

The point about Doctors being subject to criminal charges for good intentions was timely and well taken.

In the news was this story about the 32 year old man whose transplanted heart was rejected by his body to the point of being fatal. The doctor in charge had a circulatory pump rushed to the scene and installed, running it for 16 hours before a different human heart became available. The man is now in &apos;guarded&apos; condition, but without that temporary heart pump aid he would be dead.

The point of this story is that because the unit used was not an FDA approved device for the purpose, the doctors involved are subject to criminal charges and sanctions, as announced by the FDA shortly after the operation.

What the FDA cuckoos are chirping about is nonsense. The device was used to save the life of a relatively young man, regardless of approval. There have been cases where extreme blockage of the trachea (windpipe) has occurred, and a doctor on the scene performed a tracheotomy so the person afflicted could continue breathing, and the device used was a make-do cylinder such as a pen body, or small pipe. Have these items been ok&apos;d by the FDA for use in such cases? I think not, but they served the purpose of saving a human being&apos;s life, and that&apos;s what counted.

Desperate circumstances require extraordinary measures; waiting for the FDA approval on a life saving device may be tantamount to a death sentence.



LOOSE LIVERS

That very tiny book did not go into detail on specific cases of the so-called psychic surgery; I would like to have you relate some of your experience in the field, what book or books are available to debunk the activity. It does sound far-fetched, and if absolutely untrue should be exposed as such. But, wouldn&apos;t it be nice if there were some people in the world that could really perform as described? I heard that some tennis star went to Brazil or Argentine to have a tumor removed in that manner, but he doesn&apos;t talk about it. Was it because it never happened, or was it because it did happen. It&apos;s an interesting subject.



PAIN.....

I have read a few articles that stated heroin is one of the better pain killers and should be legalized for terminal cancer patient use. Those who disagreed said that heroin is a morphine derivative and has no great efficaciousness than its parent. The battle rages while patients suffer.

What appears to be the truth? Is heroin more effective? If it is, why is there not effort to utilize it. Is one man&apos;s morphine another man&apos;s heroin? Would a combination of the two provide more relief? It doesn&apos;t make sense that a terminal cancer patient&apos;s great suffering should continue when:

1. That patient is denied by law the right to end his own suffering by suicide

2. The patient is also denied the right to use a substance that would make his last

moments easier.



ESPH2O

Divining, or dowsing, for water is probably the most prevalent of all ESP or clairvoyant phenomena. In his book, &apos;Wild Talents&apos; Charles Fort said:

&quot;Peasants have believed in dowsing and scientists used to believe that dowsing was only a belief of peasants. Now there are so many scientists who believe in dowsing that the suspicion comes to me that it may be a myth after all.&quot;

Incidentally, at least five of those believing scientists are Nobel Prize winners; this must mean something.

Dowsing is described as the location of underground water through the clairvoyant use of a forked stick. The dowser holds the two ends of the forked stick in a palms up fashion, exerting a pressure outwards against the wood, holding the point of the stick at a 45 degree angle upward as he walks the area.

When the dowser reaches the point over underground water, the point of the forked stick moves downwards, with so much violence, sometimes, that it tears bark and flesh, especially when the person dowsing tries to resist the downward movement.

It would appear from the literature that dowsing can be learned by anyone; however, it takes practice, just as in piano playing, to become proficient. A trained dowser must interpret the stick&apos;s movements, and relate them in terms of water depth and rate of flow.

Some dowsers use different types of sticks, or dowsing rods as they are usually called. Some work with bent coat hangers, poles, copper wires, or even shovels. The material and shape is up to the dowser.

Reports say that when a dowser finds water, he gets a tingling sensation in his hands and arms, as though a rapport is reached through a tenuous link between him and the water below.

Dowsing, or divining, appears to have started in the Harz Mountains of Germany back in the 16th century, where miners used the theory to locate metals. In France, dowsing was first used to locate water. The Baron and Baroness of Beausoleil wrote a book on the subject in 1640, whereupon they were immediately tossed in the slammer for being sorcerers, a dire warning to those who would publish books on ESP.

Some have used dowsing to find oil and minerals; some to locate criminals; and some to test foods for poison. The consensus is that the process really works, and as such is the most common manifestation of ESP, but like many manifestations, the esoteric loses its intrigue when reduced to commercial use.

There may be more Alpha discussion concerning dowsing which will discuss actual case histories.



OLD DOWSER

My first exposure to the situation was similar; an old gent arrived at an Uncle&apos;s farm in Racine County, took out his peach twig, walked the place and found three points to drill, with the second furthermost from the house as being the best.

I thought he was crazier than my Uncle who had hired him. But when the drillers came they hit water 93 feet down as advertised, and in the flow given by the dowser. I thought the drilling crew would also think our family was nuttier than usual, but it turned out that the drillers had recommended the fellow, and that he was used part time by Racine County to find water, and also to locate abandoned pipe lines.

I wouldn&apos;t even tell the guys at school about it because I was suspect as it was for working in my basement lab instead of going out on beer parties. They wouldn&apos;t have believed it anyway.

The important point is that it works, and almost anyone can learn to be proficient at it. As I mentioned, it is the most obvious manifestation of ESP as clairvoyance that is available and repeatable.



HARMONICS

Concerning dowsing: Is it possible that our bodies, which are mostly water, set up some sort of harmonic with other, larger bodies or streams of water, utilizing the dowsing rods as a sort of indicator when rapport is reached? Do we reach this hypothetical rapport without knowing it? For example, when we are either fishing, or at the beach, just relaxing and getting the good feeling that seems to go along with those activities, is that a resultant?

Now I&apos;m thirsty - is that a side effect?



POSSIBILITIES?

We have briefly discussed possible reasons for the phenomenon of homosexuality, and I would like to repeat here a brief thought I mentioned some time ago, and throw it out for dissection and argument.

The thought was, perhaps the concept of reincarnation is valid, and operates as the human spirit enters, leaves, and re-enters the flesh. (If there is a design by an all-powerful being, re-entry would have to be in tabula rasa so we wouldn&apos;t be driven crazy throughout the infant and adolescent years)

But if the psyche were intended to be either male or female in its countless aspects, and one sex only, maybe sometimes the mechanism of re-entry goes sour and an essentially female spirit accidentally enters the flesh of a male. The basic bent of that combination might cause the sex drive to be slanted towards other males, just as the proper spirit/body in its usual female flesh/sex form would be, and would be manifested in an unknown, inexorably unyielding progression simply not definable in any presently existing terms.

My question to the Alphans is, what do you think of the possibilities, and can any other causes be furnished to account for the hmsl situation? I&apos;m trying to be as objective as possible in this approach; I hope the Alphans will also.

(Another thought is, perhaps the spirit portion which is to enter the body is a tremendous intellect, but subject to the capabilities of the brain in a given body. In other words, you can get only a quart of water in a one quart jar, even if you pour into it the contents of a 10 gallon container.

Is it possible that the intellectual potential of a human being depends on the capacity of the physical brain to accept the spiritual intellectuality pouring into it? The bigger the battery, the more amp-hours it will put out; does the physical human brain work the same way in a reincarnative phase? Does that account for the fact that some of us are Die-Hards and others are AAA cells?)



A HELP, NOT A MIRACLE

If you had absorbed the absolute wisdom of Alpha when you first became a member, you will have noted the various opinions of DMSO, or dimethylsulfoxide.

Perhaps it was before your time, but DMSO was once hailed as a welcome addition to the tools of the medical profession, but since fell into disfavor for one reason or another, mainly that the FDA said it was bad and left it at that, essentially.

Without offering anything but personal opinion, and not in any way prescribing use of the substance for anyones ills, I have to repeat that for bad sprains and bad burns it works so well in giving relief. The pain of a burn can be relieved in less than 15 minutes, and hating to use the word, its like a miracle when compared to conventional burn and pain relievers.

What brought this up again was the fact that in a basketball game yesterday, my daughter suffered a bad sprain and treated the area of the sprain with DMSO, after making sure the ankle was washed very clean, and the DMSO was applied by her hand (also very clean). Prior to this the sprain was cooled off by ice pack. Within 10 minutes the pain began to subside to an acceptable level, considering the severity of the sprain.

Today, the pain is low-level, and another application of DMSO caused the pain to almost vanish. She still cant walk on it, nor does she wish to until her ankle is healed, but the point is that the stuff really helped her.

So the question is: what is your position on the use of this material?

Does it really have a beneficial effect in your opinion?

What is the uptodate opinion of the profession on DMSO? Do you think it should or should not be used?

Is there any uptodate literature on the stuff? Let us know.



MEDICAL REPORT?

A somewhat aged medical report I assure you, concepts from ancient and medieval times. Back then physicians, barbers, and other healers of the soul and body considered the four humours as a base of existing medicine, body fluids correspondent to the Aristotlean elements of earth, air, fire, and water.

Black bile, or melancholy was earth; yellow bile, or choler, was air; phlegm was water; and blood was fire. It was thought necessary by the healers that a proper balance had to be maintained in order to keep one&apos;s health. A symptom of imbalance towards one of the humours would require treatment of the opposite. If the patient might be experiencing a high fever he might be placed in cold water to bring the humours on a par, a sort of kill-or-cure treatment. Ah, if life were only so repairable by the doctors of today.

This sort of medical treatment is called Enantiopathy, and even now it is used in modified form by contemporary practitioners, within reason, of course, inasmuch as hyperventilation might be balanced by immersing the victim, I mean patient, in a swimming pool.

Those were simpler, but deadlier, times - Hippocrates notwithstanding. (Why do I seem to hear echoes of rock music while contemplating the Aristotlean elements?)



GOODBYE HOLLYWOOD?

A recent news column brought out the fact that actors and actresses are so afraid of getting AIDS from a hmsl colleague that they are calling the Screen Actors Guild for legal advice concerning their own civil rights in the matter.

It noted that many performers do admit being gay, and try to hide the fact now, but the word is getting around, and a quasi-blacklisting of hmsl actors is in effect with the full acquiescence of non-AIDS individuals.

Dont look for much kissing going on in show business until those involved can produce a clean bill of health. (Talk about the kiss of death)

Perhaps it will come to the point where every man, woman, child, and mixtures thereof will have to be tested for the disease, and a scarlet &apos;A&apos; tattooed on their foreheads if they have it, with a free ticket to San Francisco given along with the A.

Hester Prynne lives!



HUMAN

It appears that prior to conception, the ovum and sperm are separate and could not be considered to be a human being. However, when the two combine, they form an entity which, if allowed to grow unchecked, will eventually become a living, breathing human being.

I think the criterion just may be that of an allowance to grow and mature, and if so, then the newly formed embryo is certainly a human being. Why? Because if allowed to mature, it will grow into a male or female human form, and none other.

If there were a chance that the embryo would develop into another type of mammal, then I might concur with your cut-off point. But there is not! The embryo begins as a human being, with all of the genetic patterns we have in the human body at any age, and grows to human status, first in, then out of the womb.

If it grows up to be a human it&apos;s human from the beginning; if it doesn&apos;t, it won&apos;t be human.



AXIOM

I think the precise quote is, ontogeny recapitulates philogeny, if you&apos;ll pardon my nit picking criticism.

Yes, the development path taken by the fetus is troubling to those who do not believe in evolution, ie: the creationists. My position is that I find it difficult to believe either side.

And playing devil&apos;s advocate, it also could be said that even though the fertilized chicken egg has all the parts to develop a chicken, it&apos;s indefensible to call an egg a chicken.

So again it boils down to establishing a point at which the embryo is considered human, and this point changes with the belief held.



ZYGOTE

I must have missed the point of your talk. Taking the zygote from its mother before birth certainly constitutes abortion, does it not?

And after birth, removing the baby from its mother and not feeding it would certainly kill it.

But that&apos;s legally murder.

What I&apos;m asking is, was it to make a point or strictly informational?



SOME THOUGHTS

It is easy for you to discuss abortion in those terms now that you are already born; we wouldn&apos;t have been able to hear your thoughts had someone accepted the premise that you were simply an unknowing parasite and had you scraped into a container. (subjective, right?)

Anyway, I think you&apos;re blurring the absolute distinction between parasite and fetus. The parasites are content to live out their lives in a generally one-way relationship; the pre-birth human comes to term.

And it is my feeling, that the mother-offspring relationship is one totally different in that it is the determined method of reproducing the species, and while there may be elements of a clinical parasitism, those elements do not establish a host-parasite condition.

But regardless of all the words yea or nay, I think that abortion on demand is repugnant, at any stage, but I also feel that abortions can be morally justified in certain circumstances where the life of the mother, rape, incest, established pre-birth retardism, and the like, are concerned.

It&apos;s seems a rational position to me.



UNWED MOTHERS

The social aspect of the unwed mothers is, of course, an equally compelling problem in that it is a self-perpetuating welfarism.

One of the reasons it is acceptable, particularly in the black community, is that there is no social stigma or onus involved. In fact, as you have so deftly pointed out, there is an increasing reward based on piece-work incentive.

Let&apos;s establish some criteria, if we can, to accommodate part of the problem. Could we say that after one unmarried birth, paid for in full by the tax-payers, the woman be surgically made unable to bear more children, and that the child would be placed for adoption, and the woman would not collect any welfare at any time?

Even if the child were brought up by institution, there would be more of a chance for it to learn social values than by staying with a promiscuous female; probably get fed and clothed better also.

Any additions to this rather draconian approach?



SEX EDUCATION AT HOME

It appears as though we are all treading gingerly around the home sex education thought, agreeing that it is a good thing, but not getting to the basics of when to start and what to teach.

What is the problem?

It is the fact that the husband-wife relationship is one of deep intimacy, and is extremely difficult, if not downright embarrassing, to explain the very private relationship to one&apos;s own child no matter what his age.

This is the real obstacle, in my opinion, to comprehensive sex education in the home, by the parents, and again in my opinion, sex education is best taught in schools on a more or less clinical basis by objective teachers.

How do you feel about this thesis? Cop-out or reasonable?



SOME MARRIAGE!

Oakland is adjacent to the San Francisco fairyland so it should come as no surprise that a hmsl and his transvestite &apos;wife&apos; were allowed to adopt a year old baby boy in that land of fruits and nuts.

And being the mothers that they are, when the baby cried they beat it to death with a shoe, telling the authorities that the child had suffered a seizure.

Alvin Woodward and &apos;Jean Woodward,&apos; better known as Greg Rogers, have been arraigned on murder charges in Oakland, and held without bail.

The private agency that gave them the small boy, &apos;The Black Adoption&apos; agency, is licensed by the state, and has placed 24 children in the past three years. If this is an example of their adoption acumen, they should be put out of business.

The only positive note of this entire tragic affair is that California has the death penalty for murder, a penalty which is most appropriate punishment for the outrageous crime. Too bad it couldn&apos;t be more.

Boiling in oil comes to mind.



LIFE FOR A LIFE

Anyone who kills children should be themselves executed, regardless of race, creed, color, national origin, or sexual preference, especially when the children are simply children without menace or intent, as was in the case of the Oakland pair.

That act was deliberate; there was no war, no military activity; the child was not killed incidental to battle or defense; it was just killed.

Will you be in the front ranks of those who call for registration of shoes as deadly weapons? Or will you be the sole representative?

(am I a heel for asking?)



CONCERN

Of course I care what the fags do in the privacy of their sewers; like when the two Frisco area hmsls killed that little boy, that some weird adoption agency let them abuse to death.

Aren&apos;t you aware of the tremendous North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) network operating in the US? Is this the private &apos;life-style&apos; you would allow or condone? When you are a parent, do you want your children exposed to the activities of these swine? Would you want your kids placed in a school situation where this type of degenerate operates?

As the paper quoted yesterday, the Bible says Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. In many areas of the world, homosexuality is a crime. Not a wholesome subject in any case.



FANTASIES

The ultimate aim of those who indulge in degraded practices, such as hmsls do, is to drag normal people down to their levels of thought and acquiescence. Your try lay in the accusation you made in what you must consider the acme of entendre, but what is only the manifestation of your over-tolerance to the faggian life-style.

It becomes obvious that those who are indeed over-tolerant to the hmsl relationship must have some identification with it, even if vicariously, and it seems that you fit the mold. Your mincing word play was ever in doubt, and the implication that avid dislike for a concept reflects a latent desire is suspect at most.

But I&apos;m generally good-natured, and can understand your aims; but, how fortunate for you that those accusations are made in person - I&apos;m noted for a predilection towards stamping out the viola tricolor hortensis, literally or figuratively.

In any case, I&apos;ve proclaimed on many occasions that I am a bigoted person, meaning that I tolerate groups or individuals on my own terms, and don&apos;t feel compelled to associate with any I do not wish to; conversely, I don&apos;t allow any to force their association on me.

Make the attempt to understand that position. If you don&apos;t care for that stance, so be it; simply curb your own predilection for slyness and innuendo wrapped in too-pretty prose.

As Sigerson Holmes almost said, &apos;Talk like a man, for god&apos;s sakes.



MEDIA DRUG CULTS

I feel that one of the reasons drug use by the younger people has become so prevalent is its glorification by the TV and Movie media. It is portrayed in so many programs as being an acceptable action, of little consequence, that the dangers are glossed over.

Without beating the old, liberal dead horse, it is in fact the liberalization of sex and drugs that has helped to convince today&apos;s teen-agers that it is all right to dabble in either without retribution. The Hollywood cokers and grassers push the recreational concept of drug use as normal - which it is not.

In &quot;Airplane&quot; we get a look at the matron who refuses alcohol, but gets her coke out and sniffs it. In &quot;Stone&quot; they show how the two get pleasantly high on grass in a smuggler&apos;s crashed plane, right next to his skeleton.

Nice!

Plus all the Cheech and Chong works of hippy-dippy wonder.

The contemporary scene has its base in the pillosophy of, &quot;If it feels good, do it.&quot; Or smoke it, or inject it, or sniff it, or bed it.

None of the nations where drug use is commonplace have ever become great.

Or ever will.



LEARNED OR GENETIC

I don&apos;t think that my opinion as to the above with regard to the hmsl preferences of an individual has any bearing on the fact. I have the personal dislike of the heterosexual type towards the hmsl activity.

Concerning blacks in general, it&apos;s possible that Dr. Shockley is correct in his statements on the subject, and then again he may not be. As I said, I&apos;m a selective bigot without regard to.....etc.

Do you think football has the answer? The quarterback is usually white, as are the offensive tackles, guards, and center. In those positions is where the intelligence is most needed. The rest is physical and reactionary and bulk.

My use of the baboon term was to describe the arrogance of the subjects in question in view of their reprehensible actions in the event. Not only does the term hold, but it may have been too charitable.

And if one counts all the people who consider Bishop Tutu a cerebral defective were massed in one huge area, you wouldn&apos;t notice me in the crowd. He really doesn&apos;t seem too bright, when compared to a Julian Bond, for example, or a Cosby, both of whom have admirable intellects, and who may be nuggets in a wash of pebble.



DMSO REVISITED

The other day a sibling dropped a heavy board on his toe at school; it swelled up immediately and painfully, becoming discolored.

After being brought home, the sibling washed off the toe area thoroughly, applied DMSO to the affected area, and took two aspirins.

Within minutes the pain went away and the healing process began. He was able to go to work that evening, and in two days the toe returned to normal.

No, it wasn&apos;t just the two aspirins, which were all he took; it was the effect of the DMSO on the bruise that accelerated the cessation of pain and the healing. For bruises and sprains, aspirins and DMSO seem to have a synergistic effect.

Maybe it shouldn&apos;t work, but I can&apos;t argue with results.

(For burns it is a godsend)



10. THE US AND THE SOVIETS

I realize I&apos;m going to repeat what you already know. The United States must maintain equality or superiority (preferred) over the Soviet Union simply because they are the entity which has as one of its basic political precepts the overthrow of every non-communist government in the world and the subjugation of the peoples thereof according to the gospel of Karl Marx, in the Russian version thereof.

If the United States had no nuclear capabilities, and the Soviets did, Europe would have fallen long ago, and we would be worrying about the Peoples Republic of Britain, of France, of Spain, etc.

The only thing that scares the Soviets is our nuclear capability; they know a nuclear war would be a disaster for all, with both Washington and Marx in the same category as Libowitzs Canticle as the years passed.

Moderators comments follow:



GENEVA MUMBLES

I note in the foreign news that reports indicate the Soviets are again stone-walling the talks in their usual manner, hoping to buy some more time for increasing their own armaments; but, Reagan won&apos;t let them get away with it like other presidents have - no discussion, no talks; wait for it!



PARALLELS

Throughout history, whenever new defensive or offensive weapons have been either completed or in various stages of development, there have been those who were against weapons and war. Why? Because they were fearful of the consequences of war and of new weapon use.

Generally, their fears came true, there was war, there was deployment of new weapons, there were serious consequences. However, when one side only had the new weapons, they usually prevailed. When both sides had the weapons, either there was no war, a situation based on mutual wariness, or there was essentially a tie game, with the only losers the civilians, and the level of destruction dependent on the weapons used.

What makes one think that if the Soviets were the only nation with nuclear missiles the world would be at normal peace? It&apos;s obvious that we would be subject to a continuous nuclear blackmail, or would already have been carbonized into surrender.

No, the only way to keep peace is to be prepared to devastate completely an aggressive opponent by any means. Because the US has this apparent capability, the Soviets have been kept in reasonable check. There is a war going on right now, believe it or no; it is only the level that changes.

 

It is being fought in the high tech marketplaces where the Soviets continue trying to obtain American and other technology through sub rosa means in order to achieve higher plateaus of military advantage. It is fought in other nations of the world where the Soviet tentacles reach out to enwrap governments in the Marxist ideology. It is fought right here in the United States where communist agents of all degree try to undermine the American way of existence. It is fought in the Soviet Union where our own agents try to determine what the Soviet military achievements in potential have reached.

The fight at this time is in Central America, namely Nicaragua and El Salvador, where Moscow directs the insurrections and rebellions as though from the strings of a puppet. Why are some US intellectuals and religionists so vehement in their condemnation of our attempting to keep Communism out of this hemisphere? We hear the same tired voices in the same weary grooves blasting the country in which they live for trying to maintain defenses against Communism that we heard during Viet Nam. Whose side are they on?

Perhaps there is a gigantic conspiracy in all this, orchestrated and conducted by the Kremlin, or perhaps not. However, there is a particular group who seems to be against the following:

US military strengthening

US trying to keep Communism away from the western hemisphere

Any phase of US foreign policy (unless it&apos;s a capitulation to a Soviet demand)

US standing fast against Soviets and their lackeys in the UN.

Rights of US citizens versus rights of criminals.

Any path the US may wish to take contrary to Soviet policy.

These are only a few elements of a possible conspiracy. If you don&apos;t like the word conspiracy, how do we characterize the Hiss&apos;s, the Rosenbergs, the Jane Fondas, those with the same faces that march at every opportunity if the government is involved, those who have not one good word for our administrations, right or left, but use the media to denigrate all things American with a sort of wry sarcasm to indicate total disdain for the only country in which they are allowed to exist.

There can be two types of conspiracies, one where a group meets with a set plan to achieve a nefarious end, and another which may consist of a very loose network of people who work with a cryptic understanding of the conspiracy, but try to achieve the same nefarious ends when their efforts culminate.

The message here is, taking the paths of those who quaver and quake before an enemy leads to inevitable defeat. The only way is to become strong and remain strong, and to be willing to fight it out against the enemy on every level, both in shooting and non-shooting major wars. If the non-shooting war can be won, or at least kept even, the shooting war will have a much lesser chance of breaking out.!

The war has started and is on right now; some of us actively struggle against the enemy directly; some of us lend support. If the red dawn ever comes to the US, some will be shooting at the enemy, others may throw books. Which will be more effective?



NUMBERS

In all seriousness, I must say that 15,000 missiles unfired are the aim of our government, and all governments that have any sort of reasonable leadership. All of what you said may be true, but with only 200 missiles on each side, one side or the other might be more tempted to launch a first strike on the gamble that much of the other&apos;s would be crippled.

No, give us lots of backup systems, indicating that it will take more than one shot to be our side. Your position that the sheer numbers are too high is valid; one is too many! But until you can get the Soviets to halt their pursuit of world conquest and domination, I&apos;ll feel more comfortable with 15,000 plus arrows in our collective quiver, if only to indicate to the enemy that it will be to his great disadvantage to shoot first.

I used the quantity of 200 missiles as a basic; the amount may differ in actuality.



A GREATER HOLOCAUST

It was 1933 when Good Old Joe Stalin&apos;s friend, Franklin D. Roosevelt, did a big favor for the Soviet Union by recognizing as a nation instead of the bandit enclave of communists that it was, thus giving it a stature its reprehensible slavemasters did not deserve.

In the years of 1932 and 1933, while FDR was kissing the communist bear, there was a nation of people living in what was called the Ukraine, now in the grasp of the Soviets. The Ukranians were a tough and proud bunch. They resisted the communist tyranny in any way possible.

In order to break the Ukraine, Stalin ordered that their borders be sealed completely around. The soviet exterminators set up the first iron curtain checkpoints, making certain that no food got in and no Ukrainians got out.

When two years were up, almost nine million Ukrainians had died, in what was essentially one, big communist death camp, far surpassing what had happened in the nazi camps.

But the Ukranians had no world wide publicity system. No TV or movie stars visited the dying country, no protest songs were written, no Fondas, or Ramsey Clarks, or Jesse Jacksons, or Simon Wiesenthals went there to report on the tragedy.

After some fifty years, a Montreal filmmaker named Yuri Luhovy has produced a movie called Harvest of Despair, which describes the horrors of the Soviet-made famine in the Ukraine. It is 57 minutes of stark terror. Up to now, no American or Public network has broadcast the film.

Is it because of all the left-liberal sympathizers in the networks, and especially in PBS, that this film is not shown? I wouldn&apos;t bet against it. There is said by some to be many crypto-communists in those organizations, who would rather show the soviet version of WWII and Viet Nam than any other.



MORE SOVIET PROPAGANDA

It appears that the Kremlin has produced another in its public relations programs, using its favorite American television medium, the Public Broadcast System.

It was sponsored by some gaggle called the IPPNW, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a California (where else?) group who is known as Beyond War, for short.

The program was clumsily named, &quot;The Beyond War Space Bridge,&quot; and documents the award ceremony held simultaneously via satellite between Moscow and, appropriately enough, San Francisco.

It opened with a few hundred hand-picked hand wavers in Moscow and a few thousand in Frisco. The American MC was Richard Rathbun, of some outfit called the Creative Initiative foundation, and the Soviet MC was Vladimir Posner. The Soviets shouted greetings to Frisco, the Americans returned them to Moscow, all in heavy accent, of course.

Then came the propaganda barrage, with awards to a Soviet and American physician, who drooled the line of a &apos;Spacebridge&apos; showing the effects of a nuclear war, the theme being to rid the world of nuclear weapons, with America leading the way, I suppose.

The PBS broadcast really showed how gullible the US peaceniks are, falling over in their zealous need to believe the Soviet peace line, disregarding the cold reality of the world, with Soviet militarism, expansionism, the repression of human rights, and the existence of the gulags.

While prisoners freeze and die in those Soviet concentration camps, and the civilians of Afghanistan are being bombed and strafed, the peace and co-existence drivel of the Soviets fall on peacenik American ears, who only hear what they wish.

The Spacebridge nonsense was a cleverly orchestrated Soviet propaganda ploy designed for the manipulation of the naive American.

The broadcast failed to show one segment. It was when an uninvited elderly Hungarian lawyer disrupted the proceedings, and, according to the WSJ, said the following:

&quot;The Soviets cannot be trusted in any way. They occupied our country in 1945, and in 1956 when we were winning the struggle for our freedom we sent a delegation to talk to them which never returned.&quot;

This brave Hungarian lawyer is probably in a gulag, or an insane asylum, somewhere in the Soviet bloc, if he is alive at all.

My own question is, why do we allow the PBS to brazenly show the communist propaganda it does? We get programs made in the Soviet Union about how they won WWII, programs making the statement that the US was the aggressor in Viet Nam, stark, agit-prop broadcasting on a tax-supported system public network. To where do these show&apos;s producers owe their loyalties?

We should not fund the anti-American, pro-communist lies on PBS, starting with the Spacebridge idiocy. I, for one, will write my Congressman and protest; it might even help.

I get the gut feeling, based on past experience with the evil Empire, that their next invasion is going to be into Pakistan, and they will put enough roadblocks up on the coming &apos;arms reduction talks&apos; to furnish an excuse to march in, &apos;to protect their southern border of Afghanistan against the mighty forces of Karachi.&apos;

Note: Remember those communist propaganda broadcasts when the PBS beggars are on trying to separate you from your money. If you&apos;re a Channel 10/36 friend, you may also unwittingly be a Kremlin Television Network friend. And don&apos;t bother to bring up Dr. Who and the other good programs; they are good enough so that if PBS vanished, they would still get sponsored, as would McNeil-Lehrer.



GENOCIDE CONVENTION

Since Harry Truman first presented it, the plan for the US to join the Soviet Union in ratifying the genocide convention has come up annually.

Genocide refers to the mass murder of a specific group, simply, but any reference to the type of murder has been omitted at the request of the Soviets. Why? Because of past, present, and continuing Soviet misdeeds, along with those of China, and others, to wit:

Since the Soviets came to power in 1917, they killed 5 million minorities and political enemies; 7 million died as a result of deliberate famine authorized by Moscow; 14 million died in the revolution and the civil war and purge that followed; more millions died in the infamous &apos;Operation Keelhaul&apos; plan that forced Soviets and non-Soviets to be repatriated against their will; the Reds murdered 14,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest; even now the Soviet murderers are killing innocent people in Afghanistan.

This is the type of bandit nation we should join in a genocide pact?

In communist China, it is estimated that almost 64 million people were killed by the communists and Mao.

Cambodian dictator Pol Pot slaughtered 2.5 million.

In toto, it is estimated that the communists alone are responsible for over 120 million deaths, but that deaths of this political nature wouldn&apos;t count with the genociders.

What would count is if someone said anything &apos;defamatory&apos; about the Soviets; they could be arrested and taken out of the country to stand trial before some non-US tribunal.

What we don&apos;t need is some ridiculously named pact covering crimes that the US doesn&apos;t commit anyway.



MORE INFAMY!

They are but five lonely Arctic islands, Wrangel, Herald, Bennett, Henrietta, and Jeanette. Wrangel Island was claimed for the United States by Captain Calvin Hooper on 8/12/1881; it is equal in size to Rhode Island and Delaware together. The three DeLong Islands of Bennett, Henrietta, and Jeanette were claimed in 1881 by US Navy Commander G.W. DeLong, and Herald Island was claimed in 1923 after Canada and Great Britain had abandoned their own sovereign claims.

What&apos;s important about these islands?

They are a part of the United States, and control vast amounts of oil-rich sea beds and a great deal of the US continental shelf, in which great deposits of petroleum are said to lie.

So what&apos;s the controversy?

Just that our weakling Department of State wants to give away these islands and the sea bed involved to the Soviet Union, which is tantamount to giving up control of that area of the Bering Sea to the Soviets.

And the foggy bottom boys also want to change the 1867 US-Russia convention line (established by the sale of Alaska to the US) from a correctly termed &apos;line of allocation&apos; to an &apos;International Boundary,&apos; which would result in the continental shelf giveaway.

Jesse Helms and Mark Siljander have both introduced legislation to halt the striped-pants pansys from any move to turn the islands over to the Soviet Union, and Helms&apos; bill has picked up the sponsorship of 12 Republicans and 12 Democrat, with more certain to follow as the citizens of the US hear more about what has been somewhat of a State Department secret.

So far, Shell, Amoco, Arco, and Unocal have bid over 100 million dollars for oil and gas leases, but have been held up from exploring by the lack of will inherent in all state department activities.

Joe McCarthy may have had his faults, but his feeling that communist sympathizers existed in State seemed to make a lot of sense then, and based on recent State actions, could give the impression that the comsymps of the 50&apos;s still are moled up there in the 80&apos;s.

We gave away the Canal; let&apos;s draw the line at this.



COMMUNISM DEFINED

My contemporary definition of communist is, that philosophy espoused by the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist government of the Soviet Union, whose unabashed aim, of which they have spoken and published these many years, is to overthrow the non-communist countries of the world, especially the United States, and transform the entire world into their version of a totalitarian communist state.

The people that are a part of this world-wide conspiracy, and avow its aims, are the enemies of the US and the non-communist world. Anyone who believes otherwise either doesn&apos;t wish to believe, hasn&apos;t the perception to believe, or has been brainwashed into not believing.

Or resists believing to feather their own political nests.

Like the Massachusetts wimps, Leahy for one.

Like the Wisconsin weaklings; Moody, for one.

If you don&apos;t believe what we are up against, that there is no group of deeply entrenched Soviet/communists in our nation&apos;s media, then watch the one-sided left-wing special which will be airing on Channel 18 this week, and note the distortions manifested in a zealous effort to brainwash our nation into believing that our efforts to bring Nicaragua to democracy by throwing out the Sandinistas is completely wrong, and that no funding of the contras should be allowed.

From the liberal/leftist/marxist/soviet/communist conspiracy that brought you The Fall of China, The Fiasco of Korea, The Congressional Defeat in Viet Nam, The Debasement of Cuba, The Tragedy of Iran, comes now a new production of The Central American Takeover, starring Ortega, Castro, Gorbechev, Khaddafi, the revolutionary church, members of the US congress, the US media, and the US academe, in another of the continuing search for communist &apos;peace&apos; in the world extravaganzas.

For the record, the program, &quot;Faces of War,&quot; is a completely biased film narrated by leftist-activist John Farrell, and produced by some San Francisco group calling itself Project Neighbor to Neighbor. The propaganda piece was rejected by more than 100 TV stations throughout the nation, and accepted only by 30.

The general manager of WVTV/18, Al Leitl, said he had no qualms about showing the film, no matter what its content. Leitl must be of the Cassius Clay school of patriotism; Clay, the well-known draft-dodger, was famous for his words, &quot;I got nothin against them Viet Congs.&quot;

You can view this piece of liberal trash at 11:30 pm, Tuesday evening.

Another likely leftish &quot;winner&quot; will be a PBS paen to Nicaragua titled, &quot;Who&apos;s Running the War,&quot; also on Tuesday, 9 pm. Looks like the media fellow-travelers are pulling out all the stops in their efforts to further the Soviet cause. It wouldn&apos;t surprise me to see Ed Asner with a part in either pink-tinted showing.

Of course Leitl is running one of the lesser stations of the area, and the $1500 the station will be paid might have had a bearing on his decision.

To further the Soviet cause, ideology and money are the primary tools.

The political blindness and downright stupidity of the targets is a big help to them also.



BIG-HEARTED

Look for the Soviets to use the Iceland meeting to lay the groundwork for a magnanimous summit gesture whereby they will reluctantly leave the friendly skies of Afghanistan in trade for some massive US or western concession.

Having had their marxist noses rubbed into the Afghan mountains for so long, they are dying to get out, but want the event itself to appear as though they were condescending to show the world their big hearts, and to make their escape; all they want is New York City and free lifetime passes to Disneyland.

Like I said, I&apos;m still a hawk with regard to the soviet menace; they can have New York City, but no access to Mickey Mouse!

(The democrats have mickey mouse approaches sewed up already in any case)



ICELAND CHILLS

Those who are musically inclined must certainly be aware of yet another little Soviet symphony for the tremulous, orchestrated by the Kremlin Conservatory of propaganda. Reading the score closely indicates that the initial three movements were carefully designed to produce a crescendo in the finale wherein enough brass was supposed to drown out the SDI theme.

For those who blindly dwell on each &apos;positive&apos; arms control or arms reduction phrase from the Soviets, with the hope that springs eternal within the craven&apos;s breast, the work was a masterpiece, never mind the discords obvious to the more sophisticated communist critics.

Yes, obvious, that the entire thrust of Soviet Iceland was to imply that arms reductions, or outright disarmament, might be accomplished, and at the end, all Gorby wanted was a mean little quid, SDI, effectively eliminated.

Those whose eyes were filled with the stuff disarmament dreams are made of should join those of the real world who recognize the time-worn communist ploy to gain time at the expense of western military preparedness, in order to develop their own hardware, just as in that period of sweetness and light in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s known as &apos;detente,&apos; in which the US cut back on missiles and the Soviets forged ahead.

The thought expressed in the media by various congressmen and others that we have missed the chance of a lifetime in the Iceland conference is the garbage left over from shattered liberal illusions.

And through their tears and heart&apos;s blood they should answer this question:

Which nation in the world, by its own manifesto, is bent on conquest, on an unholy mission to communize the globe in its own image? Which nation is it that holds in subjugation the small, formerly free states around it, and promotes wars of communist take-over in other areas of the world, and who must build walls about itself to keep people from getting out?

The world is not much different from the playground; placating the bully only makes him meaner; when a firm stand is taken, the bully backs off and growls to himself. In this case, the growls of the bully Bear still scare the timid, or as Tom Wolfe might say, nyet-nyetting the ochre retchers!



ATTITUDE

I don&apos;t think most of us hate the Soviet people much at all; we save our disfavor for the communist party, the KGB, and the leadership of the soviet union who maintain a constant, freedomless pressure on their hapless non-communist member citizenry simply to reinforce control.

And to amplify on that theme, what was Russia was the area around Moscow north to Finland, south to the Ukraine, etc. Geographically, Russia ends at the west along the Volga. From the Caspian sea, Kazakhstan stretches to Red China, and the people who live in that area are Asian stock.

Besides the captive nations of east European Bloc, there also are Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and their people. There are Ukrainians, Georgians, Armenians, and Tadzhiks and Uzbeks, just to name a few. The religions run from marxism to orthodox, to Islam. And in actuality, the Soviet communists have done fairly well in keeping all of the non-russo soviets under control. Half of the people living within the borders of the soviet empire are not Soviets - they simply are oppressed by the Soviets.

Unrest is building in all the non-Soviet states, the last problem area being Kazakhstan, which was swept by riots when the Supreme Soviet replaced a Kazakh with a Russian.



11. SCIENCE AND ALCHEMY

The scientific Alphans speak on perpetual motion, the impact of water on life, the effects of pressure and temperature on gases, bioelectronic implants in humans that may program the brain, the possible flow of that supercooled fluid we call glass. They even consider a disk-shaped planet earth, and pay heed to the mathematical concepts of Dr. Einstein, along with capturing worms and heating water.

Moderators comments follow:



TOP TEN

Alphans of Latin oriented bent or study may recognize the following phrase &quot;Las 10 Formulas Matematicas que Cambiaron La Faz de la Terra,&quot; or if not, can determine anyway that it refers to 10 mathematical formulas that might have altered the face of the world. These are:

1 + 1 = 2

f = Gm1 m2 / r sqrd

E = mc sqrd

e^lnN = N

A sqrd + B sqrd = C sqrd

S = k log W

V = Ve ln M0/M1

Gamma = h/mv

V sqrd E = (Ku/Csqrd) (delta sqrd E/delta t sqrd)

F1 X1 = F2 X2

Some are fairly obvious, although the first one may have been tricky at its inception. Let&apos;s have a try at identifying some of the others; it may be necessary to re-write them from computerese to math-ease so they look a bit more familiar.

 

CYCLES

Freon is a most compressible gas, thus its use in many types of refrigeration systems. The key to the hot/cold issued is energy. When freon is compressed to a liquid, it takes heat energy to do the compressing job; the motor gets hot and the pump gets hot, and the fan at the back of the refrigeration system takes off the heat. In its compressed state, freon may be said to possess kinetic energy, or some of the energy used to compress it, based on system efficiency.

And we all know that when a gas under pressure is released to nearly atmospheric, it expands and becomes cold. A refrig system using freon, therefore, squeezes the gas to make it liquid, giving off hear which is fan dispersed, and the liquid is allowed to expand through a radiator, making it cold, which is also dispersed for use as cooled air. It is not just freon that is used; older refrigerators used sulfer dioxide; some systems used carbon dioxide; very large refrig systems use ammonia to chill glycol for cooling use in beverage plants. Any easily compressed gas can be used.



PERPETUAL MOTION

We had a discussion recently about the possibilities of developing some type of perpetual motion. This concept has been intriguing man for many centuries, the idea of getting something for nothing. I would like to hear from fellow Alphans concerning the subject, and if they feel that a P.M. unit could or could not work, and why. What do you think?



RELATIVE

The cogent responses to the perpetual motion discussion led to more thoughts on the subject. Consider that all is relative to our life span. Would it not follow that any effect that was continuous throughout that lifetime might be construed as perpetual motion?

Example: If the PM concept is broadened somewhat to enfold a continuous output of energy, then the sun -to all the humans that ever lived might be a perpetual motion device. And why not? There it hangs, emitting energy day after day, maintaining life on planet Earth. Perpetual Motion? To us, certainly. Theoretical science implies that at some point in the future, the inexorable laws of entropy will ensure that the sun will run out of power, but who living today can guarantee that it will, or that the energy output will not run forever. No one!

And by using this concept as a yardstick, it could be argued that there is PM relative to the human life span. Perhaps some day an engineer or scientist will develop a device that uses the rotation of the Earth as a power source, which to human spans, will be perpetual motion.

 

INERTIA

A brief treatise on inertia has it that an object at rest tends to remain at rest until acted upon by an outside force; the same with an object in motion.

At the Earth&apos;s surface, one can shoot an arrow which is acted upon immediately by the forces involving air friction, which slows down the arrow, gravity, which pulls the arrow towards the Earth, and the Earth itself which stops the arrow completely, in a relative sense.

In space, where friction may be meaningless, and the object in question has escape velocity enough to elude the sun and planets of the solar system, the object may travel for light years until - it meets friction in the form of space dust or an atmosphere, it is captured by a huge gravitational field, or it runs into a solid, such as a planet. Inertia works the same all over, just like gravity.



WATER

One of my clones told me that the teacher in his science class said that water was a completely incompressible substance whereupon Clone I told the teacher that his Dad said it was compressible, and it turned into a contest of Oh Yeah?

Anyway, I&apos;ll leave it up to the brilliance of the Alphan society to proffer opinions on the subject, then offer my own. What do you think?



SOME LIKE IT HOT

Just because a substance has a lesser or greater volume at a given temperature, does that make it incompressible? Think about it.



THE PRESSURE IS ON!

Actually, everything is compressible; it&apos;s simply a matter of application of power. However, if you fill a non-leaking cylinder with water, and apply pressure with a non-leaking piston, it would appear that the movement is minuscule and unmeasurable. For that reason many have stated that water cannot be compressed, especially if you try to do the job by your own physical force.

But let&apos;s imagine that we have an unleakable container holding 100 gallons of water. If we exert a force on that volume of 14,000 pounds per square inch, the volume of the water will shrink to 99 gallons. More pressure (from whatever source), will cause further shrinkage. What we are really doing, difficult as it may seem, is pushing the electrons closer to the nucleus.

Ultimately, as was implied, any substance can be converted into degenerate matter, compressing further into a volume of neutrons that touch one another, finally compress because of its own gravity into a black hole.



HARD WATER

What our friend mentioned in a jocular sense makes an interesting subject; that is, water expands when it freezes. But why should water be different? By that I mean, most substances gain volume as they get hotter, and lose it as they cool. Metals have a co-efficient of thermal expansion usable by engineers to determine how much they will expand in summer, due to the heat, and contract in winter. Concrete does the same, accounting for the gaps purposely placed in streets to accommodate the fluctuations in temperature.

In any case, water does indeed grow in volume when it freezes; I&apos;m sure the Alphans can tell us why.



WATER, WATER, EVERYWHERE

There was a good deal of interesting response concerning the characteristics of water. How many of the Alphans have heard of &quot;polywater?&quot; Can water actually be polymerized? It&apos;s still water, though, but is it different.



OLD GLASS

I think the glass is fracturing because of stress placed on it due to movement in the structures. Age doesn&apos;t seem to have much to do with spontaneous fracture. He was correct in saying glass was a super-cooled liquid, but I can&apos;t accept his conjecture on why some panes were thicker at the bottom due to gravitational forces. If his theory is correct, then all of the glass vases made in B.C. would have collapsed into a puddle of cold glass.

On your other question, we are called Alphans for two reasons, neither of which have anything to do with proper Greek: One is, it sounds better than Alphians; Two is, we don&apos;t have to type that extra &apos;i&apos; all the time; think of the milliseconds saved by this!



MORE AQUEOUS HUMOR

A number of Alphan responses concerning water have discussed the density. The consensus is, in accordance with physics, that water does become more dense when it is warmed by the summer sun, and in fact there are three definite layers of water in a given lake or pond by mid-summer. The upper layer is warm, about 65 to 75 degrees F; the middle layer temperature is much cooler, 45 to 65 degrees; the bottom layer is the coldest, about 39 to 45 degrees.

These temperature extremes can be verified by any intrepid Alphan by visiting the Racine Quarry Park which is about 90 feet deep. Down to a point, the deeper one goes, the colder it gets.

But does this temperature caused variation in density have any practical aspect. Of course, otherwise the data would not be appearing here.

The warm upper layer cools in autumn until its temperature nears that of the middle and lower layers. As the wind blows, it helps the surface water to sink, causing a circulation effect from top to bottom. This is a phenomenon known as the fall overturn.

As winter comes, the cold surface water continues sinking; however, near the freezing point, its density decreases, the colder water turns to ice, hardening at the surface.

Then the warm weather of late spring melts the ice and the water is warmed to a point higher than 39 degrees, whereupon it again becomes more dense and sinks, causing another mixing and circulatory action, eventually to be again rather uniform in temperature.

Is this important? Well, the movement of the water layers help mix oxygen into the water for plants and fish to utilize. Without this action there would be a lot less fish and plants in our Wisconsin lakes, and even in Lake Michigan, so the circulation of the oxygen rich layers to the oxygen poor regions of the lake help keep the price of fishing low for the sport fisherman, and the price of smelt low for the consumer.

It is strange how water alone has this density/temperature characteristic. But perhaps it isn&apos;t the only substance that acts like this. Do any Alphan physicists know of others? It&apos;s also strange that this characteristic of water might be responsible for life on earth, that it fits right in with the biophysics of animal and plant life. According to plan? But whose?



MORE DAM WATER

When the question was asked why water expands as it freezes , no answer was forthcoming so here&apos;s one theory:

It seems that the molecules of solids are difficult to pull apart due to a firm attraction. But all molecules have an energy of motion, and as the temperature rises they move about rapidly until they gain so much energy that their mutual attraction can&apos;t hold them together. They break apart and move around bumping and sliding off one another. This is what occurs when ice melts into water at temperatures above 32 F.

Most solids have a crystalline structure, maintaining the molecules in a close arrangement with a minimum of space between. Once the solid melts, the molecules push apart, the material expands, and the density is usually decreased, making liquids generally less dense than solids.

Most solids expand as they melt and contract as they freeze; lead is a good example of this.

Density is dependent, however, on molecular arrangement when solid. The water molecules of ice are in a very loose structure, being in a tri-dimensional pattern which makes holes in the molecular formation. When the temperature rises, the molecules begin moving around haphazardly, and some fall into the &quot;holes&quot; in the lattice, thus by melting, the liquid water takes up less space than the solid ice. Melting one cubic foot of solid ice results in .9 cubic foot of liquid water.

This means that an iceberg will have 1/10 of its bulk above the surface and 9/10 below.

The fortunate part, for us Alphans, is the fact that ice being less dense than liquid water does indeed float. It the ice actually were denser than water it would sink downwards when formed, allowing more and more water to turn to ice and sink to the bottom. There would be no chance for the sun to melt that abyssal ice.

What this implies is, that if ice were denser than water, most of our planet&apos;s water supply would be frozen, close to the sun as we are. It&apos;s difficult to conceive life as we know it to have developed under conditions as that.



ABOUT OLD AGE SAG

Even though I may fulfill that description, I haven&apos;t found anyone to agree that glass also does. The engineers at PPG I spoke to said that glass could be construed as a super-cooled liquid, it was certainly a solid. The idea that window panes a few hundred years old sagged and became thicker at the bottom sent them into hysterics.

My question would be that if there are crystalline structures that can exist in one shape for millions of years, and that if there are supercooled liquids that eventually collapse their shapes given millions of years, is glass a substance apart, neither crystalline nor a supercooled liquid, perhaps a hybrid between the two?

 

Stranger things have been discovered. The problem is that glass fits its purpose in this civilization, from Fiberglas to huge telescope lenses, and researchers don&apos;t care to learn any more about it then they know now. It is said that plastics will be around forever if they can&apos;t biodegrade; but when the archeologists of the far future visit earth to find out what went on here, they will have lots of old bottles with which to conjecture.

The bridges and buildings will be gone, but coke and pepsi will still leave their mark; sort of sad, isn&apos;t it.



CONNECTIONS

I think that consideration of a microchip connected to the brain is fallible only in the hardware sense. Hard connections would be similar to trying to attach a 12 inch diameter bus bar to a .00001&quot; diameter wire - a tough job. It would appear that the microchip you may be speaking of will eventually be in the form of a bionically active module of protoplasm, attached to the brain via an opening in the skull, in a sort of symbiotic relationship, using direct chemical or osmotic transfer to accomplish the desired results.

Even in this advanced technological age, the pacemaker connectors are still that large bus bar lying next to a conducting bit of tissue, depending on brute force to get the job done.



OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS

Sometime back you had asked about other solar systems with the light capable of rejuvenating a solar panel to charge the battery in a probe after some light years of travel.

We live in a universe, the Milky Way, that has a few million stars in it, and each star is a sun, some brighter some darker depending on age. If a probe were to enter the influence of a star/sun, it most assuredly would recharge its storage cells assuming there was no physical damage to the probe&apos;s systems.

Again, assuming a proper re-entry angle to a given far-off planet, it is possible for the probe to take up an orbit about the planet, charge up, and broadcast signals. Wouldn&apos;t it be exciting if such a probe entered our solar system and did the same. Perhaps one did once, and there was no one to sense it.



MORE ON FREON

You had asked whether or not freon was a single gas or a mixture. To try for a simple answer, there are a number of fluorinated hydrocarbons which are used for refrigeration purposes. They are known as R-5, R-12, R15, etc. within a range of titles. They are generally mixtures which have the property of non-imflammability, and some of them were formerly used for propellants until some &apos;environmentalist type&apos; said their use would be cumulative in the upper atmosphere, to the detriment of the planet. Nothing was ever proved, incidentally.



OPTICS

are you still interested in bringing your beam into focus, through a glass lightly? If so, I will resurrect an old optics treatise I once used; I hope lenses haven&apos;t changed any since then, even though I myself haven&apos;t seen the light.



FTL DRIVES

Many of the science fiction writers have made faster-light-drives a standard item on space ships of the future; they make things so much easier to understand when interplanetary travel is considered. How else can a Terran rescue a Princess on Arcturus system in less than a few hundred years, after which time interest flags somewhat.

A question for the Alphans: Is the concept of Faster-Than-Light travel a valid one? Is there a possibility of man and machine actually going faster than light? How can we get around the fact of having to transverse tremendous distances to get from one universe to another?

What&apos;s your theory?



BETTER LATE THAN...

A short time ago I mentioned that there were 10 formulas listed that were said to have changed the world. After some very concise guessing by some erudite Alphans, the formulas passed into the dinginess of an archival limbo, wherever that is. But, even though late, here are the answers you all have been waiting for, even if not avidly, or not at all:

1. The rudimentary formula that brought an end to inexact tallying of possessions or exchange.

2. Sir Isaac Newton&apos;s formula for gravitation.

3. Einstein&apos;s formula for the conversion of matter to energy.

4. John Napier&apos;s logarithm formula, which provided a method of division and multiplication just by adding and subtracting the logarithms of large numbers.

5. Pythagoras&apos; formula for the relationship of the two sides and hypothenuse of a right triangle.

6. Ludwig Boltzmann&apos;s equation for the behavior of gases.

7. Konstantin Tsiolkovskii&apos;s equation giving the changing speed of a rocket as it burns the weight of the fuel.

8. Louis de Broglie&apos;s equation for light as a form of energy.

9. James Clerk Maxwell&apos;s formula equating electricity and magnetism.

10. Archimedes&apos; formula for the lever.

Note that you will have to go back and look up the formulas as I am too lazy to list them here. By the way, smart guy, who was Maxwell&apos;s demon and why was he around?



FUELING AROUND

Yours was an acceptable interpretation in theory; however, attempting to surpass 670 million miles per hour (light speed) does come up against Einstein&apos;s still formidable Special Theory of Relativity (ca. 1905). He indicated that light speed was unattainable by any object that was material, ie: a space craft, saying that as the craft approached light speed its length would approach zero, meaning that the energy to propel would inevitably rise toward infinity. The fuel tanks aren&apos;t that big.

What the orthodox relativists are saying is that no craft can exist which is of zero length and still have an engine of unlimited power. They still consider the concept of interstellar flight as an impassable barrier. They could be correct, but times change.

Haldane said that the universe &quot;is not only queerer than we imagine; it is queerer than we can imagine.&quot;

But to address relative speed: relativity states we cannot surpass light speed, even in the relative way of conceiving two space craft passing each other at light speed, and that the sum of their equal vector quantities will not be greater than light speed no matter what. Paradoxical to say the least.

The thought you expressed on continuous acceleration is valid - right up to the point of light speed - and the question may be, light speed relative to what? Well, even though the vastness of space is termed &quot;empty,&quot; there is nearly a single hydrogen atom per cubic yard, and while this appears an insignificant amount, it is enough against which to measure speed.

Harken said that the Special Theory implies a universe of utter madness and chaos, at least at first glance, as expressed by the following verse:

Nature and Nature&apos;s laws lay hid in the night:

God said &quot;Let Newton be!&quot; and all was light.

It did not last. The Devil howling, &quot;Ho!

Let Einstein be!&quot; restored the status quo.

Einstein&apos;s concept of time dilation maintains that a space craft moving at 99% light speed would allow its crew to age 1/7 of those living on Earth, and the energy required to maintain acceleration would be seven times as great, even though the crew would not be aware of the time slip. The problem seems to be that if light speed were achieved, their journey would be instantaneous, and beyond the speed of light, time would run backwards.

Remember:

There was a young lady named Bright,

Who traveled much faster than light,

She started one day

In the relative way

And returned on the previous night.

It&apos;s possible she may have met herself on returning, such as:

The lady was Bright but not bright,

And she joined in next day in the flight;

So then two made the date,

And then four and then eight,

And her spouse got a hell of a fright.

But the preceding adventures all violate the law of causality, as you know, which forbids FTL speeds through the universe since an event cannot occur before the event by which it was caused. Perhaps there are existing any number of parallel planets which run on different time tracks? Unfortunately there are a number of logical impossibilities that seem to weigh against it.



SPECIAL THEORY

We have been discussing FTL drives and theorizing on their working or not working, and in the background, Albert Einstein&apos;s Theory of Relativity has been lurking in the shadows of its own complexity.

While we still have time, relatively speaking, let&apos;s take a tour through a quick guide to the Special Theory of Relativity, which is a short and simple excursion, although well below light speed.

The Special Theory, which forms the basis for both the General Theory of Relativity and the laws of geometrodynamics, rests on the fact that the speed of light in the vacuum of space is constant at 670 million miles per hour, or 186,000 miles per second, or 300,000 kilometers per second (your choice), irrespective of the speed of its source.

Mathematical logic therefore dictates that the length of a moving spacecraft in the direction of motion must be reduced in proportion to its speed. The spacecraft&apos;s mass, i.e., the energy required to accelerate it, is increased as the object accelerates. And all clocks aboard the spacecraft - the term clock here includes both the astronaut&apos;s wristwatch and the aging process of his body - slow down as the spacecraft accelerates.

The extent of these changes are calculated by three simple formulae. To calculate the length of a moving spacecraft, we multiply its length at rest, that is its length when stationary on a planet, by the formula:

Square root of 1 - (V sqrd/C sqrd)

where V is the speed of the spacecraft and C is the speed of light. The increased mass of the moving spacecraft is calculated by a slightly different formula. Its mass at rest is multiplied by:

1 / Square root (1 - (V sqrd/C sqrd))

Measuring the slowing of time on board the spacecraft is equally simple. To see how much more slowly the astronauts are aging, we multiply a given period - say 60 minutes of Earth time - by:

Square root 1 - (V sqrd/C sqrd) (same as formula 1)

Two spaceships cannot recede from one another at a combined speed greater than that of light. If a man standing on the ground sees one craft racing overhead going due north at 90% of the speed of light, and another going due south at the same speed, he might suppose that each craft was receding from the other at a combined speed of 180% of that of light. He would be wrong! The sum of the two speeds cannot exceed that of light. It must be calculated by the formula:

A + B / 1 + (AB / C sqrd)

where A and B are the respective speeds of the two craft, and C is the speed of light. It will be seen from this formula that if the two craft had been traveling very slowly, say 600 mph, then the sum of their speeds would be about 1,199.99999999999999 mph, or almost 1200 mph. But if their speeds are very great, the formula gives a quite different answer. Pretend that instead of two spaceships the man sees two light beams receding in opposite directions. He will stimate their mutual speed of recession as twice the speed of light, or 2C. But if he were riding on one of the beams, he would estimate the other&apos;s speed of recession according to the formula:

C + C / 1 + (C sqrd/C sqrd) which of course works out as C.



SINCE WE ALL KNOW...

That is surely a troublemaking phrase, and I must let you sink or swim on your own, with your own quotes to help buttress your position in areas that are purely conjectural. If you wish me to agree with your stance on the direction and speed of light, give or take a few mps, I will; it is published as empirical fact. If you want me to reinforce your theories, it will require study. And already I have a headache just thinking about the chore.

My suggestion is that you review all of your hypotheses and compile them into a logical and sequential paper, and present them in their entirety, and with the various arguments, here in this forum. It will offer to you the fairest method to defend your theories, and for the skeptical to attack. It will be fun!



LE CONCORDE

Let us assume that at top speed the Concorde develops a skin temperature of 400 degrees F. Let&apos;s also consider the Concorde to be a long piece of hollow aluminum alloy, which in fact it is. Let&apos;s begin the flight at 70 degrees F.

Then, at top speed the outside of the cylinder will be at 400 degrees, and if we assume a cylinder length of 125 feet (just a guess), and the linear thermal expansion to be about 5.39 inches per hundred feet, then the 125 foot cylinder will expand 5.39 x 1.25, or about 6.74 inches.

If we work backwards with your 9 inches of expansion, then the Concorde would be 167 feet long, if the skin temperature is around 400 degrees, the equation being Coeff100&apos; = 9&quot; / 5.39 = 1.67&quot; hundred feet.

All you have to remember is that the linear thermal expansion of aluminum is about 5.39&quot; per 100 feet going from 70 F to 400 f. If you find out what the actual skin temperature is, and the actual length, please let us know and we&apos;ll get more accurate.

P.S. Do you remember all the garbage from the environmentalist cuckoos back when the US was going to develop a supersonic transport? The cuckoo lobby killed off the funding, essentially halting an American SST. Their fears were proved to be groundless, and their efforts were proved to be brainless. As usual!!!



COMPOUND FRACTURES

if you wouldn&apos;t have been breaking your arm patting yourself on the back for that 2 line statement about what it took Einstein many moons to write you might have looked up for a change and noted that it was from Adrian Berry.

Berry, a strong antidote to that &apos;Future Shock&apos; stupidity, outlined that treatise for those who would like to learn a little about the Theory in question, rather than hearing someone play a tuba solo on the virtues of his own immutable grandeur.

We all have occasion when we could point to our own past words wherein lay some point that some other reader missed, and triumphantly call for attention; that&apos;s not the point of Alpha! Tell us what you think about whatever; just don&apos;t maintain your position is the only correct one, and if you have other versions, go to! Your argument is not with me, Horatio, but with Einstein.



TORUS NO BULL

It was suggested that the true shape of our universe is that of a doughnut, with all of the galaxies, stars, etc., on the curved, solid part of the doughnut. The inner part of the doughnut would represent what he calls &apos;superspace,&apos; where journeys from point to point might be more rapid where he feels the ordinary laws of physics might be altered. Interesting concept.



NICE AROUND HERE

One of the nicer aspects of Alpha is that anyone can discuss anything without much fear of derision, and a sensibly put approach can be evaluated on its merits.

I seem to recall the possibility set forth by Hoyle that a huge sail be set on a space craft to push the ship along by light forces generated in the stars, and I think a novella was developed along those lines.

What would be a great difference between starlight pushing a sail through space and wind pushing a sail over the ocean. For each reaction...etc.



WATTS UP

Most of the Alphans know that a British Thermal Unit (BTU) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. They also know about watts, volts, cubic feet, gallons, and utility bills.

In general, the above named can be treated as a loose amalgam of energy related items the measurements of which can be converted one to another by using a factor, such as:

BTU&apos;s x 778.1 = foot pounds

BTU&apos;s x .0002928 = kilowatt hours

BTU&apos;s x .252 = kilogram calories

BTU&apos;s x .0003927 = horsepower hours

.....and so forth, you get the conversion picture, I&apos;m sure.

Now all of this is leading up to something as you may have guessed, and that something is the calculation of energy costs to operate devices in everyday usage. So next let&apos;s look at some of the more recognizable energy sources and their BTU potential:

Natural gas: 1,000 BTU/cu ft; one therm = 100,000 BTU&apos;s = 100 cu ft.

No. 2 fuel oil: 140,000 BTU per gallon

and some estimated basic costs:

Natural gas: .68 a therm

No. 2 fuel oil: 1.25 a gallon

Electric power: .0672 a kilowatt hour

First let&apos;s see what&apos;s watt on a comparison basis. An appliance runs at 2500 watts draw for one hour, resulting in the following costs:

Electrically: 2.5 kwh x .0672 = $0.168

Natural gas: 2.5 kwh x 3413 / 100,000 x 0.68 = .058

#2 fuel oil: 2.5 kwh x 3413 / 140,000 x 1.25 = .076

Here you can add those famous textbook words about disregarding efficiencies and losses, but it would appear that gas seems to be the lowest cost. I realize that some might ask how your refrigerator could run on fuel oil but I assure you it could be done.

House heating: Assuming a 24 hour period, in cold weather, an 80,000 BTU/hr furnace on 15 minutes each hour, or hours total in period:

BTU&apos;s = hrs x 80,000 = 480,000 btu&apos;s required.

Nat Gas: 480,000 / 100,000 = 4.8 therms x $0.68 = $3.26

#2 oil: 480,000 / 140,000 = 3.429 gallons oil x 1.25 = 4.29

As expected, the gas cost was the lower.

What will some electrical appliances cost to operate?

Flatiron 1200 watts / 1000 x .0672 = $.08/hr, $1.94/day

Light bulb 100 watts / 1000 x .0672 = .007/hr, .16/day

Washer 1300 watts / 1000 x .0672 = .087/hr, 2.10/day

Computer 50 watts / 1000 x .0672 = .003/hr, .08/day

As you can see, the calculation is:

Watts / 1000 x KWH price = cost/hr x 24 = cost per day.

And finally getting back to the glorious BTU&apos;s. We&apos;ll assume a 40 gallon water heater fired on natural gas which cycles five times a day for showers, dishes, washer, etc., for a total hot water requirement of 200 gallons per day.

We will say also that cold water entering the tank in a Milwaukee winter is at 48 deg F., and we wish to raise the temperature to 160 deg. F. This calculates (160 - 48) to a rise required of 112 degrees F.

First we convert gallons of water to pounds of water by multiplying 8.34 lbs/gal times 200 gallons, which results in a weight of 1668 pounds of water. We have to raise the temperature of each pound of water by 112 deg. F, so to determine the BTU&apos;s required we multiply 1668 times 112 which equals 186,816 BTUs needed.

In this calculation we will consider efficiency at 80% for natural gas combustion so, 186,816/ .80 = 233,520 BTU&apos;s required per day. The cost of the gas is:

233,520 BTU&apos;s / 100,000 BTU per therm = 2.335 therms x $0.68 per therm

= $1.59 for natural gas used in the hot water heater.

Let&apos;s analyze the cost for electric hot water heating:

There is no factor for efficiency needed, so:

186,816 BTUs x .0002928 = 54.7 KWH x $.0672 per KWH = $3.68 for heating the hot water, somewhat higher than for natural gas.

And of course there are extra utility charges built into the bill which have

not been addressed here.

So what does it all mean? Just that you can use the calculations involved to determine the cost of operating a given energy requiring unit by knowing the consumption, and that you also can compare its running cost to what it might be if another energy source were used. The formulas are valid no matter the price rises. Something to do on cold nights.



HOTTER

No matter what the utilities recommend, the manufacturer of our dishwasher recommends that 160 deg F water be used, and they are correct. The dishes and silverware come out sparkling clean at that temperature. I agree with what you said right up to the point where the statement was made that every BTU over 140 degrees is wasted. That doesn&apos;t make sense, unless there is no insulation on your water heater.

The point is, that 160 degree water uses more cold water and less of the hot water to achieve a given temperature, whether for washing clothes or one&apos;s self. Thus a 40 gallon tank at 160 may offer more warm water for a longer period than a like tank at 140. You may save a few pennies at 140, but with kids, wash, and dishes, it&apos;s worth it.



BIG DEAL!

I calculated the hot water heater on gas using 140 deg F instead of 160. It comes out about 29 cents less per day, but you have much more hot water at 120 deg available for whatever.

So:

200 gals x 8.34 = 1668 lbs x 92 deg DT = 153,456 BTU / .8 eff = 191,820 BTU

required / 100,000 BTU/Therm = 1.92 therms x $0.68/therm = $1.31 day, vs.

$1.59 for the higher temperature. Doesn&apos;t seem like much, but it&apos;s actually

29 cents x 30 days which = $8.70 a month more, or about $105 a year.

(disregarding [snicker, snicker] the losses)



IN HOT WATER

Instead of the flippant answer you were going to get, I thought about a definition for hot water. Logically speaking, hot water might be considered any water with a temperature of over 98.6 deg F, body temperature. This water would be warm/hot to the touch, whereas water under 98.8 would be cool to the touch.

So water in a range from 98.6 deg to 212 deg in the liquid phase could still be considered hot water, the higher the temperature, the hotter the water. It&apos;s apparent that one does heat hot water in a hot water heater simply to make it hotter. (Seems to work for cold water also)

That 160 deg F temperature limit I discussed before is a bit off; I checked the water temp to the dishwasher - it was 158.7 deg F. So much for accuracy in the medium.



BTU-HOOS

Let&apos;s see if we can calculate what your hot water maker can do:

36,000 btu per hour means that in one hour you can raise the temperature of 36,000 pounds of water (4,317 gallons) one deg F. That doesn&apos;t seem the way to go about it.

50 gallons of water weighs 417 pounds, so if you divide 36,000 btu&apos;s by 417 pounds, you get a theoretical temperature rise of 86.3 deg F, and if an efficiency of 85% is used, a rise of 73.4 deg, which we will use.

What that rough calc implies is that whatever temperature you start at cold, you will raise 50 gallons of water 73.4 deg, so if you started at 55 deg F, in one hour your 50 gallons will be at 128.3 deg F.

The recycling you speak of is strictly to overcome heat losses through the pipes and insulation; in older homes and units, the losses can be high. I&apos;m toying with the idea of putting a 100 gallon tank up in my house&apos; hot attic for use during the summer months. The temperatures there get up to 110 deg F, which would help to prewarm the water, and any prewarming will save btu&apos;s and money.



HOT, HOTTER....

contrary to what you may think I am alert and ready all waking hours, and in any case have a thermostatic shower control. (the world needs more lerts, anyway).

But, your comment about cranial charring awoke some interest there in the respect that some studies have been done in the military as to apparent limits on physical resistance to heat of various exposures, which you probably could shed some light on.

Example: It seems there was a test where the subject (victim?) was placed in a room and the room temperature was raised to some high point, perhaps over 250 deg F, the temperature then lowering again to normal. I believe it was only for a short period (10 - 15 minutes over the cycle), and the subject had drunk as much water as possible.

My question for you is, do you know of any responsible studies that have explored the capability of man to exist in hot water (other than our normal everyday lives), with just his head out, and what temperature he could withstand before starting to cook?

We have a hot room and a steam room at the club, and the temperature gets fairly high in each. I can visualize a man existing at high temperature in a hot room, with fairly dry air, because of the body&apos;s perspiration mechanism, but can see limitations of temp in the steam room or in water.



HIPPOTHERMIA

Is that the term you were really thinking of when you mentioned my being in the steam room? Anyway, my question still is one of whether or not the high temperature tests were made by the military, and if you remembered them or had any further info.

Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, the article in question may have appeared in Reader&apos;s Digest some years ago when you were still in grade school. But, thinking more on it, isn&apos;t it peculiar that the human body, because of its water content, can stand elevated temperatures far better than reduced temperatures? The bare bod won&apos;t last too long at -20 deg C, but will bask at +20 deg C (68 deg F), if the sun is shining.

I guess we&apos;re basically warm sea-water creatures; and if so, what imperative was imposed to have us born and live in Wisconsin? Life is irrational!



HEATING WATER

Perhaps no other Alphans know this, but there is an alternative to a conventional water heater.

The unit is a device that goes into your cold water line, and contains a 220 VAC heating element. When a hot water faucet is opened in the line, the lowered pressure is sensed and the heating element goes on, heating the cold water to about 140 deg F. as it passes through the unit.

In other words, no gas or electric power is used to maintain the temperature of a hot water heater tank. The water is instantaneously heated when hot water is demanded by the system. One could take an all day shower without ever running out of hot water. If anyone is interested, I&apos;ll dig up the info and the rep&apos;s name.

Some people buy very small units for a given service: one in the kitchen for the dishwasher and other use; one for the shower; and one for the washer.

The possibilities are intriguing.



HEAVY WATER?

50 gallons of water still only weighs about 417 lbs, plus the tank; we&apos;ll be concerned if there are any leaks, but condensate in an attic in summertime is almost non-existent. (I think you have condensate in your attic on occasion, so join the club)



PLOYS IN THE ATTIC

When you&apos;re discussing the impact of an attic hot water assist tank don&apos;t consider that the usual long, round tank would be used.

Just for conjecture, let&apos;s assume a water tank 3 feet wide, 1 foot high, and five feet long, resting on joists next to the building wall. The tank capacity is 15 cubic feet, 112 gallons, and the tank contents weigh 934 pounds.

That means that the tank will be resting on five joists with 16&quot; centers, which means the weight at capacity would be 936 lbs + 92 lbs for an aluminum tank made from 1/8&quot; stock, a total of 1026 lbs, with the weight on each joist about 206 lbs, or 5.7 lbs per linear inch.

The 2&quot; x 9&quot; beams in the attic section have a load capacity far above the calculated load. And a welded aluminum tank of the thickness noted will resist leakage far beyond the life of the house. The aluminum will ensure a very good heat transfer (I&apos;m really not going to cover the tank with a blanket).

Discussing the method of piping: I feel that a half-inch copper line will be adequate, and can easily be run between the walls down to the basement.

Concerning the height: It&apos;s well known that the head pressure of water equals .433 psi per foot. If the attic is 40 feet from the cold water outlet in the basement, then the pressure to be overcome is .433 x 40&apos; which equals about 17 psi. And if your water pressure is about 40 psi then there will be no problem getting water to and from the tank.

Of course there must be simple valving to allow the tank to be drained during the freezing months; turning the tank contents to ice would be one sure way of bursting seams and causing leakage. Any questions?



DEW POINT&amp;CONDENDSATE

As the frog said to Blanche, I&apos;m only going to explain it one more time.

After the last freezing, the attic tank is filled and eventually comes to temperature which may be as low as 40 degrees. Unless the air is super-saturated during a thunderstorm (don&apos;t fill it then) the tank will stay dry. In the dead of summer, the heat is about 110 deg F in the daytime and about 80 at night. As the cool water enters the tank it will be warmed enough not to cause condensation. We will, of course, wrap the incoming water pipe to keep condensation from occurring. The only possibility of condensate is if the tank is completely emptied, then filled up. That shouldn&apos;t be allowed to happen.



CALCULATION

Why don&apos;t you get out your calculator and show us by calculation why condensate would form in summertime at 110 deg F in a tank that would be drawing off from 112 gallons under normal use.

Be sure to consider relative humidity, temperature, and dew point, and try to remember that you&apos;re in the attic - not the basement.

You&apos;ve gone on record as disagreeing; now kindly show us the proofs!

Incidentally, in the dead of summer, the humidity in the attic here is about 30%, very dry, no exhaust fan. Use that figure, if you will.

You will find that in normal hot water use, the water in the tank won&apos;t be cycled completely unless the kids leave the water on, and if it is only partially cycled, as is normal, the incoming cold water will never bring the hotter water inside the tank below the dew point. And with the higher temp in our heater tank, it won&apos;t take as much hot water to satisfy a domestic requirement, more cold water will be used to mix for comfort at a given temperature.

When you calculate, be sure to also follow the curves on the psychrometric charts; it will be easier. (that ought to tie up your proximal convoluted tubule for trying to egg me on)

P.S. If you can&apos;t figure it out, I&apos;m sure a grade school kid could give you some help.



CONDENSATE TRAP

No, you didn&apos;t fall into my condensate trap, but if your house does have a high humidity attic, that tank I spoke of could rest on an aluminum pan with drain tubing to the basement or outside. Then if you did get some condensate, it would just drain away and relieve your flooding worries. Sounds like a good backup system even for my unit - just in case...



NO SWEAT

First of all, my attic is sealed; the only way to enter is through a trap door which is kept closed; humidity is almost non-existent.

Second, where did you get the 7 degree differential temp from as a cause of condensation? Condensation will occur anytime the cold surface is below the dew point. At low dew points, say 36 deg F, the air temp might be at 70 F and have to fall 34 deg before condensation would take place.

Without showing you how to do it, I&apos;ll again tell you that one btu is the amount of heat required to raise one pound of water one degree F. And as you know, water weighs 8.34 lbs per gallon. Now you have the information to determine what final temp will be when mixing waters with two different temperatures.

Third, I have a Argon-CO2 wire welder, aluminum wire is available, as is the 10 gauge al stock from Ryerson, and I can weld - so it wouldn&apos;t cost too much.

The tank shape I had in mind was rectangular, 3&apos; x 5&apos; x 1&apos;, resting on 5 joists, large surface horizontal. Drip pan optional.

One of the situations which causes condensation on water closet tanks is high humidity in the house. If you have forced air heat there is likely a humidifier in the blower line which adds to the relative humidity in the house. In summer, without the furnace on, the relative humidity is high due to climatic conditions in the area, so condensation may occur.

Our house&apos;s humidity is kept high in winter by the furnace humidifier, but none of that air goes to the attic. Likewise in summer with the furnace off; no air flows in and out of the attic; it&apos;s a dead air space.



SOLAR POWERED SALES

Ah, how the rays from the salesman&apos;s brain heats up the atmosphere for the gullible; fortunately for your finances you recognized that the great benefit of solar powered devices is for the seller&apos;s bank account.

In our neighborhood, the neighbors know of my occasional sagacity and for an opinion on purchases, then take my good advice under consideration, and go and buy what they were going to buy all along.

In the case of an acquaintance who was talked into a solar panel, he alone mentioned it would have been better had he not bought it. The unit was guaranteed for 20 years, or the life of the company; the company gave up the ghost in 13 months.

And what the company didn&apos;t make clear at the time was the fact that a small heat exchanger should have been used so the water in the primary side could have anti-freeze in it. Well, perhaps bubble gum will hold it together.

I have a drawing worked out where I can use three fresnel lenses from American Scientific (cheap, too) for focusing on a copper container to heat my pool water up about 8 degrees in good sunshine. All I have to do is get a star tracker hooked up with it - but it will be cheaper than gas.

I&apos;m still searching through the stacks of rep brochures for the info on the instantaneous heater; will present the information when found.

(All of that without a nasty word? Must be mellowing!)



FLUORIDE

As you have surmised, fluorinated means simply that a compound of fluorine gas is part of the composition. And the fluorides that have existed in the natural waters of the southwest, and now in various forms of toothpaste, are also compounds of fluorine.

Just as a matter of interest, fluorine is a member of the halogen family which includes the following:

Iodine: A purple solid

Bromine: A corrosive reddish liquid

Chlorine: A greenish-yellow gas, fairly active

Fluorine: A very active gas which is highly poisonous, as are its many compounds. The acid, hydroflouric acid, is so active that it cannot be kept in glass containers, and in fact is used to etch designs on glassware.

Because fluorine is so poisonous, it&apos;s a wonder that the FDA allows it to be inserted in the Milwaukee water supply in its compound form; it would seem that if tested it certainly would cause cancer or death in laboratory rats. One of the anomalies of FDA practice, to be sure!



SOLARISTS COLLECTED

An interesting note was in the paper this week concerning a Solar Energy company who made wildly stupid promises about payback on solar collectors to their customers.

I won&apos;t say the customers were just as stupid to believe the promises because they can&apos;t be expected to know in detail the operations of such devices; however, some judicious reading of Consumer Reports might have helped. If you read the article, did you recognize the company name as the same people to whom you spoke, or was it another outfit?



ALL SOLAR&apos;S DAY

Despite the human flotsam pushing their limited knowledge of so-called solar power, you and I can take some satisfaction in the fact that all of the energy that turns on our lights, washes our clothes, powers our cars and airplanes, heats our homes, etc., is solar power once or twice removed.



HOGANYSICS

Getting back to the Genesis Machine for a moment, and its reasonable sounding theory K*theory, Hogan&apos;s lay treatise on the possibilities involved could parallel some hitherto unknown physical concepts that lay in waiting for discovery.

Practical as I am, I have to remember the time in the 40s when John Campbell was paid a visit by the FBI who wanted to know where the author of a story concerning an operating atom bomb got his information. As you probably know, the story&apos;s line paralleled the work going on in the Manhattan Project.

My position is, any thinking individual, in spite of any technical background or discipline, or the lack thereof, is still a thinking individual, and in his own area of expertise -science fiction, for example- can come up with plausible scientific devices and/or theories to buttress a story line.

Generally, to an author, ideas don&apos;t spring full-blown from the brain, merely waiting to be transferred to paper. In fact, as it seems with Hogan, the story line is developed first, then a realistic science is formed to augment the line, and the science must perforce be acceptable to the sophisticated readers. We&apos;ll accept Dr. Who&apos;s magic screwdriver because we all know the way it is, Whovianistically; but, with Hogan we expect a far more substantial neo-scientific basis.



SOLARQUERY FROM HAM, LIT

I did a paper once on alternate energy sources some years back, and in the section on solar power I included a brief description of the French Gov&apos;s solar project. They had a number of parabolic reflectors in a circle which focused on boiler in the center. It worked fine during the day time, but that&apos;s when the electric power was at peak demand. Very efficient.

If any other solar salesman tries you again, ask him the very simple question, how many btu&apos;s are generated by the sunlight falling on one square yard per hour at this given latitude? If he hems and haws, thrust him into the darkness.....



FASTER THAN A....

Is a &apos;jiffy&apos; faster or slower than a semidemihemiquaver?



BOID DOU NEVER WOIT!

Of course we knew Mary, we had her and Percy over for high tea on many an occasion (we just didn&apos;t care much for her friend Zipper).

Speaking of resource recovery, scientists have come up with a method for transforming garbage into newsprint; I wonder if it conflicts with the patented way the Journal does it.

But in a more serious vein, the technique of utilizing methane from landfills is not a recent discovery. In past years, cases occurred where the methane generated from the underground garbage leaked into structures and caused explosion.

In order to circumvent this danger, landfill sites were covered with asphalt, and gas relief ports were installed at strategic intervals about the area. These gas ports consisted of a 6&quot; pipe thrust down in the landfill through a 2 foot bored hole, filled around the outside with stones, and then sealed.

The top of the pipe was attached to a header pipe and run to a point where the methane was burned off. Actually, it was not pure CH4 but had about 50% carbon dioxide, with traces of H2S.

The quantity of methane produced soon outran the small flare-off systems installed, and engineers then began designing boilers to burn the gas and make steam to drive electrical generators, or feed the gas directly to motor generators designed for the purpose. Now, land fill designers are automatically considering power generation as part of the overall plan. I don&apos;t know if motor-generators or fuel cells will replace the boilers, but it may be - it all depends on economics.



MEATIER OLOGY

Friday we got the pool cleaned, filled, and chemicalized. The air temperature was 80 degrees F, the dew point was 51 F, the pool water at the time was 58 F, the relative humidity was 31%; the only object sweating was the guy doing the work. The metal side of the pool adjacent to the water was dry. How does Alfredian Physics account for this?



DEW TELL

Dew is indeed condensate; what did you think it was?



FREE HEATER

Any of the Alphans who have back yard, above ground swimming pools already know the benefits of solar heating, even if on a modest scale. Solar energy lets us swim more or less comfortably in what passes for summer in Wisconsin.

What is the sunshine worth to the pool owner? Let&apos;s assume a 20&apos; diameter pool averaging 4&apos; deep. Calculating the volume of water is, radius sqrd x 3.14159 x 4 = 1,256.64 cubic feet of water, x 7.48 = 9,400 gallons, x 8.33 lbs/gal = 78,393 lbs.

If you remembered, as I&apos;m sure you did, that a btu is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one lb of water one degree fahrenheit, then you already know that it will take 78,393 btu&apos;s to raise the pool temperature one degree.

So let&apos;s say you&apos;ve just filled the pool with 46 degree F Milwaukee water, and eventually the sun has raised the water temperature to 75 deg F. This range equals a differential temperature of 29 degrees; therefore, the heat energy required to raise the temperature of the entire pool from 46 deg F to 75 deg F is, 29 x 78,393 which equals 2,273,397 btu&apos;s.

The value of this energy is:

Natural gas: 2,273,397 btu / 100,000 btu/therm / .85 efficiency = 26.75 therms x $.65/therm = $17.38

#1 Fuel Oil: 2,273,397 btu / 130,000 btu/gal / .8 eff = 21.86 gallons x $1.05/gal = $22.95

Electric Heat: 2,273,397 btu x .0002928 = 665.65 kwh x $.0671 per kwh = $44.67

What does it all mean? Not much except as a physics exercise, and the happy conclusion to let the sun supply the energy for all of the pool heating work. Alphans can use these simple formulas to calculate the solar heat values for other size pools as well.

And every time the sun raises the temperature of your 20&apos; pool one degree fahrenheit, it&apos;s worth $.60 in natural gas, $.79 in fuel oil, and $1.54 in electric power. If you could only collect from somewhere.



SAGANOLOGY

Good old nasal Carl is another of the doomspeakers of our time; do you think he would get a program on TV if it dealt with a more prosaic subject, such as the life and death of the four-leaf clover?

Sagan and his bunch were responsible for the idiocy regarding the effect of spray can propellants on our troposphere. Dire predictions were made that the propellants would layer and diminish the sun&apos;s rays until the entire world would become a cold desert, or some such nonsense. Many companies changed their propellant to carbon dioxide, a more expensive and less effective material, and learned later that the theory was never proved viable in fact.

So the Sagan position on nuclear winter may be questionable. Without actually being able to prove what the effects really would be, I&apos;d simply like to ask some of the questions.

1. The part of the theory concerning deposition of particles into the atmosphere as triggering the winter may not hold up. My query is, during the 20&apos;s, 30&apos;s, and 40&apos;s, tons of solids, as smoke from factories and houses, were injected into the atmosphere from thousands of cities throughout the world, so why would the puny effort from a few thousand nuclear bombs have a greater effect? If we tried to duplicate solids injection via the nuclear route, could we indeed come close to what those industrial/housing units emitted back then. Sounds like a tough job to me. Looks like the important effects on man would be from blast and radiation.

2. Some have said the Krakatoa volcanic blast was equivalent to 10,000 atomic bombs exploding. The atmosphere settled down in time. Why would it be any different with nuclear bombs?

3. Each minute of every day, the conifer forests of the world emit tons upon tons of solid matter into the atmosphere, which accommodates it. This emission is why the Great Smoky Mountains got their name; it goes all the time. Why shouldn&apos;t atomic dust settle in the same way?

What I&apos;m saying is that this is a tremendously large planet, and one minor hurricane can have the power of 50,000 hydrogen bombs; one tornado can have the energy of 30,000 hydrogen bombs; why? Because they are continuous. Their energy per minute is equatable to energy per second in nuclear blasts. They reach altitudes equal to or greater than achieved by nuclear bomb residue. Natural forces would come into play, with precipitation washing the air, even as it does now. The big problem is radiation, not nuclear dust in the atmosphere, no matter what Sagan and his cohorts say. But, for a scientist, Sagan drifts away from orthodoxy into flights of fancy, and that is what sells documentaries.



ENERGY!

The exploits and accomplishments of Mr. Newman (sic) have been related in a number of magazine articles. The patent office did indeed refuse to give his device a fair hearing, and the reason they are reviewing his work now is because of a court order forcing them to do so.

I don&apos;t know if the device actually works, but it does, the utilities and energy companies will be out of business in a while; if they have their way, Mr. Newman will be put out of the living business.

His idea of putting a magnetic paddle in the earths field to generate power, if it works, would be a tremendous step forward in providing low-cost energy to the billions.



WORM HUNTING

In accordance with the Alphan policy of providing critical information to all, Alpha is happy to offer this scientific method of collecting fishing bait in the person of worms and night crawlers to all Alphans interested.

The indians at one time developed a stick with notches to do the same thing. The notched stick would be inserted about inches into the ground in an area where worms were thought to be (The presence of worms is critical to the method&apos;s operating). They would rub another stick over the notches; the worms, not at all satisfied with the vibrations, would emerge from the soil where they could be picked up without much exertion. How much can a worm weigh, anyway?

The scientific approach is to use 60 cycle current to do the job.

Materials of construction were as follows:

A three foot long piece of 5/16&quot; diameter (or something close) steel rod.

An insulating handle on one end of the rod so the user won&apos;t get zapped.

A wire attached to the rod, through a 100 watt bulb, to one side of a standard 120 volt plug. The hookup should look like this:



----------------[ ] Wooden handle

|

|----------------------0------------------------E

^rod ^wire 100W bulb ^wire ^plug



In a standard household plug, one side is hot, the other is grounded. There will be only one wire attached to the plug, which eventually will go to the hot side.

To operate, put the steel rod into the ground 3 to inches. Insert the plug so the hot side feeds the rod; the light bulb will light up according to how well a ground there is. Be very careful not to touch the rod.

In a very short time (assuming there are worms and night crawlers in the immediate area) you will see the wrigglers come up out of the ground ready to be picked up after the current is switched off. A switch in the line is very handy, but not essential. Be careful.

If there is a worm in the area, he will be forced out; it&apos;s uncanny to see them emerge on cue, but then again, you&apos;d emerge too if someone had 120 volts hooked up to your couch.

Note: Neither I nor Alpha will be responsible if you happen to fry yourself or anyone else as a result of using this method. We didn&apos;t tell you to go fishing in the first place.



VARIOUS

Much of your thought might have discernible merit if only it weren&apos;t buried in recapitulation. You&apos;re simply an Everyvictim of your own repetitions.

But there was one interesting point where you claim a fire over a gopher&apos;s hole would draw the air out and suffocate him. Did you ever try this? Consider that gopher holes have a number of entrances; consider that a fire may produce a draft in an opening below it; consider that the velocity of the air column rising from the fire draws from the hole below; consider the gopher, breathing in all that fresh air drawn into his tunnelly home from the other entrances, replacing all that musty air usually there, and feeling quite good about it.

Consider the point that a fire over a gopher hole does not draw out the air and leave a vacuum; and finally consider that Benjamin Franklin invented a stove based on the draft principle. Still works!

(I had to review it to see if you really said that, and you did. I&apos;m sure it was just a slip of the tongue. I won&apos;t hold it against you if the gophers won&apos;t)



JOE NEWMAN

The latest I&apos;ve heard about Joe Newman and his wonderful Energy Machine is that he did fail to have the courts force the Patent Office to grant him a patent for the protection of his invention. Already one man has seen the machine, copied it, and is trying to market it. So much for fair play.

If anyone recalls, the Wright brothers were engaged in strife with the Patent Office for three years because their device was deemed &apos;a device that is inoperative or incapable of performing its intended function.&apos;

Dr. Robert Hastings, who is principal physicist for the huge Sperry-Univac Company, reported that he has conducted hundreds of tests on Newman&apos;s Energy Machine and has come to the conclusion that it most certainly operates as advertised. Dr. Robert Hastings says that Joe Newman has &apos;converted mass to energy by simply harnessing the kinetic energy of the subatomic particles that stream through a magnetic field.&apos;

Newman has said, &apos;How long did man sit beside a stream before he thought of putting a paddle in it? How long will man sit beside a magnetic field before we put a paddle in it.&apos; Over thirty experts, including physicists, engineers, and technicians have tested the Energy Machine and have signed affidavits indicating that the device does perform as described by the inventor.

A book recently published by Newman details the 20 year effort required to bring the machine to its present operating state. Offered are technical explanations on the device, along with a treatise describing Newman&apos;s theories on the laws of magnetism - theories which may contribute to the &apos;unified field&apos; revelations that physicists have searched for.

The energy moguls must be shaking in their penthouses at the concept of such a machine breaking their collective strangleholds on the present distribution of energy. Newman&apos;s concepts converted to hardware would provide abundant, cheap, energy to all - with no hazardous waste.

Newman demonstrated his 9000 lb machine at the Capitol Center in Largo, Maryland; a conference of scientists and engineers observed the machine and came to the conclusion that it does indeed work.

The battle against the entrenched energy interests is just beginning for Joe Newman; let&apos;s hope he can see it through.



RESPONSE

Newman&apos;s Wonderful Energy Machine, if it works as advertised, will stimulate a new industrial revolution, and go down in history as one of the turning points in the annals of man. As new data is released it will be related to all on Alpha; the book has been ordered; my utility bills are in a pile, ready to be burned en masse when the time comes; I will be collecting thoughts on uses for the WEP complexes in the area.

Note: If you don&apos;t think nuclear war is a threat, based on a supposition that cooler heads in the Soviet Union and the US will ultimately prevail, then you are at odds with a great number of people over the entire range of the political spectrum. I hope your position is correct.



FLUORINE

Your question is extremely interesting from a number of standpoints. It was found that the population in the southwestern part of the US had a significantly less number of dental cavities than their counterparts elsewhere. After some tough scientific investigation it was attributed to the fact that traces of fluorides were present in the environment, and that these fluorides inhibited tooth decay.

On the basis of those investigative results, the use of fluorides as additives to municipal water supplies was begun, and toothpaste manufacturers also added fluoride to their products.

It would appear that this additive was effective in diminishing the caries problem for youngsters and young adults. No data seems to be available on the older groups.

An interesting paradox manifests itself in this situation. On one hand we have what seems to be an effective way to lessen tooth decay. On the other hand, we have a federal law that states any subject which can cause tumors or cancers in rats must be withdrawn from human consumption. Experts have said that fluorides would not only cause cancer in rats, but also in the exaggerated test amounts would kill the test animals outright. The same is true for the chlorine injected into our drinking water.

But no laboratory of reputation has done any work along this line for fear the government would immediately ban use of fluoride, or chlorine. It&apos;s another case where a tiny bit of poisonous material supplies a greater good.

From another view, the extreme Right Wing maintains that the injection of fluorides into drinking water is the first step to mind control; however, down in west Texas, where there is a lot of fluoride in the water, they seem to have minds of their own on any subject, so that theory may be deflated.

It&apos;s been said that we all ingest some poisonous materials every day. Even our good old Morton&apos;s Salt has traces of iodine deliberately added in order to prevent goiter conditions from occurring in humans. I wonder if iodine would pass the rat tumor test? I think not.

Anyway, life is a compromise all the way round, even halogenistically.



ASTATINE

Quit looking in that old chemistry book of yours and stop asking embarrassing questions - meaning those having answers that I&apos;ve forgotten.

The Chem and Phys Handbook (CRC) says that astatine is indeed a halogen, albeit radioactive. They state that it is formed naturally by radioactive decay, and has been produced by bombarding bismuth with helium nuclei.

The reaction occurs so fast that I must have missed it in lab 301.



CHUCKLE - CHUCKLE

If you really want yellow sodium you will have to paint it; just don&apos;t use water-base paint.



MOH&apos;S LAW

If God wanted us to have fluoroapatite he wouldn&apos;t have given us hydroxyapatite!! Talcum or leave &apos;em.

(Say, is hydroxyapatite a craving for phenol, glycol, or alcohol?)



GERMICIDE

now I can get fancy; merthiolate is a trade name for thimerosal, an organic, crystalline, mercurial compound, C9H9HgNaO2S, used as a germicide or antiseptic, generally in place of the stronger tincture of iodine.

Ammonium Iodide, is an interesting substance which when left to dry in certain quantities explodes of its own weight. This critical quantity is about 1/8 cubic inch.

Concerning cancer and viruses, I&apos;ll let another provide the explanations. After I&apos;ve put on the merthiolate my medical training has come to an abrupt halt.

(I know you&apos;re going to ask how to make Ammonium Iodide but I won&apos;t tell you, openly!).



NI3

You&apos;re correct about the nomenclature, but ammonium iodide is just verbal shorthand for us dumb engineers.

But as long as you brought it up, some nameless individuals in a high school far away made up about an ounce of it and spread it over the front entrance mat on a rainy day in April. It got on most everyone&apos;s soles and heels, and spent the day drying and reverting to type. Lots of purple spots on the white bucks that day, and lots of tension headaches among the faculty.

But they couldn&apos;t prove anything, just like when some no-goods put a half pound or so of KMn04 in the school swimming pool, in a water degradable package which released in 6th hour girls pool class.

Of course I was innocent of all charges, but there were some bitter feelings developed by the hapless purple passion flowers that got stained by their volunteering to get the stuff out of the pool. You know, the type that always wanted to do nice things for the teacher. This time it was their hands that got brown. Ah, old school daze!

(Described further in my book, Green Olive Juice)



ANGSTROMS

The primary difference between violet and purple seems to lie in the angstrom wave length. To the eye, however, violet appears to have more blue mixed in, and purple tends more towards the red. The difficult part is determining how many cubic angstroms in a cup of paint.



CRAY COMP

The most interesting area of your discussion describing the Cray is the fact that the National Magnetic Fusion Energy center bought the device.

I&apos;m certain most of the Alphans know that the tremendously difficult part about maintaining a continuous fusion process to generate energy is control of the variables for regulating process balance.

The Cray, with its high clock speed, may be the turning point in fusion process development. We&apos;ll be watching the project closely for news on accomplishment, as a successful fusion process will turn down all the world&apos;s oil wells and make the US number one in energy generation.

When this announcement occurs, sell all your coal and oil stocks, if you can do so in time.



FLAT EARTH?

Even now, the Flat Earth Society in England argues that the Earth is indeed flat, in spite of our age of space travel and around the world air flights.

But consider: Could the Earth exist as a disc? Let&apos;s assume the mean diameter of the Earth as 7919 miles (give or take a foot). This would be about 260,021,734,700 cubic miles. Reshaping this mass into a relatively disk-like shape could offer a somewhat flat Earth A that was 25,000 miles across and 530 miles thick.

Or, we could derive flat Earth B, at 15,000 miles across with an edge dimension of about 1471 miles.

People living in the center of the flat area on A would not weigh a lot, and escape velocity might be easily obtained. Those living on the edge would be heavier.

On B, the center of the flat would result in higher body weights, with escape being much higher.

To get from center disk to center on either earth would be a journey of the disk diameter plus the edge distance, a total of 16,471 miles for B and 25,530 for A. Or, an enterprising transit company on either might bore a hole through the center, dropping a car with passengers into the hole, accelerating to the center, decelerating from the center, and with a tiny boost, ease into the station on the other side.

Even with the draft mathematics involved, what is your opinion as to whether or not a disk-like Earth could exist. Would the primordial basalt and its mixes be enough to maintain the shape? Would the gravity component vertical to the axis be enough to hold a person from drifting to the disk center. Could the atmosphere be held? Why not, the mass is the same. Examine rotation limits, and the required tilt for seasons.

I know it&apos;s calculable, inverse attraction, etc., but in spite of that, let&apos;s have some comments on disk Earth; its properties and longevity, and perhaps even its potential inhabitants and their unique civilization. What would it be like?



TILT!

Assuming that disk could maintain its integrity, it would seem that if it were tilted with reference to the sun, there would be periods of light, dark, and in-between, dependent on position in annual orbit. Good hypotheses on your part.



SHAPELY

Another follow-up on disk earth.

If you recall the big bang theory, the globule and its parts that went into the formation of spherical earth were molten at the time, and the force required to obtain the spheroid pattern was not great. Gravitational force seems to be weak at best, although try to tell that to someone who has just fallen off a ladder.

But the asteroids cooled and hardened rather quickly, and the largest are still in the same general shape, perhaps lacking the mass for gravity to do its job of rounding off the edges.

But if Disk Earth were by some chance cool and solid to begin with, do you not think that it would remain that way due to the integrity of its solid basalt or granite mass? That inherent weakness of the gravitational field might not be enough for a potentially globe-shaped Earth to pull itself together, especially with a thick disk diameter. Could crack, though.

And perhaps a rotating Disk Earth would have provision for the edge being the high rent district, where there would be light and dark each day, and appropriate seasons, with one of the flats sides taking turns each of the revolutions to be ruled by the Jack of Shadows.

(Note: nowhere in this brief have I mentioned the word &apos;floppy&apos; in conjunction with the term Disk Earth, a masterpiece of forbearance!)



POLAR MOMENTS

No that isn&apos;t a new movie but is related to the polar moment of inertia, and without going into a long-winded treatise, it would seem to touch on the fact that if you were on the flat side of the disk, near the edge, then crossed over to the edge, it would not affect your weight greatly at that point.

I think I personally might be more worried about getting spun off the edge by centrifugal force, but I&apos;d have to calculate it -- and I&apos;m very lazy, so don&apos;t look for it soon.

Who do you think will win the power struggle, the flat-siders or the edge-dwellers, and why? (also assuming no centrifugal spin-off)



BAD DISK?

What makes you think a disk would not be a good configuration for a planet? And if there is enough re-bar equivalent in the mass, it should hold its shape longer than a driveway. Is it possible for a disk to have just enough mass, shape, and thickness so the gravitational forces would overcome the centrifugal forces at all points of the planetary body? Make the assumption that the core is not quasi-molten, but rigid. Would an atmosphere be held, and would it not conform to a generally disklike bubble about the planet. What tidal effects would occur on the bodies of water?



CENTERED

Ike Asimov said once that if there were a 20 foot hollow sphere in the center of the earth, that a body would be practically weightless there, and perhaps would float in the center of the hollow as though it were in space. It was because each part of the mass pulled evenly on the body.

Would it be different for a disk?



ERROR OF GRAVITY

Isn&apos;t what the scientists term &apos;gravity&apos; merely the attraction between masses, inversely proportional to their distance? An astronaut&apos;s body in the shuttle (even as we speak, Watson) is attracted by the shuttle, all the crewmen and objects in the shuttle, the earth, the moon, the sun, and other bodies in the solar system.

Remember, earth&apos;s gravity is the only thing that keeps the shuttle from leaving orbit for parts unknown.

I had assumed you were an expert in the field in view of all those years you took up space in various schools.



2-D EXPERIENCES

Dont forget that book &quot;Flatland&quot; that was written some years ago. It also dwelt on the fascinating subject of 2-D inhabitants. Just think, your shadow lives in Flatland, coming and going as necessary.

Did the Cyclops race live in a Flatland?



DISK PHYSICS

That was a neat discussion on our slippery disk; my only comment is that our disk earth would have similar topographic features as sphere earth, only less pronounced.

According to the volume given, essentially the same as sphere earth, a single revolution per day could produce a sphere earth gravity over much of the disk outer flat areas. Centrifugal force, manipulated by the inhabitants, might be increased or decreased to fit desired circumstance.



NEW MOON

We know that disk earth was terraformed into its disk shape by outside influences because that&apos;s how it looked when we found it. But in our zeal to get down there and look the place over, after our hypotheses were complete, we failed to see that a spherical moon, similar in all respects to ours in this solar system, had been captured by the gravitational field of disk earth.

What effect would this round moon have on disk earth? What would be the its orbit? Is it possible that the moon would eventually escape? What would be the gravitation effect on the air and water of disk earth? Or on the inhabitants? What would the eclipses look like? Let&apos;s use the disk earth with the larger thickness in our conjectures.



RADIUM

Most of us have known about naturally occurring radium in the environment and its effects on humans, but it seems only recently that the media has discovered it. What do your sources say about the radium problem? How about Radon?



DISKAGEDDON

Since its inception, disk world has supported a number of tottering (sorry) civilizations. After the rim and surface wars, the harmony of general peace led to the discovery of space travel, and the subsequent exodus of all diskmen and diskettes to leave, searching for another suitable world on which to settle.

A minor footnote to the history of these voyagers was manifested in the long periods of scientific diskussion and outright wrangling wherein after arriving at a promising planetary body, the travelers pondered the effects of living on a spherical earth. This was resolved after landing; however, some of the diskites had difficulty in building their houses when trying to make the floors vertical to the surface. But that&apos;s another tale.

But we are looking down the pages of time, into the far future, and from our vantage point, quite a distance a way, we cannot make out the features of disk world; somehow it looks different.

Because we can&apos;t get any closer, we must conjecture as to disk world&apos;s ultimate fate. What will happen to it as the eons pass by?



DISKISTICS

Your treatment of area and volume formulas was impeccable.

However, the dimensions of disk earth were not spheroid earth&apos;s diameter, nor were they the proportions of an LP record; except for that you were disktinctly on target.

The original concept of disk earth (by the modest creator) were in two hypothetical sizes: 25,000 miles in diameter by 530 miles thick, and 15,000 miles in diameter by 1471 miles thick.

These conditions approximate the volume of spheroid earth, and were outlined previously.



SPINDRIFTING

I note that response to your question was not overwhelming, but let me, without completely doing your problem for you, point you in the correct direction.

Consider that any sort of mass set to whirling, even a solid, sets up certain centrifugal and centripetal forces (if you will) which act on particles of different densities. Consider also the partial vacuums which may be generated. For your further research, look on the whirlpool, waterspout, and the tornado. Please do not be influenced by yesterday&apos;s movie concerning the perils of the Kansas kid; they were somewhat fictionalized.

Realizing your antipathy towards Newtonian phrase, it&apos;s allowable to replace the word &apos;forces&apos; with the label of your choice.

Next, you may slant your research to determine why, when one shakes a container of dry material, such as corn grits or sand, that the larger particles end up at the surface.

Or are you too dense to analyze it?



FORCED

No such thing as centrifugal force? Try and tell that to the Sharples Centrifuge people who have various machines working at Miller Brewing Co.

(Perhaps what some call centrifugal force is merely a mechanical anti-gravity phenomenon)



CENTRIFUGAL FORCE

I was doing some research on the work of one of my heroes of science, A. Einstein; it seems that he said if a man were in a sealed capsule traveling in a straight line relative to whatever, the man would not have any way of knowing he was in motion.

But Albert went on to say that if the capsule were on the end of a rope, he would know, since he would be flung against the side wall in an acceleration effect.

Einstein thought that such an observer might well believe he had entered some planet&apos;s gravitational field, which was pulling him against the wall, and that he felt gravity and acceleration were equivalent forces.

Do your concepts correspond to Einstein&apos;s view of warps in four-dimensional spacetime?

If not, where do they differ?



A LITTLE DEFERENCE...

...and bow your head when you speak of my hero, Albert Einstein.

(Isaac Asimov and Newton are close behind)



CHALLENGER MALFUNCTION

I will assist your calculations by stressing that the main difference between 53 degrees and 20 degrees is 33 degrees. I knew med school was specialized, but I thought they would at least require a smattering of basic math. I dont understand how you stumbled into that defective conclusion, but my opinion might go along these lines:

1. At 20 degrees, the O-ring seals may have contracted somewhat, and not had the sealing pressure against the sides of the joints that they had at 53 degrees. It&apos;s parallel to window and door joinings in winter at low temperatures, that is, the doors shrink and the cracks get bigger.

2. I can recall the work I did with the solid fuel of the minute-man missiles long ago. In order to operate at max efficiency, the entire solid fuel mass was said to work best when the fuel temperature was at one given level, ie: all the fuel at 60 degrees, or all at 10 degrees, without any gradient change across the missile fuel section. If the booster fuel was 20 at the outside, and 50 at the core, it may have caused uneven burning, which &apos;may&apos; have had an adverse effect in the steering of the rocket engine.

But it&apos;s more than likely that the cold shrunk the seals just enough so pressure of the burning fuel forced its way past in some manner. I&apos;m as much in the dark about actual events as you, and if the hearings are any indication, we&apos;ll be in the dark for some time, the end of which a name from all involved will be drawn from a hat and blame placed.

What is particularly nauseous is the hypocrisy of the press, whose shrill cries about delays in launching were certain to affect launch strategy if only to silence their derisive comments about how many countdowns it took to get the shuttle off the ground. They were contributors to the tragedy, but with their mealy-mouthed comments of past weeks, one would never know it.



NEWMAN&apos;S MACHINE

If you can recall back that far, news about a unique, new energy generating device, which outputted more energy than was put in, had been designed by an inventor named Joe Newman, who had tested the device for many engineers and scientists, convincing them it really did work.

However, Joe did not convince the Bureau of Standards, who wished to test his machine in private, perhaps destructive, testing modes.

Judge Thomas Jackson had ordered that the Bureau be allowed to test the machine in any way they saw fit, but a US Appeals court called Jackson&apos;s decision &apos;highly irregular.&apos;

The Appeals Court then ordered that the National Bureau of Standards test the machine in the presence of Joe Newman, but that they were not to destroy the machine in test.

The NBS was given 30 days to produce a report, but after being furnished a machine by Newman, conducted no tests.

Do I detect the faint odor of big oil in the background?



HARD AS A ROCKWELL!

As you probably know, being the erudite bon vivant that you are, there exists in the pipe bender/wheel turner field a standard for hardness known as the Rockwell Series of scales, A, B, C, etc., with the C the better known as it is used to describe hardness of most steels.

I wonder exactly where on the Rockwell Scale the hardness of the plastic now covering the CD would lie, and if there is research going on to develop new and tougher materials.

Do you have any idea of what plastic material covers present CD&apos;s?

Another thought! When some precision lucite (acrylic resin) optical surfaces were abraded during handling, we sometimes coated the entire face of the marred surface with a mixture of acrylic resin dissolved in ethylene dichloride; when dry, the abrasions and/or scratches disappeared.

I don&apos;t know if this technique would work on mis-handled CD audio disks, but if we knew the material, we could choose a solvent and material with which to try. Or if you have a disk that&apos;s really scratched badly enough to be unplayable, pass it on to me for (heh, heh) experiment. It&apos;s worth a try.

(I&apos;ve got nothing to play it on, but I could try to renew the surface and let you see if it works)



HOW HARD IT IS......

The concept of hardness briefly touched upon in the last lecture gave rise to a thought concerning the relative hardness of different materials. And I suppose that the Mohs&apos; Scale of Hardness is fairly well known by scientific types, but for those who haven&apos;t heard of Mohs, without Larry and Curly, here it is, from top (the hardest) down:

10. Diamond

9. Corundum

8. Topaz

7. Quartz

6. Feldspar

5. Apatite

4. Fluorite

3. Calcite

2. Rock salt, or halite (gypsum in later years)

1. Talc

There is an industrially made compound called &apos;Borazon,&apos; which is a trade name for boron nitride, claimed by some to be harder than diamond. Anyway, on the above scale, each element will scratch the one below it, except for talc, which has no one to scratch on, at least not on this scale.

Note: Alpha, always known to bring to you the latest in scientific information, researched the data from a 1930 copy of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, purchased at a rummage sale last summer. The Handbook was, and still is, published by the Cleveland Rubber Company, albeit in a much larger edition now.

(Mohs&apos; first name was Friedrich, but that was his problem)



NEWMAN&apos;S MACHINE

Did any of the Alphans notice in the Sunday Journal of two weeks ago a rather lengthy article on Joe Newman&apos;s energy machine?

It seems that several in Congress are fighting tooth and nail to suppress the unit, saying it should be allowed to be destructively tested without Newman&apos;s being there. I wonder if the heady smell of petroleum wafts over the proceedings? If the machine gets a fair hearing, and proves to be viable, sell off those energy stocks in a hurry.



RATS!

Are you on DST again? So what if a kg of anything (not just water) is 1000 cubic centimeters. It&apos;s also 2.2046 lbs, 9.8 x 10^5 dynes, 9.8 x 10^-2 joules/cm, 70.93 poundals, 9.842 x 10^-4 long tons, 35.27 oz (adv.), or 9.807 newtons? What&apos;s your point?

While you are desperately searching for it, let&apos;s examine the data:

1. The text of that nifty report (a document which future generations will consider a milestone in Aquarodential Science) stated &quot;cubical glass pens .2 meters on a side.&quot; To convert, .2 meters x 39.37 = sides of 7.874 x 7.874 by 7.874, for a volume of 488.187 cubic inches, 0.283 cubic feet, and 2.1132 gals or, 8 kilograms H2O.

2. I draw the conclusion that the rats were tested one at a time.

3. If the facts were that the rats were in a closed top cubical of the given dimensions, then certainly the test subjects would have reacted as indicated. If the rats were in an open top cubical, then lab personnel would have spent a lot of time watching the rats swim, climb over the sides, and provide the heady excitement of the chase, even while not including the phenomena in the report.

4. Protection from environmental contamination might imply a cover on the cubical, depending on definition, test stringency, and how they got the rats into the cubical in the first place.

5. The only part of the report I might question is the length of time given (less than 60 seconds) for death to occur; rats are tough!

6. Finally, any engineer, scientist, or student pretending to excellence has to know all systems these days.

Hope you pieced together the facts well enough to get it (If not, your kid will to help out).

BY THE NUMBERS

As a quickie response, Reynolds numbers are dimensionless numbers which allow the engineer to calculate characteristics of laminar and non-laminar fluid flow relating to temperature and viscosity. A more precise and descriptive answer may follow, if Im up to it.



12. SOUTH AFRICA IN CRISIS

Most histories, encyclopedic and otherwise, have indicated that the Dutch and English came to South Africa and found it sparsely populated, then, after the Boer War, went on to build a country with beautiful cities where in the past there had been nothing but mud huts.

As the white culture grew, blacks moved in from the rest of Africa in order to benefit from the civilization established by the whites. The blacks multiplied at a high rate until they far outnumbered the whites.

And today, a spasm of sympathy for the so-called down-trodden blacks, living as squatters in South Africa, is reaching a contrived crescendo in the world, possibly to take the heat off the oppressions in communist countries and other black nations in Africa, for example, in Idi Amin&apos;s old stamping grounds, where the rag-tag army there is looting and stealing the people blind in the wake of the newest turnaround.

Now they want to take over a ready-made country, just as they were allowed to do in Rhodesia, and establish a control of consumers over producers, apparently not being smart enough to know that when the producers leave, the economy nosedives.

Its a shame!

Moderators comments follow:



REMINISCENT RHETORIC

There&apos;s a new cause in the air buoyed by the elements of the past.

It&apos;s kept afloat by the hot air from the same sources as those who tried to convince all that the Viet Nam experience was an immoral war, when it was really a noble cause to attempt keeping a people free,

It&apos;s well known, that the leftist media, the communists and their fellow traveling friends in the world, brought pressure to bear on the congress to withdraw funds from the ARVN so as to allow the forces of the North to eventually conquer South Viet Nam by default.

We still have some of those congressional cowards around.

This time the media, the liberals, and those staunch defenders of &apos;freedom,&apos; the commies, have again joined one another in an all-out campaign to turn the whole of the South African nation over to the radical blacks under the guise of democracy.

The left-wing rags are in full howl. The NY Times, Newsweek, Washington Post, LA Times, etc., fire editorial after editorial &apos;demanding&apos; that SA roll over and die to accommodate the blacks.

Night after night the TV idiots are blasting us with scenes of riots and unrest, of US flakes marching in the streets for a cause they understand as little as the war to keep South Viet Nam free which they opposed, and with strings pulled by the same evil sources that controlled them in that era.

It&apos;s a reprise of the Rhodesia takeover on a larger scale.

The latest &apos;hero&apos; of this infamous coterie of the left is Nelson Mandela, a marxist radical who vows that if he is released he will begin a reign of guerrilla terror; yet the media wants to see him freed. Why? So they have more pictures and copy when the blood letting starts? Of course!

The Viet Nam reportorial tactics of doom and defeat did serve one valid purpose, however inadvertent; it made us wary of network propaganda, the politicising by the Fifth estate, television. The pinks and reds are at it again, but in the case of South Africa, it is easier to define their true aim, the turnover of yet one more western country to marxism.

Let us hope that this time, they may have bitten off more than they can chew.



LIES AND SOUTH AFRICA

There have been a number of lies promulgated by the forces of revolution and leftish-liberalism:

1. SA holds the blacks in poverty.

It&apos;s just the reverse; blacks in SA have a higher standard of living than in any other African country, with wages 3 to 4 times higher. Blacks own cars, homes, and businesses. Thats why other blacks want to go there.

The blacks are mistreated by whites.

On the contrary! One million white, 200,000 colored, and 210,000 east indian taxpayers support 11 million blacks with their taxes. The whites subsidize black housing, medical care, and schools.

3. Whites are holding down the black majority.

There is no black &apos;majority;&apos; there are 10 major tribal units and scores of lesser ones, all enemies or hostile to one another. No Venda or Xhosa or Sotha wants to live under the rule of a Zulu, and vice versa.

4. Divestment will bring about justice for the blacks.

All it would do is bring about black unemployment.

5. SA is a police state.

In SA, there are 1.4 policeman per thousand people. In New York the ratio is 4.3 per 1000, and in Moscow it&apos;s 10 per thousand. Incidentally, most police in SA are black, 19,177 at last count, as compared to 16,292 white policemen.

It&apos;s obvious from other African countries which started out as 1 man 1 vote, the elections which were held were held only once, then drifted into dictatorships, mostly marxist, who hate the west. The slogan for those countries is: 1 man, 1 vote, 1 time.

Those who have seen the beautiful, modern cities of SA, like Johannesburg and Capetown, know that the blacks, on their own, could not have built them. But others, of the leftist stripe, are using the preponderant population of the blacks, who came to SA only to better themselves, to insist on a black takeover, violent or nay.

With all of the real dictatorships of the Soviet-dominated nations in the world, why are those crying out for black take-over strangely silent when it comes to the communists. Guess!

By the bye: In the Marxist garden paradise of Ethiopia, the rains have halted the drought, but the money and goods are still kept flowing in. Funny we haven&apos;t heard much about the rain, but that might shut off the money machine. Last word was that much of the food sent there is rotting in wet piles and will only benefit the rats. The Marxist rats already have their share in Swiss banks.



MAN&apos;S OWN WORKS

I would have been disappointed if you hadn&apos;t bled over the so-called poor blacks in Apartheidsville, SA, and shame of course is in the philosophy of the beholder, no matter how nicely put.

What I&apos;m saying is, the whites there built a civilization, the blacks built nothing but mud and thatched huts. The whites built up a farm-based food chain that didn&apos;t include one another. The whites built a nation; the blacks built better ways for one of the ten major tribes to kidnap and kill each other.

If you think that I advocate the premise that whites should be in power, in the land which is now their country, that enjoys a high white standard of living because of their own development, that just because blacks migrated to a place where they are better off, and exist at the sufferance of the whites who brought all of this to fruition, you are correct.

My suggestion is that Botha and the South African whites will get tired of all this meddling, which is apparently instigated by the communists and their fellow-traveling liberals, and expel all of the blacks to the wide open spaces northwest, and east to Mozambique, and let them build their own mighty cities and empire, although it is a difficult engineering feat to construct a 50 story skyscraper out of mud and reeds.

Expelling the blacks so they also can have the opportunity to have their own government is a reasonable answer to those who say that simply because the blacks happen to be living in someone else&apos;s country, they should be allowed to participate in the governing of that country. After this is completed, there will be no more apartheid because the blacks will be gone.

The half-million or so east indians and coloreds should also be given the choice of staying under white rule or moving out with the blacks. Which choice do you think they would make?

Yes, you also have the equivalent of apartheid in your own business, home, and family. Just because someone else lives in your neighborhood, are you ready to have them come in and have a say as to what schools your kids will attend, what furniture to buy, what car you want, what your office policy should be, and how you should landscape your lawn? Of course not!

But you are saying that on a larger scale, in South Africa, this concept is acceptable, at least to you.

As I stated, it&apos;s a matter of the people who are consumers trying to have a hand in the affairs of those who are the producers. I say if the blacks don&apos;t like the conditions in South Africa they should feel free to exit the country and flourish elsewhere.

Rhodesia was once a fine country; Cecil Rhodes envisioned a land where hard work would result in a good economy, great cities, and plenty for all who did work. This was achieved.

But no more! Under pressure from the world, the blacks were allowed to take over and the economy is headed down, down, and down. The glories of the marxist system are being set into place by the tin medal dictator. At the last election, he was irritated that the former white premier, Ian Smith, and his party got 17 seats in the assembly. The dictator threatened that this situation would be rectified.

Why didn&apos;t he just kick out the whites, take over their land, and shoot them all? World pressure? Goodheartedness? Sweet disposition? No! It is because the South Africans are on Rhodesia&apos;s southern border, and a wholesale slaughter of whites would bring reprisals.

When you speak of 1930 Germany, or 1830 deep south, you aren&apos;t using proper parallels to the SA situation. And considering the problems we are having with the blacks in the US (they would be &apos;coloreds&apos; in South Africa) today, perhaps back in the early 1800&apos;s we should have deported all blacks to Liberia, or its equivalent then. The blacks in America don&apos;t ever seem to have a good word for the whites who support most of them through taxes and subsequent government handouts.

In Milwaukee we are seeing fifth generation welfarites. Over 90% of the babies born to black adolescents are born without benefit of clergy. You and I are paying for their pleasure, and will continue to do so throughout the black mother&apos;s fertile period, during which her oldest daughter will hop on the gravy train as soon as she can ovulate.

Perhaps South Africa is using our situation as a bad example, to be fought against, because with the money it&apos;s costing the whites here, with a white majority, what would it do to SA with such a black majority. What you really seem to be advocating is that the whites of SA just hold elections and let the blacks take over because of superior numbers. Is that what you really want?

And as far as my views stemming from my conservative approach, I feel that many hold my viewpoint, and to many it&apos;s just common sense. Remember how they described the Liberal - a man with both feet set firmly in the clouds.



VISITORS

Perhaps what they call apartheid should be called Rules for Visitors and their Descendants.

From an indigenous population of a few hundreds in black tribes, the black population rose to its present 11 million, because blacks in other areas, seeing the promised land in white South Africa, migrated there in search of jobs.

This was fine! As long as the visitors played by the rules, and the rules were called apartheid. But as the numbers of blacks grew by migration and birth rate, they diluted the jobs market, giving rise to unrest, which was played upon by the communist instigators fomenting revolution.

What the white South Africans want is to preserve their country which they made from nothing. Why do others in the world want to take away the fruit of their labors of the years?

My sources include BBC broadcasts, Radio Nigeria, Radio Moscow, World Press Review, news magazines, and that published in the American press.

Incidentally, there is many a fact brought out in the open in foreign publication or broadcast that we never hear in the US. Listen to the BBC on short wave some time to get an objective report. Radio Nederland and the Deutchvelle of Germany are also very fair. Radio Moscow, of course, sends out the straight revolutionary party lies - I mean line.



BIGOT? WHO ISN&apos;T?

If you will read some history of black people in Africa, and I don&apos;t mean plagiarized fiction like &quot;Roots,&quot; you will find that there was a &apos;civilization&apos; of sorts in Timbuktu or Zimbabwe, both black ruled cities, but nothing of great import as we considered civilization. The whole of Africa was outdone by the Incas, Toltecs, Aztecs without a deep breath or a wheel.

And no matter what you think that you think, everyone is a bigot in some situation; some are more honest than others. It&apos;s nice to visualize through rose-tinted glasses, the way things should be, but idealism flees when realism enters.

I am a complete bigot in my belief that when a person works and builds, the fruits of his labors should not be confiscated and given to another. I suspect that books like Atlas Shrugged, and other Rand books, had somewhat of a logical effect on me in such respect. You should read Atlas, if you already haven&apos;t.



WHITE SETTLERS IN SOUTH AFRICA

White settlers came into a region with few or no indigenous people. They built a white civilization which was white ruled. Blacks came into the country to work and make a living far above the standards of other black African nations, and were told they would not be allowed citizenship.

Because of the work and welfare, the black population has risen to its present proportions, and now they want to take over a viable country with a viable government. If you don&apos;t believe this, you haven&apos;t heard the statements of Mandela, who wants to do it with murder, and the divine Tutu.

And you are equating the SA government and people with the Soviet Union. In SA, the white people, with some colored representation, are the government. In the Soviet Union, all races and religions are under the domination of the communist party.

The parallel is not the same!

And if you will read the tag end of the argument on SA Cure, you will see the part where it says in effect this is the point to which the SA&apos;s will be driven.

But even without that codocil, the cure would work if followed, and it may just happen. Reagan took the first steps with his stupid edict on sanctions; why, I don&apos;t know, the Republicans will never get the black vote in any case.

No one ever can emerge victorious by trying to please his enemies.

In conclusion, you are in no position to make moral judgments on anyone else; someone said once, Judge not lest ye be judged. You didn&apos;t forget that, did you? I say you, instead of me, because of your self-noted position when items Christian are involved.



LABELS?

When Tutu stands next to Botha, labels aren&apos;t needed. So then can we separate the populace into Bishops and Presidents? The label of black is only pejorative in the sense that the black in Africa is the sum of his ancestors; it may not be compelling, but it&apos;s truth.



SA COMMENTS

The answer to your thought on why SA cannot accommodate the blacks as the US did after the civil war is simple: The whites who built SA into a nation number a million, blacks number 11 million, others total 400,000. To take in all blacks would be the end of SA and those who built up the nation. My suggestion again is to force out all the blacks from the country, maybe to Mozambique, another marxist paradise which is on the brink of extinction after 10 years of Communism; they could use some extra workers.

Your reply on personal apartheid begged the question, but you were pretty clear as to your objection to the concept where your family was concerned, so why do you suggest it for a government and a people which built up from the bare land?

I didn&apos;t hear you complain when Nigeria threw out a million blacks who had come from outside the country to work. Or is it only where whites and blacks are involved that you view from such a lofty, dark plain?



INTRUDERS

Let me again clarify with a parallel.

You as a pioneer enter a frontier and proceed to construct a township in the classic size, 6 square miles. Your fellow pioneers have brought their families to this uninhabited place and have constructed homes, commercial buildings, church, and farms which make you self-sufficient.

Natives from other areas enter your township because of its attractive economy; some get jobs and work; all those accepted are bound by the rules of the township.

Later on, many more natives enter, overtly or covertly, breeding to the point where they begin to outnumber the original settlers. Second generation natives are given food and shelter by the settlers; they soon want more, control of the settlement because of their numbers. They want to throw out the rules of the originals and institute their own as the new majority, even though they were not involved in the development of the township.

If you were of the original settlers or their families, what would you do? Would you let the natives and their descendants take over the township, and make new rules favoring the majority, an inevitable sequence? And if the natives were fomenting rebellion against the township rules, breaking the township laws, with help from governments far away from the township, would this be acceptable to you?

Not likely.

This is the situation in South Africa. The rules are that blacks cannot be citizens the same as are the whites and the white government. Why should the SA minority who built the country accede to those who want to steal it away because of their numbers?

Your statement that because these blacks are in SA, they should be given a voice in government. Nonsense!

I don&apos;t really care if the SA government does not consider the blacks as part of a democratic process, they simply aren&apos;t, under the SA rules, and as migrant workers, and their families, the blacks are in SA at the sufferance of the white government, the same as our migrant workers from Mexico are.

If the SA government sees fit to set up a process to make citizens of the blacks, that is their business, or if not.

And your statement that SA is not much better in their treatment of the blacks than Russia lacks understanding of the situation. In the Soviet Union, one works or starves, especially in the non-white areas of the communist monster. In SA, the government provides food, housing and education to the blacks without charge - and they don&apos;t have to do so.

Let&apos;s put your statement to the foot test by assuming an open border for the Soviet Union and South Africa. My opinion would be that in the Soviet Union, the footprints would be heading out of the country, and in SA they would be going into the country.

The thrust of this commentary is, no matter what the skin color of the visitors or intruders to any country established by its inhabitants, the newcomers should not be allowed to take over the country simply by force of numbers.

It would be like a committee of laymen telling you how to extract a gall bladder by the fact that there were 20 of them making the decision and only one of you, even though you were the doctor.



NIGGLES, RENIGGLED

Where does it say that Syria, Libya, or Egypt are communist societies controlled by the Soviet Union. Provide your source, not simply a &apos;what does&apos; assumption, if you can.

Natives is a catch-all term for the black tribal members living in much of the continent. I believe I used mostly the term &apos;migrant,&apos; or if one considers SA as a sovereign nation, then blacks coming into the country could be called immigrants.

I believe that in prior notes I established my position that there were a number of variables to be weighed in the SA situation, and that the points you raise concerning black professionals, and other long time workers, are points to ponder by the SA government. This is not to say they should capitulate to the blacks in all instances.

It is my feeling that the SA whites, being better educated, and having a long history of achievement, are superior to the blacks, and perhaps also are of superior basic intelligence.

The rest of your discussion was simply a demand for answer from an &apos;if, then&apos; series of queries without substance.

And viewing the point that I feel whites are more intelligent than blacks, that has been proved in many areas of the world, and I am sure that every other reader got the point, even if you didn&apos;t, and had to put the obvious into words.

Your proposition on &quot;whites ruling all colors,&quot; and the &quot;shame&quot; suggestion, is merely one of the usual improbities. In cases where a non-white civilization rules, the whites must follow the established rules; where whites rule, the blacks must do the same.

I don&apos;t agree that apartheid is repugnant, if it is realized that apartheid is a set of government rules dealing with actions within a basically white-controlled society, to protect that society. The first rule of the State is to ensure its survival.

Do you think the blacks should all have a vote, that they should all be given SA citizenship, that they should have a part in the government, even though they would immediately outnumber the whites? Should they be allowed to take over the government according to amended existing laws and rule the country, in complete control of the South African nation?

Do you really believe, as you stated, that simply because the &apos;reforms&apos; others in the world want are not instituted that there will be no &apos;happy&apos; outcome? Do you mean that a happy outcome is when the blacks take over?

Try and make clear to us what you believe and want for SA, instead of nit-picking chosen portions of context.

Note: As was said before, we have no true blacks in the US except when we are visited by Bishop Tutu, or black african business or government officials, we have only our mixed blood population of color. This population would appear to be capable in accordance with the percentage of white blood in their ancestral background.

The white/black amalgam of genes has resulted in a number of superb athletes in most sports and some highly intelligent professional people, who are head and shoulders above most African blacks, in my opinion.



SOUTH AFRICA NOTE

Some Zulu tribe members went on a rampage last week and destroyed houses, looted shops, and just generally trashed the area. Was this against the whites? No, the target was the Indian community, shopkeepers and the like, who happened to be convenient.

This was only a few hundred Zulus. The Zulu tribal chief commented that the way to equality was certainly not through looting and burning. Sounds like a black with common sense and reason.

The Sunday Journal had a feature article on Watts, the Los Angeles suburb where all the &quot;burn, baby, burn&quot; rioting and looting took place back in that troubled era. The pictures of Watts and the pictures of the Indian city in flames didn&apos;t appear to be far removed from one another in terms of violence, which doesn&apos;t prove much except that violence is violence no matter where, why, and the skin color of the participants.

Reminiscent somehow of a Belgian soccer game, or a Sikh temple scene, or even the Haymarket riots, if you have a good memory.



SOUTH AFRICA POSITION

I think I made my position clear; without blacks, there would be no apartheid. If the SA government wants to develop a lily white nation, they can eject all the blacks that don&apos;t want to live under present rules. It&apos;s harsh, but pragmatic. I don&apos;t think the white SA&apos;s are going to commit political and cultural suicide, so after my thoughts of yesterday, I say that if any apartheid rules are changed, it won&apos;t be a major change that could endanger the white government. If the situation were reversed, the blacks being in power, there is no way they would allow a mass of whites to take over under the same circumstances.

The reasonableness of apartheid is not the issue; the true issue is the continuation and survival of the SA government and its citizens in face of the pressures that want to topple it. I hope SA uses all its powers to maintain the status quo.

Am I a white supremicist? Probably, I am white; most black supremicists are black, the yellow ones yellow, and the brown ones brown.



DEBATING SOUTH AFRICA ON PBS

Last night on McNeil/Lehrer they had a segment devoted to the effects of the speech Prime Minister Botha gave concerning modifications to the SA laws concerning blacks.

Interviewed were a representative of the SA government, Bishop Tutu, a Republican congressman who made little sense in his rambling disjointed remarks, D.C. congressman Walter Fauntroy, a black whose comments were laughably illogical, and a representative of the SA opposition party.

The Republican sounded as though he were lost in space; Fauntroy was against anything Botha or the SA rep said, although he couldn&apos;t supply adequate reasons why, the Bishop&apos;s attention span seemed limited to 6 seconds. Whenever Jim Lehrer, after someone&apos;s statement, said, &apos;Bishop, what do you think of that,&apos; Tutu invariably said, &apos;think of what?&apos;

The SA government rep tried to explain that what Botha said would be a starting point for negotiations, but his remarks were given little positive response.

When Tutu was coherent, he repeated that the blacks didn&apos;t want majority rule, they just wanted the vote. When asked if the huge black population did vote in blacks, was that acceptable to him. He grinned and said if that happened then it would happen.

After most of this type of contradictory rhetoric, McNeil finally got to the representative from the opposition Conservative Party, who was Mr. Roger Clive-Derby, and who made a statement loosely quoted as follows:

&quot;Here we are in Washington, D.C., in a foreign country, discussing the internal affairs of a sovereign nation far away. What gives the Congress of the United States the right to make moral judgments about SA policies over which they have no control, and should not have?

&quot;If the US were so concerned about human rights, why aren&apos;t they taking action in Afghanistan, or in any other place the communists are suppressing the people. Why don&apos;t they have programs like this in the Soviet Union? Because there is suppression, and there&apos;s nothing the US can do about it. The US operates under a double standard.&quot;

There was more in that vein, but none of the other participants could offer a cogent reply to the questions, probably because there were no answers that would not be embarrassing to the US congressmen.

If sanctions are applied, the SA&apos;s may simply break relations with the US, nationalize the US industries, and continue as they have, doing some suppressing of their own with regard to the revolutionaries in their country, and making the rules more stringent for the other blacks. A US policy of sanctions and boycott is bound to affect the blacks adversely and hurt American investors. If it happens, the US, to its sorrow, will have to assume a great portion of the responsibility.



US INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA

What you said about the United States having interests in South Africa is deceptive in the sense that the only interests identifiable with the US are commerical.

There are no US air bases or naval bases, no havens for a US military presence. There are only factories developed by US private enterprise, and as such should not be meddled with by our government or its citizens who have no vested interest in the companies.

Most of the loonies who march against the concept of private companies located in SA don&apos;t have the wherewithall to own stock in any of those companies so they have nothing to lose. If the idiots wanted to march in a good cause, they could demonstrate against US banks and companies who provide funds and expertise to the Soviet Union and its captive satellites.



RAW IS RIGHT!

What you are really implying is that we are telling SA they should listen and do what we say, in their own country, and if they do so we will allow them to sell strategic materials to us for our defense.

Are you serious?



TRUE BLACK IN SA

I hope you all noted that the wife of the marxist Mandela who is in a SA jail for life, but who could get out immediately if he would abjure violence, but refuses, let the cat out of the bag in a fit of pique yesterday.

She was quoted as saying the time for sharing power with the white SA&apos;s had passed, and what the blacks wanted was to have the government turned over to them. Showed her true colors, what?



MAJORITY!

Just to clarify a minor point for you, there is a white, majority government running SA; the blacks are not citizens and do not vote.

Were they citizens, and could they vote, there would now be a black, majority government in SA, at the expense of all the white citizens and their forbears who by now would have been unlanded citizens, probably in some other country, Australia, for example.

As long as there are dictator, imperialist nations like the Soviet Union and its captive satellites, with the people under the thumbs of the communist oppressors, why are you liberals so enthusiastic about bringing change to a country which offers blacks the highest living standard in the African continent?

Go pick on the Soviets, for all the good it will do.



SA CURE?

This might be the final approach by the SA government if troubles continue:

1. Exile all persons, black, white, or colored, who either don&apos;t have a job, or won&apos;t work if they do have a job.

Dispose of the revolutionaries in the country, beginning with Nelson Mandella; method is not a consideration.

3. Nationalize all foreign owned industries and banks, and prevent funds from leaving by confiscating all funds, except for those nations wishing to maintain a trade based on need instead of criticism.

4. If the meddling nations want to buy strategic metals, make them pay through the nose, or let them go to the other supplier, such as the mild and benevolent Soviet Union.

5. Kick out, by force if necessary, all TV and other media journalists immediately.

6. Have accompany the journalists, all of the white bleeding hearts who are against government policy; let them bleed for causes in other lands, in Latvia, or Estonia, or the Ukraine; see how far they get.

7. Maintain the military forces in numbers, and on high alert; don&apos;t hesitate to make preventive strikes on enemy build-ups; if Israel can do it successfully, so can SA.

8. Make it clear to the other black African nations that SA will be willing to trade with them and have peaceful relationships with those who want peace; but, is ready for war with those who would make war. Advise the black nations that SA would be ready and willing to use the atomic weapons that they have developed jointly with Israel as a method for offense and defense.

9. Inform others in the world, especially the two-faced US liberals, that if they don&apos;t like what SA is doing, they can stuff it!

10. Repudiate all debts to interfering nations, those with the famous double-standards of approach being first.

Draconian methods, right? But that&apos;s where the interferences of the West are pushing the South Africans. Who will suffer most? Those blacks the liberals seem to be so fond of; but the libs won&apos;t care, knowing only their time-disproven methods, but not ever noting their inevitable folly.



SOUTH AFRICA VIOLENCE

I don&apos;t think there will be either a revolution or a rebellion in SA; either of those must be by the citizenry.

But, there may be an attack by the non-citizens, supported by invasionary forces from outside the country, with plenty of help from the communist bloc, and unwitting assistance to the attackers by the bleeding hearts of the world, those who never seem to be aware of the soviet enemies, but only know the faults of our friends. Look at the list: Rhodesia, Iran, Nicaragua, South Viet Nam, and Cuba. And the idiots in congress now trying to add South Africa to their collection of shame.

If there is armed violence, on a military scale, I hope SA takes every action needed to defend itself. The communist technique is so visible here, take a slice at a time. Sanctions, pressure, voting rights for all, then one big, last vote to get their black puppets in power, thus gaining control of some of the world&apos;s most important raw materials, materials vital to America&apos;s defense.

That&apos;s one of the real aims, and I can&apos;t believe how our own wimpy Congressmen, Solarz, Kennedy, and that ilk, aren&apos;t aware of this possibility and are simply closing their partisan eyes to it for political gain among American blacks.



TUTU SQUEAKS

Those who took issue with my claim some time past, that Tutu and his revolutionary gang were out only to take over South Africa from the white government structure might have heard the African activist&apos;s words of the recent week wherein he stated:

&quot;We are going to be rulers in this land!&quot;

Sullen and angry blacks in the crowd called for a white bloodbath, and a violent removal and execution of white leaders.

My advice to those white leaders is, throw out Tutu and his black and white supporters, expel all blacks who don&apos;t want to work in the system, and do whatever must be done to preserve the Republic which the whites built from nothing. And the hell with what the US liberal or the rest of the world thinks.

Bigoted? Racist? Sure! If you consider that I&apos;d like to see the civilization the Boers built remain theirs. There is no God-given fiat that says because most of the natives living in Africa are black, that they must perforce be given control over the entire continent.



DIP LIP SLIP

Well, the fabulous Bishop, Tutu Devine, has footed his mouth again, with his statement that Reagan&apos;s reasonable outlook on South Africa was nauseous, and there is no connection between a people and its religion, culture, and land in recorded history. He said that the West, presumably including President Reagan, Prime Minister Thatcher, and Prime Minister Helmut Kohl, can go to hell.

The limited brain of the good Bishop, was weighed in the balance and found once more to be wanting, again repeating the Bishop&apos;s farcical appearance on the McNeil-Lehrer Report some time ago.

But the concept that causes this bishop to stutter is simply that his skin color is not effecting the pressures he and his ANC (read communist) cohorts wish to bring about, namely, economic sanctions, leading to chaos, leading to a black takeover of the SA government.

I once said that the prime motive of the black revolutionaries was to take over the government and forge a marxist society, starting with the famous Zimbabwean method of one man, one vote, one time. Perhaps those who disagreed with my viewpoint at the time may wish to reconsider.

And speaking of Zimbabwe, the marxists are in power, the whites are leaving whenever they can, Ian Smith, the former prime minister, is under house arrest, and the blacks are rescinding their agreement to give the whites a given number of seats in the parliament. It&apos;s a trip downhill for the state that American Liberals built.

Now they wish to do the same for South Africa.

The time will come, according to the black communists of the ANC, when the inevitable blood bath occurs; however, even though the ANC and its cohorts are supplied arms from the eastern bloc, the SA armed forces have most of the fire power. After they have annihilated the black revolutionaries, it can be hoped that they will continue on into &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; and turn it back into Rhodesia, a formerly rich and self-sufficient nation.

Look for this face-off: The Afrikaaners and other whites, teamed up with the Zulus, against the marxist hordes; the Indian population will run for the hills in terror of getting a hang nail, with only the Sikhs owning the fortitude to put up a fight, if they might wish to.

Bishop Tutu will be in some safe haven, mouthing his racist statements, with his metatarsal phalanges firmly fixed between his maxilla and mandible as usual.



ERRANT

You are missing the point, which is: what is happening in South Africa is actually none of our business, but the liberal-left is inserting its well-used proboscis into that non-marxist country&apos;s internal affairs.

Reality is, doing nothing about the communist slave societies around the world, and when the US tries to do something, such as in Central America or Grenada or wherever, that same liberal-left is totally against our helping the slaves of the marxists.

Reality is, the liberals bringing pressure to topple the governments of Iran, Cuba, Viet Nam, Nicaragua, and Rhodesia to allow a takeover by a marxist group to our detriment.

Reality is, not getting strategic materials from South Africa, who is a bulwark of anti-Communism, and instead trying to procure the same badly needed items from US liberals&apos; great and benevolent friend, the Soviet Union.

The real point of it all is this: The United States is the only world power based on democratic ideals. Little by little the totalitarian forces of the world are assimilating bits and pieces of the planet and subjugating the residents. We are the only nation standing in the way of a global communist dictatorship, and we have an obligation to assist other anti-communist governments to survive; South Africa is such a government.

It always amazes me that the two-headed liberal can always call for sanctions against our friends, but never against our soviet enemies. Ian Smith of Rhodesia is now under house arrest and not permitted to travel by the black marxist forces in control there, forces that our American and British liberals helped put into control in a move that bordered on the ridiculous.

Fortunately, South Africa&apos;s white government has the manpower, weaponry, and will to resist the revolutionaries no matter what sanctions are exerted by the US (including a stock of nuclear weapons) unlike Rhodesia. marxist blacks have promised a bloodbath in SA if they are not allowed to assume power; if they try, I think the ensuing bloodbath will not be to their liking.

You can apologize for the liberal thinking all you want; it hasn&apos;t worked in the past, and it won&apos;t work in the future. Liberal critics have ever decried the US&apos;s military actions to provide for free choice of government, such as in Grenada; in SA, they have their own military to resist communist revolutionaries; we don&apos;t even have to get involved.

So why do liberals want sanctions? Could it be that in their heart of hearts they really want to see a marxist government in South Africa? Is that their secret aim for the entire world? The &apos;One Worlders&apos; have always been with us; is global Communism their grand design?

It would not surprise me.



SOUTH AFRICA AGAIN

The nations of the world seem to be ganging up on South Africa, trying to get them to withdraw from governing the nation by allowing the millions of blacks to vote themselves into power.

This is the bottom line of all activity in that direction. The blacks will take over and run the nation as they see fit; the whites will have no power because of their relatively small numbers.

The blacks will be able to develop a new set of rules, run a totally black army, and do what they wish to the whites that are caught there.

Now:

Seeing that this is the ultimate result of one man one vote, what do the Alphans really think about the forcing whites out of power in their own country so the blacks will rule?

Do you really want to see this happen?

Do you think the blacks will allow whites to continue their way of life after the blacks take over?

Do you think the blacks would rule fairly if they did achieve absolute power?

Do you feel that the blacks would listen at all to the west, that they would allow western companies to remain as they were, that they would not take over all commerce and industry, that they would identify with freedom instead of with the soviets?

We have had much controversy on apartheid, reforms, and sanctions; do you think that if the only way to dissolve apartheid would be a black takeover, would you still be in favor of the takeover?



CREATIVE THINKING

Progress may be related to latitude; however, much of Africa lies in temperate zones; what kept them from the wheel and axle? And accomplishments beyond?

Even near the equator, nothing stopped them from thinking at night, when it was cooler.

And, no one really knows where the initial home of man was, on earth or otherwise; we only have the artifacts of antiquity to observe and theorize over.

In the far future, when the Whites are vanished, the fruits of their vigor and knowledge may yet be utilized to maintain the melting pot drabskins of earthian descendants. What engenders this depressing thought? Only that at the turn of the century, Whites were about 30% of the world population. Today they are 15% of the world population, and as the total approaches 5 billion people on the globe, White birth rates are only 10% of all births.

Let&apos;s apply this in demographic terms.

At present, a fertility rate of 2.1 babies for each female equates to a no-growth population. In the United States the fertility rate for Whites is 1.3, way beneath the rate of replacement. And as we allow hordes of non-whites into the US, coupling with those already here, means that within a few decades the United States will itself be a third world nation of color, with the Whites a minority group, and the country itself on a downhill path to mediocrity.

I don&apos;t think the founding fathers had that in mind.

The only hope of the nation is stringent immigration laws and control of our borders, with the ejection of illegal aliens a must in order to maintain the status quo of racial levels now in existence. Note that I said stringent immigration laws, laws that set standards of competency for those who wish to become citizens through proper channels.

The country, like the marines, always will have room for a few, good people.

The problem is, illegal aliens are ipso facto law-breakers, who generally wish to keep the customs and languages of their homelands instead of going through the naturalization process with its demands of American history and English language. Liberals want to legislate an amnesty for all those millions of illegals who flouted our laws to get in, but who only want the easy living of government handout.

Emma Lazarus notwithstanding, America should not be a &apos;melting pot&apos; for the world in a willy nilly fashion.

I agree with John Jay, who in his second Federalist papers said:

&quot;With..pleasure..I have often taken notice that Providence has been pleased to give this one country to one united people speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs and who, by their joint counsels, arms and efforts, fighting side by side through a long and bloody war, have nobly established their general liberty and indepencence.

&quot;This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignities.&quot;



LAUGH OF THE WEEK

It came when an unholy duo, Senators Richard Lugar and Ted Kennedy, waxed highly indignant over the fact that Botha made calls to some senators explaining how South Africa would withdraw grain purchases from the US if sanctions were upheld, blabbing to the effect that &quot;how dare this representative of a foreign government meddle in the internal affairs of the United States!&quot;

Where were they when Israel made the refugee black jews into second class citizens? And note how tight-lipped they are as the news unfolds as to how the whites in Zimbabwe are being oppressed by the black marxists in control of what passes for government there. You remember the teeming nation of Rhodesia, and how the liberals of the US and the world exert pressure from every aspect to turn the thriving Rhodesian society into a black, marxist paradise.

Fortunately, South Africa has the backbone and the wherewithall to resist the black and white communists and US congressmen who are waging a non-military war against it.

It&apos;s a big laugh, but it&apos;s not funny.



13. FAITH, HOPE, AND CLARITY

Fear not! We have curbed the dogma! There is none here as such, only elements of historical record as found in the great religious tomes of the centuries. More questions are asked than answered, and so it is with all matters dealing with faith - whichever faith.

Moderators comments follow:



SEASONAL DATA

What really was the star in the east? It could have been the bright light generated by a nova, or it could have been a comet, perhaps even Halley&apos;s Comet, which was known to the Chinese as appearing in the Toung-Tsing area of the sky.

Around the time of Christmas in 1603, Johannes Kepler was observing the skies with his small telescope, noting the approaching conjunction of two planets, Jupiter and Saturn. Kepler had read the rabbinic writings of Abarbanel, who said that it was believed the Messiah would appear when a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn would take place in the constellation of Pisces.

Kepler, whose genius covered a complex mix of mathematician, astrologer, outright quack on occasion, and astronomer, mathematically deduced that there indeed was a threefold conjunction in 6 or 7 B.C., and finally fixed the date of Mary&apos;s conception in 7 B.C.

Present day computer calculations have proved that there was this three-way conjunction, and that it was visible in the Mediterranean area, and that the combination of stars did show with a brilliant light.

Christmas is celebrated as being in the period from December 24th to 25th, but most astronomers and historians, in the church and out, agree that December 25th of the year 1 was not the true birth of Christ with regard to both the date and year.

The Scythian monk, Dionysius Exiguus, was instructed in 533 to establish the beginning of the new age by working back, but he forgot to enter the year 0 between 1 BC and 1 AD, and also overlooked the four years when the Roman Emperor Augustus ruled under his name of Octavian.

The scriptures say that &quot;.....Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the King.&quot; It is known that Herod was appointed king by the Romans in 40 BC until his death in 4 BC, So Jesus must have been born before 4 BC.

But what about the date? St. Luke wrote that the shepherds were in the fields watching their flocks by night. However, at mid-December, the area of Bethlehem is frozen, and the shepherds of that time kept their animals inside shelters from November to March, and would not have been at the site of the Creche.

Then why December 25th as the birth of Christ? In 354 AD, the Emperor Justinian first proclaimed that date as Christmas. In the past, the Romans celebrated a day known as, Dies Natalis Invicti, or birthday of the unconquered. The day also fell near the winter solstice, and on the last day of Saturnalia, a long week of carnival celebration, and was on December 25th.

What a convenience for Christian Justinian, who was able to combine the date into a monument to Christ, to Saturn, and to the solstice, at one fell swoop, and to provide us with a day for celebrating the birth of Christ and, if we are so inclined, to defer to the God Saturn at the same time. In any case, Merry Christmas!



A TRUE TALE OF JESUS?

I wonder how many of the bible advocates, that is to say those who religiously believe that every line is in the book is gospel truth, really know the of the other stories and tales dealing with the people who were prominent in that time period. The key words are &quot;other stories,&quot; which did not find their way into the final biblical literature.

It&apos;s been some ten years since I traveled to northern India, specifically to Kashmir. At that time the history of Kashmir was available in English, the official language then, and some interesting ideas were put forth by the writers.

For example, it is an accepted fact in Kashmir that the Valley of Kashmir was in fact the promised land spoken of in the Bible. The people there claim that they are direct descendants of an Israeli tribe, and that contrary to what the Bible says, there was no wandering around in the Sinai Desert for 40 years, they also claim that the tribe started right from Egypt.

This would make some sense in the respect that all of the trials and battles came about as a result of the Israelis fighting their way through hostile lands who weren&apos;t about to allow a vast caravan of exiles cross their territory.

Another claim. It is said that Moses died in the Kasmiri highlands, and that his tomb is on Mount Booth, some 30 kilometers SW of Srinagar. A local mountain near Srinagar is named Takht-i-Suleiman, The Throne of Solomon, as every Kasmiri knows.

The Bible says: ...Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord, and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-Peor; but no man knows the place of his burial to this day...&quot;

Perhaps the Kashmiris know?

To reinforce the Israeli/Kashmiri link, here are some words to view:

Hebrew Kashmiri Meaning

akh akhl alone

ajal ajal death

awa awa go

ahad ahad at once

hamah humaham noise

loal lol love

qatal qatal murder

qabar qabar grave

There are many others, but these are some examples.

To go further: The Essenes, a group of Jewish scholars, lived near the Dead Sea. Their histories say that at least one Israelite tribe lived in faraway Kashmir. It is possible that Jesus himself may have come to the valleys of Kashmir. Let&apos;s examine some possibilities:

Crucifixion, as practiced by the Romans, was not an inevitable death sentence; it was a form of torture that a strong and healthy body could survive, and many did, perhaps even Jesus. When the legionary inserted his spear into the side of Jesus, they say blood and water flowed, which would indicate life in the body.

Joseph, Nicodemus, and Mary took Jesus down from the cross, letting the Roman soldiers think he was dead, and treated his wounds in some hiding place. Doctors of the Essenes? When some followers asked the women at the specified tomb about Jesus, the Bible says they answered, &quot;Why do you seek the living among the dead?&quot;

This would seem to follow our hypothesis.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke are contradictory about the resurrection, and John the Evangelist does not even discuss it. The Romans might have heard that Jesus was still alive, and began to look for him. Is it possible that he could have been told by the Essenes escape to Kashmir where a friendly tribe of Israelis lived?

Did his mother, Mary, die on the way to Kasimir, a long and brutal trip? Was she buried in an area about 8 kilometers west of Rawalpindi in Pakistan? Still today, a chapel reverently called Mai Mari, Last resting Place of the Mother Mary, stands on the spot.

The Indians say that Jesus continued on his way to Kashmir, and would have been joyously accepted by the tribe of Israelis there. He most likely would have married and died at a ripe old age, venerated by king and commoner alike. Is this possible?

Well, Professor F.M. Hassnain, maintains that Jesus made his way to the area of Kashmir because he was traveling to the land of his fathers. Is it possible that the unaccounted for year of Jesus&apos; life was spent in Kasimir? Hassnain points out that for 1900 years the people of Kashmir have known that the tomb of Jesus is there. In a narrow, gloomy, alley stands a church/mosque edifice, combining elements of both.

Its name is Rauzabal Khanyar, and it is in a street named, A Prophet Will Come! The inscription reads, Here lies the famous prophet Yuz-Asaf, prophet of the children of Israel. Yuz-Asaf and Yusu are local transliterations, and are identical with the name of Jesus.

The holy place itself is a pilgrimage point for Christians, Hindus, and Moslems. An inscription on the Solomon mountain says (ca AD 54), He is Jesus, the prophet of the children of Israel. And in the Sanskrit book, Mhabishya Maha Purana, dating to AD 115, on pages 465 and 466 in verses 17 to 32, a meeting between Jesus and the Ruler of Kashmir is described, with Jesus saying, I was born of a young woman, I taught the truth and preached against the destruction of the traditions...they rejected the traditions and Judged me!

Interesting and intriguing...



BIBLE SECRETS

The bible as history has been touched on in these discussions and likely will be again, such as right now. The Holy Land always has been more desert-like than not, and a good well was a treasure to be kept safe.

Our old acquaintance, Nebuchadnezzar, sent an army into a grape-growing area where the noted &apos;Pool of Gibeon&apos; had been carved into the face of an outcropping of hard limestone. Eighty two feet down, they hit pure water in large quantities which were to be used in the Gibeon wine-making operations.

In 587 BC, Nebbie&apos;s army laid waste to the countryside there, filling up the pool with tons of rock and rubble, sealing it up for all time - so they thought.

Sir James Pritchard of the University of Pennsylvania&apos;s noted museum had studied the Bible and found a reference to the Pool. Using the ancient scriptures as a guide, his group found the actual site. The pool was cleared and reopened, providing a fresh source of water. After over 2500 years, the Pool of Gibeon flows again. Winemaking was not mentioned.

The 8th Chapter and the Ninth verse of Deuteronomy said, &quot;For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land....whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou canst dig copper.&quot; This was enough to pique the interest of Sir Nelson Glueck, who studied the traders who developed commerce between Solomon and the Persian Kings.

He determined that the cargoes going to Persia must have been copper. From aerial photographs taken in color it was noted that many water holes had been dug in a particular area of ridges. From the pictures, and studies of the Bible and other writings, Glueck deduced that the mines were in an area called Wadi el Arabah, and after traveling to the site, finally located the mines. Old smelters had used water from the wells; veins of copper ready to be worked were found, with some of the picks and tools still beside them, dropped when the workers had to escape the invaders so many years ago. The mines are in production today.

In conjunction with the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, which provided much of the source information for the Bible, speaks of many treasure hoards, all within about fifty miles from the Dead Sea. Although most of the scrolls were written on some sort of parchment, the scrolls dealing with treasure were inscribed on thin sheets of copper. The message, 95% of which can still be deciphered, tells of hiding places containing an estimated 200 tons of gold bars.

One inscription states:

In the cistern, which is below the rampart, on the east side in a place hollowed out of the rock, there will be found 600 large bars of silver. Close by, under the southern corner of Zadok&apos;s tomb, and underneath a column of pilaster in the exedras, there is a golden vessel of incense in pine wood and another vessel in cassia wood.

In the pit nearby, toward the north, and near to the grave, in a hole opening to the north, there is a copy of this book with explanations, measurements, and details. The Zadok mentioned in the tantalizing treasure map was really a high priest of King Solomon, and some scholars think that they know the approximate location of Zadok&apos;s tomb, which has been referred to in many ancient manuscripts.

If the area can be established, and if high tech electronic gear could be used, either to find the treasure or at least the instruction manual, it would be an interesting, and lucrative, archeological event. That is, if during the long span of years between then and now, others have not already solved the puzzle of Zadok&apos;s tomb.

Incidentally, an &apos;exedra&apos; in this case, is a large outdoor seat, sometimes carved from stone, with a very high back. Carelessly throwing one&apos;s head back while first sitting down gave rise to exedra headache #1.



NOT AS I DO...

I too spent many years learning and arguing with the Jesuits and Franciscans, who were trying to pound faith into my British, Irish, Kraut head along with Math and Science. The harder they pounded, the more skeptical I became, finally believing nothing about everything. The thing that was most self-defeating to their educational cause was the do as I say, not as I do technique.



A BASIC RELIGION?

Down the long trail of years that man has developed sophistication in his culture, as well as in his religion, there has been one approach that could work anywhere at anytime, and that is: &quot;Try not to hurt another human being in any way.&quot; If man lived according to this simple statement there would be no real need for formal religion. But it won&apos;t happen; organized religion with its churches supply a meeting place to expiate our sins against one another in a ritualistic way so we can release the guilt - and go out and do the same thing over. The church is paid for this plastic atonement, making it a good business to be in, especially in Rome, Jerusalem, or in Mecca. The spot doesn&apos;t matter.



MORE RELIGION

The point is that there is a sophistication in corruption as well as in religion, and the quid pro quo between priest and supplicant has evolved from a blessing for a coin to a more ritualized process, but the essential element of cash for guilt remission still remains.

As far as religious sophistication is concerned, I think we have progressed from the time when they heated up the statue of Baal and threw in the sacrifices, or when the Hebrews sacrificed their children to the God of the old Testament, or the Arabs sacrificed their sons to Allah in battle (maybe that part is still going on), or the Aztecs cut living hearts out and waved them in the sunshine, or any number of worshipping techniques which demanded a human life. However, I must admit that in parts of Africa and New Guinea the natives ritualistically consume their enemies, which is tough on them.

Being one who believes in life, I feel the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception - a powerful example of the whole being more than its parts - however, I don&apos;t think it is a religious issue per se. It is more of one human being killing another, in legalized murders at the rate of millions per year. The women that disagree with this stance are usually those who consider abortion as only a minor inconvenience to their usual activities. But I also think there may be special cases where abortion can be specified to save a mother&apos;s life or sanity, but the sanity condition cannot be applied to every situation either.



PURE GOLD

Perhaps my definition of the injury to others concept is too simple; however, here are some rather homely homilies on a similar subject:

Brahmanism: This is the sum of duty: Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you. Mahabharata 5:1517

Buddhism: Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful. Udana-Varga 5:18

Christianity: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets. Matthew 7:12

Confucianism: Surely it is the maxim of loving kindness: Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you. Analects 15, 23

Islam: No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he wishes for himself. Sunnah

Judaism: What is hateful to you, do not to your fellowman. That is the entire law; all the rest is commentary. Talmud, Shabbat 31a

Taoism: Regard your neighbor&apos;s gain as your own gain and your neighbor&apos;s loss as your own loss. T&apos;ai Shang Kan Ying P&apos;ien

Zoroastrianism: That nature alone is good which refrains from doing unto another whatsoever is not good for itself. Dadistan-i-dinik 94:5

(Of course there are some who swear by: &quot;Do unto others before they do unto you;&quot; and there&apos;s another one that says, &quot;Whoever has the gold makes the rules!&quot;)



$SIN.00

Remember what I said about expenditure per expiation; the more sins the more money in the priestly coffers. As soon as a certain sin is out of date it may fade into memory.

There have been many, many changes in Catholic rules; these may touched on later.



YOGA SUTRAS

I&apos;m sure we would all appreciate hearing more from the Yoga Sutras; in my memories, it seems as though there were a number of references not only to out-of-body travel but also to telekinesis being utilized to operate air, land, and sea vehicles, even though that was considered mundane work as opposed to the flights of pure spirit fancy.



MENNONITE PHILOSOPHY

I can understand and respect a position on conscientious objection to war. Is it also the Mennonite position that during time of war there can be no helping of our side?

For example, I would not expect a sincere CO to carry a weapon, or perhaps even serve as a medic or ambulance driver, but is it also forbidden to work in a plant making medical supplies for a war, or a factory supplying the munitions for our forces.

It would seem to me that enjoying the freedom to live in a given country of choice carries along with it some obligation to help that country in time of need, just as your group helps the northern neighbors in time of their particular need.

Give us some idea concerning where the assistance lines are drawn vis a vis the Mennonites and the United States. I certainly don&apos;t feel that if your group won&apos;t do anything at all to assist in time of war that you are deliberately aiding the enemy, ala Jane Fonda and her crowd, I can only admire your adhering to your principles, regardless of what others might say; that&apos;s why we are a nation of laws and rights.



GOOD BOOK NOTES

Back in the days when I went to St. Patricks and St. Bernards in the tough part of Madisons East Side, we were expected to know the books of the Bible along with various statistics dealing with the Bible. Hard work for a heathenish kid who only went to St. Bernards because they had a seventh grade tackle football team.

Anyway, if I had to learn all that holy miscellany, theres no reason why I cant pass it on to the Alphans. Even if youre not Biblically inclined, what can it hurt, as the man said when he drove the stake through the alleged vampires heart.

So, here are some statistics:

There are 66 books in the Bible, of which 39 are in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament.

Chapters: 920 in the Old, 275 in the New.

Verses: 23,214 in the Old, 7,959 in the New.

Words: 592,493 in the Old, 181,253 in the New.

Letters: 2,728,100 in the Old, 838,380 in the New.



The names of the books making up the Bible were as follows:

Old Testament:

Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

New Testament:

Matthew, Mark, Luke, The Acts, Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, I Thessalonians, Titus, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, Philemon, To The Hebrews, Epistle of James, I Peter, II Peter, I John, II John, III John, Jude, and the Book of Revelation.

There are other books of the Bible known as the Apochrypha, books included in the Septuagint and Vulgate canons of the Old Testament, but were not in the Jewish and Protestant canons. Many consider the Apochrypha simply as early Christian writings not included in any Biblical books.

The word &quot;Deuteronomy&quot; was always confusing. We were told in Sister Florentinas class that Deuteronomy was the fifth book of the Bible, so I guess it was. However, some of us smart-alecks looked up the word and found out it meant second. Sister told us it really meant secondary, but not second, thus squeezing out of a tough spot, without having to really explain.

She was good at that.

(Note: At the least, you now know where the names of the old settlers and pioneers of the Wild West movies came from - right out of the Old Testament)



CHAPTER&amp;VERSE

My basic position is one of complete abhorrence of homosexuality in any of its ramifications. I remember hearing that the Bible has some adverse comments on hmsls but can&apos;t recall what or where they were to be found. Could someone kindly provide some Biblical quotations covering the situation, along with chapter and verse designations? It would be appreciated - especially by me, who went on record that the Bible was agin it, but failed to provide more detailed backup.



HOMOSEXUAL CHURCHES

Those churches that allow hmsl&apos;s to be ordained, or even take part in lay activities, cannot call themselves Christian churches that believe in the Bible. I think the Torah also is adamantly against them also, but I leave it to our Jewish scholars for interpretation.

Adherence to Biblical concepts doesn&apos;t seem feasible on a selective basis. In my opinion, other world religions would not favor the life style.



PROPHECIES

My position is that an erudite scholar can find a line in the Bible to justify the fulfillment of any prophecy, or the lack thereof. It&apos;s like reading Nostradamus; his quatrains can be construed as foreseeing atomic power, air travel, space flight, or what have you. It&apos;s a simple matter of interpretation.

Concerning your thought that every prophecy in the Bible has come true, I suggest you re-read revelations and then comment.

With regard to your cheerful outlook, there are two theories which apply:

The Ice Ball and the Mack Truck.

The Ice Ball theory states that in a few billion years the earth will become a lifeless ball of ice, so why worry?

The Mack Truck theory states that if you are walking around outside your home you could be hit by a Mack Truck and demolished at any time, so why worry?



REV. JERRY FALWELL

I also was one of those who thought Falwell was simply a Bible-thumping cuckoo; but, after seeing and hearing him during this anti-SA fiasco, and noting how he handles himself, I&apos;m afraid I have to reassess my opinion.

Falwell came across more and more as a very intelligent man whose outspoken views put him in the heat of the liberal focus. Even so, he accepts the heat and returns even more to his detractors than they can accommodate.

On McNeil/Lehrer, he was debating some blonkey legislator, who, it appeared, could only have been elected from a totally black voting area, because of the color of his skin, and turned the chap inside out with his concise statements. I was embarrassed for the poor black fellow; hardly anyone knew what an inferior mind he had before the broadcast, afterwards, everyone was aware.

Falwell has emerged intellectually supreme in every confrontation with those who advocate turning South Africa over to the blacks. There is a depth to the man that was not apparent in the brief media clips shown in the past, especially those meant to be deliberately embarrassing by being taken out of context.

Had I to make a choice of voting for Kennedy, Hart, Weiker, Proxmire, Solarz, etc., or Falwell (for any office), it would be Falwell hands down! (Blonkey means &apos;black honkey&apos;)



SUM OF YOUR THOUGHTS...

I guess you can characterize the early Bible as Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek. The Codex Petropolitanus was written in Hebrew about 916 BC, and the Codex Alexandrinus emerged somewhere between 500 and 400 BC.

However, the Latin Vulgate also was written in the same time frame as the Alexandrinus, 500 to 400 BC.

And, do not mistake my skeptic&apos;s attitude as anti-Bible; the study of the Bible, and its relationship to actual history, is a scholar&apos;s attraction. If you attended past sessions of Alpha you may be convinced this is so; however, I just don&apos;t accept all the Biblical words on faith alone, as some do (not a criticism).

Perhaps you could describe me as a scientific agnostic, truths acceptable as displayed beyond the mere printed word.



EVOLUTION

I&apos;ve been an individual who accepted the theory of evolution for some time, and have had my chuckles at the Scopes Trial records, wherein it is described how the atheistic Clarence Darrow raked poor William Jennings Bryan over the coals so badly that Bryan died within two weeks of the trial&apos;s end.

There were simply many questions put to the witness by Darrow that were unanswerable in the cold light of the trial atmosphere, even though Scopes was convicted and fined, the conviction being later overturned on appeal.

My scientific background was the spur that kept me on the evolutionist theory path most of my life.

I&apos;m having some doubts.

Those doubts were planted by sometime atheist turned Christian Malcom Muggeridge, who was lecturing on evolution. He was discussing a famous book on the theory, which in one sentence destroyed the entire concept of the book. The phrase was to the effect that despite all of the fossil records, and the observable evolutionary effects on some mammal and reptile life, that there was a great blank area in the sequence from ape to man, and that no one had filled this blank to date. The inevitable link indeed was missing.

I don&apos;t really believe that man was actually created by God about 2:30 PM in the Garden of Eden, and I don&apos;t much believe the rib story either, but that Bible episode may have been an allegory, a race memory of man being placed on the planet Earth by someone or something, with the tale providing a neat explanation.

What I&apos;m saying is, that in my desire to have proposed facts proven to me by the Bible followers, I also should have asked for proof from the other side. That large gap in the supposed evolutionary link between man and ape just isn&apos;t there, and hasn&apos;t been found to date. I became just as skeptical of the evolution theory as I was about the Adam/Eve viewpoint. I shouldn&apos;t say the proof isn&apos;t there for evolution, I only mean it has not yet been discovered.

Another question I have is, why haven&apos;t the major life forms of Earth continued the proposed evolutionary trend in the past 4000 years? We have achieved genetic changes in animals, from horses to bacteria, but it didn&apos;t seem to have happened by itself. Why not?

Why has it taken so long to fill the evolutionary blank? Maybe it can&apos;t be filled. Maybe the apes are the apes, and man arrived on, or was put on, Earth to survive as a species for some glorious motive or aim we still have not attained.

I really would like to hear some comments pro and con on the subject; it seems like an argument whose time has come!



THEOMATICS

I would like to see some examples of theomatics; whether or not they point to divine inspiration, or are a manifestation of the laws of chance, will be arguable, but interesting to discuss. Like they say, attaching letters to numbers, or vice versa, can indicate anything. One could utilize the lines of Richard II to prove the existence of field mice on Jupiter, if one felt like going through the process.

But go to it; we&apos;d like to see the theory presented as an intellectual exercise, however, not the second coming of the ten commandments.



SO FAR

You haven&apos;t really explained anything about &apos;theomatics&apos; other than a lot of positional statements that have been made in the past. Let&apos;s hear some meatier &apos;proofs.&apos;

And the first part of what appeared to be some descriptive depth still began with that bedeviled word &apos;If.&apos;

But let&apos;s keep it coming, with substance instead of style on the proofs; logic I can get from the Jesuits.



CATCH 22&apos;S

When you say that living a good life and following the rules is no guarantee of salvation, it occurs to me that if so, it is simply another Catch-22 being perpetrated on us poor souls.

I try to be fair with everyone, but I&apos;m perfectly capable of violent reactions if someone is not fair to me. Does that make me ineligible for the big laboratory in the sky? If so, then the rules are baloney.

In Catholic school, we were taught that Jack the Ripper, had he made a perfect act of contrition, and was given the last rites, his sins all forgiven, would be saved and go to heaven. Likewise Joe Stalin or Adolf Hitler; what a lot of horsht to be putting into young minds, but they still teach that today.

As I said, white light, red light or nay, I would prefer to believe the Cayce version, and would hope it were true, not having to depend on the whims of an irate God to get to the promised land.

I have read some serious work on the life after death factors, and the temporarily dead coming back and reporting, and am familiar with what the returnees were supposed to have said. It might be true. But it isn&apos;t really at odds with the Cayce theory or the religious theories, it could fit either.

He has made some statements that imply God does want any smart people to question any of his so-called word. Was the world to be composed of simian dummies or an ever-rising human capability? The first is too stupid to contemplate, the second a natural circumstance in man&apos;s attempts to transcend himself.

If the god of the religions really feels that way, maybe he should have stopped after the first flocks of sheep, or the initial tribe of baboons.



NON-CHRISTIANS

You&apos;re being deliberately presumptive for effect. Isn&apos;t it a fact that the religions of the east are most discerning of spiritual matters, and that most Christian churches relegate the limits of their own spiritualism to the trinity and a few angels?

Quit pulling our collective legs; we&apos;re not centipedes.



3RD CLASS SUN

Here we are in a solar system controlled by a 3rd class star, living on the 3rd planet of nine, and having the temerity to say that we have developed a theology that is the true explanation of some mysterious prime directive.

Tell me, is the God of the Bible running not only this planet, but also all planets in all solar systems everywhere, and is the same God to all creatures on those trillions of other planets, or wherever an intelligence can exist?

Just asking...



BOOK VS BOOK

In order to substantiate your viewpoints you are quoting passages from an ancient book.

Why cannot others say their ancient religious books are as valid as yours, and hold that theirs is the true God and religion with just as much authority as you? Outside of that book, how do you know Jesus is God?

Prove without mere quotes that what you believe is so; but, do it without utilizing the concept of faith.



CYCLES

You know we&apos;re not Bible-thumpers over here in the religious sense. But we do a lot of religion-thumping here as part of the service to all. A strict interpretationist takes a stance and the iconoclasts break it down. Why not? It&apos;s not promoting religion as much as a common sense approach to views of religion and not the mechanics of a given creed.



PROVING A PROPHECY

How do you know? What you have said is only an opinion on your part. With a few words you yourself have proved that you can&apos;t prove anything with regard to the &apos;truths&apos; of the Bible. You have a penchant for skipping the difficult answers and responding with a homily; it&apos;s not enough if you want to attain credibility. Why don&apos;t you prove that even one of the prophecies of the bible was unequivocally true?

Insignificant are the bible passages you have quoted at length for a proof that does not exist; all you&apos;ve said is that no matter what is or is not true, you will continue to believe because of your faith.

That&apos;s fine. Just don&apos;t continue the unproveable scripture quotes to try backing up your case; they are merely writings from a long-dead past, portions of which may or may not be true as archeology or history, and not able to be proven in actuality when it comes to the spiritual aspects. Cults write their own histories, and the strength of the cult determines its longevity whether Jewish, Christian, or Islamic.



JOSEAH

Some Biblical questions:

Who told Joseah to take the whore?

Why doesn&apos;t our church offer advice like that?

How did he take her, and in which circumstance?

Where did he take her, and by what means?

Did he keep her after he took her?

Did he bring her back for the deposit?

Who tore that story out of our textbook at St. Bernards? It would have been critical to a comprehensive education. But at least we understood vaguely in those years that in the Bible, almost everybody knew everybody some time or other.

At least when the Ark wasn&apos;t around.



FOR THE ULTIMATE

It&apos;s difficult to prove anything, but proof of God&apos;s existence is the ultimate proof, and according to scripture can be done only after the death of the physical body, and of course in this world belief is centered on faith. The other thoughts you mentioned are of minor importance compared to the proof of the ultimate being&apos;s existing.

Why should you feel sorry for someone who takes the position that he wishes to wait until the time comes for the proof?

I like the approach (which I may adhere to) that, perhaps an all-powerful being, such as God, did in fact create everything, and that He is around somewhere in a place we will eventually see him and understand; but, maybe there is no such God, and all started by a whim of natural forces.

I would prefer to believe the former, but who knows?



FANTASIZING AGAIN

Under what directive from whomever can you proclaim God&apos;s version of life?

Let us know when he last spoke to you about his version of life and asked you to pass it on. Also tell us if there were any chemical reinforcements involved. (Quoting the Bible doesn&apos;t count)

You remind me of the fellow who said he talked to Beethoven all the time, but when pressed, said Beethoven never answered. Is this typical of your own conversations with God, wherein he lets you in on all of his rules and regulations?

You said that Scripture is true whether or not you say it&apos;s true. Then what makes you think it&apos;s true? You don&apos;t really know! All you can truly state is that you think it&apos;s true, but you don&apos;t know for certain.

Your last mush was a prime example of fallicial reason and non sequiteur thought. On Alpha, you can&apos;t fool any of the people any of the time, and if you have any modicum of logical thought you might temper your tantrums with reason instead of blind and mindless belief.

You said you didn&apos;t answer my questions because you didn&apos;t have time. But you&apos;ve used a great deal of space since that time trying to buttress your more than precarious position.

I submit you didn&apos;t answer because you can&apos;t answer, and as in many of your past responses you just fell back on your Bible with a thump, and didn&apos;t care to develop any cogent reinforcement.

That talk was one of the more mealy-mouthed messes of wish-washy I&apos;ve ever seen. I don&apos;t think you really understand the Bible or God, and like some others I&apos;ve see, don&apos;t know you don&apos;t know, and continue to prove that fact.

Look before you leap, and think before you talk.



MARK AND JOHN

At this point in time it could be argued that both Nietzsche and God are correct about one another; the thunderclap could have been coincidental. By the way, have you heard from Matt and Luke lately?



WE WANT TO LEARN MORE!

Many of us in this forum know a good deal about Christianity, less about Islam, little about Indian religions, and least of all about Judaism.

And with ignorance there is generally little understanding, so there is in order some teachings on Judaic principles. You have given us some notable information on the Talmud and its translations and its references, a brief fragment that was interesting in the extreme.

Being the curious type person I am, I (and I&apos;m sure other Alphans) would like to know more. Exactly what is the Talmud and what does it cover? What is the Torah? What are the basic precepts of the Jewish faith? I&apos;ve heard of Hasidic Jews, Reform Jews, Orthodox Jews, but don&apos;t know how they differ from one another. I think a bar-mitzvah is similar to confirmation, but that&apos;s all I know about it. I don&apos;t even know if I spelled it right.

Why don&apos;t you offer a treatise of significance on Judaism and its precepts, its history, rituals, modern beliefs, etc. It would be well appreciated.

We learned as much about Judaism from Fiddler on the Roof as you might have learned about Catholicism from the Sound of Music, ie: just enough to be tantalizing, but not enough to satisfy.



TALMUDIC RECORDS

Although all of your talk was interesting in the extreme (and I hope you will keep up with all the questions), one of the points you made was even more so, that is, the fact that God (if I type a dash then I have to use upper case, and I&apos;m too lazy) asked all the peoples (tribes, etc.) of earth if they wanted to join Him. Nowhere in any of the Christian literature have I ever seen anything corresponding or referencing to that thought (and I&apos;d like to know why they didn&apos;t mention it).

My next question, as long as discussing the subject in general is this: Most of us know that kosher means clean. And listening to a monologue by that eminent theologian, Buddy Hackett, I learned that meat and dairy things just don&apos;t go together, and that if they do, utensils must receive some treatment before they are again useable. Buddy was fairly serious in this respect, telling about his life at home (he&apos;s changed).

But what was the rationale behind the kosher (dietary?) laws. Was it the hot climate&apos;s effect on perishable foods, or a combination of circumstances? You know my great interest in food of all kinds, but I also have an interest in learning, so realize that whatever thoughts you leave on this phase of Judaism will be appreciated by me and all the Alphans.



ZOHAR

At the risk of your becoming the official Rabbi here (not a bad thought), I&apos;d like to have you tell us more about the Zohar or Book of Light. I realize that it takes time to develop these things, so take your time if some research has to be done.



THE TRINITY

I went to Catholic school for 8 years; in that time I never could understand what the Trinity was in reality. Now, I suppose that like a god in the Hindu pantheon, God is God, and Jesus and the Holy Ghost are aspects of that God. Why He is said to have chosen that method of revelation by multiple personality, I&apos;ll never know.

Not while I&apos;m here on earth in this life.



CHRIST

I still like the concept that Christ was an astronaut or an android who was used by benevolent extra-terrestrials to point civilization in a given direction.

Christ&apos;s miracles (technology based, of course) caused some to believe he was a god, which conflicted with the G-d of Jehovah perhaps, and could have been rationalized into aspects of the main God. Where the Holy Ghost part came from I&apos;ll never know.

I said I liked the concept; I didn&apos;t say I believed it; but it would be a lot easier to believe than what we&apos;re told is &apos;correct.&apos;



BOOKS OF MORMON

I think it was mentioned some time ago that the Bible covered only the passage of events here on earth. On the other hand, the Books of Mormon cover more than this, especially in the Book of Moses, Chapter 1, verses 31 to 40.

Now before you start needling me about quoting scripture, chapter, and verse, a practice I usually decry, let me say that we&apos;ve never heard from the Book of Mormon, which has some interesting words.

Here are a few passages:

Enter God:

For mine own purpose have I made these things. Here is wisdom and it remaineth in Me.

And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.

But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man, but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.

And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come, and there is no end to my works, neither to my worlds.

Exit God, stage right!

Now, I don&apos;t think that these intriguing words bear the prestige of antiquity as does the Christian Bible. There is a tale that Joseph Smith (1805-1844), the founder of the Mormon Church of Latter Day Saints, had a visitation by the Angel Moroni who told Smith where to dig up some gold tablets on which were inscribed the Books of Mormon.

I have to be somewhat skeptical about this story, which seems developed to parallel the receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses; but, whomever of the Mormons, or what literary Angel, did write the text, they certainly had more than a geocentric view of the religious cosmos, and absolutely had one which agreed more with the scientific outlooks of the 19th and 20th centuries than did the Bible.

Any comments on this vision of extraterrestrial encompassment?



LIST OF GREATS

I suppose in terms of spiritual influence Jesus did start something big, but of the rest, Einstein had a tremendous impact on the world and its future that overshadowed the rest, an effect that may yet decide whether or not we will return to the stone age, Darwin, Freud, and the rest notwithstanding.

I would have included Newton, whose classical physics formed the basis for Albert&apos;s extension.



PREYER MEETING

It was enough to turn the stomach of any God-fearing American, Christian, Jew, Moslem, or whatever creed.

There were thousands of religious broadcasters and their adherents who were at the meetings of the National Religious Broadcasters Convention which was held at the D.C. Sheraton.

What they called it was a chance for the various religious broadcasters to meet and talk religion, but in actuality it was a series of &apos;educational&apos; seminars on how to increase the amount of dollars flowing into the &apos;church&apos; coffers.

The meetings also were attended by a number of Jewish leaders whose primary thought seemed to be one of pounding home the Israeli viewpoint co-mingled with the sermons of evangelism. And they say simple politics makes strange bedfellows.

Can you believe that there were over 500 exhibitors in the huge, main convention center at the Sheraton. There were fund-raising consulting firms, foreign missions who were trying to get national exposure for their pastors, and all types of religion-slanted sales reps, who pushed items like naugahyde-covered Bibles for special large contributors.

And companies selling state-of-the-art, multi-million dollar broadcast equipment. Nothing like being a poor, country preacher nowadays.

Then, the Evangelist-Israeli tie-up, manifested mainly by something called &apos;The Lord&apos;s Airline,&apos; which said &apos;Support Israel, fly under the rules of God, &apos; etc., etc. The ad said the Lord&apos;s Airline will contribute 25% of its revenue to &apos;the Lord&apos;s Ministries,&apos; which happens to be owned by the Lord&apos;s Airline. Are the angels grounded?

Other exhibitors sold things ranging from Israeli investment programs to Christian feed lots.

But the central theme of the convention was to support Israel, and like the Lord&apos;s Airline said, &apos;We recognize Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel, and we support the Israeli Cause.&apos;

At the &apos;prayer&apos; breakfast, there were about 700 Christian &apos;Zionists&apos; and a few &apos;Jewish&apos; leaders. Among those there were Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggert, Jerry Falwell, Ben Armstrong, Albert Gore, Jack Kemp, Robert Dornan, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, all of whom talked about how Israel was America&apos;s best friend and ally, and deserved all of our support and funding.

No one happened to mention the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty which killed 30 some American sailors, or the atrocities committed when the Israelis let their murderous allies into Sabra and Shatila, or the invasion of Lebanon by Sharon and his cronies, or the vast Mossad spy network in the US which is just coming to light. How absolutely gauche that would have been.

But the love feast between the Evangelists and the Israelis is probably based on that most common of common ground - money, big money. The flights to the holy land will bring in millions of dollars, as will the continuing air-wave appeals to the outlands to keep those hundreds and thousands rolling in.

After the breakfast for Israel, the broadcasters, their good deeds and deals done for the year, returned to the seminars on how to increase their audiences and the donations, scientific fund-raising, how to raise audience ratings, promotion of &apos;holy&apos; type products, syndication of programs, and so on, ad nauseum.

The money-changers are not only in the Temple, they own it!



LETTERS FROM THE EARTH

Mark Twain&apos;s hilarious book, &quot;Letters from the Earth,&quot; is a bittersweet volume of theological questions that no one else seems to have asked - out loud anyway. The book was kept out of print for many years because of its irreverent comment. Dont be put off by the Biblical quotations; they are there only as interesting description, not as proselytization.

Mark Twain surely knew how to bring out embarrassing questions and answers in a most amusing manner, saying what the iconoclasts have been saying for many, many years, but in a delightfully devastating style.

And remember, this is the Israel of the ancient days, not the Tel Aviv of the present, although there may be some associatable parallels.

Two short questions:

1. What did they call the people who lived in Shittim?

2. What was the matter of Peor? Did it have anything to do with Peoria?

Inquiring Alpha minds want to know!



SCIENCE AND THE CREATION

&quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void: and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, let there be light; and there was light. (Gen. 1:1-3)&quot;

The above words, and those of the text that followed, have confounded scholars for thousands of years. Did they really mean that God made the world, and by definition, the universes and the galaxies, in seven days?

Was it true that the world was created at 9:00 am, on October 26th, in the year 4004 BC? Archbishop Ussher of Ireland calculated that as the date of creation, and for a long time, anyone who disagreed with that masterpiece of deduction was considered a heretic.

Even in the 19th and 20th centuries, in fact, even today, there are people who believe in a literal interpretation of the seven day theory, and would fight to the death on its behalf.

But what about the inevitable clash that occurred between the findings of modern science and the language of the Bible? Is there such a gap between the two that can never be bridged, never be resolved in the apparent struggle between holy writ and the sciences?

It would seem not.

Yet, there was one rather effective speaker who provided a rather effective set of views on the concept of Biblical dogma versus scientific knowledge. He addressed the Papal Academy of Sciences in Rome. His name happened to be Eugenio Pacelli (1876-1958), who was better known to the world as Pope Pius XII, and he said:

&quot;When the scientist in the present-day world looks towards its future he is bound to recognize in microcosm and macrocosm that the world is aging. In the course of thousands of millions of years the apparently inexhaustible mass of atoms is losing its effective energy. Matter is approaching the condition, so to speak, of an extinct and scoriform volcano. If then the present world which is full of rhythm and pulsating life has no sufficient foundation for existence within itself, how much less will the world of the past possess it, that world over which the wings of death have passed.

&quot;The further back into the past we go, the richer do we find matter to be in spontaneous energy as well as being the subject of great cosmic revolutions. Everything points to the fact that the material world, equipped with unimaginable great reserves of energy, had its beginning at a certain time. Two questions, therefore, present themselves to our minds: Can science say when the world had its great beginning? And what was the state of the world when it did begin?&quot;

Those same words spoken in the time of Galileo would have caused that learned writer to be cited as a heretical heathen - and burned at the stake. Even as late as 1952 the speech caused a stir in both the scientific and religious communities. Pius XII was heralded by a majority of Catholics and Protestants alike for his stance, except for the staunch, seven-day creationists, who even now appear to hold to their one-week&apos;s-work orthodoxy.



ZEALOTS

To reinforce your capsular comment, perhaps you could define for us those three classes of Christians your implication designated, ie: overzealous Christians, zealous Christians, and underzealous Christians. Are you further implying that one can be &apos;too&apos; Christian? Or are you saying that a mostly Christian life be sprinkled with a modicum of sin?

That&apos;s not what they taught us at St. Patrick&apos;s.

You realize, of course, I&apos;m neither a verse-spouting thumper nor a hedonistic devil-doer, but society has changed much over the last twenty five years in its moral precepts, and much of the change -for the worse, in my opinion- has been due to the attitude fostered by the TV and Movie people, namely - drugs are acceptable in society under some circumstances, extra-marital sex is fine at any age, and if it feels good, do it, no matter the consequences.

Its a question of maintaining some sort of values in the attitudes of the generations growing up. Rigorously puritan America was stringent; however, loosening up too much can turn the nation into a cesspool of morals similar to those manifested in France, Italy, and Sweden today, along with a few others.

It has been said that outside the United States the world is one big whorehouse; the TV and Movie types, exemplified by the sleaze of the Norman Lear factions, are trying to drag the US down to the level of those degraded foreign states. Are those people overzealous Christians who decry the massage parlor mentalities who are trying to alter the thinking of the land to conform to their smut-oriented views of life, that feel a moral family unit is the cornerstone of a healthy nation? I think not.



TV AND HOLLYWOOD HATE CHRISTIANITY

If TV wants to parody the TV hallelujah preachers, let them; it&apos;s the seemingly calculated insistence on portraying the everyday minister or priest, or the minister&apos;s wife, as moral lepers. It&apos;s too much choosing them for a target just for a story line.

Have you noticed any TV shows where the Rabbi and his wife, or a Muslim, are mixed up in a love triangle involving murder? Dont hold your breath. Perhaps there is no malevolence involved, but usage of the warped minister plot is getting lots of usage. And I realize you can step back from the more sordid offerings and view them with a sophisticated objectivity. I don&apos;t think the youngsters can.

Maybe the story is apocryphal, but two mothers were discussing the soaps, and commenting that the first thing the man and woman do is jump into bed together. The 7 year old daughter said that wasn&apos;t true; they have a drink first. TV makes the kids accept the concept at an early age. Too early, in my opinion.



BOMBAST

It was my impression that you were a Christian Catholic, one who believed in what the Bible has to say on matters, text that was developed from the Mosaic Ten Commandments; In view of your comments, I may have been wrong.

It seems to be apparent that your commitment to given levels of moral tone is contingent on your outlook, your definitions of immorality and smut, and not that of others. Like the Supreme Court Judge said, &quot;I can&apos;t define it but I know it when I see it,&quot; referring to porn.

I am neither an avid believer or church-goer in the strong religious mode, as has been clear in the past. But I&apos;m not blind to the line being promoted on the big and little screens, as you intentionally may be, because your particular religious philosophy allows a live and let live attitude where the programs are concerned. The message is getting to you and many others, little by little, that it&apos;s all right to do anything, and that those who decry the lack of moral tone in those programs just aren&apos;t up with the times.

Indeed, I am the first one, as you well know, to crack down on the thumpers and their own narrow visions of interpretation, so your accusations in that vein lack validity; however, I did think as a self identified Christian you also might be against the ongoing smut exposure of the entertainment media.

There&apos;s a summer release movie coming out, where the heroine finds herself falling in love with another woman; is that your idea of a wholesome presentation; do you recommend lingerie shows on 27th street? Or is your attitude oriented towards liberation theology?



SHROUD OF TURIN

That was the most fascinating explanation I have heard so far regarding the shroud - and one of the more plausible. Some might say that the temperature could not have been of a sufficient magnitude to establish crystal formation; however, crystals have been purposely grown in solutions approaching 32F, though growing faster in higher temperatures.

I think body temperature after death would lower swiftly, and that speed in the case of the shroud positive image must have been essential. When mysticism is reduced to science, clarification generally results; this also could be the case with the shroud effect.



SEPARATIONS

When a Catholic church official takes a position favoring such concepts as redistribution of wealth or identification with labor&apos;s goals and ideals, he is applauded by the liberals of the country.

If another Catholic church official comes out against federally funded abortion, the furnishing of contraceptives to high school students, or criticizes any liberal activity, he is castigated by the liberals who immediately bring up the concept of separation of church and state.

Nowhere was the old liberal double-standard in evidence more than in recent comments by Archbishop Rembert Weakland with regard to the Patrick Cudahy strike. When you are a liberal Catholic theologian, you can indeed have your meat and eat it too.......

COVENANT

Say, do you happen to have a copy of that Mt. Sinai contract you described in your last talk? I want to check the signatures. (and I hope God counts on people&apos;s sense of humor)



4. THE PHILIPPINES

The Philippines are in political turmoil. President Ferdinand Marcos, whom the liberals look on as a devil, is up for re-election, and is running against the darling of the leftists, Corazon Aquino.

It&apos;s a no-win situation for Marcos; if he wins, the election was rigged; if he wins there will be a revolt of the people, sending the nation into a spasm of anarchy; if he wins, the communists will take over.

But if he loses, there will be joy in the streets, and &quot;democratic&quot; rule by a woman elevated to a status equal to St. Joan&apos;s by the port-sided press.

Who is Corazon Aquino? Her father was a communist sympathizer for many years, and she has gone on record stating if she wins, she will hold discussions with the communists. She also has been against the American presence at naval and air force bases in the islands. Those who remember little Corey as always having had an anti-American stance.

In 20 years the US will likely have moved out - by communist invitation.

Moderators comments follows:



HISTORY REPEATS

Are any of the Alphans old enough to remember back when Harrison Salisbury and the New York Times, aided and abetted by the Washington Post, puffed up the motives and career of Fidel Castro to the point where he looked (at least in Salisbury&apos;s eyes) like George Washington? We had day by day reports of how this freedom-loving patriot wanted only to unchain his people from the nasty dictator of the day.

What eventually happened was that the Cuban people only exchanged the benevolent rule of one dictator for the typically harsh communistic regime of another dictator, with the attendant circumstances well-known to us today.

The leftist bells of the NY Times are again ringing out a message of &quot;freedom,&quot; on this occasion promoting the Corazon Aquino quest for control of the Philippines. The continuing hatchet job on Marcos is full-blown, with most of the liberal rags of this nation in full howl.

Sound familiar? It will be Fidel all over again if Aquino wins the election, and perhaps a replay of yet another American retreat from a critical area.



MANILA - SAIGON REVISITED

Colonialism by any other name, or any other ism, is only the label placed on an area in which we have interests, with our interests being those requiring service. Subic and Clark serve those interests. What do we get from the Philippines other than trinkets and immigrants? Nothing much! Only the land upon which the bases lie, willing workers from the local people, and lip service from whichever head-of-state rules - as long as dollars maintain a flow, even Marcos.

The situation reminds me very much of the events in Viet Nam whereby Jack Kennedy and his cronies made arrangements for a reigning head of state to be assassinated. Ultimately the US resolve weakened under a Congress that lacked the spine to win, being the cowards that they were, and many still are, until a communist dictatorship was set up in that sad region.

It&apos;s merely another world domino falling to the communist tyranny: Cuba, Viet Nam, Afghanistan, eastern Europe, etc., with seemingly more to follow if we proceed along lines suggested by that famous world (fellow) traveler, Ted Kennedy. If the communist candidate, Aquino, does happen to take over the country, look for every effort to be made in getting our military men and equipment out of the country, leaving a yet another built-in military installation for the communists.

I personally hope that Marcos remains in power, has Aquino and her allies thrown out of the country, and goes after the new Huks with all the fire power available. If Reagan is wise, and pragmatic, he will accept Marcos and not listen to the pink doves of the congress, nation, and world whose only coos are notes of compromise and accommodation. Marcos may be a small time leader, but at least he&apos;s our small-time leader.

The same liberal cum commies are again screeching about the deficiencies of the Marcos government, while deftly ignoring the communist despots elsewhere, led, as usual, by the Salisbury types of the NY Times, and their second class brethren, the Washington Post, followed by the teeny weeny minds of those editorializing for the Milwaukee Journal.

Aiding and abetting are the sleazy types such as Stephen Solarz, whose &apos;great expose&apos; of Marcos&apos; war record got headlines for the charges, and back page space for rebuttals from people who served with Marcos, and were there at the time.

No matter how it&apos;s ground and sliced, it is still another battle between the forces of freedom and the insidious hordes of those who would place the globe under the thumb of the communists. I hope we don&apos;t lose this round also.

Note:

Some might say that the government of Ferdinand Marcos is not free; they would be wrong. I was last in Makati about three years ago, and found business and trade flourishing, from the sidewalk vendors to the huge department stores, with any who wished setting up their own enterprise.

Of course there was some corruption, just as there is in any land that has a system based on free enterprise, and just as there is in the communist countries, although there most of it is marxian procedure. Anyone who has the initiative can make a start and progress to success. Just like it is in the US. That&apos;s the real freedom of the western thought and ideal.



SECRET INFO

If you had heard the last talk, you will understand that the writer has a secret pipeline into the inner workings of the Philippine government, and can obviously back up all of his charges (from 13 hours flying time away) with solid data.

Charges here, charges there, but nothing to reinforce their validity, especially not the venom from the leftish TV, newspaper, and magazine writers and commentaters immersed in the liberal line.

My only admonition to all those who will believe what they will believe is this: Fulgencio Batista was a benevolent but tough Cuban ruler who used a firm hand to maintain control. He was overthrown by Castro with the military-supply assistance of the Soviet Union, and the moral assistance of the ultra-liberal Times and Post, among others. Would the Cubans trade Castro for another Batista? You bet! say the ones to whom I&apos;ve spoken. With Batista, there was always the chance for the good life; with Castro, it&apos;s the totalitarian state and the attendant repression.

We can discuss others &quot;helped&quot; by the US left: Ian Smith of Rhodesia, the Shah of Iran, Ngo Dinh Diem in South Viet Nam, all friends of the US who were done in by the liberals in congress. Now the weasels are at it again, trying to help out Marcos, trying to help out Botha, and by out I mean out.

Who are these people?

They are generally the crowd in favor of lowering military readiness, raising giveaways to the mideast, forced busing for the middle class, abortion, lowered moral standards for the nation, more control on the police department, promoting criminals &apos;rights&apos; instead of victim&apos;s rights, government social programs, and a sort of legally mandated &apos;love your neighbor program&apos; whether you like it or not.

How do these descriptions equate to the world scene? Well, they are part of a segmented mentality, an esoteric scheme wherein each little liberal robot unit does his thing (as they say) for the big world of social justice to come, the day when all men will be brothers and cry on each other in the happiness generated by ethnic and racial togetherness. Hell, it wouldn&apos;t even happen if all men were the same color and all spoke the same language, based on the same ethnic background. And it especially won&apos;t happen by force. But the robots can&apos;t comprehend that.

But, getting back to Manila, I said once before that Marcos is in a no-win situation, and should understand it. Rather than let Aquino and her pals take over by pronouncing themselves winners, as they have done, they should declare, Marcos&apos; people, that Marcos has won and put Aquino on the next boat or plane out.

The US delegation, the catholic church, and every left-winger in the world has already declared the election corrupt, so if Marcos does have a final total exceeding that of Aquino, it won&apos;t really matter - he rigged the votes.

My own hard-right view is this: Rather than let the communists behind little Corazon take over the country with the blessing of sleaze Solarz and others of the US congress, Marcos should insure that he stays in office by any means whatever, and continue to allow the US bases to remain at a nominal annual fee, something that the World Press Review reported Aquino would not (you didn&apos;t read about it in the US press, did you!)

If you disagree, maybe you should have taken the side trip with me to Mindanao, near the village west of Davao, and seen some of the people who were hacked apart by the communist contemporaries of the Huks.

The sounds of execution were heard for weeks after Castro took over, the Idiotollah took over, and wherever the real tyrants took over. But this doesn&apos;t bother the liberals; you have to break a few eggs, you know. If the Philippines go, the squads will be out again having target practice; only the names, faces, color, and language change.

I guess what I&apos;m really saying in this sad tale is that the nations of the world that have more or less freedoms for their citizens, even though some methods of rule or control vary, should still be helped to maintain what they have, and not be overthrown by the forces that dictate misery from the Soviet Union. Reagan began a halt to the process at Grenada. Let&apos;s nip the marxian way in the bud in the Philippines, and continue to slice the stems wherever we can.



PRAGMATISM

Another over-worked word, but one which fits. If you have read my opinions on how I feel that Marcos should take all steps to insure his election, you probably noted that it was my idea of a pragmatic and immediate resolution involving a problem yet to arrive - that after the ascent to power of Aquino and her redvisors.

No where did I say Marcos was anything but what he was, the better choice of two evils. Say what you will about Marcos, his sometime misuse of force and power, his expected, but so far unproved, packing his cash somewhere else, his benevolent despotism, etc., he still is the one I would rather have heading the Manila government than anyone in the wings now. Marcos is getting old, and perhaps, ill; when it&apos;s time for him to retire, it&apos;s my hope that he has a hand-picked successor to carry on his relationship with the US - the critical segment of the situation.

Aquino may be perfectly suited to the governing task - though I personally don&apos;t believe it - and all those cheering supporters having only the ax of complete freedom to grind; but, even if she were elected, my thought is that the military would soon depose her. Machiavelli said that he who builds on the populace builds on quicksand; Aquino&apos;s construction is on that quicksand, Marcos&apos; is buttressed by the military.



FRIENDS OF MARCOS

What&apos;s really happening is that some of the rats not only want to leave the US scuttled ship, but want to jump on the new one as captains. Unfortunately for them, they will be suffered by the left wing forces for their propaganda value during the troubled times and then dumped when the new regime takes over - if it does.

What they&apos;ve done is sealed their own death warrants in either respect. Twenty one years with Marcos is not a record that will bring them any mercy from the Aquino/leftist ranks, and if Marcos holds on (which might be likely because the high ranking military in most cases are tied up with Marcos&apos; destiny), their positions will be precarious.

Marcos, like Nixon, seems to have grossly underestimated the intensity and ferociousness of the leftist forces, not only in the hills, but in his own government, not to mention the congress of the United States, whose mealy-mouthed pronouncements tried to put the kiss of death on Marcos, and then stood back and said it wasn&apos;t their prerogative to comment on the Philippine events.

What the wishy-washy do-gooders of this land seem to lose sight of is that there are no good governments or bad governments outside our shores; there are only friendly governments and enemy governments, and the Libidiots seem to attack only those who are our friends. If there comes an Aquino government, you can be sure it won&apos;t be friendly to the US, but it will be fawned on by the Libpress.

What is the real reason for what&apos;s happening in the Philippines. Simply that it is a part of the communist long-range plan to eliminate United States power and presence in the strategic areas of the Pacific. Certainly there is a leftist smoke-screen in place to hide the real aims, and most of the bleeding hearts have jumped on the Aquino (marxist) bandwagon in their brainless zeal to shape those islands in the democrat mold, but the objective from the Kremlin is a political attack on Subic and Clark, and none other.

The communists are always helped by those with their heads in the clouds, or more likely elsewhere, while the commies are sawing away at their feet. They never learn, if they ever will, until they&apos;re up against the wall wondering why it&apos;s happening to them.



NOTE TO MARCOS

Quote:

If now we examine the conduct of those princes who in our day have lost their states, we shall note in them at once a common defect as regards their military forces.....And we shall also find that in some instances the people were hostile......or if he had the good will of the people he knew not how to conciliate that of the nobles. For unless there be some such defect... states are not lost when the prince has energy enough to keep an army in the field.....

Those of our princes, therefore, who have lost their dominions after having been established in them for many years, should not blame fortune, but only their own indolence and lack of energy; for in times of quiet they never thought of the possibility of a change (it being a common defect of men in fair weather to take no thought of storms), and afterward, when adversity overtook them, their first impulse was to fly and not defend themselves, hoping that the people, when disgusted with the insolence of the victors, would recall them.

Such a course may be very well when others fail, but it is very discreditable to neglect other means for it that might have saved you from ruin; for no one ever falls deliberately, in the expectation that some one will help him up, which either does not happen, or, if it does, will not contribute to your security; for it is a base thing to look to others for your defense instead of depending upon yourself. That defense alone is effectual, sure, and durable which depends upon yourself and your own valor.

Unquote.

Old Niccolo M. sure knew what he was talking about!



GOODBYE CORY?

I&apos;m not Nostradamus, but let me make a quiet prediction.

Sweet little Cory Aquino will have a short, tumultuous life as president of the Philippines. I can see the headlines now:

Corazon Aquino, beloved president of the Philippines, was shot to death by an assassin, who escaped on a motor scooter. It is believed that the killing was ordered by former president Ferdinand Marcos from his palatial estate in the US. The new president (Enrile, Ramos, whomever?), choked back a sob, saying, &quot;Cory will be missed; she was of great help to us all.&quot;

Just don&apos;t ask me for the time frame; it may be weeks, months, or even a couple years. Remember the world is watching through TV eyes, at least until the revolutionary orgasm slows down.

Again, goodby Cory, the generals will weep at your funeral.



POST SCRIPT

Perhaps the initial crack in the wall of the new Philippine solidarity occurred in the past few hours when Aquino released the leaders of the communist party there against the advice of the military. I suppose the next step will be an invitation to the communist rebel forces to become a part of the Aquino government. I hope the US has the fortitude to step in at the critical point and prevent a communist takeover, the real reason for the events of the past weeks. We can&apos;t afford to see a Stalin Bay or a Lenin Field instead of Subic and Clarke.



COMMIE TALK

You may believe what that rara avis said, but I won&apos;t until I see it. And I was incorrect in stating that all of the communists, including the leader of the Philippine CP were let out. He may still be in the slammer, and I hope if he is, he&apos;s kept there until deported.

Gee, why don&apos;t I offer credence to what the commies say? Perhaps some of it may be due to the fact that they&apos;ve broken their word on every treaty ever signed with anyone, along with the reports of the vicious anti-American rhetoric issuing from the Kremlin meeting which is now ongoing.

Gosh! I guess I&apos;m simply a mean, old skeptic when it comes to marxist promise s, except for those that promise to bury us and such - those I believe will be tried, if ever the libs let us get weak enough.

Golly, you don&apos;t think that the Philippine communist leader is different from the nasties in the Kremlin, do you, and he really wants a nice democratic government in the islands? Holy Lenin, Batman, will he make a believer out of us after all?

Wham! Zowie! Pow! Yuch!!!!!!!!



THE MANILA FOLDERS..

More about poor, little Corazon Aquino, the sweet widow and housewife who bravely led the &quot;revolution.&quot;

Aquino, whose maiden name was Cojuangco, is one of the wealthiest land owners in the Philippines. She and her brother own the United Fidelity Bank, a corporate money-center founded by her father, who was said to be one of the original robber barons of the islands, with an advance parallel to the Kennedys&apos; rise in fortune and wealth that was based on liquor trafficking.

Aquino holds controlling interest, with her brothers, Pedro and Jose, of two huge holding companies. These are the Tarlac Development Corporation (Tadeco) and JCS management. Tadeco and JCS jointly own the Hacienda Luisita, a tremendously large sugar plantation of over 12,000 acres, a tract which is described as the richest and largest piece of fertile land on the plains of central Luzon Island.

With Tadeco and JCS, and a number of other holding companies, Aquino owns the Tarlac Distilling Company, Luisita Marketing, the Fidelity Bank, and numerous other lucrative enterprises.

With a background like this why would Aquino pretend to being such an idealistic reformer type? Perhaps it was because of Marcos&apos; 1984 agrarian reform law, which was to take over some of Aquinos land holdings, along with those of other rich Philippinos, and subdivide them for sale to their poor tenants at cost.

Aquino&apos;s attorneys argued that the 14,000 poor sugar workers on Hacienda Luisita were not really tenants at all, but merely laborers who should not qualify for social reforms.

And as for the revolution itself, reported from Manila:

Another factor rumored to be significant in the Marcos overthrow - the Marcos moritorium on debt repayments to foreign banks in 1983, which was extended many times. This brought the big money bankers against him, along with Aquino, along with some officers in his own military who had been pressured by foreign agents to overthrow the Marcos government.

And an unverified rumor had it that because Marcos was adamant in his refusal to hire the mercenaries of a middle-east power to fight the communist NPA, at the request of Washington, he had to go.

So it was a combination of forces, from the bankers, the military, the insurgents, the US media, certain US congressmen, and those he thought mistakenly were his friends, that appear to have been what brought about the downfall of Marcos, not little Corazon, who was, and will always be, simply a figurehead.

It would seem that much of the revolt was orchestrated by the very US agencies who wail about the possibility we will lose Subic and Clark, but who clandestinely offered aid in communications and supplies to Marcos&apos; enemies. We can only guess why.

There will be further news concerning the background of the Marcos deposition as it is received.



15. INGESTIBLES, RECIPES, RECEIPTS

This has been a favorite topic among the A-O group - especially the Moderator. Here are thoughts on selected food items, recipes and receipts, brewing, winemaking, meadmaking, and a bit of vegetable history.

Also described are some edible wild flowers and plants, and the alleged health rejuvenator the pharmacopoeia knows as panax quinquifolium, or ginseng. There are formulas for producing quality cosmetics - moisturizing face cream, sun tan lotion - quickly and easily in your own laboratory, I mean kitchen.

Moderators comments follow:



PURSLANE

That mysterious plant to which we referred is called Purslane, or by its Latin title, Portulaca Oleracea. This particular plant originated in either India or Persia, and has found its way around the globe. The plant is usually about 2&quot; tall, but reaches out as much as a foot in diameter. It grows between the cracks in concrete, but does even better in rich soils - like that of a garden. Each plant has many stems which grow outwards from the center, branching as they go. Near the main root-stock the stems are about 1/4&quot; in diameter, getting smaller at each successive branch. Only in the morning sun will you see the tiny yellow flowers which grow from the branchings.

Why so much emphasis on a &quot;weed?&quot; Well, purslane is an eminently edible plant, and can be eaten in salads, cooked, or as a pickle. It has a very mild acid taste, and a fatty quality, something like Okra. In fact, the eastern peoples add purslane to soups and stews to give them body. We have purslane growing in our garden and floral area, and pick some once in a while for our kitchen.

Another common plant which is deliciously edible is the common Day Lily. It is the plant we see in gardens, or at roadsides, all over the state. The botanists know it as Hemerocallis Fulva. We grow the lilies mostly as ornamentals, but in China and Japan, day lilies are an important food crop. They are used as follows: Gather the unopened buds when they are nearing full-size (get a lot because they go fast). Put them in boiling water for about five minutes, then serve like asparagus or green beans, with lots of butter. They taste great, and have no bad flavors.

If you do try this, your lily-growing neighbors are going to wonder where all their day lilies are going to, but they&apos;ll never know if you eat the evidence - unless you share the secret with them. If you (gosh forbid) ever dig up your day lilies to plant something else, you will find on the roots small, edible tubers, like small potatoes, about a half-inch in diameter by an inch long. These can be washed and boiled rather easily. Anyone else have any edible wild plants of which we can take advantage?



GINSENG

There are a number of ancient remedies of herbal or mineral origin that have been used by physicians of all schools, whether formal or informal, for many thousands of years. Medicines of the informal discipline have been frowned upon by the pundits of medical formality for some time, and it has only been in contemporary times that some brighter people in the doctor business have done some investigating to determine the efficacy of compounds used by the informals.

For example, seaweed, with its iodine content, was used by the Polynesians as a bactericide and a fungicide; digitalis, now used in the treatment of congestive heart-failure, was first employed by an English folk-doctor who got the information from eastern remedial practices.

Reserpine comes from Rauwolfia Serpentina, a plant which was used as a tranquilizer by the Hindus, for treating neuropsychiatric disorders and hypertension; our old standby, penicillin, which is procured from the bread mold known as Penicillium, was used by Greek shepherds, who used the mold to heal their wounds and sores; rhubarb (yup, like in rhubarb pie) was used in China over 5000 years ago as a cathartic (body cleaner-outer).

Also in China, a plant known in Chinese as Ma Huang, or Ephedra Sinica, provided the basis for synthesized Ephedrine, used in many forms today for a decongestant; even Quinine, from the bark of the Cinchona tree, was used by the Jesuits in Peru against Malaria, and they learned its use from the Indians there.

Castor oil was used in India as a purgative over 2000 years ago, and received the enmity of thousands of children in the west who didn&apos;t know who to blame it on; and finally, the gift to medicine, the opium poppy, Papaver Somnifer, which in its finest uses provides relief to millions in its forms of Morphine, Codeine, and Papaverine.

So what has all of this to do with Ginseng?

Just that Ginseng also is in the class of eastern remedies which have been scoffed at by the west as simply another folk-tale product without merit. However, contemporary medical research is finding again that there may be value in the plant known as Panaz Ginseng (Shen Seng in Chinese).

Oriental males have used it for years in the belief that it prolongs life and provides strength and revitalization to those in later years (not me). Studies are ongoing to research the essential substances, and probably will reflect the starting opinion of the researchers, pro or con.

In any case, not too many know that Wisconsin is a hot-bed of Ginseng production in the northwestern area where there are lots of sunny hillsides and oak trees, but well be more specific in another note. If you are interested, Ginseng in various forms is available in health food stores, along with further information on its use.



TO WARM YOUR HEART....

To all you mighty Alphans old enough to appreciate a good wine, and to those younger Alphans who would like to produce a present for their maters and paters, the following recipe for a very tasty wine, at an unusually low cost, is hereby presented:

Ingredients:

1 40 ounce bottle of Welch&apos;s Concord Grape Juice

2 pounds of white sugar

2 tablespoons of lemon juice

1 pack of general purpose wine yeast, or even Red Star in a pinch.

1 One gallon jug

1 water lock, available from a winemakers store, or a balloon

Pour the grape juice into the jug. Heat a quart of water and dissolve the sugar in it, then pour into jug, along with the lemon juice. Fill jug with water to about 3/4 full. Let the mixture stand until it reaches room temperature.

In the mean time, take a bit of the jug mixture and put it in a cup; make sure it&apos;s cooled to room temp. Mix the yeast into the liquid and let it stand, covered, until the yeast becomes very active. It will bubble.

When room temperature is reached, pour the yeast mixture into the jug and place the water lock, or a balloon, over the top of the jug. Set the jug in an area where it won&apos;t bother anything if a little fermenting wine bubbles over. After a couple days of foaming, the wine will settle down. After a week, fill the jug nearly to the top and let it go on fermenting.

It will take a bit, but in time the alcohol produced by the yeast will reach the point where it stops the fermentation. The wine will be clear, ready to siphon into a bottle for long term storage. At this moment, the wine will be fresh and tasty, but a trifle yeasty. Sample it, but let it get a little older.

I have used this same basic recipe with other fruit juices, including pineapple, with success. It&apos;s fun to experiment. In my back yard I have a number of grape vines planted - Concord, Cawtawba, Scuppernong, Himrod, and some others whose names escape me. Perhaps this year I will be able to press and ferment from my own grapes. Using prepared juice makes it much easier.

When you become a more sophisticated winemaker, you may wish to try some of the more sophisticated varieties of wine, using imported concentrates. Some available are, Riesling, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonney, and the like. It&apos;s an interest with rewards in more ways than one.

P.S. When you go to the winemakers shop for general purpose yeast and a water lock, don&apos;t let the proprietor talk you out of the Welch&apos;s recipe and into something more expensive. Experiment first, you may be like us and like it well enough to produce it in five gallon lots; that&apos;s 25 regular bottles.

This recipe was from an article written by the author for Eagle Magazine, May, 1971. It still works well.



RECIPES/RECEIPTS

Did you Alphans know that the words recipe and receipt can both mean the same thing, and can be used interchangeably? Down South they all say receipt, and it sounds strange at first.

But the reason for this note is to recognize that there are many diverse combinations of ingredients, by whatever name they&apos;re called, and can make life a little easier for us.

I&apos;m not addressing food recipes, but recipes for useful household and even garden concoctions. You will be reading some here on Alpha in the near future.

But there must be Alphans who also develop their own homely mixtures, at low cost, and we would like to hear from them. Just everyday stuff from easily obtained ingredients. No rare, untraceable poison compounds, if you please.



YEAST IS YEAST AND .....

The yeasty aspect is in the wine when it first stops fermenting and becomes clear. At this point the wine is a cheery reddish purple, and has a bit of fizz in it. It has a delicious grapey flavor, something like the new Beaujolais that is raced to market every year in the fall.

After the wine has aged, and generally its age is inversely proportional to the degree of personal thirst, it becomes a beautiful dark wine color, and wine not? (Sorry) As it grows old in its graceful manner, it throws off a small bit of precipitate which can be seen in the bottom of the bottle. This concord grape wine has a good share of tannin which means it can age well; in fact, I have wine from this same recipe made in the late sixties, which is top notch.

My greatest problem, when I first began to make wine, was keeping enough of it to age. From the first gallon, I think that after all the tasting was done by everyone, we ended up with a scant bottle to age. It didn&apos;t last a month.

The most fun, after you have a fair supply of recipe #1, is experimenting as described previously, with other fruit juices. One of our best has been apricot wine, a delicious white wine, bottled just a little fizzy, which tastes like a champagne varietal.

And again discussing the concord wine recipe, there are any number of cheap European and American plonk-type wines that don&apos;t come anywhere near the quality.



VEGIES VINDICATED

Speaking of the tomato, it first was found in the hills and valleys of Peru, subsequently spreading to Mexico where the Aztecs called it by the name of Xitomatle.

Of course this mouthful was too much to say three times fast so it became known as the tomato. The French, one of the more foolish ethnic groups, considered the tomato an aphrodisiac, calling them Pommes d&apos;amour. (The French consider nearly everything an aphrodisiac).

Over in the US, however, the Puritans would take no chances on succumbing to this dangerous pomme d&apos;amour, and decreed that for the public safety they were not to be ingested, and in fact proclaimed them to be poisonous, in the same class as toadstools and wolfbane.

Another little-known American hero named Robert G. Johnson who came from Salem, New Jersey, announced in the year 1820 that he would eat 12 big tomatoes on the steps of the Salem Court House, at high noon.

In the crowd which had come to watch over this grisly feat were two stomach specialists with pumps to match, just in case. Bob Johnson ate the 12 tomatoes as advertised, patted his ample tummy, and walked five miles back to his farm. As he left, one of the crowd fainted, dropping his stomach pump to the ground.

Bravo Mr. Johnson! Because of you we have catsup, chili sauce, tomato paste --- and heartburn!



ONE MAN&apos;S MEAT.....

There are a number of vegetative cognates vis a vis poison-non poison, of which mushrooms are probably the most common. Another good-bad pair is poison sumac and scarlet sumac (remember, poisons are not confined simply to those deadly, but any inimical to life).

You know the effects of poison sumac, at least in the literature, but little know is the fact that scarlet sumac has a great number of tiny berries that incorporate a pleasant acid quality to a drink made from them. The indians, and some of us pioneer types, would gather the berry clusters during hunting season, crush them in water, and add honey for sweetening. In fact the concoction was called Indian Lemonade.

While out after pheasants in the fall, a mouthful of clean berries, gathered away from roadsides, are a refreshing treat after some miles of walking. (And I do mean walking! Pheasant hunting is great in southern Wisconsin - pheasant seeing is far more rare)

Just an aside on poisons, the common poisons of literature are effective because they are deadly in relatively small quantities; again, it is little known that the body can build up a tolerance for poisons, such as arsenic, by starting out with very small doses and building ingestion slowly over a long period. Without looking it up, I think Poe many have treated this subject in a short story called, Rappacini&apos;s Daughter. Poor kid. Sad to think of someone kissing a girl and then dropping dead. (Maybe that&apos;s what happened to Rockefeller?)



STRANGE FRUIT

Botanically speaking, the tomato is classified as a fruit. But it is also considered vegetable by the vegetarians as compared to flesh, to wit - vegetable matter.

I was really in luck! Just before I was about to rush out to the swamp for the makings of a nice cup of hemlock tea I read your warning. Just in time! (I wonder why my wife told me it was good for me?) As far as the historical drinking of hemlock, wasn&apos;t it Socrates who was forced by the Athenian rulers to drink himself into oblivion?



KING GAMBRINUS LIVES!

If you&apos;re wondering who the heck King Gambrinus is, then take a look at the statue out in front of Milwaukees Pabst Brewery. Gambrinus is the patron of all brewers, the kind that make beer anyway, not the Milwaukee Stumblers.

But back to business. Archeologists searching the nooks and crannies of the dig at Babylon found containers in which dried remnants of barley coated the sides. It may not have been Miller Lite, but it had been beer!

And in honor of all the brewers that have made people&apos;s lives happier throughout history, Alpha is presenting at this time an easy recipe for a simple, but good, beer that can be made at home. You will end up with about 20 quarts or about fifty 12 ounce bottles, but I&apos;ll tell you right now that there is a lot less mess making the quart sizes.

Here is what you need for the cheapest, simplest recipe:

1 Can Malt Extract with hops added.

5 Pounds regular sugar

1 Pack lager beer yeast

Equipment is as follows:

1 Ten gallon plastic garbage can (new)

1 Five gallon glass bottle

1 Air lock to fit above bottle

1 Bottle capper, and some caps, which are cheap

And some small plastic hose for racking and bottle filling, a kettle, and a cool place to let the beer age, or lager as we say in the Reich!

Get your mother&apos;s or wife&apos;s big blue canning kettle; fill with four gallons of water, add the malt extract and the sugar, and simmer it on the stove for about 45 minutes. Let it cool and put it into the garbage pail. In the mean time, take a bit of the mixture, cool it down, and add a pack of that lager beer yeast you bought. This is in a separate cup. In a short time it will begin to foam up.

Add the yeast to the cooled-off mixture, which is known as &quot;wort&quot; and mix it in well. Place the can down in the basement, in a cool place, and put a clean towel over the top to keep out extraneous material. By the next morning you will see a layer of white foam on top. This foam should be removed with a big spoon in the morning and evening; it is bitter and should not be allowed to fall into the fermenting beer. A little bit won&apos;t hurt.

In 4 or 5 days the foam will no longer be seen on the top of the wort. At this time you can add water to bring the total up to five gallons. After two more days you will be ready to rack the beer and put it into the five gallon bottle.

Carefully siphon the beer into the bottle with the plastic hose. If you lose any, make it up with cool water. Cover the bottle with a cloth to keep the light away and let the beer ferment out until it is clear and not bubbling any more. This will take about three weeks, but we&apos;re not in a hurry.

When activity has stopped and the beer is clear we are ready to bottle.

Wash the quart bottles out with chlorox and hot water so they are sterile. Rinse them very well. Cleanliness is the watchword.

In each of the 20 quart bottles, insert one teaspoon of white sugar. Then siphon the beer into the bottle, letting it foam up just over the top to keep out the air. Have someone capping the bottles as you are filling. When you fill all the bottles, put them in a cool place and let them age.



As I said, this is the simplest recipe for brewing your own beer, and also the cheapest. As you become more proficient in brewing, you may wish to try other types of beer, the ingredients for which you can purchase at a winemaker&apos;s shop, generally. If you wish, you can add a bag of dried hops or a spoon of hop oil to your first batch. You could even add some gypsum if you want, which smooths out the taste. Just remember this about home brewed beer - the longer it ages the better it is.

And that little bit of sugar you put in the bottle will be acted on by the residual yeast just enough to give you perfect carbonation.

 

One thing I should have mentioned along with the wine recipe: call the Federal Alcohol Tobacco&amp;Tax Division for a free permit application to make beer or wine at home. It&apos;s one of the few good things free from Uncle Sam.

If you have any questions, just ask.

P.S. Her canning kettle may only be 3 gallons in size; that&apos;s all right, you can make up with water after boiling and transferring to the plastic pail.

P.P.S. When you rack from the plastic pail to the bottle, try not to get yeast from the bottom of the pail into the bottle. There will be enough yeast in the fermenting wort to keep you going.

One final note, after your beer ferments in the bottle to provide the carbonation, there will be a very thin layer of yeast at the bottom of the bottle. If you decant carefully, you won&apos;t get any in your glass; if you don&apos;t care, go ahead and drink it, it&apos;s good for you anyway!



TO KEEP ONE WARM

Hot coffee hasn&apos;t been around forever, and may have started becoming a popular beverage a bit over 320 years ago, judging from this advertisement in the London Publick Adviser, which said: In Bartholomew Lane, the drink called Coffee, which is a very Wholesome and Physical drink, having many excellent virtues, closes the orifice of the stomach, fortifies the heat within, quickeneth the Spirits, maketh the heart lightsome, is good against Eyesores, Coughs, Colds, Rhumes, Dropsy, Gout, Scurvy, King&apos;s Evil and many others, is to be sold both in the morning and at three in the afternoon.

Closer to modern times, an 1880 ad in a Michigan magazine said:

Though love grows cold, Do not despair:

There&apos;s Ypsilanti Underwear!



CREAMED

All of you married, male alphans know that your wives spend a lot of money on makeup and stuff like that, but I&apos;ll bet you didn&apos;t know that some of the more expensive moisture creams cost about $3 an ounce.

 

A lady named Beatrice Traven has come to your fiscal rescue with a recipe for Whipped Moisture Cream which not only works well but is fun to make.

It is, as many creams, an oil/water emulsion: here goes:

Oil phase:

2 tsp beeswax

4 tsp lanolin

2tsp paraffin wax

1/3 cup peanut oil

Water phase:

2 tsp glycerine

1/4 tsp borax

1/3 cup water

And:

1/4 tsp perfume oil of your choice

1 drop food color, red for pink makeup, yellow for gold makeup.

Measure the oils and waxes into a 2-cup pyrex measuring cup and heat slowly over boiling water. Meanwhile, in another small pot, mix the glycerine, borax, and water and bring them to a simmer. Stir well to make sure the entire amount of borax is dissolved.

When both pots are simmering, not boiling, slowly add the water phase to the oil phase. Hold at a simmer for five minutes, stirring occasionally.

Now take the mixture off the source of heat and start beating slowly with a electric mixer at LOW speed. The cream will gradually thicken and start to whiten. When it reaches the consistency of a thin mayonnaise (it will be hand warm, then) add one more tablespoon of warm water, the food coloring, and the perfume, and continue beating.

Now you will see a dramatic change: your mixture will suddenly whiten and thicken into an elegant, firm, glossy cream. Continue to beat as before, scraping down the sides of the bowl. The longer you beat, the better the final emulsion will be, but the cream should be slightly warm when you scoop it into the jar (we used an old Ponds jar). Makes about one cup and lasts for weeks. Most of the materials can be found at a large drugstore; however, the beeswax we got at an arts/craft supply store. This cream really works and is very inexpensive, and as I mentioned before, it&apos;s fun to make and doesn&apos;t require a lab, just non-metallic bowls, a mixer, and a heat source.

How about some waterless Hand Cleaner for the garage and basement?

1 tbsp paraffin wax

1 tbsp solid vegetable shortening (Crisco is fine)

1/4 cup light mineral oil

2 tbsp 10% soap stock (Ivory soap and water, 1 ounce wt. to 1 cup water, fl.

Mix wax, shortening, and mineral oil into a non-metallic pan and heat over boiling water until melted and hot. Add the (cool) soap stock in a steady stream to the oil mixture, beating constantly with your electric mixer on medium. The mixture will whiten and become thick. Pour it into a suitable container to cool for future use. It works!



MORE RECEIPTS

Once we get started on these inexpensive concoctions it&apos;s difficult to stop. For example, good suntan lotion costs a big bundle for just a little - one weekend of tanning and it&apos;s gone. We make our own which is just as good as ski and surf, or sun and shock, or whatever. Here&apos;s how the recipe goes:

Oil phase:

1/4 cup lanolin

1/4 cup sesame oil

Water phase:

3/4 cup water

3 tea bags

Heat the water to boiling and soak the three tea bags in it, squeezing occasionally (the tea bags, you fool), for twenty minutes. Remove the tea bags. What&apos;s left is about one-half cup of quadruple strength tea.

In another medium-sized corning wear type dish, measure out the lanolin and sesame oil, and heat them gently over boiling water. As soon as the oil phase ingredients are melted together, take out of the hot water and slowly add the one-half cup strong tea, beating constantly with your electric mixer on medium.

Pour the tea slowly, in a thin stream, and watch carefully, making sure that the emulsion accepts the tea. If it doesn&apos;t, and some tea appears to be floating on top of the lotion which is forming, stop adding tea for a bit and keep beating until all the tea is absorbed. Then begin slowly to add tea again. Continue this until all the tea is used. When all the tea is in the lotion, increase beater speed

to &apos;high&apos; and fluff up the lotion by whipping it for 3 or 4 minutes. In the final whip you can add a few drops of fragrance if you like.

You now have about one cup of a great suntan lotion which spreads beautifully, feels moist as it&apos;s rubbed on, and dries without a hint of tackiness. It is actually water repellent when on, and will screen out about 50% of the erythermal (burning) rays of the sun, but will allow about 90% of the tanning rays to get through. If you&apos;re extremely light skinned, double the tea bags in the recipe to raise the tannic acid level.

The sesame oil is used because it has the highest ultraviolet absorbance of all the natural oils due to its high polyunsaturate content.

Perhaps this addition to the receipts was a preliminary note of wishful thinking vis a vis the Wisconsin winter; hope springs eternal.....

P.S. If you buy lanolin for some of these mixtures, you can either get a small tube from Wallgreen&apos;s at an outrageous price, or a very large jar at a reasonable price.

HOT POTATOES

Back about 200 BC the Incas were first cultivating the potato. They didn&apos;t know this remarkable vegie would come to be called Solanum Tuberosum, and probably wouldn&apos;t have cared. It was in connection with preserving the potato for future use during the lean periods that the Incas also came up with the first freeze-drying application.

In 1537, an unexpected Spanish expedition headed by Quesada entered the small Andean mountain village of Socorota, scaring the hell out of the populace who then fled to the hills leaving the place to the Spaniards. Quesada and his men found corn and beans, and also a weird looking vegetable that was of various colors and sizes. This, of course, was the potato, and had many Incan uses. Raw slices were placed on fractures, rubbed into the head to ease headaches, rubbed on the skin to cure disorders, worn to prevent rheumatism, and eaten raw to stop indigestion.

The Incas called the potato by different names, &quot;Knife-breaker,&quot; &quot;Human Head,&quot; &quot;Red Mother,&quot; and the one with a red inside was called &quot;Weeps blood for the Incas.&quot; The usual name for this plant was &quot;papa,&quot; meaning tuber, but the Spanish soldiers called it &quot;turma de tierra,&quot; or the truffle. In Spain today the potato is papa, or on occasion patata. The English term potato is a variation of &quot;batata,&quot; West Indian for sweet potato.

When the potato was brought into Europe about 400 years ago it was objected to vigorously. Because it wasn&apos;t listed in the Bible it was considered unfit for human use. Like the tomato, it was a member of the deadly nightshade family and thought poisonous, and it was not grown from seed, thus was thought evil. French scientists said it would destroy the soil in which it was grown and would cause leprosy, syphilis, and scrofula. As usual, some French also said it was an aphrodisiac. The Soviets, just as stupid as they are now, would rather have died of starvation than plant that poisonous, sexually unclean, vegetable.

History implies that the potato was first introduced into Europe by a Spanish monk, Herinymus Cardan, but may have been in Spain even earlier. They were bought and sold in the markets of Seville in 1570, and used to feed hospital patients in 1573.

In 1585 Italy began growing these tubers, then by Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and ultimately in France. Frederick II of Germany issued an edict that the peasants would plant potatoes, which he gave them free, plus sending soldiers to make certain his orders were followed. In Sweden, the same was done by the King in 1764.

But the majority of people in Europe weren&apos;t very enthusiastic about these vegetables until the great French Chef and pharmacist, Antoine Parmentier came up with a number of recipes. He had learned to love the potato while a prisoner of war in Germany, during the seven year&apos;s war, another war that France lost. But Parmentier did come up winners with his potatoes; he invited numbers of famous people to his home and gave them an all-potato menu, having sometimes as many as 20 courses. Among these guests were people like Ben Franklin, representative of a small two-bit nation from across the Atlantic.

Louis XVI gave Parmentier permission to plant potato fields at Les Sablons, a sandy field outside of Paris. Parmentier tried to give away the potato cuttings but the farmers refused to accept them; however, a shrewd bit of psychology was worked on the peasants. Parmentier asked the King to build a fence around Les Sablons and post two or three guards. This immediately caused the farmers and peasants to consider that these vegies must be of great value, subsequently breaking into the fields at night and stealing some for themselves to plant. In 1663, the British government sent the first potatoes to Ireland, where the people, smart enough not to look a gift horse in the stomach, promptly planted and ate them.

In the United States, the potato was first grown by an Irish colony at Londonderry, New Hampshire, but potatoes weren&apos;t a significant part of the diet because, like tomatoes, the potatoes were said to be poisonous, shorten lives, and make people unhealthy. But after the upper classes used them regularly without incident the others soon followed.

It was only in the last three or four decades that US nutritionists began to discover the value of the potato. They found it to be a source of essential amino acids, high in potassium, making them help the body to utilize protein and retain nitrogen. The content of potassium also allows the tuber to be highly digestive, and also an important tool to treat digestive disorders.

The US Department of Agriculture has stated that, &quot;A diet of whole milk and potatoes would supply almost all of the food elements necessary for the maintenance of the human body.&quot; In another test, a Michigan State grad student went on a potato diet for 22 days in which he ate four pounds of potatoes every day (1300 calories), with cream, butter, and cheese bringing this to 3600 calories per day; he gained four ounces during this period.

In another test, a man maintained excellent health with constant weight of body during a 167 day period in which he ate only cooked potatoes, some fruit, and on occasion some coffee or tea with sugar.

The US eats 122 pounds of potatoes a year per capita, the Germans 374. If the various stuffings are not added to the potato it will not have the fat. Man may not be able to live by potato alone, but used judiciously this lowly vegetable prince can supply a great deal of nutrition and a minimum of fat.



IDAHO HO!

If the preceding was more about potatoes than you really wanted to know, you might want to skip this note about planting a couple potato plants just for the hell of it. It&apos;s fun to put two or three potato plants at the side or back of the house during the spring; you don&apos;t get a lot of crop but you do get some satisfaction. Here&apos;s how to do it.

Buy some potatoes from the garden center; you will need enough to cut into sections with three &quot;eyes&quot; in them for each plant. Put them in with at least one eye staring up about 5 inches deep. If you plant more than one, make them at least 12 inches apart.

When the plants are about 12 inches tall they will have blossoms, and at this time you can put some compost, manure, or other vegetable fertilizer around the plants. Dont use too much. Water the plants well about once a week.

Harvest time is near the first frost, about two weeks after the upper foliage becomes dry. Dig carefully, starting from the edges.

If you like the Idaho type, buy seed potatoes called Burbank. This is a tasty and mealy potato very good for baking. Be sure to get the &quot;certified&quot; seed stock so you know they haven&apos;t been chemically sprayed to stop sprouting. Keep the weeds away.



DEFINITION

In case you wanted to know, &quot;Scrofula&quot; is a tuberculosis affecting the lymph glands of the neck. Eating potatoes grown by the directions of the previous note is guaranteed not to cause Scrofula.

The word tuberculosis appears to derive from &quot;tubercle,&quot; a word describing a small knobby prominence on a plant or animal, a lump, etymologically. So it seems that tuber vegetables and tuberculosis may have had a common source, especially since tubercle is a diminutive of tuberculum, but that may be stretching things a little.



EVERY FOOD IS SUSPECT

It&apos;s not only meats that may be suspect but every kind of food available that we do not personally process. There is no way that the inspection process can insure quality even under the most hygenic conditions, and even then, the food itself may be inherently contaminated (if you care to use that pejorative term) by the chemicals used to enhance growth or flavor.

When you get a box of flour, or corn grits, or barley, there is bound to be insect parts in the material, the level being in accordance with the standards placed in effect by the governmental agencies. If a box of corn meal, just for example, is allowed to stand long enough, even if completely sealed, the residual insect eggs will hatch into larvae. Of course the larvae are edible and nourishing if ingested, but the concept is unspeakable to us Americans.

It may be possible that the meats and grains and vegies we purchase at the stores today are the best and cleanest that have been available since markets began; this does not say, however, that they are absolutely pure and clean.

I think vegies are great, especially potatoes (as you may have noted) and asparagus (not in the Grecian use, though), but I still like meat. Some of my friends are fanatics where organically home-grown, non-chemical vegies are concerned. They ignore the fact that they are using sheep and cow fecal matter to adorn their crops, and don&apos;t even consider the myriad of bugs crawling over everything.

What I&apos;m saying is that you will enjoy life best if you eat what tastes good to you, meat, fish, vegies, etc., and keep the raw material as clean as is possible under modern circumstances. And if the slaughter houses were anywhere near as bad today as they were when socialist Upton Sinclair used them to denounce the capitalist system, we would all be in gastric trouble.



WHERE&apos;S THE CAKE?

To provide some kind of answer to your query, be advised that locust bean is better known as carob, a substance used in food production as an adjunct or substitute for chocolate, and a poor one at that. The carob is an evergreen tree of some sort found in the Mediterranean - too bad it didn&apos;t stay lost!

The guar plant swings both ways. It produces a gum which industry uses for a thickening agent. I say industry because in food plants it is utilized for said thickening, but in paper and textile plants it is used for sizing, or stiffening cloth or paper. You must have seen those cheap cloths that seem strong at first but go limp after 3 or 4 washings. That was guar gum put in to trick you.

Hydrogenation is much easier. It is the addition of hydrogen to the molecule of any unsaturated organic compound to thicken and smooth it. For example, an unsaturated fat is liquid at room temperature, like corn oil or peanut oil. Most chubbies I know are generally composed of saturated fats, but it gives them a wobble of solidity. When an unsaturated fat liquid is hydrogenated, even partially, it solidifies them in proportion to the degree of hydrogenation. Zanthan gum is another thickener that also adds color.

But in line with your question, here is a question for you:

A Sara Lee Strawberry Cheesecake has the following ingredients:

Sugar, strawberries, skim milk, partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening (soybean, coconut, and/or cottonseed oils), cream cheese, neufchatel cheese, enriched flour (with malted barley flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate {vitamin B1}, riboflavin {vitamin B2}, water, whey, whipping cream, corn syrup, sour cream, modified food starch, rolled oats, gelatin, malto-dextrin, skim milk protein concentrate, lemon juice, salt, molasses, natural flavors, citric acid, propylene glycol esters, propylene glycol, alginate, mono and diglycerides, baking soda, vanilla, xanthan gum, guar gum, lactylic stearate, annatto and tumeric extracts, cinnamon, lemon oil, carob bean gum, certified food color, and calcium carrageenan.

The question is:

Where is the cheese cake? (It may be in there somewhere)



I SCREAM

Yes, that&apos;s what I do when I see some of that air-filled sack of flavored chemicals they call &quot;ice cream&quot; nowadays. There is no way to fight it except by making one&apos;s own. Two pints of cream, some sugar, and some real fruit flavoring, plus an electric powered (I&apos;m no fool) mixer, ice and salt. It results in some creamy, luscious, high-caloried stuff.

Some days it&apos;s worth the calories.



SUGAR/SALT

There have been many kinds of roasts we purchased which were either excessively salty or sickeningly sweet. I remember the Virginia ham we bought that tasted as though it were carved out of salt. What we have learned to do is soak the roast in water overnight, or even longer, changing the water periodically, until the sugar or salt is leached out.

Re: Monosodium Glutamate; the material does enhance flavor, but there are individuals very sensitive to its effects, thus accounting for those who get high on shrimp chow mein. The cook should use MSG discreetly, if at all, but I can recall a brand of MSG called Accent, which my mother used very generously on vegetables, which probably accounts for my erratic behavior.

 

HOW SWEET IT IS!

I realize that too much sugar may not be beneficial to the human body but I also know that sugar in the form of sucrose supplies about 13% of the total energy that man receives from foods.

Sucrose itself is it produced at a present rate of 130 million tons a year, of which 60% comes from sugar cane (saccharum officinarum) and 40% from sugar beets (beta vulgaris).

But as the Alphans know, there is more than one sugar.

There are monosaccharides, disaccharides, and trisaccharides, all sugars, not to be confused with polysaccharides which are starches, glycogens, and cellulose. Ribose is a monosaccharide with 5 carbon atoms, and is called a pentose. There are also trioses, tetroses, heptoses, octoses, and nonoses, but most widespread happen to be the hexoses. The hexoses have the general formula C6 H12 O6, have the same molecular weight, and are structural isomers of one another.

Each hexose has a dextrorotary form and a levorotary form, meaning simply that in solution they will rotate a beam of polarized light to the right (dextro) or to the left (levo). All of the hexoses when ingested are converted by the body to dextrorotary forms.

The most important hexose sugars are glucose and galactose, which are aldehydes, and fructose, which is a ketone. A ketone is similar to an aldehyde but is not as reactive.

Disaccharide sugars, such as sucrose, have the general form C12 H22 O11, and when treated with acids split into two molecules of monosaccharide hexose sugars. If you remember the winemaking recipe, some lemon juice was used. This was to split the disaccharide sucrose into glucose and fructose.

Acid treatment of maltose splits it into two molecules of glucose, lactose into one molecule of glucose and one of galactose. In the human body, all forms of carbohydrate are digested and assimilated into glucose (called grape sugar in foods, blood sugar in the body).

Body metabolism of fats and some proteins form glucose which is present in every cell and fluid of the human system. Glucose is the principal body fuel.

When sugar is fermented by yeast, it is a process remarkably similar to the body&apos;s metabolism of sugar. The enzymes used by yeast in fermentation are identical to enzymes used by the body to metabolize sugar.

Unfortunately for some, a difference occurs at the end of the process. When yeast ferments sugar, ethyl alcohol is formed; in the metabolic process of the body, lactic acid is the final product.

So near, and yet so far!



NUTRA SWEET

An article said: Although Nutrasweet is not as tasty in foods as Cyclamate was, it is a far more palatable sweetener than the old standby, Saccharin.

Consumers should not be deceived into not using it by people like Jeffrey L. Bada, who did not provide any reinforcement of his personal views on the subject, and is suspect of making his pronouncement merely for effect.

If the mighty FDA has approved the use of Nutrasweet, or Aspartame as it is chemically known, then the testing involved use of Nutrasweet in both hot and cold situations. More detailed explanation of the Nutrasweet qualities indicates that it takes a temperature of over 250 degrees F to cause the chemical change. How hot is your coffee?



HONEY

I think honey is one of the finest natural foods in existence. In reading about honey for a paper I discovered that we generally know only clover honey and its characteristic taste; however, other honeys have other flavors, as you know, and instead of going into them I&apos;ll let you expound on the sweet and welcome subject.

Dont get the idea that old EA is against natural foods, in fact I have, with Euell Gibbons, been in the habit of trying natural, wild foods, here in southern Wisconsin and up north.

In future discussions I will be touching on some of the wild grown foods we can find around this area. It&apos;s the illustrations that will be tough.



HONEYUK

In followup, I thought I&apos;d never meet a honey I didn&apos;t like until the day the sadist in the health food store gave us a taste of Eucalyptus honey. Yuchhh! It tasted like I think burnt Koala fur might.



CONTENTS

We have discussed previously the makeup of various modern foods, dwelling on the contents, sinister as they may seem. I found another &apos;food&apos; on the shelf that interested me, and I&apos;m wondering if any of the Alphans would want to try it out after noting the ingredients, which are:

Di-calcium phosphate, magnesium oxide, sodium ascorbate, gelatin, ferrous carbonate, niacinimide, artificial colors, D-calcium pantothenate, talcum, DL-alpha tocopheryl acetate, stearic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, mononitrate, sucrose, magnesium stearate, droxypropylmethylcellulose, pyridcoxine hydrochloride, cellulose, copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, starch, manganese sulfate, polyethylene glycol, vitamin A acetate, silica, potassium iodide, monoglycerides, ergocalciferol, and cyanobalamin.

Some lineup, right?

This list was found on a bottle of multivitamins and minerals. Are the tablets supposed to build you up or tear you down? Something should be done for balanced nutrition, but some parents don&apos;t have the time, or even a basic desire to learn. A great example is Flintstone vitamins for kids - hyped like crazy, etc. - until a small group of parents found out that the &quot;vitamin pill&quot; they were giving their kids was 95% refined sugar! The company did everything in it&apos;s power to silence that group - including discrediting them, but the parents were stuborn enough. Good nutrition can not be accomplished through synthetics - Mother Nature still knows best...



SUGAR SOPS

What you said about those particular vitamin pills consisting of pure sugar is probably correct. My question is this: Does that small bit of sugar once a day hurt the kids? If chewing up Dinos is the only way a parent can have the kid eat his vitamins, isn&apos;t sugarifying them a neat way to do it - especially in those tiny sucrose quantities.

I don&apos;t care for the sugar frosted cereals, and I don&apos;t think they&apos;re right for my children (who like grits and eggs anyway); but, a modicum of sugar for a good purpose can&apos;t hurt.

The sugar that makes up honey is still sugar, natural food or not, and it has the same effects on teeth and body. And speaking of honey, we&apos;d like to see you follow up with an essay on the various honey types and flavors; it should be sweet reading!



RECEIPTS

Dont be surprised about topic of discussion recipes for anything except the mundane. Mead is not mundane; chocolate chip cookies are.



CALORIES

Sir, far be it from a nice quiet fellow like me to dispute your school lunch theory, but let me break it down somewhat while slowly typing this:

2 slices white bread: 140 calories 22 grams carbohydrate

2 tbs peanut butter: 200 &quot; 8 &quot;

2 tbs jelly: 98 &quot; 25 &quot;

Potato chips, 1.5 oz bag: 241 &quot; 21 &quot;

One Twinkie: 72 &quot; 13 &quot;

12 oz can of soda, Coke: 146 &quot; 37 &quot;

Totals: 897 calories 126 grams carbohydrate

These figures are based on U.S. Department of Agriculture publications, and are reflected within a per cent by other diet publications.

The data given includes all possible sources of calories or carbohydrates in the foods shown, not simply those for the sugar content. We all know that the lipids and starches constitute much of the heat content.

The point I&apos;m taking issue with is this: 2 cups of refined sugar, according to the USDA contains 1502 calories and 388 grams of carbohydrate; however, the totals shown above do not reflect an inclusion of that amount. I feel that two cups of sugar in that lunch would be so sickeningly sweet that even the kids couldn&apos;t take it. But that might not be true either: all they would have to eat to match it would be six 1.75 oz Hershey bars, not an impossible feat for a hungry quasi teen-ager like me.



SUGAR IS SUGAR

What was stated about the beneficial effects of the nutrients in honey is true, but it must be realized that the two main sugars in honey are glucose and fructose, and in fact are responsible for the 1520 calories per pound of honey.

Those nutritional elements in honey are indeed valuable; however, sugar is still sugar, and there is no such thing as natural sugar and synthetic sugar being different. The fructose and glucose in sugar are exactly the same as the fructose and glucose in the disaccharide sucrose.

I&apos;m trying with difficulty to note, except for enhanced flavor and texture provided by honey, along with the trace nutritional elements, where honey has any less of an impact on the sweet tooth and the body. It would appear that if glucose, fructose, and water were mixed together in proper amounts, and the correct trace minerals added, one would get a roughly synthetic honey. All that would be missing would be the essential oils of the flowers the bees got the honey from. Is that right or wrong?

And returning for a moment to the Flintstone vitamins, wouldn&apos;t they, with their mix of sugar, vitamins, and minerals, approximate a dose of honey?

I really don&apos;t know, and my food science texts don&apos;t go much beyond what has been provided in the Honey Papers. Anyway, let&apos;s maintain the empirical approaches we&apos;ve had in the past by using honey when we can, just because it tastes good, and by your listing the recipe for mead, one of the oldest of the fermented, alcoholic, liquid delights. And let&apos;s hear some more on the different flavors of honey developed by the bees utilizing different nectars from different flowers.



TWINKIE-TWINKIE LITTLE TUMMY...

The reason that our kids have only one Twinkie for lunch (when provided) is that their Mother buys the 8-pack and doles them out singly. Why is it that foods which taste the best are the worse for us: candy, ice cream, soda pop, sugar, pancake syrup - all the things that make life worth living.



PIZZA?

We make pizza from natural ingredients here at home using flour, eggs, salt, sausage, tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, plus any extras we want to add.

On occasion, last sunday to be exact, we bought two &quot;pizzas&quot; from Sentry manufactured (yes, that&apos;s the word) by the Pillsbury Labs. The following is a list of ingredients required for Pillsbury&apos;s production facilities to generate the finished product:

CRUST: Enriched flour: (flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin) water, yeast, salt, soybean oil

Dough Conditioner: (whey, L-cysteine hydochloride) calcium propionate (a mold inhibitor)

SAUCE: tomato puree, water, modified corn starch, sugar, soybean oil, salt spice, beet powder, natural flavor

TOPPING:

Mozzerella cheese substitute: (water, casein, hydrogenated soybean oil, salt, sodium aluminum phosphate, lactic acid, natural flavor, modified corn starch, sodium citrate, sorbic acid -a preservative, sodium phosphate, artificial color, guar gum, oxide of magnesium, ferric orthophosphate, zinc oxide, riboflavin -vitamin B-2, Vitamin B-12, folic acid, vitamin B-6 hydrochloride, niacinamide, thiamine

mononitrate -vitamin B-1, vitamin A palmitate)

Cooked pork

Pepperoni: (pork and beef, salt, dextrose, spice and color, natural flavor, lactic acid starter culture, garlic powder, sodium nitrate with BHA, BHT, and

citric acid to help protect flavor)

low moisture part skim mozzerella cheese

Textured vegetable protein: (soy flour, caramel color)

salt

garlic powder

spice

Not defined:

Spice

Natural flavor

color

BHA

BHT

The question is the same: Where is the pizza hiding? (It could be there somewhere)

Note: That admixture of charms inserted into the pepperoni to protect the flavor is due for courts martial.....the flavor had escaped, making a clean getaway!!

Let&apos;s hear some more chemical examples of our supermarket foodstuffs!

P.S. The sauce looks normal even if &apos;natural flavor&apos; is undefined; we must give credit where it&apos;s due.



MEADY SUBJECT

We&apos;ve been threatening to offer recipes for mead here for some time and here they are!

We can start by providing general directions and follow up with specific recipes further along. Mead is made from honey, and the flavor of the mead may have a hint of the honey&apos;s origin - clover, orange blossom, etc., and the meadmaker can be governed by the honey of his choice (isn&apos;t that always the way?)

General Procedure:

Mix honey with a half-gallon of hot water, bring to a boil and hold there for at least two minutes. Pour into 2 gallon plastic pail, add citric acid and tea, and let cool to room temperature. Add the yeast and some dissolved nutrient tablets (from the winemakers shop, they&apos;re cheap) and cover the pail with a towel. Let ferment for about 10 to 14 days. After that time, pour the mead carefully into a gallon jug, trying not to allow any of the bottom yeast to enter. Make up with water to a gallon. Put a water lock (also from the winemakers shop, also cheap) on the jug and let ferment out clear. When it is clear, siphon carefully into another jug and let it age, the longer the better.....

Now the recipes:

DRY TABLE MEAD:

3 1/2 pounds of honey

1/4 ounce citric acid

4 ounces freshly-made tea

yeast&amp;nutrient

You can let the dry mead ferment out as a still mead, or you can put a teaspoon of sugar in a quart beer bottle, cap it after pouring in the mead, and have a sparking mead, like champagne.

MEDIUM SWEET MEAD:

4 1/2 pounds of honey

citric acid, nutrient, and tea as above. Not recommended for sparkling mead because of difficulty with post fermentation in bottle, which may lead to embarrassing explosions in storage.

SWEET MEAD:

5 Pounds of honey

citric acid, nutrient, and tea. Not for sparkling wines, as described above.

NOTES AND COMMENTS:

Published information on honey and mead indicates that in general honey is made up of about 70% sugar, yeast, bacteria, albumen, and ash. The honey in its original state resists spoilage; however, when dilute with water, forms a perfect medium for bacterial action or fermentation. This is why the diluted mead stock is boiled in the initial stages, to eliminate the viable germs and wild yeasts present. It won&apos;t hurt the flavor.

For those who want a more scientific approach to meadmaking (and winemaking) the purchase of a hydrometer is recommended to allow readout of the specific gravity of a sugar solution. And to guide you in the process, here is a brief table of gravities:

Dry mead: 1.070 specific gravity

Medium dry: 1.120 &quot; &quot;

Medium sweet: 1.130 &quot; &quot;

Sweet: 1.140 &quot; &quot;



Measure the specific gravity of the mead before fermentation, just after it has cooled to room temperature.

The alcohol content of the mead will be about 9% at s.g 1.070 and about 14.5% at s.g. 1.140. With a hydrometer you can predict fairly closely what the results of your mix will be.

One last suggestion is, buy your honey in five to ten pound containers from a farmer who produces it. That is the least expensive approach. Questions?



GREAT ROOT BEER

Perhaps some of the older Alphans can remember when their parents made root beer at home before it got so cheap. The procedure was to take root beer mix, add water and sugar, and put in some bakers yeast. They would bottle the root beer and let it ferment for a week or so, then put it in the ice box or fridge so fermentation would stop. If they didn&apos;t, those embarrassing explosions discussed in the last recipe would make quite a mess.

The problem with home made root beer has always been one of fermentation control. It demanded too much time and effort for the product involved, and there was always that chance of forgetting the fermenting root beer until muffled thumps and brown, foamy liquid provided the irritating reminder.

However, the root beer taste was great! And now Alpha has come up with a recipe for home made root beer which is not only tasty but also low calorie. Here it is:



HOME MADE ROOT BEER

One bottle of Hires or other root beer flavoring (from the winemakers shop)

Nutrasweet flavoring to taste (if you don&apos;t mind saccharine you can use that)

Mix the root beer flavoring with 5 gallons of luke-warm water, add the nutrasweet.

Add some winemakers general purpose yeast to the mix.

Mix all ingredients thoroughly.

Wash and clean about 20 one quart beer bottles. Make a solution of 1/4 cup chlorox to one qt water and use for disinfecting the bottles before the final rinse. The final rinse should remove all chlorox.

Put one teaspoon of white sugar into each of the bottles. Fill the bottles to about 1 1/2&quot; from the top with root beer, then cap (both bottle caps and a capper are inexpensive)

Put the bottled root beer somewhere at room temperature. In about a week the root beer will be carbonated and ready to drink. You don&apos;t have to worry about explosions or leaks because the only sugar is that deliberately put in so the yeast can act on it to develop the carbon dioxide needed for good carbonation.

This is probably the best tasting root beer available, and it won&apos;t last long. The entire family will love it. Because of the action of the yeast, there will be a very thin coating on the bottom of the bottle. This yeast is nourishing, so don&apos;t worry about it, or if it bothers you, pour carefully and it won&apos;t even come out.



HIDDEN MEADINGS

You don&apos;t have to know anything about the therapeutic values of honey to enjoy mead. If you want malic acid in substantial quantities, eat lots of apples. That&apos;s why they call them prunus malus.

If you make mead with honey alone, it will taste flat no matter how long it is aged, but if you like it that way it&apos;s OK. The reason for the tea is to provide tannic acid, which is the difference between mead and great mead, just like tannic acid is the difference between a short-lived, minor Bordeaux, and a Chateau Mouton Rothschild.

The mead recipes that were furnished were by a distinguished home winemaker, brewer, and mead-maker from England, H.E. Bravery. His mead recipes not only make sense, they result in delicious, repeatable, beverages.

Actually, you get your honey from bees and not beekeepers, but I prefer to use the middle-man whether he&apos;s a beekeeper or a farmer who keeps bees.

And, if you&apos;re not the adventuresome type, you can go over to White Manor liquor store on 51st and Oklahoma, and buy some inexpensive, but good, mead made and bottled in Poland. The bottles have cord wrapped around the cap and neck area. (But I don&apos;t!)



PEARVIEW

Any Alphans who have their own pear tree, or access to lots of apples or the cider, may be interested in a coming recipe for making hard cider at home, and also for making perry.

Perry is a fermented drink made from pears, obviously, and is quite popular in Britain. Many people here have pear trees that are attractive at first, but after a few years of eating pears, then tiring of them, and getting even more tired of picking them up each fall,; these persons may appreciate a new way to use all those pears.

It&apos;s nice to have the fruits of your labor in a bottle ready to enjoy during the long evenings of summer.



HALF-FAST FOOD

I didn&apos;t think you were that old, remembering the little old lunch wagon with the rotten food at high prices at the lake front. When they went into the new building they hired some kids not only to wait on people but also to cook the stuff. It seemed like the junior chefs had almost 15 minutes of training. Prices were even higher than outrageous considering the quality of the food. I think that a McDonald&apos;s type place on the west side of the drive, against the bluff somewhere, with parking, and serving all year round would be an attractive solution.

Concerning plastic cups, let&apos;s come up with one that biodegrades within one hour after use; that should allow plenty of time to drink before the container collapses into a pool of jelly and evaporates. Or let&apos;s make the containers edible to the point where they can be discarded almost anywhere for use as food by birds or animals. The possibilities are endless.

Back to the first thought, even a Big Boy&apos;s would be nice where you could sit and watch the lakefront scene, winter and summer.



HOT AND NUTRA SWEET

I only report on what I&apos;ve read, even as you; the figure quoted was 250 deg F. And you&apos;re perfectly correct when you say you have a perception of my tendency to downgrade cautionary announcements. It&apos;s really only a perception on your part; I don&apos;t want anyone to be injured unnecessarily from any new product. I can only relate my own experience if I have used the item personally.

Except for the patronizing admonishments, that appeared to be a sensible treatise on your part. How do you expect to generate excitement if you&apos;re going to talk in such an uncharacteristically reasonable manner? But then again, I&apos;ve only listened up to the Nutrasweet statement.



THE HIVES

No, I don&apos;t have them, but I wanted to let you know we found a farmer who has a couple dozen beehives working for him, located on Sunny Slope road just north of Grange, near Muskego.

My question is, if he does have 24 beehives, how much honey can he safely (for the bees) harvest for market? What percentage of the honey made can he take, if the answer in volume depends on hive size? Do the bees get mad when he takes the honey, or does he use some special technique?

We stopped the car and got close to the hives, but when we started to draw a buzzing crowd, we left. (No, the hives aren&apos;t right on Sunny Slope Rd., but just west of there a few feet)

One more, are there some operators who are strictly dedicated to honey manufacture, and if so, how big an operation in terms of beehives?



FLYING THINGS

Sir, I took your advice about wearing light colored clothing around flying things and got hit by a raven. Never more will I heed your suggestions!

Seriously, the closest we got to the hives was about 30 feet, close enough for me, and must have been in the flight path because they hummed in on the ILS right past our ears.

In our back yard we have some kind of mud dauber wasp; one set builds the clay condominiums on the garage and the other emerges from an underground shelter; both sting!



HOW WAFFLE IS SOURDOUGH

Why do they call it Sourdough? Tales have it that the old prospectors of the West and Alaska carried a lump of sourdough in their packs so they could make a bread or biscuit dough rise without adding yeast.

Even today, sourdough bread commands a premium price, and is usually a form of sourdough rye, which is tasty but expensive. What&apos;s not generally known is that true sourdough can be made easily and used in the most divine manner of all, Sourdough Waffles!

To begin, we need some sourdough starter. This is made by combining two cups of warm water with two cups of all-purpose flour. After mixing the two in a glass bowl, set the bowl without a cover in a high, warm area of the kitchen. Airborne yeasts will contact the mixture and start a fermentation. When the fermentation is done, there will be a sourish, but clean-smelling dough mixture, with some liquid at the top. This may take one or two days.

This is the sourdough you will use. Before using the sourdough in the main recipe, a half-cup of dough is removed and put into a glass jar having a plastic top. No metal container can be used. This is the starter for your next batch of sourdough. The next batch is made by using 2 cups flour and two cups warm water (85 degrees), and mixing well with the sourdough starter. Put the mixture into a glass bowl, cover it, and it will give you an new batch of sourdough the next morning.

But let&apos;s get to the main recipe for sourdough waffles.

Let&apos;s assume you have your mixture of sourdough base all made and a new half cup of starter safely in the refrigerator. To the base add 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp soda, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 eggs, and 1/4 cup shortening or cooking oil. Also add a little flour to thicken the batter for your brand of waffle iron.

Cook the waffles according to waffle iron directions. I guarantee they will be the best waffles you ever ate! If you like the taste of Belgian waffles, add a tablespoon of malt extract to the recipe. Eat with honey or pure maple syrup, or even regular syrup; these waffles even taste good just plain.

For variation, we get a can of wild blueberries from Sentry, drain them, and mix them in the waffle batter. Ambrosia!!!

And if a certain Alphan can come up with his own variation on the basic

recipe, he is free to call it Rob&apos;s Waffles. A teaspoon of vanilla in the batter will give it a fine aroma.

One thing I must add is that if you, as we, have a waffle iron that produces rectangular waffles instead of round waffles, it&apos;s easy to make a double or triple batch for freezing and subsequent toasting. Very convenient, and far superior to the store-bought kind.



LUSCIOUS LAMB

When I saw the word lamb in the list of things we eat less of (that is some of us) it set the recipe machine sequence into action, culminating in yet another Alphan special receipt.

I guess the usual way to prepare leg of lamb is to trim it, slit at

appropriate spots and insert garlic pieces, and then bake to the required

temperature.

Here is a very tasty way:

Procure a nice, big leg of lamb from your store, and have the butcher slice it into 1&quot; wide slices.

Make a marinade of 3/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 3 cloves of garlic. Put them in the blender and liquefy. Put the sliced lamb into a bowl, pour the marinade over it, and mix around until every slice is well oiled. Salt and pepper to taste, and let sit for an hour or so.

When you are ready to cook, put about twice as much charcoal in your barbequer as usual, and let the coals get to the hot, glowing stage. This will offer a much higher cooking temperature than usual.

Place the marinated lamb leg slices on the grill. There will be fire and flame as the oil drips off and the extra hot coals really cook fast. In about 5 to 8 minutes, the cooked side will be very brown and sizzling. There may even be small patches of black; this is ok. Turn the slices over and burn the other side. Check the doneness by taking off one slice and cutting it; it should be pink on the inside. If red, let it cook a little longer.

When the lamb is done, remove it and serve immediately. It is a feast that haut cuisine could never match, and at $2.49 a lb, yet.



BRITS BITS

We stopped at the May 4th celebration at the Bits of Britain shop; they had a gent there dressed as a British guard, wearing the big hat.

Just last week end we visited to buy more pork pies and scones; the last pie went west on thursday. They still have jelly babies, but the little company that had Dr. Who scarves moved to the east side.

There is a publication out called British Cooking, a large hard cover which is available in most book stores, that has all the good British dishes from Toad in the Hole to Bubble and Squeak. You would enjoy it.



MALT BEVERAGES

All of the fermented, carbonated malt-based beverages we know as beer are truly products of their type of malt, so let&apos;s take a quick look at what malt really is.

The Maltmeister procures the finest barley, either 2-row or 6-row, and transforms it into barley malt. This is done by placing the barley into a condition of warmth and moisture, causing it to sprout. The tiny sprout, called the acrospire, is allowed to grow to a length of nearly a quarter inch. At that point, the hard outer shell of the barley grain is now much softened, and enzymes, such as amylase and betalase can be found near the outer husk, with barley starch composing much of the central portion.

At this point the Maltmeister heats the malted barley to halt further growth, and the kernels are tumbled to remove the acrospire. When the beer is to be made, the malt kernel is passed through a malt mill where the outer shell is gently cracked in preparation for the cycle of starch conversion in a device called a lauter tun.

Lautering, as this is called, uses 170 degree water in the process. The enzymes in the barley attack the starch in the kernel, and any other starch used in the brew (rice, corn grits, etc.) and convert to maltose and/or other fermentable sugars.

When the conversion cycle is complete, the water and sugar, now called the &apos;wort,&apos; is filtered through its own bed into the brew kettle. Also into the kettle go hops and other sugar adjuncts such as dextrose or corn syrup, depending on the required brew. These adjuncts are used because beer from pure malt is an expensive product, and generally used only for the best beers, composed of the old German Rheinheitsgebot formula of water, yeast, malt, and hops.

This mixture is boiled in the brew kettle for about 3 hours, depending on product. It is then cooled and sent to the fermenters for a 7 to 10 day fermentation cycle, where the sugars are converted to alcohol by the brewers yeast. The yeast can also be categorized into two groups, top-fermenting, and bottom fermenting, the use of either being dictated by product.

Now I had to tell you all this before I could answer the questions of what is Beer, Ale, Stout, and Bock. I&apos;m assuming that you knew Bach was a great German composer and what you really wanted to ask about was Bock. To that list I must add Weiss beer and Porter.

It almost always depends on the character of the malt:



Type of beverage: Type of Malt:

Lager Beer Lightly toasted malt.

Ales Light to medium toast, sometimes called crystal malt.

Porter Medium/dark toast, beverage taste between stout and ale.

Stout Very dark toast of the malt, almost black, providing a heavy dark beverage, creamy head with small bubbles.

Extra Stout Darkest malt toast, blackish, syrupy, with a creamy head, almost molasses taste, highly hopped and definitely bitter.



When I was at Guiness&apos;s London brewery, I saw the extra stout brew process. The black malt was placed in a &apos;copper&apos; and the wort circulated through the malt for 24 hours. For regular lager beer, the mashing takes about 140 minutes.

In the hospitality room at Guiness we were given pints of extra stout, fresh from the aging tanks - simply luscious.

At the brewery in Ulm, Germany, we got a taste of weiss beer, a very pale beer made from malted wheat. To a glass of weiss beer, the epicure adds a dollop of raspberry syrup, making a rather sweet soda fountain type product with a kick to it.

Many Britons like their ales, porters, and stouts served at a temperature of about 65 degrees, but I like it very cold. The same for the Pilsener beers from Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, which are very light. The worst beer to the American palate I found while having lunch at a pub in Burton on Trent in &apos;82 that was called a small ale. This charade on the name ale was a brew that had been allowed to ferment out so that no fizz remained, and was served at pub temperature, about 74 degrees. It tasted like a glass of beer left on the table for a couple days.

And back to regular beers for a moment, there are three beers said to be the best in the world: Heineken beer drunk in Amsterdam; Hansa Fjord drunk in Bergen, Norway; and Huber Augsberger drunk in Monroe, Wi. And of course, Miller Lite is the best light beer there is, although I can&apos;t remember if it&apos;s because it&apos;s less filling or it tastes great.

NOTE: Ales, porters, and stouts use top-fermenting yeasts; lagers, bottom fermenting. Bock is a lager made from dark malt, bottom yeast.



NUTRASWEET REVISITED

One of the lesser intellectual lights of the Senate Club, Howard Metzenbaum, has teamed up with some private medical interests to ask for an investigation into how and why the FDA approved aspartame in the first place.

They want the FDA to establish a physician&apos;s clearing house for health complaints that are aspartame related, even though the FDA conducted over one hundred safety tests before approval. The FDA has stated aspartame has been tested more than any other food additive in history, and has seen no evidence it is not safe.

Searle said that they would not stand in the way of safety tests if evidence was found to back up claims of health hazard. So far they have not.

Frank Sturtevant of Searle said that they had received 600 complaints out of 70 million users, and referred the complaints to the Disease Control Center in Atlanta.

Here&apos;s a list of complaints and responses:

Adrian Gross, EPA: said aspartame can cause brain tumors in lab animals.

Response: Sturtevant said the study data is incorrect; there is no proof that brain tumors can be induced.

William Pardridge, UCLA, said too much aspartame might cause subtle brain and behavior changes in young children.

Wurtman, MIT, claims pregnant women and young children might be affected by high dosages of aspartame.

Louis Elsas, Emory Med Sch, said if blood phenylalanine is concentrated that irreversible damage and mental retardation could occur in a child&apos;s lifetime.

These were all challenged by Sturtevant.

I guess my question is, were the tests by Searle accurately performed? Is what the adverse opinion doctors are saying correct? If they are correct, why was aspartame allowed on the market by the FDA?

If there must be further tests, let them be run at government expense, and not conducted by the Metzenbaum types. If there is any question concerning aspartame&apos;s safety, let them be answered one way or another.

So far, it would seem, genetic and pediatric researchers are concentrating on phenylalanine, the key ingredient in aspartame, to see if it is causing dizziness in adults, brain damage and tumors in lab animals, infants, and fetuses, and causing children under six to become unusually emotional.

But all they have to go on is their voiced opinions, and no test results.

My personal opinion is that with the chance for huge grants to the research groups, the groups start to salivate, and bark at the same time, trying to get a piece of the testing action.

Then, when they get a tumor in a rat that&apos;s been injected with the equivalent of the aspartame in 500 bottles of soda water, they will chortle in their I told you So&apos;s, having advanced the cause of public safety -50 years. And it may be that same strain of rats that get tumors even when injected with distilled water.



NUTRAGAIN

The source emphatically said that all complaints had been turned over to the government. It would be idiotic for Searle not to do so; think of the media hey-day if they would have been exposed as not doing so. They would have put so much ink in it that it would have been converted to the worst poison since arsenic.

I hope the charges are untrue, but if true, let&apos;s know about it from researchers with no axe to grind. The best diet sweetener in the world, cyclamate, was banned under the stupid Kennedy law because of tests rumored to be sponsored by the sugar industry. I wouldn&apos;t have a difficult time believing that either. They tried to depress the corn sweetener industry also, but failed.



ELIXIR OF LIFE

Another magic receipt!

Stop at Honadel&apos;s applery on 27th street near Puetz (or any other apple farm store where the pure, unpasteurized juice can be obtained) and get a gallon of cider.

Store it in your kitchen at room temperature for about two days, or until it begins to bubble and foam with some vigor.

What is happening is that the elements of fermentation that were in the cider to begin with - sugar and wild yeast - are reacting to make alcohol and carbon dioxide.

When the cider is bubbling nicely, put it in the frig; this will halt the fermentation. After the cider is ice cold, pour out a glass. It will have a wonderful cidery taste, not too sweet, and still be bubbly. This is a drink that so far has not been able to be duplicated by a commercial process. You are the only one that can concoct this ambrosia.

Note: the longer it bubbles, the more alcohol it makes, and the less sweet it tastes. But remember, it will begin to get sourish if let go too long, finally become cider vinegar, which is useful, but not thirst quenching.

Two days is just right, at least for us; it&apos;s about 1 to 3% alcohol.



SWEET RECEIPT

Here is another recipe that exceeds the mundane both in scope and taste, as do all provided in the Alpha forum. Here is the way to prepare that middle east delight known to us through Greek cooking as Baklava - those ambrosia-like concoctions of little cakes that transcend the ordinary.



BAKLAVA

Combine the following to make the syrup phase:

2.5 cups sugar

1.25 cups water

2 tablespoons lemon juice

1 cinnamon stick

Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; let boil for 15 minutes, after which remove the cinnamon stick and let the syrup cool. Honey can be used in place of the sugar as an equivalent.

Procure a one pound package of &quot;Filo Dough&quot; from either an Italian store or a super market.

Then prepare the filling mixture using:

1 pound of chopped nuts

.5 cup confectioners sugar

1 tablespoon cinnamon

1 tablespoon nutmeg

1 cup of butter

Combine the nuts, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, mixing thoroughly.

Carefully unwrap the filo dough, which comes in many layers, and is slightly moist. As you place the filo into a baking pan (2&quot;x9&quot;x13&quot;), make certain that the reserve filo is covered with a damp towel to keep it moist and pliable.

Brush the bottom and sides of the baking pan with butter, and arrange the filo in the pan one layer at a time, allowing the dough to overlap the edges. Brush dough with butter and fold in the edges to make it neat.

After seven layers of dough are in the pan, insert a layer of the nut and spice mixture, alternating the two until the filo and mixture is used up. Some may wish to insert all of the mixture in one layer, which is easier, but isn&apos;t as authentic (tastes just as good, though).

Each layer of filo should be brushed with melted butter after it is put into the pan, as should the top layer after the Baklava is completed and ready for cooking.

Carefully cut the Baklava diagonally to the pan in two directions, making a diamond pattern of small cakes.

Bake at 375 degrees for ten minutes, then one hour at 325 degrees, until the Baklava is golden brown. Remove the pan from the oven and slowly pour the syrup over the Baklava, and let the whole thing stand for at least 24 hours at room temperature. Cover to keep the dust away.

Sounds like a lot of work, but it isn&apos;t. And home-made Baklava is of higher quality than that purchased at retail stores or restaurants, where the price is about 2 bucks for one small piece.



YORKSHIRE PUDDING AND ROAST BEEF

First, procure a 4 or 5 pound chuck roast, one of the cheaper cuts of beef. Cook it in a covered pan for the time it takes to make it tender and delicious. This is the beef phase. But the next part is the delectable Yorkshire Pudding that is not on the standard Milwaukee home menu, nor on most restaurant menus either.

So let&apos;s go!

Yorkshire Pudding ingredients:

3/4 cup of flour

1/2 teaspoon salt

3/4 cup of milk

1 tablespoon water

2 eggs

Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl; add the milk and water gradually, mixing with a wooden spoon. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they are fluffy, then add them to the flour mixture. Put the mixture into the refrigerator for at least a half hour, which means you should prepare the pudding while the meat is still cooking.

When the meat is done, remove it, but do not remove any juices or fat from the pan. Get the pudding mixture and rebeat the batter for a short time, then pour it into the still-hot cooking pan.

Bake the pudding in the oven for ten minutes at 450 degrees; then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and cook for an additional 15 minutes or so until it has risen well and turned golden brown. It will have peaks and valleys over the pan in a hap-hazard manner, and look elegant. Serve immediately.

Note: do not open the oven door while the pudding is cooking or it will detonate and wipe out your kitchen! Well, it may just fall, too.

This is a recipe which is easy, but which results in an outstanding adjunct to the roast beef. The pudding absorbs all the good flavors of the beef and gives new meaning to the word scrumptious.



PABST BLUE RIBBON

One of the satisfying moments in life is paying a visit to the hops storage area at Pabst and simply sensing that beautiful aroma of the humulus lupulus, the dried blossoms of the female hop plant.

One of the primary reasons for using hops was the bacteriostatic action on the beer. At high hopping rates, such as 400 grams per hectoliter of beer, the iso alpha acids from hops prevent or inhibit the development of many types of bacteria which can cause spoilage.

Back in the olden times, unhopped beers were liable to turn sour within a few days, and could not be shipped any great distance. Then, during the 12th century, German brewers began using hops in beer so it would not spoil and found that hops added an attractive flavor. Hops became a permanent part of beer from then on.

Some of the great hops of the world are these:

Germany: Hallertauer, Spalter, Tettnanger, Bullion

England: Golding, Fuggles, Bramling

Poland: Lubliner Saaz, Pulawy

Belgium: Brewer&apos;s Gold, Northern Brewer

Australia: Ringwood

US: Cluster, Cascade, Comet

France: Strisselspalt, Record

Yugoslavia: Styrian Goldings, Saazer

And to travel on, the word &apos;beer&apos; stems from latin, &apos;bibere&apos; which means to drink. Most monasteries brewed their own beer and spread the word for beer throughout medieval Europe. In old High German, the word was boer, or bior, and was transformed to the old English word, beer.

There is evidence that brewing existed as a formal practice over 5000 years ago; a drawing glazed onto a ceramic pot excavated in Mesopotamia portrayed workers using poles to stir brewing vats. The Egyptian Book of the Dead discusses beer made from barley, and other Egyptian manuscripts describe the methods and distribution of beer production in ancient times there.

There is some evidence also that the Chinese brewed a type of beer called &apos;Kiu&apos; over 4000 years ago, making it from barley, wheat, spelt, millet, and rice.

Beer was just one of many fermented products made by man when he found out that yeast acted upon most natural substances containing sugar - grapes, honey, fruit, etc.

In North America the indians fermented corn mixed with water to produce an alcoholic beverage. Moctezuma&apos;s daughter had given such drinks to the invading Spaniards, one such drink was called &apos;Sendecho.&apos;

Various other tribes of the area produced fermented beverages which were named, Chicha, Zeydetha, Zeyrecha, Tesguino, Isquiate, and Pulque. Some were derived from plants other than maize. For example, Pulque, which is still drunk today in Mexico, is made from sap that is extracted from the Agave plant.

A side note to the Mexican accomplishments, the first brewery in the Americas was built in 1544 by Alfons de Herrera near the present site of Mexico D.F.

However, brewing was brought to the highest art form in Germany. A law was established with regard to the raw materials used in brewing there, the Rheinheitsgebot, which said that beer could only be made from barley malt, hops, yeast, and water, thereby producing great beers on a continuing basis.

Unfortunately, there are those in the common market who would have the law changed so their products, cheapened up by the use of adjuncts such as corn syrup, rice, grits, dextrose, and the like, could be made and sold in Germany.

They can&apos;t leave well enough alone!

Anyway, the memory of the aromas in the Pabst Brewing Company hops room has give rise to all of this........

(And in Offenbach&apos;s operetta, La Pericole, the disguised Viceroy of Peru, in the first act, calls for a glass of Chicha, one of the brews spoken of previously, so the method of producing that beverage must have spread throughout South America also)



CROWNTOWN BREW

Kronenburg has a good clean taste, as you know, with a fine hops linger; it has but a small share of the American marketplace but it will grow.

It also costs a lot.

 

The thing to remember about foreign brands is that you may get a fresh bottle and it will taste great (please don&apos;t say less filling); however, if you get a bottle that has been sitting in some un-airconditioned beer depot for 12 weeks it might not be acceptable.

The beer-business word describing that taste is &apos;skunky.&apos;



WHAT&apos;S THE SCORE?

If you&apos;ve shopped at Kohl&apos;s or Sentry you doubtless have been in the butter department and noted that the top grade butter is generally, if not always, 92 score.

And for those who can&apos;t wait to hear how the dairymen score with their butter, here are the facts:

The system of butter scoring is based on points:

Top flavor 45 points

Composition 25 points

Color 15 points

Salt 10 points

Packaging 5 points

Butter that scored at least 92 points out of a possible 100 was known as extra-grade, or New York Extra back in 1921.

So, if a butter scores that 92 points it will usually be displayed somewhere on the package; if it doesn&apos;t make the 92 don&apos;t look for the score.

The reason that scoring came about was directly related to the lack of quality butter in the market. Some dairymen would let the cream go somewhat sour, thinking this helped the quality; others acidified the butter a little to thicken it. Naturally, this approach didn&apos;t help the quality very much.

When Danish butter, a high quality product, began to be imported in 1921, 20 million pounds a year, it forced the US dairymen to begin a program of raising the quality of their own product.

The quality of butter is based on the amount of butterfat content of the cream from which it is made. In 1890, Stephen M. Babcock, of the University of Wisconsin, developed the &apos;Babcock Test&apos; which allowed the butterfat to be measured.

Babcock found that sulfuric acid added to a milk sample would digest all of the solids that were not fats, and the heat of the mixture would melt the fat and let it rise to the surface.

Placing the mixture in a graduated-neck bottle and centrifuging it thrust the fat into the bottleneck where it could easily measured and noted.

The Babcock test is still in use today.

And for those who are just at the end of their patience concerning milk and butter information, suffice it to say that the replacement of cream separating hand-skimmers by centrifuge separators was another innovation which brought the quality of butter to today&apos;s levels.

Always remember that all you butter fans out there!



POISONS

Yes, smoking is detrimental to the health of most; but, when I smoked cigars I really enjoyed them - to the dismay of all around me, except other cigar smokers.

And it occurs to me that there are any number of substances which also could poison in quantity; however, it is the chemicals which alter the human outlook, such as nicotine, alcohol, &apos;recreational&apos; drugs, etc., which are the most life threatening because they are the ones most abusable

If salt water produced a condition of &apos;high,&apos; I&apos;m sure that there would be addicts who would slowly kill themselves on a steady ingestion of the same.

Sugar, a deadly substance - in quantity - would do the same, all that it lacks is the enhanced mental/physical zoom far above what it offers now.

If vitamin A sharpened one&apos;s attitude as cocaine reportedly does, it too would be a deadly substance in high-dose steady quantities - so I&apos;ve read.

The list is long.

Plus, it doesn&apos;t do the anti-smoking forces any good when the newspaper runs a picture, as it did on Wednesday, of George Burns, 91 years old, with his stogie in his hand, smiling.

Neither life nor death are fair.



THE WALDHEIM AFFAIR

Kurr Waldheim was an Austrian diplomat and politician who served as United Nations secretary general from 1986 t0 1992. Waldheim also served in the German Army during World War II. He was accused by some Jewish groups of concealing an involvement with the Nazis, and was accused of &quot;war crimes&quot; in occupied Yugoslavia; however, there was no actual proof, but only allegation. Despite the so-called revelations, he was elected president of Austria.



Moderators comments follow:



ON THE WALDHEIM AFFAIR

What is your opinion on the Waldheim situation in Austria? Do you think that Waldheims participation in German army activities 40 years ago should disqualify him from being elected to high office in his own country, simply because certain pressure groups, who never did any formal combat on either side in WWII, want it that way?



COMMIE HELP

Thats what the nazi-hunters have been getting lately. In several cases what have been identified by some as forged documents were being turned over to our &apos;official&apos; nazi-hunting department (headed by some Sher guy) for use against alleged war criminals here in the states. Many of the so-called war criminals were in fact anti-communist fighters during WWII, and the Soviets in their own inimitable blackguard style are trying to exact a revenge using the Weisenthal types to do so.

I have no argument with prosecuting real war criminals, those responsible for many deaths in non-military situations, but I don&apos;t accept the witch hunters, who break up lives with phony evidence, such as that allegedly used to get rid of Demjamchek, and another senile old man who doesn&apos;t even know what is happening to him. Some revenge.



MORE WALDHEIM

A few random quotes on the Waldheim situation:

1. A highly experienced American-Jewish fund-raiser (who asked not to be identified in print) said, &quot;The charges against Waldheim are petty and dubious....the World Jewish Council attacked the wrong guy, for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time. Edgar Bronfman (Canadian liquor baron and head of the WJC) was talked into this blunder by his aides Israel Singer and those other young bloods who want to compete with the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) and the JDL (Jewish Defense League).

&quot;Singer and his crowd of Harvard MBAs want the WJC to be more like these aggressive and flamboyant groups in search for the Jewish dollar, but they just don&apos;t know how to squeeze the money out of our people. They&apos;re a bunch of amateurs.&quot;

A retired Israeli diplomat now living in the US, also wishing anonymity, said, &quot;Fanatics are difficult people to deal with. They are totally lacking in logic. These people, most of whom were mere children during the war, have no real experiences to draw upon. They have no understanding of life.

&quot;I served at the United Nations and I knew Kurt Waldheim. We had our political differences, but he was not a bad man. We (the Israelis) knew who he was and what he was, as did everybody else. He was not a war criminal.

&quot;Why pick on him now just to make some dirty publicity and perhaps some more money? Where are our ethics?&quot;

3. One of the CBS-TV &apos;60 Minutes&apos; producers said attempting to expose Waldheim as a &apos;War Criminal&apos; on its show turned out to be a disaster. &quot;We simply could not prove the case against the man. Worse than that, however, while we were evaluating the show, phone calls and letters began coming in slamming us for a lousy job. People were asking if we were going to accuse everybody who ever served in the German army of being a war criminal.

&quot;The most disturbing letters, however, were those from (American) World War II veterans and people who fought in Viet Nam. They wanted to know if they were

criminals, too, for having fought in their country&apos;s bloody wars. The audience&apos;s reaction blew everybody&apos;s mind (at CBS).&quot;

4. Mr. Gerhard Waldheim, Waldheim&apos;s son, mentioned that, &quot;even professional nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal had absolved his father of any war criminal charges.&quot;

Asked by a reporter why his father had served in the German army, Gerhard pointed out that, as in the US, those who refused to serve went to jail. He added, &quot;Most of all, I want to dispel the grossly false charge that my father has changed his story repeatedly as fresh information has surfaced. His only &apos;changes&apos; have been to add supplemental information to disprove &apos;When did you stop beating your wife?&apos; accusations.

To questions why his father had been given the Zwonimir medal, which had cited the older Waldheim for being &apos;a leading figure in the command hierarchy against Croation partisans, he said, &quot;Winning this medal required all the effort of a GI winning a good conduct medal. All officers in my father&apos;s unit received the medal, including the medical officer and the staff priest.&quot;



WIESENTHAL ON WALDHEIM

Notes from the most tenacious nazi-hunter of them all:

New York Times, AP (MJ)

Bonn, West Germany -- Simon Wiesenthal, the Austrian hunter of Nazi war criminals, has accused the World Jewish Congress of stirring anti-semitic sentiment in his country through its campaign against Kurt Waldheim, the former United Nations secretary general and candidate for the Austrian presidency.

Wiesenthal singled out Israel Singer, the secretary general of the WJC, accusing him of having made &quot;threats&quot; against Austrians if they voted for Waldheim, who won 49.6% of the vote May 4. He is favored to win a runoff election June 8.

In a phone interview from Vienna, Wiesenthal said that on the basis of documents that had been unearthed by the WJC and others, he believed that Waldheim was &quot;an opportunist&quot; but not a war criminal. He said Waldheim had certainly dissembled about what he knew during his wartime service in the Balkans.

Wiesenthal indicated that he was familiar with the Jewish Congress&apos; evidence against Waldheim, but that he had not seen all of the documents themselves.

But while severely criticizing Waldheim, the 77-year-old Wiesenthal said Singer and the executive director of the WJC, Elan Steinberg, had undone years of patient work for reconciling young Austrians and Jews by aggressively mixing in Austria&apos;s internal politics.

Wiesenthal, who is Jewish, referred specifically to an interview the two Jewish Congress officials gave to the Austrian magazine Professorial in March in which they warned Austrians against voting for Waldheim.

&quot;It should be clear to the Austrian population that, should Waldheim be elected, the next years will be no sweet time for Austrians,&quot; Singer said in the magazine. &quot;Bitberg was bad enough, but it lasted only one day. The action against Waldheim will last six years long.&quot;

Singer was referring to efforts a year ago by American Jews and others to prevent President Reagan from visiting the West German military at Bitberg, where troopers from the Nazi SS are buried.

Reached by telephone in New York, Singer did not dispute the remarks attributed to him and Steinberg by Professorial. But he dismissed the discussion as &quot;a sideshow&quot; and said;

&quot;The World Jewish Congress does not create anti-semitism. Anti-semitism creates anti-semitism.&quot;

Ivan Hacker-Lederer, the president of Vienna&apos;s Jewish community, broadly confirmed Wiesenthal&apos;s accusation, saying television appearances by Singer in Austria had had &quot;a terrible effect&quot; and had improved Waldheim&apos;s electoral chances.

American Jewish spokesmen reacted with surprise and bewilderment to Wiesenthal&apos;s remarks, particularly his argument that the revelations against Waldheim were reviving anti-semitism in Austria.

&quot;If that is so perhaps it is because there is a great deal of anti-semitism in Austria that is awaiting revival,&quot; said Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, an independent body that is affiliated with World Jewish Congress.

Wiesenthal - who survived confinement in five Nazi death camps, and has a long record of exposing Nazis, including a number of prominent Austrian politicians - said:

&quot;Our side must be justified and pure, without emotions. The facts alone are emotional enough.&quot;

Wiesenthal, who has not had direct access to the various documents about Waldheim&apos;s wartime service, said he believed the charges against him were serious.

&quot;I don&apos;t support him, I don&apos;t believe him,&quot; the head of the Jewish Documentation Center said. &quot;I have told that to him directly and I will not defend him.&quot;

End of quote.

Comment: The entire affair appears to be just what one Jewish source called it: efforts by two arrogant young bumblers trying to raise money for their specific organization. And, wishy-washy as Wiesenthal comes across, he is correct in his thought that actions of this sort raise the specter of another wave of European anti-semitism, and for no good reason.

It&apos;s just possible that Waldheim, mostly because of his age, would have had a difficult time winning the election for the Austrian presidency over his popular opponent; the apparently weak charges by the WJC might be the issue that allows him to win.

Comments from other places:

Vienna Kurier: Waldheim knew early enough that over the course of the presidential campaign his military past would be put under examination. Anyone embarking on such a campaign should not expect to be spared. Erwin J. Frasl, 3 April.

Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt: The facts that Waldheim leaves out do not necessarily mean that he was personally involved in questionable actions, but they weaken his credibility. Harry Schleicher, 8 March.

Liberation, Paris: Austrian leaders fear that the accusations may tarnish their country&apos;s image and spawn a new wave of anti-semitism. 30 March.

Corriere dell Sera, Milan: Waldheim is being acquitted by the majority of his countrymen, who are assisted by the weakness of the accusations. Ettore Petta, 4 April.

The Times, London: What is clear is, that a part of Kurt Waldheim&apos;s past is missing. 4 April.

Jerusalem Post: Waldheim was, at worst, a minor war criminal. 31 March.

Globe&amp;Mail, Toronto: The response of former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim to charges that he participated in Nazi war crimes is not altogether reassuring. 27 March.

It will be interesting, June 8th, to see if an outside accusatory force will have an effect on the Austrian election, either by proving beyond a reasonable doubt the truth of the charges, or by not proving them, and assisting Waldheim to win an election he may well have lost - on his own.

WALDHEIM WINS

All one can hear in the background are the rumblings from Israel as Kurt Waldheim easily won an election to the Austrian presidency that he may well have lost. Waldheim should thank the Israelis for guaranteeing his success.

Now, the Israeli dumkophs are withdrawing their ambassador to Vienna for &quot;consultation,&quot; simply to show their displeasure that the Tel Aviv full court press failed.

But, they won&apos;t break diplomatic relations.

Why?

Because Austria has provided a conscientious link between Israel and the Arabs on many an occasion, at Israeli request. And the fact that Israelis still receive reparations from Austria will make sure the link is not broken.

And Shimon Peres, Israeli Prime Minister, said that &quot;murderers should be punished and not elected to high office.&quot;

He may be right, and a good place to start is in Israel itself with Sharon and Begin and others in the government responsible for killing the Arabs who owned and lived in Palestine and taking over their property without pay for it.

And concerning US funding for Israeli military hardware, just this morning on NBC is was reported that the US has funded a $1 billion dollar program for Israel to design and build the &quot;Levi&quot; fighter bomber, which will cost $22 million each to construct. Why have we given money to the Israelis to do this work when our own aircraft factories would handle the job?

Can the answer be that in the upper echelons of our government we have people in place who are US citizens, but have an inflated loyalty to Israel, and see that these type of contracts go to Tel Aviv?

It sure looks like it.



EX POST FACTO

Waldheim revisited:

For those who haven&apos;t seen the story, the Washington Post reported that Waldheim was set up for blackmail by Soviet and Yugoslav intelligence services, who contrived a &apos;dossier of allegations&apos; for the purpose of recruiting Waldheim for their agencies.

Post writers had initially implied that Waldheim was &apos;guilty&apos; of the published charges by Israeli sympathizers in the world, and to augment this charge they tried to establish independent proof Waldheim was actually guilty.

Much to their chagrin, they could not prove that Waldheim ever had been recruited by Soviet or Yugoslav intelligence agencies, who would have had some control of events in the United Nations had they been able to get Waldheim under their thumb.

A Yugoslav official said that the Waldheim File, drawn up by the communist Yugoslav secret police, was &apos;legally unpersuasive,&apos; drawn up simply to blackmail. This view was supported by present and former US intelligence officials. To its credit, after examining the document, the Post concluded likewise.

Remember the outcry that arose from Israel during Waldheim&apos;s run for the presidency of Austria? It was easier for Perez and Sharon to believe communist allegations than to look for the truth. All of their accusations were based on a 1947 four-thousand word indictment of Soviet and Yugoslav fiction, which former Yugoslav chief of intelligence in post-war Austria, Anton Kolendic, said was developed solely to compromise Waldheim. Kolendic, directly involved in the matter, along with his deputy, Vasilije Kovacevic, joined with Soviet Colonel Gonda to attempt using the file to recruit Waldheim.

The Post story describes the evidence supporting charges of &apos;murder and massacre&apos; against Waldheim as &apos;tenuous.&apos;

Why this recapitulation?

Because there is another &apos;war crimes show trial&apos; coming up soon in Israel. It is the trial of Demjanjuk, accused by the Israelis of being a particular prison camp guard in Treblinka.

Demjanjuk is a retired auto worker from Cleveland. His nightmare began when the US Office of Special Investigations introduced &apos;evidence&apos; against him which was obtained from the Soviet KGB. The allegations were proved by Demjanjuk&apos;s lawyer to be faked, but the US courts still accepted it. Demjanjuk is now in solitary confinement in Israel.

Then there is the case of Linnas, a 66 year old American citizen whom the OSI is trying to deport to the Soviet Union based on &apos;evidence&apos; provided by the notorious KGB.

Linnas&apos; daughters said: &quot;Our father has been falsely accused of war crimes. He has been stripped of his US citizenship based on Soviet fabricated evidence, arrested and placed in solitary confinement, and ordered deported to the Soviet Union to be shot without ever having been tried on criminal charges.&quot;

Demjanjuk was Ukrainian, but does anyone remember the nations of Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania? They were absorbed into the Soviet maw after WWII.

Linnas was originally Estonian.

The point is, knowing the Soviet communists as they do, and being aware of their intelligence operations and methods, why does the US allow federal judges to make determinations for deportation on Soviet supplied &apos;evidence?&apos; The Soviets have always been noted for their fabrications in every situation possible. Are our judges so naive they can&apos;t realize this? Or are they simply dancing to the Soviet tune out of provincial ignorance?

Who or what is the &apos;Office of Special Investigations,&apos; and where did they get the power to withdraw American citizenship from American citizens on the basis of Soviet evidence, and deporting the accused to Israel or the Soviet Union for trial, especially when there was no Israel at the time of the alleged events?

It appears that in the fight of some against Nazism and facism, we have a new set of Nazis operating under a different name with the same rules. We don&apos;t need that in America.



HASTY?

Perhaps I was too hasty in praising the Post for its apparent stance on the Waldheim affair. On the NBC news this evening, it was reported that the Washington Post had again charged Waldheim with being guilty of war crimes, and that Waldheim had vigorously rejected the Post&apos;s charges.

The piece was a far cry from that in the morning paper.

Anyone hear any more?

LITERARYAlphans have an ongoing affair with the muses, in prose, poetry, and music. They appreciate Wordsworth and Byron, Beethoven and Mozart, Hamlet and Macbeth, Odysseus and Jason, and Faust in both text and operas. They read; they listen; and, they realize that life would be pale and empty without creative words and sounds.

SHORT STORY

Beneath the velvetine canopy, on the ornately carved bed, the Cardinal lay weary in his last repose. Around him, near the satin coverlet, were the friends and companions he had known these many tired years. Light and shadow from the flickering tapers danced intermittently over the smile that touched the corners of his worn lips. His mind contemplated in a confident serenity his approaching passage to Him for whom he had labored since acknowledging the call, so long ago....

And he had labored. How many the parishes he had nurtured to fulfillment in the name of the Lord. How many the much-needed schools developed, the hospitals built, the programs for the needy in oddly named parts of the world he had brought to fruition for the greater glory of his God!

The unction ritual had been accomplished by the Bishop. The hand of the Cardinal rose slowly in a trembling Nomine Patri, becoming unbearably heavy, dropping quickly as his aged heart surrendered to its deficiencies. And as the saintly man reluctantly expelled the final breath of his life, the mosaic lines of his antique face settled into an ultimate composure.

And, perhaps, the tear-filled eyes of the gathering caused them to miss the brief expression of horror that quickly came and went as the soul of the saintly man left his body and came into the grasp of the gross being who expertly and methodically peeled away the transitory husk and began to feed.

LANGUAGE

Your brief treatise on language was an interesting observation from the standpoint that the sophistication of a civilization or its people is dependent on the number of ways in which thoughts may be expressed.

How else can one graphically describe an event or situation with the proper nuances in a language with limited power? And I do not merely consider sophistication as represented by the high-tech societies. The eskimos, within the limits of their environment, have a flair for the accurate determination of something playing a large part in their lives - over a hundred terms identifying types of snow.

There are other tribes, or groups, mainly in the South Pacific islands, who have a distinct word to relate the exact relationship between members of their group. The Polynesians always did have a wealth of descriptive language capability, much of it based on verbal hand-me-down through the generations.

The Chinese can speak a word, supply any number of pitches, tones, or inflections, and give it twenty different meanings, in some cases. But the Chinese were a sophisticated people vis a vis language some thousands of years ago.

Coming to the point, I must concur with your concept of English as the universal language of sophistication, description, and technology. It is due to the fact that words from all societies and cultures are pouring into the English Language hopper, and with each addition, the language grows richer.



SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI

I met a traveler from an antique land,

Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculpter well those passions read,

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:

And on the pedestal these words appear:

&quot;My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level sands stretch far away.



Shelley&apos;s poem Ozymandias really puts human works into perspective, as does Thomas Grey in his &quot;Elegy, Written in a Country Churchyard. I&apos;m certain that many Alphans know some of the quatrains of Gray&apos;s Elegy, for example:

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,

And all that beauty, all that wealth eer gave

Awaits alike the inevitable hour: --

The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

And:

Far from the madding crowd&apos;s ignoble strife,

Their sober wishes never learned to stray;

Along the cool sequestered vale of life

They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

As you can see, Thomas Gray unknowingly supplied Hollywood with a number of movie titles, and is doubtless spinning away somewhere. Another commentary on life as time was the Persian tentmaker, mathematician, astronomer, and poet. Omar developed a longer poem which came to be called The Rubaiyat, with the English translation done by Edward Fitzgerald. Omar combined this attitude on life with a tolerance for vinous attractions:

Come, fill the cup, and in the fire of spring

Your winter garment of Repentance fling:

The bird of time has but a little way

To flutter -- and the Bird is on the Wing.

A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,

A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread -- and Thou

Beside me singing in the Wilderness --

Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!

Some for the Glories of This World; and some

Sigh for the Prophet&apos;s Paradise to come;

Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,

Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!

Why be this Juice the growth of God, who dare

Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?

A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?

And if a curse -- why, then, Who set it there?

I sent my soul through the Invisible,

Some letter of that After-life to spell:

And by and by my Soul returned to me,

And answered &quot;I myself am Heav&apos;n and Hell:&quot;

We are no other than a moving row

Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go

Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern held

In Midnight by the Master of the show;

These quatrains are not in any proper sequence, but were randomly chosen for philosophic comment; they are part of a much greater whole which many Alphans will find interesting to read, combining beauty, alcohol on a base of mysticism. Now, two last verses:

The Moving finger writes; and having writ,

Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit

Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,

Nor all your tears wash out a Word of it.

And in that inverted Bowl they call the Sky,

Whereunder crawling cooped we live and die,

Lift not your hands to IT for help -- for IT

As impotently moves as you or I.

And ending with the inevitability that awaits us according to Christina Rossetti.......

When I am dead, my dearest, Sing no sad songs for me;

Plant thou no roses at my head, Nor shady cypress tree:

Be the green grass above me, With showers and dewdrops wet;

And if thou wilt, remember, And if thou wilt, forget.

I shall not see the shadows, I shall not feel the rain;

I shall not hear the nightingale Sing on as if in pain:

And dreaming through the twilight That doth not rise or set,

Haply I may remember, And haply may forget.

God, what gems!

Note: Were Shelley, Keats, Byron, Wordsworth, and other great poets around today, they would assuredly find their way to the Alphan meeting place.



BRAHMA

Some has recently mentioned the name of Brahma, bringing to mind a unique poem written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, which suggests the essence of a natural life technique versus a more theological, yet nonetheless spiritual.



BRAHMA

If the red slayer think he slays,

Or if the slain think he is slain,

They know not well the subtle ways

I keep, and pass, and turn again.

Far or forgot to me is near;

Shadow and sunlight are the same;

The vanished gods to me appear;

And one to me are shame and fame.

They reckon ill who leave me out;

When me they fly, I am the wings;

I am the doubter and the doubt,

And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.

The strong gods pine for my abode,

And pine in vain the sacred Seven;

But thou, meek lover of the good!

Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.



More extremely intriguing word weavings by an American poet who was a student of mysticism in many respects. What do you get out of these words? What is the idea Emerson is trying to get across? For the best answer to these questions, the award is a trip to Lhasa for the ultimate in navel contemplation (no return ticket, however).



VISITATION

From the day I had learned of it, I knew it had to be some random cosmic blunder. The perceptible presence of the Artist had been erased by a thoughtless whim of fate, and the fact had built within me steadily a tenor of absolute indignation and irritation.

My concept of justice was outraged by that patently unreasonable and unscrupulous celestial error by whatever so-called power that was. It may have been this particularly strong personal judgement of blatant unfairness in the case, and strong resentment felt, that gave rise to sequential events that sensitives might characterize as extraordinary.

And, a recently gained awareness of the past tragic circumstance had nurtured an obdurate desire to personally visit the Artist, thinking perhaps that any spectral impressions garnered possibly might convey a modicum of solace.

The fey incidents began as I turned from the main highway and made my way in and around the aging town. Moving north to the meeting-place, the radio seemed spontaneously to offer the Bruck violin, continuing on even as I arrived at the destination in obeisance to those beckonings that had existed over a life&apos;s journey, sensed, but unknown.

I seated myself on the granite ledge near the linden trees. It was chill at first, so cold, cold as the monoliths adjacent, but proximity to the Artist cut into the inherent gloom, dispelling it briefly, causing an increasingly spiritual turbulence that culminated in a pre-destined moment of emotional harmonic.

It was a moment solidified in a shard of time in which all the desires and wishes of inevitable rapport transfused for an undeniable instant in such a depth of intensity it could not be maintained, instead gradually diminishing to an ember, a steady glow, appropriate to the mutuality of satisfaction and contentment at long last achieved.

Reluctantly I entered my car, driving to the way&apos;s turnaround, then back through the dusk, guiding the wheels over the ruts and roughness of the seldomly driven path. Again I approached the tiny patch near the lindens where the Artist had waited in her loneliness for so long.

I halted for a brief thought in parting, visualizing the eurythmic grace and symmetry of the Artist. Once more an aura of love and warmth rippled over my being in suspended interval, this time accompanied by a subtle tantalizing portent, a glimpse sans lucidity.

The exhilarating impressions were indelibly enhanced by the lingering bittersweet phrases of Mozart in that most melodiously compelling, but so simply complex romanticism of the fifth violin - played as though She might have played it. I was held in gentle sway, and had to make a conscious effort to break from the peace and solitude of that delightful stasis.

I retraced my way through the town to the highway. The energy and force of the emotional charge surrounded me, moved with me as I moved.

Later I entered the flow of the Interstate, gradually slipping into the typical road-induced driving reverie, ruminative patterns wandering in that contemplative stream of indirect consciousness which is operative even during the mechanical control functions. The cognative effect of the visit, the siren strains of the music, and what I knew had been the silent presence of the Artist, had developed a synergistic emotive impact owning a level and intensity that ever strengthened as I continued on.

And in that almost trancelike reverie came cinematic flashes of swiftly changing scene, almost stroboscopic in imagery, shifting and altering in vivid contrasts of intermittent aspect until softly focusing into a recognizable scene.

It was a sitting room, with a great chair shaped in some baroque solidity of black oak and leather. The windows wore homespun lace curtains, and the settee, but a corner of which only could be seen, was of aqua cast material with a pale overlaid pattern. It was late afternoon; the chandelier was unlit; no other part of the room was discernible.

Over the chair, thrown across as if in careless haste, was a military uniform jacket of blue-black field cloth, with gilt buttons, and a gold epaulette on one shoulder. Across the chair seat was a worn scabbard encasing a saber, the silver hilt no longer new, but a hilt which I knew would well fit my grip.

Although neither was visible in the scene, I knew I was in that room with one very dear, a room bounded by a sweetly feminine strain from bow and string. The chamber pulsed with the joys that intermingled with feelings of affection and tenderness, of poignancy and longing, an impending promise of intimacy and understanding - somewhere, in some time.

The scene abruptly fractured into an unwelcome consciousness of spasmodic beams and discordant horns, of shapes rumbling through the paves of concrete darkness that engulfed all in a sudden intrusion of depression and a realization of loss and unfulfillment - a miasmic oppression that demonically hovered tenaciously about, throbbing in an unyielding and unsatisfactory life of its own. (Apologies to Edgar Allan for that Po effort)

BRAHMA CONTINUED

And, in perusing the Hindu mystic scriptures of late, I noted some parallel lines in one of the Upanishads, but before we get to that let&apos;s take a short look at the oldest and most important scriptures of India which are known as the Vedas.

The are but four Vedas in number, but they form the basis of Hindu faith, and to adherents of the eastern philosophy of that nature are as basic to them as the Bible is to the Christians.

The Vedas are called, RIK, SAMA, YAJUR, and ATHERVA, and each of the Vedas is divided into two sections, WORK and KNOWLEDGE. WORK is primarily composed of ceremonial rites and instructions, hymns, rules of social conduct, and the mechanisms of day to day activities. KNOWLEDGE is made up of the knowledge of God, the highest plane of religious truth, and this second part of the Vedas is called the UPANISHADS.

The literal meaning of the Hindu word upanishad means, sitting nearby in devotion, as a student to his teacher, but it also means secret teaching. Shankara, a 7th century adept, said it meant the knowledge of God that &quot;destroys the bonds of ignorance and leads to the supreme goal of freedom.&quot;

No one knows how many Upanishads once were in existence; only 108 are now found. Of these 108, some are of a few hundred words, some of many thousands. They may be in prose, poetry, narrative, or dialogue form. Some are lofty in character, some humorous. Nobody can tell who the authors were; it is only know they were originally written in Sanskrit.

Shankara, the adept, stressed the importance of ten principal Upanishads. These are:

Katha Isha Kena Prasna Mundaka Mandukya Taittiriya

Aitareya Chandogya Brihadaranyaka

These Upanishads are as familiar to the Hindus as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are to the Christians, or Moses to the Jews. Another Hindu adept, Swami Prabhavananda, includes two more to the list of ten, the Kaivalya and the Svetasvatara.

But getting back to Ralph Waldo Emerson for a moment, he must have been influenced in his thought by the first of the Upanishads, KATHA. His poem began, &quot;If the red slayer thinks he slays, Or if the slain think he is slain, They know not well the subtle ways I keep and pass and turn again.&quot;

In KATHA, the lines go:

If the slayer think that he slays, if the slain think that he is slain, neither of them knows the truth. The Self slays not, nor is he slain.

Smaller than the smallest, greater than the greatest, this Self forever dwells within the hearts of all. When a man is free from desire, his mind and senses are purified, he beholds the glory of the Self and is without sorrow.

Though seated, he travels far; though at rest he moves all things. This part of KATHA goes on and on describing in many words the idea that man need no longer be a slave to his passions, but devout, self-controlled, and disciplined in spirit.

And on a more prosaic note, for those interested for any reason, the glory of the Upanishads is available in paperback from Mentor Books. Much of the preceding was taken from that particular publication.



VIBRANT VIBRATIONS

FIELDS

We move, we sleep, we live, we die in fields.

Our common days and nights are spent in synch

With three-score cycle fields. Our eyes only

Feel raster quiverings that sweep

Beyond a knowing sense. Another field,

Aglow with quanta, smites our rods and cones

With pseudo-reason, as though demon based.

A freak of frequency that washes us

In oscillating c and lambda/mu.

A field, at us, about us, ever up.

In prism field, a charge of perception,

Narrowly twixt the violet and the red,

And on the edges heat and light unseen

That chars or warms according to a need.

Nickel fields below; they wrap us in

An isogonic web we cannot feel,

And cannot see without auxiliary steel,

With its atoms arow, to blindly set

The pole with unequivocable aim.

Sinister fields. The dark, malignant form,

Unseen, unheard, unfelt, unanswerable,

Which uses elementary cosmic rocks

With proton nuclei, to strike us first

And those of meson, gamma, photonic

To spear us effortlessly and again

Till what? Till why? Till everlasting when?

More, then: Fields which draw and nudge us to

And fro, proportion inverse to the length

Away, and gravely reaching from afar

Or near with light and heavy wave

To close as one with sweeping tendril touch.

Fields! Yet do we really know

The impact on the cells, the brain,

A lump of pulsing protoplasmic blob

That scintillation counts the particle

Which strikes the neuron in a cranial path,

Mutating to an upper state, aware.

Fields! Do we but vibrate to their whims,

A flesh harmonic subject to their thrall,

Our rhythmic action subservient

To a cyclic will? Is but our life

A movement in the varying control

Of fields, at fields on fields of fields - and fields?

A GOOD BELT....

Mr. Average Worker got up on this morning in March 2010 after he unfastened his bed belt. He visited the bathroom where he used the appropriate belt, then took a shower being very careful to fasten the shower belt before he turned on the water. At breakfast, he ate more than he should have so his chair belt was feeling tight.

As he got into his car, the automatic straps went into action, securing legs, arms, waist, and shoulders. It was hard to drive that way, but it was better than disobeying the law.

At work, he adjusted his office chair belt to a comfortable operating tension, and began to write. A tiny light and buzzer went on and the belt superintendent came over and made him tighten the belt. Can&apos;t be too safe, he said.

In the lunch room, he waited some time for the auto service to take his order; 30 minutes later he notice the latch on the booth belt was not fastened securely, but what the heck, lunch time was over and he didn&apos;t need the calories anyway.

When arrived home that evening, his wife asked him to repair a cracked window pane. He put on his ladder belt and measured the glass needed. As he stepped down, his foot slipped and he fell, the ladder belt slipping around his neck, strangling him six inches above the ground.

They laid Mr. Average away a couple days later, and if he would have been conscious of what was going on, he would have noted with satisfaction that the coffin belt would keep him in place many years.

In Hoc Beltum Signo Vinces!

SEMITES

I had lunch in Madison the other day with two engineers who happen to be of Jewish and Arabic descent, very good friends, but argue like hell. The Arab was complaining about the fact that Israel wanted another grant of $5 million dollars from the U.S. treasury for 1985, and the Jew told him he was anti-Semitic. The Arab said, what do you mean? I&apos;m anti-myself?

Which piqued some interest in the term &apos;Semite.&quot;

It seems the term was first used in the late 1700&apos;s to describe the people of the Bible who descended from Shem, Noah&apos;s oldest son; however, in these times it is more of a linguistic than a racial classification, referring to those who spoke, or now speak, any of sundry Semitic languages.

The ancient people who were grouped as Semites included those living in Aram, Assyria, Babylonia, Canaan (including the Hebrews), and Phonecia. The most well-known modern peoples speaking Semitic languages are the Jews and the Arabs.

If we can consider Semites as a specific people, and I&apos;m sure we can, their original homeland is not specific. Some scholars feel it lay in southwestern Asia, and some believe it was located directly in Arabia. The latest archeological evidence seems to indicate that the Semitic speaking tribes were scattered over all of Mesopotamia even prior to that region&apos;s start of urban culture. The present belief is that waves of Semitic speaking nomads periodically swept over deserts to the Fertile Crescent.

At this point in time, the Semitic speaking people (mostly Arabs) are in heaviest concentration in the Middle East and in northern Africa; but, in recent history their influence has been extended by the Jews as far as Europe and America, and by the Arabs into the south of the Sahara in Africa, and east to the Indian sub-continent.

The Semitic peoples are credited with inventing the alphabet, and the development of three major monotheistic religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

Going a bit further on Semitic languages. They are described as a family of highly inflected language, and have decided affinities with the Hamitic languages spoken in parts of north Africa. The area of the Semitic language influence is a relatively small part of the world, with the Mediterranean sea as a western boundary, the Euphrates river on the east, the Taurus mountains on the north, and the Indian Ocean to the south. It is because of this area of limitation that the different Semitic tongues are more closely akin to each other than the Indo-European languages.

Characteristics of the Semitic languages are: Root words having three consonants, using prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and inflectional endings to denote the precise variations in word meaning. There is substantial agreement in the development of noun and verb, and the use of consonants only -such as h, n, sh, and t - to form prefixes and suffixes.

Three distinct forms of Semitic writing exist: the cuneiformic characters of Assyria and Babylonia, originating from pictographs, and gradually becoming wedge-shaped in time; the North Semitic alphabet, which evolved into the Aramaic and North Arabic alphabets; and the alphabet of the southern Semites which was utilized by the Himyarites, Minaeans, and the Sabaeans, with the Ethiopic alphabet being subsequently derived from the latter three.

Of the Semite language groups, Babylonian-Assyrian provides the bulk of the ancient literature. Aramaic was probably the most wide-spread in use, found over most of the range of Semitic speech. Of the Phonecian and Hebrew languages, Hebrew became the more important of the two.

The primary representative of the southern area of Semitic language influence is Arabic. It has exceeded all other Semitic tongues in the breath of its impact on the middle-east area. Ethiopian literature was written in the now-dead &apos;Geez&apos; language, and dates from the introduction of the Christian religion in the 4th century A.D. It is specifically religious, and consists mostly of homilies, devotional verse, and the lives of Saints. It is one of the more obscure Semite languages.

I would be please to demonstrate the writings of the various Semitic languages in this arena, and the appearance of cuneiform, Hebrew, and Arabic, it would give my computer a nervous breakdown trying to write the lecture notes.



TO BE, OR NOT TO BE:

Even though Hamlet might be considered somewhat of a wishy-washy wimp in these modern times, the soliloquy he discourses in Act III, Scene 1, has to be one of the greatest passages in English literature, and even if we don&apos;t read Shakespeare for light enjoyment, we can sympathize with Hamlet at this stage of the play when he contemplates suicide.

Almost everyone knows the line, To be or not to be....etc., but few have knowledge of the rest, and in the Alphan tradition of thrusting culture upon you, like it or no, here is the entire soliloquy:

Enter Hamlet]

To be, or not to be: that is the question:

Whether &apos;tis nobler in the mind to suffer

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;

No more; and by a sleep to say we end

The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to, &apos;tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wish&apos;d. To die, to sleep;

To sleep: perchance to dream: aye, there&apos;s the rub;

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,

When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,

Must give us pause: there&apos;s the respect

That makes calamity of so long life;

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

The oppressor&apos;s wrong, the proud man&apos;s contumely,

The pangs of despised love, the law&apos;s delay,

The insolence of office, and the spurns

That patient merit of the unworthy takes,

When he himself might his quietus make

With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,

To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

But that the dread of something after death,

The undiscover&apos;d country from whose bourn

No traveler returns, puzzles the will,

And makes us rather bear those ills we have

Than fly to others that we know not of?

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,

And thus the native hue of resolution

Is sickled o&apos;er with the pale cast of moment

With this regard their currents turn awry

And lose the name of action......

In many ways, Hamlet acts like everyman, weak and vacillating one moment, strong and forceful in another. But even though toying with the notion of self-destruction in this instance, he has the resolve to play out the line of vengeance to the end....



MOVIES

I think we have been educated to the point where fantasy and science fiction movies can be taken in stride. Television has helped a lot, and in fact was the forerunner to the technically and artistically commendable movies of today, like Star Wars, for example.

What must such a novel need today to establish a candidacy for moviedom? The days of the BEM&apos;s (bug-eyed monsters) are long gone. The almost humans of today&apos;s flicks are far more sophisticated. For a movie, I want a novel with intelligent dialogue and a modicum of technical spark, the dialogue to be paramount over car-crash technology, where the scenes dealing with the exotic are reasonably justifiable in terms of realism.

Here a few favorite books I feel would make good fantasy/science fiction movies:

The Sleeping Planet Burgess?

The World of Null-A, The Players of Null-A A.E. Van Vogt

The Weapon Makers, The Weapon Shops of Isher A.E. Van Vogt

Lord of Light Roger Zelazny

 



JAMES THURBER

Is there a unicorn in your garden?

In any case, there is a certain air about those who appreciate the wryness of Thurbers essays and cartoons. It may be an aura of controlled lunacy, which manages to escape on occasion (especially in print), but it&apos;s there nevertheless.

Another of the shorter tales I really like is, The Night the Ghost Got In! There was a great line in that piece, &quot;All of our relatives had some kind of attacks!&quot; I guess the implication is that all relatives are the same, and perhaps, as a species, they are.

Remember the line when the elderly lady met the young lad carving away during family reunion? She said, &quot;I&apos;m your great Aunt Ethel on your father&apos;s side.&quot; The kid didn&apos;t even look up, saying, &quot;well, you&apos;re on the wrong side!&quot;

Hope you don&apos;t get any shooting pains in the head.



FRAGMENTS

In the year 1441, in what was then Herat, the capital city of what is now Afghanistan, ruled by a son of Tamerlane, was born one of the Middle East&apos;s most famed poets, Mir Ali Shir Nava&apos;i.

Known as Nava&apos;i, the poet wrote mainly in Turkic, a language strange to the ears of the West, and it has taken 500 years for the words of Nava&apos;i to reach here.

Without going into details of the poet&apos;s life and times, let it be enough to savor the translations of two fragments which are as important as Omar&apos;s offerings:

The heart separated from the beloved is a country that knows no sultan;

A country that has no sultan is a body that has no soul.

What, O Muslims, is the harvest of a soulless body?

It is like black soil that has no rose or sweet basil.

Black soil that has no rose or sweet basil

Is like the black night that has no shining moon.

The black night that has no shining moon

Is a darkness that has no fountain of life.

A darkness in which no fountain of life can be

Found Is a hell that has no garden of Paradise.

A hell that has no garden of Paradise

Is a headache for which there is no chance of cure.

O N&apos;ava&apos;i, such are the torments that stem

From the pain of separation, yet there is no remedy of union.

O Zephyr, search for my vagabond heart in every direction.

Go through the valleys and mountains and deserts one by one.

Try to find it, no matter where it has journeyed,

And when you do, swirl around its head like a

Whirlwind and, having fooled it, cause it to return.

Try to bring it back to me, and if it will not come,

Disclose to it the tale of my melancholy.

Say to it: &quot;You have gone astray, and your soul is

On the verge of departing.&quot;

Bring it back to me, and if it will not come, implore it.

Return it, and if it is like Majnun - unable to control itself -

Do not leave it to its choice - guide it this way!

Then slit open my bosom and put it in its place,

And rescue me from the calamity of lovesickness.

Exactly in this way always seek the heart of Nava&apos;i

And if it will not reach you, help from God will reach you.

Since the best of men must pass through Death&apos;s portal,

Happy is he who makes his name immortal.

(translated by Victor Ostapchuk)



GRECIAN APPROACH

The old Greek comedies were wonderful mixes of life and confusion, with confusion, as in Aristophanes&apos; Lysistrata, The Clouds, The Birds, etc., generally taking over so much that near the end of the play no human being in the cast could have sorted out the problems in order to manage a successful conclusion.

So, being the clever thinkers that they were, on occasion, the Greek authors resorted to the concept of Deus ex machina, or a God from the machine. The God or Goddess was lowered on a machine (platform?) to the stage and exercised supernatural power to resolve the situation.

This is not to say that Aristophanes hired the machine god for all the plays mentioned, but it was apparent in some of his comedic fragments, as it was in other Greek 4th and 5th century plays. Euripedes was more of a tragic scribe (Electra, Medea, etc.) but even his lighter offerings brought down the platform.



FAUST LOUSED!

What a worthwhile Florentine Opera presentation today of Gounod&apos;s opera Faust. Besides the fine music, it also has a compelling story line.

1. The old geezer Faust is sitting in his study girl-watching and prays that he would be young again.

2. His prayers aren&apos;t answered (strange?), so he calls on the devil instead.

3. Mephistopheles appears and the usual arrangements (soul for por quo) are completed.

4. The devil has Faust meet Margurite, and one act later she becomes a bit pregnant.

5. With the help of the devil, Faust makes a shish kabob out of Margurite&apos;s brother Valentine.

6. Margurite then performs a post partum abortion on her baby.

7. She is jailed for this, and Faust tries to convince her to run away with him and the devil, but she prays for help.

8. The skies open up and a golden escalator appears to take Margurite to opera heaven, while Faust is left holding the pitchfork.

Yup! The good guys win in the end - except for Faust.



THE RIGHT STUFF

To my shame I have neither read the book nor saw the movie, even though the elements of the tale lie in my interest fields. I have heard good reviews of both, and it&apos;s only a matter of time until both reading and viewing are accomplished. After all, one of the protagonists is my hero, Chuck Yeager, a great pilot and a real gentleman.



WEIRDOES?

Speaking of weirdos, all of us who read and wrote science fiction and fantasy in years past were considered weird because we transcended the mere earthly matters and dwelt in the halls of outer space.

And unless a &apos;name&apos; writer came out with a novel that had enough of a touch of strange to fall in the gray area of atmosphere and ether, relying on his established name to sell books, an unknown didn&apos;t have a chance at the big time, relegated only to the odd few that delved.

The point of all this carping is, how times have changed!

The space shuttle came back from an umpteenth trip, completely successful in space, with only a minor braking incident in landing, and got about 15 seconds on the national news.

How sophisticated the media plebians have become!



DR. DETROIT IS A FUNNY MOVIE

Its destined to become a cult move. It has elements of ridiculousness and sublimity, compounded by a fine cast, and jelled by Dan Ackroyd.

Ackroyd is a stuffy college prof who falls in with the slick manager of three of the sweetest ladies of the evening in Chicago. Because the manager (Howard Hesseman) is in trouble with the boss of the girlie scene, &quot;Mom,&quot; (played by Kate Murtaugh), he sets up Ackroyd as the fake &quot;Dr.&quot; from Detroit who is muscling into Hesseman&apos;s operation: Dr. Detroit!!!!

Dan Ackroyd takes over the play to help out the girls, and in the process disguises himself as the good Doctor with the most pimpish outfit this side of Sunset Boulevard, the crowning touch being an armored right hand that the Doctor claims to use for &quot;small adjustments to the human spine.&quot;

The feud between Mom and Doctor Detroit accelerates until the night of the Players Ball at which the Doctor will be crowned King of the Ball, with the Ball being held at the same hotel that the faculty of Ackroyd&apos;s college are holding a dinner for the donor of enough money to maintain the college for some time.

Of course the two groups mesh, the high point being a duel (with epees) between Dr. Detroit and Mom, in front of the college faculty dinner.

There is too much to be said about this four star movie in this small space. The scenes are episodic, yet flow easily along to the climax. Ackroyd was never better.



MUSIC, PUBLIC RADIO&amp;COMMERCIAL

Granted much of the Public output is boring both on radio and TV. They continuously try to sell the liberal line on each, and as Sam Goldwyn said, if you want to send a message, use Western Union, meaning that when they stick to British films and non-political documentaries they do well.

Isn&apos;t it amazing that the ratings for classic station WFMR seem to hover around the percentile that Mensa finds applicable to their own entry levels. This seems to reinforce a past position of mine which argued that music is another indicator of potential. Some can handle the 3 minute record, some the 5, and some the complete symphony. With capability lies an understanding of the ninth, and an appreciation of the work as a whole...

Then we have Yellow polka-dot bikini providing challenge to the lower ranges; but, there are certain to be exceptions. Hadyn got turned on by Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, and made an unforgettable work out of the melody. And some, even as I, can find emotion in the simple tune about Edelweiss.



WORDSWORTH HEARING

The world is too much with us: late and soon,

Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:

Little we see in Nature that is ours;

We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!

This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;

The winds that will be howling at all hours,

And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;

For this, for everything, we are out of tune;

It moves us not. - Great God! I&apos;d rather be

A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;

So might I standing on this pleasant lea

Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;

Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;

Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.

I may have quoted this sonnet in some past talk, but it&apos;s just as effective now as it was then. Wordsworth, one of the Romance Poets, wrote this about the time he penned:

&quot;I wandered lonely as a cloud, that floats on high o&apos;er vales and hills, When suddenly I saw a crowd, a host, of golden daffodils...&quot;

I used to cherish that poem until one day when I heard Bullwinkle&apos;s unforgettable rendition on TV. It&apos;s similar to hearing the William Tell Overture, which inevitably brings to mind the Lone Ranger and his great horse Silver.



NO RINGER HE

Beginning with Winning Through..., all of the Ringer books are exceptional; the last one, American Dream, is profound. The lesson from all the books, and Ringer&apos;s life, is that if you have the basic intelligence, coupled with drive, you can be down and still make it back up.

Let&apos;s hear it for the Turtles of the world!



MIDDLE EARTH LEGEND...

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,

Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,

Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,

One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne

In the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.......

Whether or not you have journeyed with Frodo to Mount Doom, the verse still can send chills along your spine. I can only envy those who have yet to join the Fellowship of the Ring on the first part of the adventure. In the party will be Frodo, Sam, Strider, Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Boromir, Gandalf - and you, lucky you!

(Note: I was in the airport, Billy Mitchell Field, on my way to Amsterdam and looking for a good, thick book, fantasy or science fiction, when I saw and bought an acceptably substantial volume called:

The Fellowship of the Ring

I began reading it in the coffee shop, then in the lounge, in the loading area, and on the plane that brought me to Chicago where I changed to KLM. Settled in comfortably on KLM I was about half way across the Atlantic, and coming to the end of the book, I couldnt see how everything in the exciting story could be tied up in the few pages that were left. Finally, I got to the end, and saw those dreaded words:

Here ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring.

The sweet and understanding Dutch stewardess got me calmed down in reasonable time...



KANE

The fantasizing of gods appeals to me when done in the style of Karl Wagner&apos;s Kane series. It seemed to offer a wonderfully striking perception of a world pantheon. What ever happened to Wagner? It seems that after a few books he vanished, or perhaps the gods caught up to him.



UP AGAINST THE WALL

With regard to art, we have on our walls the products of the many artists who either are, or have been, in family residence, including the pastels of the paterfamilias, all of which stem from the fact that the kids were not allowed to buy presents on the various present-days, but had to generate some sort of artwork instead. It worked out well.



ILLUSTRATION

A long time ago I bought a circular copper plate at a small rummage sale. It had an illustration on it in silver and copper. I truly marveled at its unique, chisel-beaten, metal formed development aspect, but can&apos;t still cant identify the motif.

There are three figures in prominence: One figure is robed, sits on a throne, has a staff in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. It is a man, bearded, and is looking to the left in profile at another man.

This second man wears an ornately decorated robe and has a soft cap covering his head. With his right hand he is offering a large rabbit to the man on the throne, and with his left he is offering a cup of some sort.

The third man stands behind the throne holding a large feather, reminiscent of a fan. He too is bearded, and is shown in profile facing left.

The two outside figures standing have on their backs what appears to be a set of wings; however, along the center of the wing is a belted ornament which hangs towards the floor.

There are various other decorations, birds, vases, flowers, etc., in the background. Under the throne is a representation of a 4-spoked wheel.

It could be that sitting on the throne is a god-figure, receiving an offering from a lesser angel, while a higher level angel (the one with the crown) is doing the fanning. It might be a fragment from some part of ancient legend, or from the Bible, an event in Masonic history, or from the lore of some other secret society.

Maybe one of our Alphans has an idea of the illustration&apos;s significance; I can&apos;t remember ever seeing it in the past, all I know is that it looks mysterious. Perhaps the rabbit is a significant clue.



TORTOISE - ON THE LOOSE

Good news for tortoise fans! Robert Ringer&apos;s new book, &quot;How You Can Find Happiness During The Collapse of Western Civilization&quot; may be coming out in paperback soon. All liberals will hate it.

Ted Kennedy is elected to the National Hall of Dumb.

Alan Cranston becomes known as Leonid.

The light at the end of the liberal tunnel is on a train.

And a general exposure of why the liberal democrat social programs if allowed unchecked will generate a future book dealing with The Decline and Fall of the American Republic.

Ringer suggests how to halt the decline.



SOURCERES APPEND LIST

The question has been put as to what sources furnish the material of political and geo-political nature which I discuss in Alpha meetings, that are other than my own opinion. You will find most of those publications listed near the end of this tome under &quot;References.&quot; I read as many a month as I can which are pertinent to subjects of current Alphan interest; but, I dont get each one on a regular basis - just cant afford it.



SPOTLIGHT ON LONDON

The Richard London article was in the Spotlight, a weekly news mag that was once published by Liberty Lobby (one of your favorites, I&apos;m sure) but is now published by Cordite Fidelity, Inc. The theme of the publication is populist, with a strong right-wing lean, and has a flair for expounding even-handed relations with the nations of the middle-east.

They feel that the Israelis are too much benefiting from their relationship with the US government in a one-way street concept, that they get a heck of a lot more from us than we get from them. Because of this stance, many in the JDL and WJC have called the paper anti-semitic, even as they tag anyone with that label who questions Israeli motives.

Spotlight has several Jewish contributors who are staunch American conservatives, unlike writers like William Safire who are conservative in every respect except when it comes to dealings with Israel. They give a lot of importance to the so-called &apos;dual-loyalists&apos; theory, individuals who work for the US government but see to it that Israel gets all the money, data, and military information possible, and see no problem with Israeli spying in the US.

The paper has a definite anti-Reagan stance, and if it praises him at all it is as faintly exhibited as yours. One of their editorial statements recently said, &quot;the White House is riddled with dual loyalists and America lasters... It is a sickening fact that no administration in 200 years of history has suffered the massive infiltration of enemy agents more than the Reagan administration...&quot;

As in many a political sheet, there are items in the Spotlight with which I disagree, and many with which I agree. Heck, I even quote Mother Jones once in a while, even though they bash Reagan more than you do. But I know the editor, so read what he says, for better or worse, even if I have mentioned to him that &quot;Jones&quot; in the title should be changed to something far more explicit.

One of the recent columns by John Carmichael reviewed a book by Holly Sklar, no mean Reagan-beater herself, called &quot;Reagan, Trilateralism, and the Neoliberals.&quot; She also edited a book called, &quot;Trilateralism,&quot; which picks on Reagan a lot, but also pounds the globalists.

In reading the Spotlight periodically ever since I subscribed briefly after having received a Publishers Clearing House blurb, I note that one of the paper&apos;s goals is to establish the Populist Party as a major force in the US, not having learned, I guess, from history, and has developed area committees in many states, which run candidates for office.

But it must be observed that the Spotlight view is that American Jews are separate from Israelis, and simply because the paper criticizes Israel for what it believes are actions inimical to US interests that does not make it anti-semitic, no matter what the JDL says.

However, when a blatant story relating an act of anti-semitism is patently false, the Spotlight calls attention to that fact. For example, in the ADL bulletin of March, 1985, a picture is shown whereon a swastika has been painted on the door of a Jewish home in Kings Point, N.Y., an act of &quot;nazi desecration.&quot; However, the swastika has been painted on the photo by someone, and it is very obvious that the lines of the swastika do not follow the lines of the ornate door.

And, in passing, it was first in the Spotlight that I read about Joe Newman&apos;s &quot;wonderful energy machine,&quot; and subsequent information on the unit has been printed.

It&apos;s my belief that your interests might not be parallel to those of the Spotlight in certain areas, yet, the Spotlight believes in America and its principles, as outlined by the Constitution, in a strong military, in the concept of fairness, not license, to all, and in fair trade, not free trade, and in the fact that Communism is a totalitarianistic form of government oppression that has no place in a free world. It seems that from past pronouncements you too may agree with those purposes.



THE CONSTITUTION RULES!

All kidding aside, The ThunderBolt couldn&apos;t hold a candle to the Spotlight or Human Events in any respect, including logic and grammar; however, it&apos;s to the credit of the founding fathers that the ThunderBolt, Spotlight, NY Times, Washington Post, The Progressive (how I wanted to say &quot;The Regressive&quot;), Conservative Digest, Mother Jones, American Opinion, and the Daily World or Worker or whatever the communist rag calls itself these days, can all exist without fear of the midnight jackboots, in this great nation, now, and for times to come.



H. ALLEN SMITH

In a talk somewhere, I referred to &quot;Lost in the Horse Latitudes,&quot; a book by that eminent humorist, H. Allen Smith. Now the horse latitudes, if memory serves me correct, were those areas of the Atlantic where certain belts of calm between the prevailing westerlies and the trade winds, where a ship could get becalmed for a long time, and if too long, the horses were graciously allowed to swim for the nearest land....

But, now that I&apos;ve brought up H. Allen Smith, we will examine some of his stuff on occasion, and list here the books he has generated.

Here is his note on, &quot;Testing for IQ:&quot;

The way to determine a person&apos;s Intelligence Quotient is to obtain the date of his birth and then, if you understand arithmetic, find out how old he is at the present moment. If he is under ten, give him a high grading.

As it has been in the past and as it will be in the future, truth-telling and complete candor and awful sincerity are to be found amongst our small fry. A teacher asked a ten-year-old boy to spell the word &apos;straight.&apos; He spelled it correctly and then the teacher asked, &apos;Now, what does it mean?&apos; And the child answered, &apos;Without ginger ale.&apos;

Mark Twain urged us not to scoff at the school boy, for it was he who said: &apos;Faith is believing what you know ain&apos;t so.&quot;

Other words of wisdom: &apos;Anyone who ever says he was et by a wolf is a damn liar,&apos; from the friends of the wolf society.....

And lastly, an old Chinese proverb from HAS:

&quot;Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from your friend&apos;s forehead!&quot;

(But God, sometimes the temptation is there)

H. Allen also asked whether your dog can go to heaven? He might if he is a Mohammedan. The Mohammedans believe that one dog and nine other none-human creatures are already there, namely:

Jonah&apos;s whale

Solomon&apos;s ant (no, not her, but the formicator)

Abraham&apos;s ram

The lapwing of Balkis

Saleh&apos;s camel

Balem&apos;s ass (couldn&apos;t take all of him, huh?)

The ox of Moses

The dog Kratim of the Seven Sleepers

Mohammed&apos;s ass, whose name was Al Borak

Noah&apos;s dove

Smith felt that Al Borak sounded more like the name of a shortstop, but I have

to disagree.

It sounds like a third baseman.

(Note: those of you with bibles and ensicklepediums will have to look up those other references, I&apos;m too tired. And lazy.)

More works of H. Allen Smith to ponder:

Waikiki Beachnik

Mister Zip

Lost in the Horse Latitudes

Smith&apos;s London Journal

Life in a Putty Knife factory

People named Smith

Busking With H. Allen Smith

Note: The Smiths of the world have united! For the results, check your white pages to view the plethora of ubiquitously abundant Smiths, even if they are trying to hide behind Smythe, Schmidt, Schmitt, Smit, or Smt.



SAD COMMENTARY

The use of sad for the commentary was brought about thus: At a rummage in this area, there was a sale on beautiful University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee textbooks - accounting, math, psychology, anatomy, psych testing, etc. All were used, but in fine condition.

The sad part was that the books were on sale for 5 cents each, six for a quarter; needless to say I bought a dozen of assorted titles. And the prices stamped in the covers ranged from $21.95 to $75.00, and all you college students know that that is what some underclassman, had to pay for them.

Theres a lesson there somewhere - but I just can&apos;t find it.



ARCHIE LIVES!

Norman Lear wanted to make Archie a caricature of right wing thinking in the country. But, Archie&apos;s philosophy became more of a success than Lear dreamed it would be, saying a lot for the move to the conservative right by the American public, instead of to the left in accordance with the views of Jane Fonda or the Meathead. Lear is an abomination in his thinking, his TV shows, his morality, and his politics.

I think many Americans would identify with Bunker rather than Lear.



ARCHITECTURE

Everyone famous had to start somewhere, and Frank Lloyd Wright was no different. Just before WWI, Wright was commissioned to do a series of low cost homes here in Milwaukee, and specifically, on the South Side.

Built in 1916, while the war in Europe was going on, were four duplexes and two single-family homes built on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street, on the north side of the street. Wright developed standardized designs so the houses could be constructed from pre-cut materials, thereby anticipating modular building by many years.

The Alverno College brochure, &quot;Milwaukee&apos;s Superb South Side,&quot; said &quot;the homes have the clean lines and the ageless appeal so typical of the Wisconsin-born architects work.&quot;



ONCE, JUST ONCE!

I have seen Republican and Conservative nominees put on the hot seat time after time by the small-time inquisitors in the Senate, asking their nasty little &apos;when did you stop beating your wife?&apos; questions, dripping with innuendo, implying degeneracy to the nominee because of his conservative position, usually led by that paragon of Massachusetts virtue, Ted Kennedy.

Once, just once, I&apos;d like to hear a nominee reply:

&quot;Senator Kennedy, you have stated that I was guilty of &apos;such and such&apos; for the basest of reasons, making the suggestion that my racist, heartless, inhumane, etc., etc., behavior and character are suspect, and that I am unfit for the office in question.

&quot;How can you make those accusations of immorality and degradation with a straight face; you, who got drunk with a young girl in a private house, at a party of married men and single women, an affair planned to be thoroughly private, with no one outside allowed to note what was transpiring?

&quot;You, who took that young girl in your auto, and driving in a liquor-induced stupor, missed the roadway over a small bridge, causing the auto you were driving to go off the bridge and sink into the water; you, who escaped with your life, but left the young girl to drown after the air pocket she was in finally gave out.

&quot;You, who hours later called your attorneys and advisors before notifying the authorities, and with those attorneys and advisors conspired to concoct a ridiculous scenario to explain the events; you, whose veracity was strongly questioned by the judge in the case.

&quot;You, whose family had the wealth and power to seal the history of what some have called a drunken orgy; to get the young girl buried as soon as possible to prevent an autopsy; to seal the events of the day from the public, with the help of those &apos;friends of the common man&apos; of your own party; to threaten, cajole, and finally settle a large sum of money on the girl&apos;s parents so they would not pursue the matter as it should have been done.

&quot;You, who was involved in the crash of a small plane, in which huge, and unexplained, amounts of cash were found in the wreckage at the crash site; you, who had other persons take the college tests you seemed to lack the mental ability to complete on your own; you, who have never deigned to deny the reports of escapades with other young women during your marriage, following in your brothers&apos; bed sheets.

&quot;You, whose activities in the tragic death at Chappaquiddick should have resulted in your serving a jail term for manslaughter, instead of allowing you to buy your way into the United States Senate, elected by the citizens of the state of Massachusetts. Some citizens, some state......

&quot;You, whose entire life has been one of license because of wealth and political connection;

&quot;How can you even look me in the eye and state that because of some nebulous accusation based on events 30 years ago, I am not fit or worthy to be certified for the position in question, in view of those ever-present and indefensible allegations concerning your own questionable life style? What qualifies you to snidely attack a proved record of service in the highest court in the land, you, whose past is so spotted and checkered with misdeeds?

&quot;You may respond, Senator.&quot;

VIGILANCE STORY

Back in the old days, a small, isolated town generally had a peace officer to run the ordinary policing affairs of that town. For extraordinary threats which were unable to be met by that officer and his staff, the men of the town usually could get together, armed, and meet the dangers as a group.

In general, a magistrate would hold a trial and pass necessary sentences on conviction after the situation was neutralized and the perpetrators caught.

Nowadays, American society is victimized by those sworn officers of the court who take an oath to uphold justice - the lawyers. And the lawyers of the left, who make their living defending those who would bring about the collapse of the American system, would be the first to howl and weep about any organization which was developed to meet local, state, and national threats by anti-American groups or nations.

Try to prosecute a revolutionary, anarchist, communist, or the like, these days, and you will find the Kunstler crowd leaping to his defense, using every legal avenue provided by the constitution to defend the very traitor or terrorist trying to defeat the American system.

Brought up was the name of Posse Comitatus (the power of the county), ironically, of course, but in the newspapers I have read that the &quot;Posse&quot; stood firmly behind the American way of life and the precepts of the Constitution.

For this they have been hounded by the liberal left, who, it seems, help bring the full weight of the federal government down upon them.

The John Birch Society, a sometimes way out organization, also proclaimed their staunch support of the American way of life, and their belief in the Constitution as it was written. They backed a strong military, and a foreign policy based on such strength.

For this they have been castigated by every left-wing liberal in the land as being overly patriotic, groups like that headed by leftist Norman Lear, who cloak their radical-liberal policies behind some nationalistic sounding group title.

Observe the enemies of the National Rifle Association and you will get a good picture of those on the left who would bring the mediocrity of socialization to our nation.

The point of the preceding is this: for any patriotic organization dedicated to the defense of American principles and precepts, who would be willing to bear arms to defend against those who would try to topple the nation and its Constitution, to survive against the liberal-left forces of media, wealth, and power, the organization must perforce be highly secret. Otherwise the powers of the left would leave no stoning unturned in a fanatical zeal to wipe out the group.

All I know of the John Birch Society or the Posse Comitatus is what I read or heard in the media; but, always mentioned was their belief in the US and its principles of freedom, always presented in a wryly derogatory manner, especially by the Brokaws and the Rathers.

In any case, there may be such secret group existing right at this time, a group that takes it upon itself to secretly right certain wrongs, a group dedicated to maintaining the rights of the average American to those nebulous concepts of life, liberty, etc.

It&apos;s not likely, but I would hope there might be, with the funds and connections to erase the drug, crime, and terrorist scum from our lands.

They would not lack for volunteers.

Does harboring thoughts such as that make me a fascist? If it does, then perhaps we may need a different interpretation of the word fascist. Maybe it will come to mean someone totally against a chemically socialistic society of drudgery, in the mode of the people&apos;s paradises of the world.



AFRICANS - PBS VERSION

The initial PBS Africans series was more blatant in its anti-American tone than the later episodes; however, this is in keeping with leftist line of Public radio and television.

You may recall the WWII series produced by the Soviet Union a time ago on PBS-TV showing how the brave Soviets won the war. Nauseous!

And PBS has also given a good deal of time to the Soviet publicist who is a pop star in liberal circles these days. They have always been far to the left of center, and in some presentations made some liberal Alphans look like a member of the Birchers. And it&apos;s our tax money funding those anti-US broadcasts.

We&apos;re selling the rope to hang ourselves - just like the man said.



REDS WIN AGAIN!

On film, that is!

The rag today had a piece about the coming TV series, &quot;Amerika.&quot; That spelling, as we all know, is a code-word pejorative used in general by those elements who consider the US a fascist nation, but in this case the TV title describes an America that has been taken over by the forces of the Soviet Union.

They don&apos;t actually explain how it&apos;s been taken over without an American fight on their hands, but perhaps it&apos;s a pinko wishful-think for a future when the far-out liberals have taken over the congress, and in the face of threat they simply voted to concede, in their typical better red than dead attitudes.

It &apos;stars&apos; Kris Kristofferson, a weak-voiced radical singer whose politics are cast in the lefist mould of Jane Fonda, Martin Sheen, Ed Asner, and Lillian Hellman.

Some quotes from Kristofferson, with notes below:

1. &quot;I have mixed emotions about this project because I don&apos;t believe that Russia is the primary threat to world peace. The arms race is - and a lot of aggressive American foreign policy...&quot;

1A. Of course the arms race is America&apos;s fault just because it wants to defend against some bully nation who has had as its aim the subversion of governments in the on-going plan to make the world communist. And obviously our research on SDI shows we are the aggressors.

2. &quot;Some colleagues of mine call &apos;Amerika&apos; right-wing propaganda and are praying for me over appearing... Martin Sheen and Ed Asner said &apos;What are you doing there?&apos;&quot;

2A. Asner and Sheen figure that any possible little thing that would imply we should defend against the Soviets as right wing propaganda.

3. &quot;When it&apos;s shown, it will be in Russia at a conference.&quot;

3A. For the Soviet equivalent of the Academy Award, I presume. With some luck, he won&apos;t be able to tear himself away from the communist paradise.

 

4. &quot;I thought it was my duty to make this film, which is also why I went to Nicaragua at Christmas. We shouldn&apos;t be trying to overthrow that sovereign nation.&quot;

&quot;I hope we can re-examine our attitudes towards the Soviets, finding things we can admire and cooperate with instead of staying in the arms race. The best I can do is write songs about this.&quot;

4A. Perhaps Kristofferson forgot that South Viet Nam, Rhodesia, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, were all sovereign nations before US leftists helped to overthrow them, as they are trying to do presently in South Africa.

It did not surprise me that Kristofferson&apos;s last film, Heaven&apos;s Gate, bombed miserably, gaining the title of the biggest flop in history.

In &apos;Amerika,&apos; he plays the role of a leader of the US resistance forces; let me predict that he will portray the role in such a fashion that in spite of the bullets flying, he will have lots of lines indicating the basic goodness and tolerance of the Soviets, and how it may end up that the subjugation of America by the Soviets was a positive accomplishment, and will show how they cleaned up the slums and put everybody to work according to their abilities and paid them according to their needs like good little marxists.

You will see the sympathetic Soviet invaders just doing their job to bring communist peace to Amerika, just like the good guys they are, while our dirty capitalists pay for their crimes so the proletariat can become dominant - and so on, ad nauseum.

Its Dumbo instead of Rambo.

David Wrye, the writer-producer-director said of his film, &quot;It&apos;s creative chaos. We drifted into this backwards like the American government does...&quot;

Not his government, the implication, but the American government.

Remember the Mikado, where Koko is telling about the idiot who praises every century but this and every country but his own? That sort of selective praising is still going on, coming from certain types of &apos;Americans&apos; who seem to praise everything the Soviets do but castigate the US for everything they can. Fortunately, America is strong enough, at least for now, to keep the Soviets at bay, and to withstand the rhetoric of the left.

I just can&apos;t wait not to see this series.



KRISKRIS

Innocent that I am, I didn&apos;t even know Kristofferson was one of the far-left Fonda types until I read the blurb in the rag.

However, it&apos;s been my experience that any time one of the left-leaners appears in anything, ala Redford in Condor, beneath the thin veneer of flag-waving there will be a thick layer of agit-prop garbage.

Maybe I&apos;m wrong, but KK&apos;s direct quotes in the article are not the sort one would expect from Nathan Hale, Patrick Henry, or Pat Buchanan. And usually, a film reflects the beliefs of the writers and the stars in them - especially if the philosophy is port-sided.

For example, most of the Viet Nam films were actually anti-American in nature, including the new one just released, in order to propagandize the public into such an utter distaste for war that they would not want US soldiers to be allowed to fight anywhere where they might get hurt. Especially if that anywhere might be a communist government in this hemisphere.

Hollywood was full of communists in the 50&apos;s; they&apos;ve flourished since then.



GOOD BOOK

One of my compulsive-reader offspring brought me a book yesterday called &quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Wizard,&quot; a new science/fantasy/sorcery novel by Christopher Stasheff. Some of the Alphans may remember other books by Stasheff, including what I always thought his best, &quot;The Warlock in Spite of Himself.&quot;

Wizard seems to be, as Warlock was, the continuation of a series - let&apos;s hope that it is. I won&apos;t explain the plot, but, be careful in exploring those old runes. Really blew the football game for me.



AMERIKAN IDIOT

In the rag this morning, Kristofferson said he took the part in Amerika to make sure a left-wing representative was in a lead role so that it would negate a right-wing approach to the series. What a simpleton, what a true son of the Hollywood 10.



LIKE THE PEOPLE, HATE THE POLITBURO

I don&apos;t think most of us hate the Soviet people much at all; we save our disfavor for the communist party, the KGB, and the leadership of the soviet union who maintain a constant, freedomless pressure on their hapless non-communist party member citizenry simply to reinforce control.

What was once Russia was the area around Moscow north to Finland, south to the Ukraine, west to Poland, etc. Geographically, Russia ends at the Volga. From the Caspian sea, Kazakhstan stretches to Red China, and the people who live in that area are Asian stock.

Besides the captive nations of east European Bloc, there also are Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and their people. There are Ukrainians, Georgians, Armenians, and Tadzhiks and Uzbeks, just to name a few. The religions run from Orthodox, to Marxism, to Islam. And in actuality, the Soviet communists have done fairly well in keeping all of the non-Russo soviets under control. Half of the people living within the borders of the Soviet empire are not Russians - they simply are oppressed by the Russians in their Soviet guise.

Unrest is building in all the non-Soviet states, the last problem area being Kazakhstan, which was swept by riots when the Supreme Soviet replaced a Kazakh with a Russian.

Perhaps some small cracks in the Soviet monolith are showing up.

18. TRUTHS ABOUT VIET NAM

Viet Nam was still in the news in the middle 1980s. There was much finger-pointing going on between past Hawks and Doves as to who lost the war in Viet Nam, just like it was once asked, who lost China?

But who did indeed lose Viet Nam? Easily answered. It was an unholy conspiracy that included world Communism, domestic communists, their leftist supporters, the cowardly American Media, the craven pussyfooters in the congress of the United States. The South Vietnamese military was forced to lose on the South Viet Nam battlefields.

How? The ARVN in South Viet were more than brave enough to withstand the attacks of the communist north; however, its difficult for any soldier in any action to be brave when hes down to his last two or three cartridges, and the enemy has all the guns and ammo he wants or needs.

Why? Because the United States had promised full aid to the South Viets in the form of weapons and ammunition. The craven liberals in the US congress failed to keep their promises to the ARVN, and voted to cut off all military supplies, in essence, cutting the throats of the brave soldiers of the south who had faith in those false promises.

It is a sad commentary on how the communists here and abroad, and their fellow travelers in Washington, and the media, allow the savage forces of Ho Chi Minh prevail over our former friends and allies.

Moderators comments follow:



MOR ON MEDIA

Here&apos;s some factual information to counteract the media&apos;s hyping of the so-called 10 year anniversary of an American &quot;defeat&quot; in Viet Nam.

1. After years of fighting there, President Nixon began bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in earnest, plus mining the harbors to effectively cut off supplies to the north. This forced the communists to the peace talks where a treaty was signed for the purpose of ending the war.

3. As usual, the communists of North Viet Nam, backed by their soviet arms suppliers, broke the treaty and began attacking the south. This was after American soldiers had gone.

4. The American government had promised the South Vietnamese that military supplies would be provided them in order to help them defend against the communists.

5. The cowards in the US Congress cut off funding for this promised program, thus allowing the commies to overrun the South, which ran out of ammunition and supplies.

6. It took only about two years after our troops pulled out for the north to take Saigon, thus giving the media turncoats their long-awaited pictures of American helicopters leaving the embassy roof with diplomatic personnel aboard.

The responsibility for any failure of the US to prevail against the communist north lies with the media, whose distortions of the war and the objectives were flashed on US TV screens every evening. It took a conspiracy of these media people, liberals, party-liners, and the Soviet mis-information services to massage the public into believing outright lies about our participation in Viet Nam, aided and abetted by leftist politicians in our own nation.

So why rehash these events? Just to establish the record in the face of the daily hype from the media morons about &quot;loss&quot; of the Viet Nam War, and more importantly, to show how this Southeast Asian history lesson will be lost on us if we allow the same weaklings in congress to help defeat the Anti-communists in Central America.

All this talk from the liberals about who&apos;s right or wrong in Central America is a flow of hot air which will still be fueling the leftist fires right up to the time when the communists would have established check points along the Rio Grande.

 

Americans cannot let that happen. Sympathizers to the Central American and Cuban communist governments should leave this country and join the workers paradises in one of those unhappy lands.



NAM

My appraisal would have been the opposite. Those who protested the US effort in Viet Nam were in the main not disloyal, but in disagreement, for whatever reasons.

I think that phrase fragment of &quot;my country right or wrong,&quot; even with the preceding caveat, would hold for them.

And you are correct; we should have blockaded and mined the NV&apos;s from the start, cut off all supplies, and brought them to an early agreement.

Just like Nixon did later.

Which achieved a cease-fire.

But which congress in a liberal wash of misplaced zeal proceeded to unravel by cutting off promised funds for the defense of the south.

And, to skip the two-hour lecture, it is apparent that congress is inserting itself into a role for which it is neither capable nor authorized, that is, the area of setting foreign policy. They are no more prepared for this activity than a hippo is for ballet, Disneys Fantasia notwithstanding.

My choice at this moment would be one of having the president blockade all shipments into Nicaragua until the marxist government there holds honest elections - elections which were scuttled by the communists in favor of the present dictatorship, which is worse than the old dictatorship.

And by their votes, it would appear that certain members of congress are perfectly willing to see Nicaragua, and all Central America perhaps, under the hammer and sickle.

How do those idiots justify that stance to their constituents?



WAR&amp;REPORTING

Actually, the purpose of general land/trench warfare is to wound your enemy, not kill him. Wounding to the point where an opponent is rendered hors de combat takes seven men&apos;s activity. Killing dead takes only one activity.

Concerning biased combat reporting, had you keenly interpreted the Viet Nam war reporting by US journalists, you would have seen that most of the reporters were gung ho for the Viet Cong and North Viet Nam, at the expense of our soldiers, thus causing the US malaise toward the Viet Nam war and the diffidence towards our military men just afterwards.

Now the reportorial and other media dastards are patting themselves on the back for finally discovering the Viet Nam veterans, and the fact that the vets acquitted themselves honorably in a war that that a cowardly consortium of congressmen, media sluggards, and liberal-left fellow travelers combined to develop the atmosphere which led to final, craven, capitulation.

Is it your position that as a correspondent you would not be gung ho in your reporting? Would you report pragmatically? If so, you would be miles ahead of the media creeps who slimed up the TV&apos;s with their anti-American Viet Name war nightly tidings.



EPILOGUE



Dear Reader: You have discovered, not to your surprise, Im sure, that there are certain individuals whose appetites for knowledge and discussion are forever whetted by discussion and knowledge, whose thirst for wisdom and erudition is satiated for a time by revelation of erudition and wisdom, but whose passion for learning will never be fulfilled completely. These individuals are people whose common instinct had led them to the Society of Alpha-Omega. One could call them students of the world, the heavens, and the dimensions. They are the Alphans.

My words here are but a stimulus to the discourse, and a reflection of the keen Alphan wit and depth of knowledge.

However, are the Alphans compartmentalized in those neatly sectioned categories? The truth of the matter is that each of them, as all of us, are composed of many intellectual parts, and each has interests that interface with a degree of intensity proportional to their own basic talent and interest.

And, considering the talents, the potential, the attainments of each participant, in each unceasing quest for the acquisition of wisdom in its various forms, we choose an apt name, a term, most appropriate to an honored Alphan individual:

The Eternal Scholar

The Bloody But Unbowed!
