VALET PARKING TIPS

City dwellers understand the value of strategic parking, particularly for dining out at restaurants, checking into hotels, attending theater events and visiting at hospitals. For those who cannot, or do not wish to, walk lengthy distances to and from their vehicles, valet parking can be a highly valued service.

Many high-end establishments offer valet parking for their patrons. Drivers simply pull up to the curb, or into the front circle drive of the building, and pass their keys to the valet parking attendant. These staffers, who are usually uniformed, will drive patrons&apos; vehicles to appointed parking facilities. When patrons are ready to depart, the valet parking employees will retrieve their vehicles as well.
 
Customarily, patrons will offer gratuities, or tips, to valet parking employees to express appreciation for their assistance. Often, a patron will pass a cash tip directly to a valet parking staffer, as he is handed his own car keys. After doing so, the patron will load up his passengers, enter his own vehicle and depart from the valet parking area.

HOW VALET PARKING EMPLOYEES EARN

Valet parking employees are usually paid an hourly wage, but the bulk of their earnings may come from customer gratuities. Valet parking tips comprise the lion&apos;s share of their income.

If valet parking is offered at a private event, such as a home wedding or tented party, then valet parking tips may be car-parkers&apos; only income for the night.

Although a customer may pay a fee ranging from $10 to $20 or more for valet parking at a hotel or restaurant, the valet parking employees may not receive any of these proceeds. The establishment, or perhaps the valet parking company (if it is a contracted service) will pocket the fees.

Valet parking customers do best to hand tips directly to the employees handling their vehicles. Some valet parking services place tip jars on the valet parking attendant&apos;s counter. However, tips placed in these receptacles may be divided among all the valet parking employees, or they may never make it to the employees at all. If a customer places a valet parking tip right into the hand of the employee who delivers his car, then that customer may be sure the tip has been correctly distributed.

Of course, valet parking employees may be required to pool their tips. If they do, then this is beyond the customer&apos;s concern. At least, the customer may be certain that his valet parking tip and expressed appreciation has been properly delivered.
