How much money does a restaurant owner earn?
 In: Salary and Pay Rates , Restaurants and Dining Establishments [ Edit categories ] 

 Answer: 
 Answer 
You&apos;d need to factor in many variables:
How many customers? How much do you charge for your food? What does your food cost to prepare? What does it cost to BUY the food? How much do you pay your employees? How much are the local licenses and taxes?
Any business is about risk. You need to be able to make more than you spend, then you&apos;re a profitable business. Will your total sales exceed your total expenses? Will you be able to attract enough customers? Will your prices give you enough profit to cover your expenses and end up with a little for yourself?
Unfortunately, a restaurant business is not easily evaluated the way you&apos;ve asked. Some of the more &quot;exclusive&quot; restaurants, with high priced menu items and trendy decor will be able to attract a client base that assures them a profit, no matter WHAT their expenses are like. On the other hand, some of the little family owned restaurants, that look dirty and have a reputation of making people sick will not make money, but instead will just continue to be an expense. 
 Answer 
It depends on the location, size and type of restaurant. A big factor is if you will be managing your restaurant or if you will hire a restaurant manager to take care of everything for you. In general restaurant owners make between $50,000-$100,000 for good sized restaurant.
