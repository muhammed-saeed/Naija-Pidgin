The best Chick-Fil-A Restaurant in the…

The best Chick-Fil-A Restaurant in the nation! I&apos;ve heard stories of people who come from everywhere just to eat there! Once you walk into the restaurant, they open the door for you and greet you with a warm smile. When your ready to order, you only have to wait for an average time of 30 seconds after you&apos;ve ordered, and they ALWAYS get your order right! if they&apos;re not that fast, they&apos;ll have you take a seat and even bring out the food to your table with everything you need! While your eating their yummy Chicken Nuggets with Polynesian Sauce, a&quot;Guest Specialist&quot;comes by, (kind of like your personal waiter/waitress) offers you Mints to eat after your meal, refill your drinks (for free!) and take away your tray when your done. Wow! Is all I can say. That is the best Quick Served Fast Food Restaurant I have EVER experienced. And what makes it an even better bonus is: They have FREE WIFI!!!!!!

Chick-Fil-A

If you haven&apos;t eaten here, you are missing out. They don&apos;t make those cheap tasting dollar sandwhiches. They make tasty crunchy, real chicken ones.I love their lemonade. I don&apos;t know if it is fresh squeezed or not, but it tastes pretty good. I could drink gallons of it and not grow tired of the yummy taste.Go their and try it out. You won&apos;t be disapoointed.

Best Fast-Food in USA

Provided by Citysearch 

Chic-fil-a is the best, and the old (drive-through only) IN-AND-OUT Burgers, a close second for fast-food. Of all the mall-located Chic-fil-a&apos;s in Utah, this one is the best. That&apos;s because it is the only stand-alone, and the newest. The new menu items are tried here first. Try the sandwich, strips, and nuggets in-that-order. But stay from the WORST and only item that should be removed from the menu: the cool wraps (ABSOLUTE PURE GARBAGE)!
