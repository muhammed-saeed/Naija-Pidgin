 Posted in Convict on Death Row by Doc on December 7, 2007 
 

 DC Number: 124669 Name: HURST, TIMOTHY L Race: BLACK Sex: MALE Hair Color: BLACK Eye Color: BROWN Height: 5’11” Weight: 298 lbs. Birth Date: 12/12/1978 Initial Receipt Date: 05/02/2000 Current Facility: UNION C.I. Current Custody: MAXIMUM Current Release Date: DEATH SENTENCE 

First Judicial Circuit, Escambia County Case # 98-1795

Sentencing Judge: The Honorable Joseph Tarbuck
Attorney, Trial: R. Glenn Arnold – Private
Attorney, Direct Appeal: W.C. McLain – Assistant Public Defender
Attorney, Collateral Appeals: Jeff Hazen – Registry

Date of Offense: 05/02/98
Date of Sentence: 04/26/00

 Circumstances of Offense: 

Cynthia Harrison was an assistant manager of a Popeye’s fast food restaurant in Pensacola, Florida. Timothy Hurst was a morning prep person at the same restaurant, and his responsibility was to make rice and biscuits and wash dishes. On 05/02/98, Harrison and Hurst were scheduled to work at 8:00 a.m. The two were scheduled to be the only workers in the restaurant until another worker arrived at 9:00 a.m.

On the morning of May 2nd, Davis Kladitis, an occasional customer at Popeye’s, was standing outside a feed store near the restaurant when he saw Harrison drive by and waved to her. Kladitis also saw another car behind Harrison’s, being driven by a black man. Kladitis later identified the car as the one belonging to Timothy Hurst. Carl Hess, who worked at a nearby Wendy’s restaurant, reported seeing Hurst being let into the Popeye’s restaurant by Harrison.

At 7:55 a.m. on May 2nd, Jeanette Hayes, an employee of another Popeye’s restaurant in Pensacola, called the restaurant that Harrison and Hurst worked at and informed her that a delivery truck was en route. Hayes noted that Harrison did not sound scared.

Tanya Crenshaw, another assistant manager at the restaurant, arrived at the restaurant at 10:30 a.m. to find two employees and a delivery truck driver waiting outside the restaurant. Hurst was nowhere to be found, but Harrison’s body was found in the freezer.

Harrison’s body was bound and gagged with black electrical tape. The body had over sixty incised slash and stab wounds, all of which were consistent with having been made by a box cutter, which was found by the back door of the restaurant.

Lee Smith, a friend of Hurst, testified that Hurst had stopped by his house on the evening before the murder and told Smith that he [Hurst] planned to rob the Popeye’s restaurant where he worked. At 8:30 a.m. on May 2nd, Hurst returned to Smith’s house, carrying a clear plastic container with money in it and a bank bag. The amount of money taken by Hurst was later determined to be $1751.54 of the store’s proceeds and $375 in small bills and change, all taken from the restaurant’s safe. Hurst told Smith that he had killed “the manager” and put her in the freezer. Smith washed Hurst’s pants, which had blood spots on them, and he also helped Hurst dispose of Harrison’s wallet and Hurst’s shoes and socks. Hurst, Smith, and Hurst’s brother then went to a Wal-Mart store and bought a pair of shoes for Hurst. The three then went to a pawn shop, where Hurst bought three rings for $300.

Lee Smith’s parents were out of town at the time of the murder, but when they returned and found the clear plastic container and money in Smith’s room, they called the police. Police interviewed Smith and searched a garbage can, where they found a coin purse with Harrison’s driver’s license in it, a bank bag marked with “Popeye’s” and Harrison’s name on it, a bank deposit slip, and a bloody sock and shoes that belonged to Hurst.

Sentencing Judge: The Honorable Belvin Perry, Jr.
Attorney, Trial: Michael Irwin&amp;Robert LeBlanc – Private
Attorney, Direct Appeal: Christopher Quarles – Assistant Public Defender
Attorney, Collateral Appeals: Eric Pinkard&amp;David Gemmer – CCRC-M

Date of Offense: 05/24/94
Date of Sentence: 06/16/95

 Circumstances of Offense: 

Thomas Gudinas and three of his roommates arrived at an Orlando bar, Barbarella’s, between approximately 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. on 05/23/94. Prior to arriving at the bar, the group drank beer and smoked marijuana at their apartment and in the car on the way to the bar. While drinking throughout the night, the group periodically returned to the car to smoke marijuana. When the bar closed at 3:00 a.m., Gudinas could not be located. One of Gudinas’ roommates testified that he last saw Gudinas at approximately 1:00 a.m.

Rachelle Smith and her fiancé arrived at Barbarella’s between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. on 05/23/94. When they left the bar at approximately 2:00 a.m., Smith went to the wrong parking lot, where she saw a man later identified as Gudinas, watching her while crouched behind another car. Realizing she was in the wrong parking lot, Smith walked to the correct parking lot and found her car. Smith sensed she was being followed, so she immediately entered the car and locked the doors. The same man who was watching Smith earlier tried to open her passenger door, then tried to smash the driver’s side window, screaming “I want to f___ you.” Smith blew her car horn and the man left. Smith later identified Gudinas in a police photo lineup as the man who tried to attack her.

Michelle McGrath was last seen at Barbarella’s at approximately 2:45 a.m. She left her car in the same parking lot where Smith initially saw Gudinas. McGrath’s body was discovered on 05/24/94 in an alley next to Pace School by an employee of the school. Her time of death was estimated to have been between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m. McGrath’s body was naked, except for a bra which was pushed up above her breasts. Her body had several blunt force traumas to the head and evidence of sexual assault. The body also had trauma to the cervix and rectum, which was determined to have resulted from the insertion of foreign objects into her body. Semen was found inside McGrath’s vagina and on her thigh.
Prior to finding McGrath’s body in the alley beside Pace School, Jane Brand, an employee of the Pace School, came upon a man inside the gates of the school. After being told to leave the school grounds, the man jumped the fence and ended up in the alley. Brand looked in the alley and found McGrath’s body. Brand later identified the man as Gudinas.

All of Gudinas’ roommates testified that he was not at their apartment when they returned from Barbarella’s. They also testified that Gudinas was later seen with blood on his underwear and scratches on his knuckles. Gudinas attributed his wounds to a fight with two black men who tried to rob him. Two roommates further testified that when asked if McGrath was a “good f___,” Gudinas replied, “I killed her then I f___ed her.”

 Additional Information: 

As a juvenile, Gudinas had several felony convictions in the State of Massachusetts in the early 1990’s: Burglary of an Automobile, Assault, Theft, Assault With Intent to Rape, Indecent Assault and Battery, Assault and Battery.

 GUARDADO, JESSE 
 Posted in Convict on Death Row by Doc on December 7, 2007 
 

 DC Number: 324342 Name: GUARDADO, JESSE Race: WHITE Sex: MALE Hair Color: BROWN Eye Color: BLUE Height: 5’07” Weight: 200 lbs. Birth Date: 06/05/1962 Initial Receipt Date: 02/15/1991 Current Facility: FLORIDA STATE PRISON Current Custody: MAXIMUM Current Release Date: DEATH SENTENCE 
 First Judicial Circuit, Walton County Case # 04-00903
Sentencing Judge: The Honorable Kevin Wells
Attorney, Trial: John J Gontarek, Private
Attorney, Direct Appeal: W.C. McClain, Assistant Public Defender
Attorney, Collateral Appeals: TBA

Date of Offense: 09/13/2004
Date of Sentence: 10/13/2005

 Circumstances of Offense: 

Jesse Guardado met his victim Jackie Malone in 2004, shortly after he had been placed on conditional release for three separate robbery charges in Orange and Seminole Counties. Malone, a real estate broker-contractor in Walton County, not only rented a house to Guardado but also lent him money occasionally. She also helped him get a job at the local water treatment plant where he worked at the time of the crime.

On September 13, 2003, Guardado wanted to continue his recent cocaine binge and attempted to rob a local grocery store, but he was thwarted by an alert employee. He then turned his thoughts toward Malone, who trusted Guardado and lived in a secluded area. Using his girlfriend’s car for transportation, Guardado collected a metal “breaker bar” and a knife and drove to Malone’s home.

Guardado knocked on Malone’s door and identified himself, asking to use the telephone after she opened her door. When she turned away, he repeatedly struck her with the “breaker bar” about the head. After raising her arms in defense, she fell to the floor where Guardado stabbed her several times and finally slashed her throat. Guardado stated that he thought he would have killed her after the first blow from the “breaker bar”, but “[i]t just seemed not to go that way, she would not die.” Thus, he continued to hit her with the bar and resorted to stabbing her in the heart so it would be over.

After beating and stabbing her, Guardado looked through Malone’s belongings in her room and took her jewelry box, briefcase, purse and cell phone. Police caught Guardado after he cashed some of Malone’s checks and used her cell phone. Guardado confessed and pled guilty to robbery with a deadly weapon and first-degree murder.

An autopsy revealed Malone was alive until the fatal stab wound to her heart. Moreover, the victim suffered from fractures and wounds consistent with attempts to defend herself from her attacker.

 DC Number: 282008 Name: GRIM, NORMAN M Race: WHITE Sex: MALE Hair Color: BROWN Eye Color: BLUE Height: 5’06” Weight: 146 lbs. Birth Date: 06/29/1960 Initial Receipt Date: 12/22/2000 Current Facility: UNION C.I. Current Custody: MAXIMUM Current Release Date: DEATH SENTENCE 

First Judicial Circuit, Santa Rosa County Case # 98-510
Sentencing Judge: The Honorable Kenneth Bell
Attorney, Trial: B.B. Boles&amp;Spiro Kypreos – Private
Attorney, Direct Appeal: David Davis – Assistant Public Defender
Attorney, Collateral Appeals: Jeff Hazen – Registry

Date of Offense: 07/27/98
Date of Sentence: 12/21/00

 Circumstances of Offense: 

On 07/27/98, at approximately 5:00 a.m., a Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Deputy responded to a disturbance call at the house of Cynthia Campbell. Campbell reported a disturbance behind her home, and when the deputy investigated, he found a broken window and a chrome lug nut in the bushes below the window. Campbell’s neighbor, Norman Grim, Jr., invited her over for coffee before Deputy Lynch left.

Two workers from Campbell’s law office went to her house later that morning and found Campbell’s car in the driveway, but no sign of Campbell in the house. The Sheriff’s Office was called and deputies responded to the scene. When deputies questioned Grim about Campbell’s disappearance, they noticed that Grim’s shoulder and cut-off blue jean shorts had reddish-brown stains on them. Grim explained that the stains were primer paint from his car.

In the afternoon of 07/27/98, two fishermen hooked a human body, later determined to be Campbell, wrapped in a sheet, shower curtain, and masking tape. Campbell’s body had deep abrasions and contusions around her shoulders, eyes, forehead, chin, and lips, which were consistent with the blunt force trauma of a hammer. Campbell’s body also had eleven stab wounds to the chest, which, in conjunction with the blunt force trauma, caused her death.

Earlier that afternoon, a former coworker of Grim’s spotted him in his parked car on the Pensacola Bay Bridge, with the car doors and trunk open. Surveillance camera videotape showed Grim entering a convenience store at the foot of the bridge shortly after he was seen parked on the bridge.

Additional forensic evidence was found in Grim’s house: two damp, bloody mops in the kitchen; small areas of blood on the kitchen floor and cabinets; two bloody fingerprints on a box of trash bags; a striped pillow case with blood on it in the kitchen trash; blood spots in the dining room; a pair of blue-jean shorts with blood stains in the living room; bloody athletic shoes; and rope consistent with the rope used on Campbell’s body. On Grim’s back porch, further forensic evidence was found: a green carpet, which matched the carpet used to wrap Campbell’s body; a pair of prescription glasses (with Campbell’s prescription); and a cooler that contained more forensic evidence. In the cooler a steak knife, a piece of cloth with blood stains, a pair of men’s underwear, a tampon with blood stains, masking tape, and a blood-stained hammer were recovered. All forensic evidence contained Campbell’s unique genetic markers.

 GRIFFIN, MICHAEL J 
 Posted in Convict on Death Row by Doc on December 7, 2007 
 

 DC Number: 124518 Name: GRIFFIN, MICHAEL Race: WHITE Sex: MALE Hair Color: BLONDE OR STRAWBERRY Eye Color: BLUE Height: 5’09” Weight: 166 lbs. Birth Date: 12/17/1970 Initial Receipt Date: 07/17/1998 Current Facility: OUT OF DEPT. CUSTODY BY COURT ORDER Current Custody: MAXIMUM Current Release Date: DEATH SENTENCE 

Sixth Judicial Circuit, Pinellas County Case # 95-18753
Sentencing Judge: The Honorable Brandt Downey
Attorney, Trial: Bjorn Brunvand – Assistant Public Defender
Attorney, Direct Appeal: Kevin Briggs – Assistant Public Defender
Attorney, Collateral Appeals: Terri Backhus&amp;Celeste Bacchi – CCRC-S

Date of Offense: 10/07/95
Date of Sentence: 07/10/98

 Circumstances of Offense: 

After graduating from high school, Michael Griffin began working for his father as a service and repair technician at Moore’s Refrigeration. Moore’s dealt with vending companies which needed servicing for vending machines and coolers. One such company was Service America Corporation, where Griffin became familiar with the facility, the employees, and the large amount of cash kept there.

In 1995, Griffin left Moore’s Refrigeration and became addicted to cocaine, selling drugs to earn money to buy more cocaine. Griffin moved in with the man for whom he was selling drugs, Nicolas Kocolis. There he met another addict, Anthony Lopez. Griffin was in financial trouble and decided to steal money from Service America Corporation, which kept large amounts of money collected from their vending machines.

Kocolis, Lopez, and Griffin had planned to steal the money, but then Kocolis decided against the plan. Griffin planned to gain access to Service America’s warehouse through any Service America employee who would recognize him from previous service visits and let him into the warehouse.

On 10/07/95, after one failed attempt, Griffin and Lopez returned to Service America, armed with a 9 mm pistol and a shotgun. They spotted an employee who recognized Griffin and let them in the warehouse. Tom McCallops was accompanied by his wife, Patricia McCallops that evening. Once inside the warehouse, Griffin and Lopez showed their weapons. Lopez forced the McCallops into a cooler while Griffin opened the lockers where the money was kept. Griffin testified at the sentencing phase that while he was opening the money lockers, he heard Lopez shoot the McCallopses with the shotgun. However, other witnesses testified that Griffin told them that he shot the McCallopses with the shotgun after the money was taken, and he also told Lopez to finish the job with the 9 mm.

Autopsies showed that Tom McCallops received a life-threatening shotgun wound to his upper chest and neck and four handgun wounds to his hip, thigh, and head. Patricia McCallops had two handgun wounds, one to the head and one to the chest. Further forensic investigation matched the tire tracks left at the Service America warehouse to the tires on Griffin’s van. Griffin and Lopez were initially implicated in the robbery and murder through a conversation that the pair had with an acquaintance in a bar across the street from the Service America warehouse.

 Codefendant Information: 

Anthony Lopez developed severe mental problems prior to trial. He has been institutionalized in order to restore his competency to stand trial.

Nicolas Kocolis was incarcerated on a probation violation not related to the McCallops murders.

Griffin had previously stolen the LeBaron, which had been used in prior burglaries.

The three proceeded to search for an appropriate target, finally arriving at a Holiday Inn in Newport, Florida, where Griffin had prior successful burglaries. Griffin and Velez entered a hotel room and stole a cellular phone and purse. Tarallo drove while Griffin and Velez divided up the stolen property.

After leaving the Holiday Inn, the three observed a police car. Griffin panicked and told Tarallo to evade the police car. During these maneuvers, another police car, driven by Officers Martin and Crespo, spotted the LeBaron and followed. Tarallo tried to pull over, but Griffin stated that he would not go back to jail and ordered Tarallo to continue evading the police. Tarallo eventually pulled over, and as the three attempted to escape, Griffin began shooting at the police, killing Officer Martin. Tarallo and Velez surrendered to Officer Crespo, while Griffin fled in the LeBaron and was eventually apprehended.

The apartment had been ransacked, and Davidson’s watch, camera, and money clip were missing, although $19,300 in cash and some credit cards remained.

The medical examiner testified that Davidson had bruises on his face and shoulders, three broken ribs, and multiple lacerations on the back of his scalp, caused by a blunt object. The cause of Davidson’s death was drowning.

 Meryl McDonald was convicted of First-Degree Murder and was sentenced to death.
