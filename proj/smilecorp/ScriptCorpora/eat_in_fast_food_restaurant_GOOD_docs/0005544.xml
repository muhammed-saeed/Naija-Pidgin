I&apos;ve been here a lot, and have yet to have a bad experience. I was soo bummed out when Wendy&apos;s left St. Louis, and on cloud nine when they came back!  So, the first thing I noticed when this one opened was that the customer service is always top notch. I assumed it was because they were new and the employees weren&apos;t &quot;worn out&quot; yet. Not so. Rarely do I consistently encounter &quot;nice&quot; employees at a fast food restaurant- but so far so good here. Kuddos to their manager for hiring employees who actually understand what good customer service is.

Anyway, we just stopped in for frosties tonight- really no way to get that wrong. Also- the bathrooms are always clean. For some odd reason, whenever I&apos;m here, I gotta go.

THE FILTHIEST WENDY&apos;S I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.

I feel like Wendy&apos;s ranks kind of low on the fast food totem pole and this one in particular takes the cake for dirtiest Wendy&apos;s (that I have been to). Only reason I came here because it was walking distance down the road - I had no car.  If McDonald&apos;s was closer I would have for sure gone there over this dump.

When you see FLIES buzzing around INSIDE the restaurant - that&apos;s a problem. When there are ketchup smears on the table and food crumbs on the table - someone is not doing their job.

By the way, the Sea Salt fries I had here were kind of soggy. This was also around the time they switched to Sea Salt so I thought &quot;ohh this sea salt is wack, why did Wendy&apos;s have to switch salt.&apos;  But then I got Sea Salt fries at another Wendy&apos;s, in a different state and the fries were fine - crisp, not soggy.

If you go here - I WOULD NOT EAT INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. Why does this place have an &apos;A&apos; rating ? BOGGLES MY MIND.

FAST food implies that you receive your food quickly... well, not at this Wendy&apos;s.  I have given this Wendy&apos;s a couple of tries, as I prefer Wendy&apos;s to other fast food restaurants as far as quality and taste.  However, NO fast food is worth waiting 38 minutes for the employees to make 3 burgers, fries, a salad, and 2 drinks.  NOT complicated.  The staff was completely overwhelmed by people ordering, they could not fix their receipt system, so they had no idea what each person had ordered.  AWFUL experience.  If you are looking for fast food, don&apos;t look here.

Like John Paul I also have very fond memories from a happier younger time in my life.  My memories consist more of going their with my grandmother (Rest in peace) and I going to the one off of lindbergh to get a cup of chilly chicken nuggets and a frosty.

On my last experience at Wendy&apos;s I received what you receive at most fast food restaurants.  A fast meal with little service.  I never expect 5 star service at a fast food restaurant since all the employees there are paid minimum wage.

I only go to Wendy&apos;s for a handful of things.  Them being their chilly, frostys, and a fast cheap meal.

I remember fondly as a kid, getting in my best friends Dad&apos;s T-top Camaro and going to Wendy&apos;s to get curly fries and a Frosty. We never really wanted the burgers, but we ate them. He would take us to guys night out and then we would go watch the planes take off at the airport. This one one childhood memory that is special to me. Wendy&apos;s in St.louis went Bankrupt, I didn&apos;t frequent it often but it was sentimental when I did. Losing them was a loss for me. I happened to drive by the New Wendy&apos;s on Manchester in Rock Hill. I was so excited. I made a u-turn and went for curly fries and a Frosty. When I got to the voice box, I ordered, and was told they didn&apos;t have curly fries, I pressed are you sure. The guy was a total dick, he said no, we have never had curly fries, you are thinking of Rally&apos;s and we are not Rally&apos;s. I was so flustered. I ordered a meal with a coke and a Frosty. When I got to the window, the jerk, and older man who looked like he hated life, with his salt and pepper mustache, was again a prick. He argued with me again, telling me how wrong I was, before he gave me my order, he said, well, maybe back then but definitely not now. I didn&apos;t want to be there. I didn&apos;t want the food. I paid, got the food and drove away as fast as I could. I got to another parking lot, thinking, that sucked, but I have a frosty and my memories. I went looking for my frosty. It wasn&apos;t there. I was pissed off, disappointed and wished Wendy&apos;s had stayed bankrupt. As for the guy at the window. All he did is make me never want another Frosty ever again. I hope he feels right as rain.
After looking at http://Wendys.com , they no longer serve curly fries. And I don&apos;t care. I will never eat there again. I highly recommend you avoid this wendy&apos;s at all costs. Your Childhood dreams may not be at stake, but mine were.
