 Joe Bologna’s 
 18 Aug 
 www.joebolognas.com
 
 Before I start my review, I need to get something off my chest. 

 I consider myself capable of delivering a fair review. I’m not looking to dump on any place in town, especially local favorites and landmarks. I’m not looking to make a name for myself doing this, as I do this for fun and it’s just a hobby of mine. I started this blog because I dine out constantly, and I was tired of reading reviews that were fifteen paragraphs dedicated to the history of the establishment or cuisine of a  particular region, accompanied by seven pictures of the food, then two sentence on the food itself. I never go to a place less than three times before I make up my mind, and none of these reviews are done immediately after visiting a place, so I can go home and collect my thoughts before putting anything online. 

 We’re going to disagree, and that’s fine. No two people love exactly the same thing and I can respect your opinion. However, if the only reason you love a place and defend it is because“it’s been around forever”, well then that’s unfortunate. Many places, including restaurants– ESPECIALLY restaurants–need to either improve or maintain a certain quality standard to their goods otherwise customers will move onto another choice. It’s that’s simple; I’m not going to keep going to a place where the quality has suffered and the price stays the same. There comes a time when even having brand recognition isn’t enough to save a suffering establishment. 

 That being said, if you hated my review of Ramsey’s, don’t read this. 

 I’m sure there was a time where Joe B’s was the best place in town. Heck, it still may be the favorite pizzeria in town for hundreds, even thousands of Lexingtonians. To each his own. However I consider myself a pizza snob, and Joe B’s is not the best pizza Lexington has to offer. 

 It’s a shame. I know how many of you love Joe Bologna’s. It reminds me of when I was younger, when a seafood restaurant back in Mastic which I loved just didn’t keep up with it’s reputation. After a few horrendous meals and a case of food poisoning, I won’t even step close enough to the building to board the windows. You never want to see a childhood memory die, but you can’t put off the obvious forever: Joe B’s just isn’t that good. 

 The garlic breadsticks are an embarrassment. While a healthy portion, with an even more unhealthy portion of butter accompanying it, it’s just bland. It’s inexpensive, however if I’m ordering a garlic breadstick, can I maybe get some GARLIC with it please? A pinch of garlic powder isn’t enough, especially when you cook it before you place it in the oven, burning the powder on top. 

 People flock to Joe B’s for one reason: the pizza. It’s not bad, but it’s not worthy of it’s reputation. My latest visit included ordering one of their“Specialty”pizzas: a four cheese Sicilian pizza consisting of mozzerella, provolone, cheddar and fontinella. After my initial tasting, I knew EXACTLY what it resembled: Stouffers french bread pizza. I’m talking a carbon copy, flavor wise. The difference is two of Stouffer’s french bread pizzas cost $5 at a grocery store, while here a 8×10 pizza costs $10. Now you can obviously put more toppings on your pizza, and I would recommend doing such. In the past I’ve ordered garlic, pepperoni and sausage on a small pizza, and it wasn’t bad. Kat ordered the broccoli and garlic pizza, which comes with white sauce:
 

 She loved the pizza, as it was crisp and not too garlicky. Like I said earlier in the post (and in my profile), I’m a pizza snob who grew up on NYC and Long Island pizza, so while I may not enjoy it that doesn’t mean you won’t. 

 Here’s my real issue with Joe B’s: Stick to the pizza, subs and salads, because the meals are awful. That may sound harsh, but it’s true. I ordered the lasagna on one of my more recent trips to Joe B’s, and I left less than impressed.
 
 
Apologize for the terrible photo
 
 This couldn’t have been a more half-assed, more hastily put together meal. From what I can gather, this must have been put together a few days in advance, maybe the day before I came in. I can picture this sitting in a walk-in freezer, being defrosted in a microwave, cooked in an oven with some sauce and then topped off with some cheese, then cooked some more. The sauce was watery, so it was either cooked with the now defrosted lasagna (most likely) or it is just naturally like that, which I don’t particularly care for either. It was soggy, tasteless, and a complete waste of my money. I’m not even sure it had meat in it. I hate being so critical, but what I hate even more is throwing money away on bad food. 

 I realize that some places prepare their food in advance. Yes, it takes a long time to prepare lasagna. Yes, it takes even longer to cook the lasagna. Yet you have to remember that people are going to your establishment looking to enjoy a tasty, hot meal and they’re willing to pay. I would be ashamed to have served this at my house to guests, and I’ve never even made lasagna before. Unbelievable. 

 Service at Joe B’s is like any other place: You need to go in a certain time. We’ve been there when they’re busy and when they’re dead, and the service has always been adequate. When it comes time to bring you your food, it comes out with minimal wait. When you’re done and waiting for your check and need some boxes, then I hope you have good company since you’re going to be sitting for a while. It’s not that big of a deal, since I’d rather wait for the check than wait for my food. I’ve never had an unfriendly waitress at Joe B’s, so there’s that. 

 Yes,“everyone”loves Joe Bologna’s. Sadly, I can’t join the party. 

 Overall: C-/D+

 Wallace Station Deli&amp; Bakery 
 03 Aug 
 www.Wallacestation.com 

 
 The strongest, most appealing aspect of Wallace Station is not it’s food, but rather it’s ambiance. A setting on which Wallace Station had little effect.
 

 Located on Old Frankfort Pike in Versailles, a drive from Lexington to this small outpost in the middle of seemingly nowhere is an experience that can’t be described in words. The closest one has gotten to illustrating the sheer beauty of Kentucky was“My Old Kentucky Home”, the state poem penned by Stephen C. Foster (albeit without the strong racial overtones of the original version). Enjoy the scenic drive out to Wallace Station, where you’ll be surrounded by horse farms, tobacco plants, corn stalks and tall, stunning trees that line the street. Drive down the other“Scenic Byways”in the area and just enjoy the day, as you take in all that Kentucky has to offer.
 

 Wallace Station has been featured before on Food Channel’s“Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives”, a show which I despise but has a cult following. The show’s host, Guy Fieri, tried the Station’s Big Brown, which I tasted on my latest visit. His garish stamp is prominently featured in the front of the interior, just to the left of the entrance. 

 All the food is locally made, and all the breads and desserts are made on site. All the produce comes from local farmers, and the owners make sure you know that Wallace Station IS Kentucky. The interior is covered with local bumper stickers(political and radio), horse farm memorabilia and“Kentucky Proud”(produce) signs. They have embraced a community that, in turn, has made them one of the more popular restaurants in central Kentucky. 

 Like everywhere else, this would all be for naught if the food isn’t worth your time. In my experiences with Wallace Station, the food was…respectable. My first couple of visits have been fine, however my main gripe lays with the desserts. I’ll get to that a little later. 

 As stated earlier, on this last trip I ordered The Big Brown: a juicy burger with bacon, tomato and ham covered in a white cheddar mornay on a homemade bun. 

 

 This burger was sublime. Cooked medium well, it was a little more well done than I preferred but it was still extremely juicy and tender, with the combination of the mornay and bacon perfecting the sandwich. The ham would have been enough for a sandwich on its own, as it’s so full of flavor it’s a shame it was overpowered by the bacon and mornay. However I absolutely loved this burger, and would recommend it all day, every day. It’s a little expensive ($9; comes with chips) but well worth the price. 

 The sandwiches are gigantic, and that’s not hyperbole. Most contain enough bread for a quarter of a loaf, with enough meat, cheese and veggies to make two meals. Kat ordered the Bourbon Trail Triple Crown: Three slices of white bread, roasted turkey, cheddar, home-made BBQ sauce, bacon, tomato, lettuce and mayo. 

 

 The taste, however, was not to Kat’s liking. It was a little flat, with the BBQ sauce not adding anything. Oddly enough, her favorite part of the sandwich was the tomato, which was one of the freshest she’s even eaten:
 
 Sadly my camera phone is terrible at conveying flavor (and even worse at taking pictures) so you’re just going to have to take my word for it. The difference between a tomato like this and something you may get at other establishments, such as a fast food restaurant, is night and day. When you use local, fresh ingredients, people will pay a little extra if they know they’re getting a better meal. It’s just that simple. 

 On other trips I’ve ordered a Turkey Rachel (Roast turkey, coleslaw, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing on rye) and an East Hampton Ham (Brie, apples, ham and honey mustard on white), and both sandwiches were fantastic. I would have liked a bit more ham for my money, but I was still full at the end. 

 Now the desserts. Like the sandwiches, Wallace Station’s desserts are HUGE. Whether it’s a ginger cookie, a lemon square or a“Danger Brownie”, your dessert is enough for a second (or third) meal. 

 

 I ordered three desserts: a ginger cookie, a peanut butter cookie and the local favorite, a Danger Brownie. Like everything else at Wallace Station, the desserts are made on site, using local ingredients. Well…somewhat local. Maybe someone can explain this to me, but the Danger Brownie includes Jamieson’s Chocolate. It’s‘Kentucky Proud”, but it’s from Ghana. I must be missing something, because I don’t understand how something falls under the“Kentucky Proud”umbrella if it’s from a foreign nation. The Danger Brownie is chocolate, nuts, and fudge topped with a bourbon bonbon and a pecan. 

 Since the desserts are gigantic, they may be forgiven for being so expensive; the brownie is $5 and each cookie is $3. Yet, they’re not that good. In fact I was very disappointed in all three. Out of the bunch, I preferred the ginger cookie, since it was the only one that wasn’t completely dry. The peanut butter cookie vaguely tasted like anything resembling peanut butter, and was rock hard. The brownie was a complete disaster. While it wasn’t overly chocolaty, it wasn’t worth five bucks. It was dry, boring, and just overall“blah”. Overall it was just a disaster. If I order a brownie, I expect it to be moist. Even the bonbon was dry and was void of any chocolate flavor. How do you even manage that? 

 Go explore Kentucky. It’s one of the most beautiful states to just spend a day exploring, and every community has its own flow and attraction, offering outsiders the chance to experience what makes their town special. Wallace Station is a perfect complement to a perfect Kentucky afternoon. 

 Overall: B-
 Minus desserts: A
