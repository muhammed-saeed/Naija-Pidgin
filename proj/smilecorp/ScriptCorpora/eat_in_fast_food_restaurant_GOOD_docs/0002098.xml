 TWO men are on the loose after robbing a jewellery store in Sydney&apos;s Chinatown today, while police have arrested a man attempting to rob a fast food outlet. 
 
At about 1pm today, two men wearing balaclavas entered the Sussex Street jewellery store in Chinatown and used sledgehammers to smash a display case.
 
The men stole a tray of jewellery, believed to be rings, before fleeing in a vehicle believed to be a silver-coloured Subaru Impreza. They are described as being of Asian appearance.
 
Detectives from City Central Local Area Command are investigating the robbery, while specialist officers from the Forensic Armed Robbery Unit are examining the scene.
 
Police want to hear from anyone who was in the Sussex Street area about 1pm or who witnessed the incident.
 
They should phone City Central Police Station via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
 
The robbery comes as a man was charged after an attempted robbery of a fast food restaurant at Rutherford early this morning.
 
About 3am, it is alleged two men gained entry to the restaurant located in North Mall.
 
The men allegedly attempted to force open a safe with a sledgehammer and crowbar before fleeing the shop after their attempts were unsuccessful.
 
About 3.10am, police attended the location and allegedly witnessed the men fleeing the shop. Police chased the two men on foot but lost sight of them in Weblands Street.
 
A short time later a 31-year-old East Maitland man was found hiding under a ute which was parked in a nearby driveway.
 
Police armed their taser and called on the man to come out from under the car. The man complied with police directions and was arrested without incident.
 
He was taken to Maitland Police Station where he was charged with aggravated break and enter with intent and refused bail to appear at Maitland Local Court today.
 
The 31-year-old appeared at Maitland Local Court where he was refused bail to appear at Newcastle Local Court on Monday 14 June.
 
Investigations to identify the second man are continuing and anyone with information about the break-in is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
