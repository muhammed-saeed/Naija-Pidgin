Close your eyes. Imagine for a moment that you&apos;re at work and it&apos;s lunch time. You have an hour to eat and Burger King or McDonald&apos;s simply will not do. You want something delicious, energizing, and healthy. Of course, time is always an issue. So, it has to be FAST.




Before you resign yourself to yet another trip to a fast food restaurant, ordering the same boring thing. Consider Pho 501 in East Hartford, Connecticut. 




Pho, is not a Chinese restaurant. Do not expect to find General Tsao&apos;s Chicken or Beef and Broccoli anywhere on the menu. While you&apos;re at it, don&apos;t think about finding a quiet, secluded spot, either. Pho is ALWAYS packed. The tiny space is filled with tables and chairs like a miniature lunch room cafeteria. It&apos;s loud and it&apos;s busy. Yes, this looks like it may not be worth it, but fight the urge to turn around and leave. You don&apos;t need a lot of patience in Pho, but the little that you do spend there, will be worth it.




Once you sit down, don&apos;t bother asking for a menu. There are really only three things on the menu, two of which are pho, the other is the fresh, shrimp spring roll. So, quickly ask yourself, &quot;Do I want beef or shrimp and do I want a spring roll or not?&quot; The waiters there are lightning fast and will bring you what you ask for in less time than you would be sitting in line at a drive thru.



What is pho? Other than the name of the restaurant, it is a Vietnamese soup that consists of broth, rice noodles, and meat. On a separate plate an arrangement of basil, lime, bean sprouts and peppers will be placed to be added by the diner, according to their taste. Other condiments (Sriracha and hoisin sauce) are on the table along with spoons and chopsticks. 




By now you&apos;re probably thinking, &apos;Wait, I wanted something that was going to fill me up, soup is not filling.&quot; Dash that thought away, the small bowl of pho bo (beef) or pho tom (shrimp) is the equivalent to having a little under a quart of soup, all for the low, low price of $5.50. There is a medium and large as well, however this writer has never been so hungry as to necessitate a half gallon (large) bowl of pho. This soup will fill you up without weighing you down, which means no grogginess after the blissful slurping is complete.




The taste is complex. The broth is light, but rich in flavor. You can taste that it&apos;s been simmering for a while and is definitely homemade. The rice noodles are nothing like ramen or spaghetti. They are light and in no way mushy. Being able to add your own vegetables and condiments means that you will get to have the soup to your liking. There is no way that you will leave unsatisfied.




Also mentioned were spring rolls. If you&apos;re thinking the tiny, fried things that resemble egg rolls, think again. These are soft, filled with lettuce, mint, vermicelli, and shrimp. The wrappers are steamed, not fried and served chilled with a crunchy peanut sauce. Like the soup, they are generously portioned, light and filling without being cumbersome.




What makes this place so great is that it is home made fast food. Once you sit down to a bowl, you&apos;ll know that what your eating was made fresh that day, not sitting under a lamp, or shipped frozen and microwaved for you, you&apos;re not eating a load of processed and preserved stuff that will leave you wishing that you&apos;d decided to skip lunch after all.
