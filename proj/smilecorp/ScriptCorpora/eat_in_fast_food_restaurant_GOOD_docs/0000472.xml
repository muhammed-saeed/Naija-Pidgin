The Holes in Whole Foods

Let me start by stating that I am a fan of Whole Foods Market, and a firm believer in paying more for a tomato that tastes like a tomato. During two recent trips to the new South Miami branch, however, I was surprised to find that a number of items on my shopping list were unavailable. For instance, the store was out of frozen orange juice concentrate (which, if you must know, I use for glazing, not gulping). When they were out again the second time, an employee explained, “We sell a lot of that.” There was no liver on hand in the meat department. Nor chicken wings. Nor beef shank bones for soup. The produce department was out of yucca. Paper plates were in stock, which I considered purchasing, as dishwashing gloves were unavailable.

It was while perusing the spice aisle that a woman approached me and asked if I’d seen any five-spice powder. “No”, I answered, “but it’s a fairly common spice these days. I’m sure they have it.” I was involved in my own search for lemon extract. “That’s what I thought,” she continued, “but I can’t find any.” At this point, having carefully inspected the extract selection in vain, I scanned the hundreds of little containers for five-spice. There was none. “It’s like Baskin-Robbins not carrying vanilla,” she said, and then added that they didn’t stock any frozen blueberry bagels, either. “I’m sure they’ll have five-spice in Publix” I assured her, but at this point my credibility was pretty much shot.

I moseyed to the deli section for a sandwich. They’ve got plenty of cold cuts, which they sell by the pound. A brand new slicing machine. A bakery department’s worth of accessible bread a mere ciabatta&apos;s throw away. But they don’t make sandwiches. Instead, they have pre-assembled subs and wraps in a cooler. The former looked astonishingly unwholesome. The ham, for instance, was two-toned: Pink and gray. But even fresh fillings couldn’t save these monstrosities, as the elongated sub rolls they use are so soft, white, and cheap they make the bread at Blimpie’s seem artisanal.

While driving home, I wondered when it was that orange juice concentrate became so goddamn popular. -- Lee Klein

Delicious Organics is a south Florida based mom and pop with a huge selection of organic fruits and veggies usually well under retail (and even better than farmer&apos;s markets, coops and buying clubs!) and also a great selection of other grocery items and hard to find items. Though there are the occasional out of stock, more often then not there is a comparable substitution. Organic grocery delivery service from the Keys through to West Palm Beach!

I went to WholeFoods and I think the prices are way too high. Thier produce can be found anywhere no one thinks to shop Norman Brothers, its a wonderful store. Everything is so fresh and smart helpful people. FreshMarket is nice but the front managers are way too snobby and need some manners, and a good kick in the butt. By the way I have worked at Freshmarket and you would be surprised at the stuff you&apos;re eating, and what happens to it before it gets out. Stay out of the deli. the cheeses are quite good, but whole Foods is really much freshier.
 
Oh, they are great for rare cheese. The prepared foods are excellent, too, but I find that the new Whole Foods lacks as a pure supermarket...I actually like the Wild Oats a few miles down the highway a little better. 

I too, go to three grocery stores to get what I want...Wild Oats in Pinecrest, Whole Foods, and Publix. I swear, I&apos;m constantly going to the supermarket.
 
Hit Whole Foods Gables last night. They had every rare cheese I was looking for. They probably had 100 varieties!
 
Actually, I&apos;m a firm believer in the new Winn-Dixie, especially when I&apos;m comparing it to Publix. Whole Foods and Wild Oats is another league, still. The Winn Dixie in a not so great area (by the Medical Center - 11th avenue and 11th street - stocked everything I could ever wish to find, much to my surprise. Their organic milk is also for a good price relatively speaking. And they have lots of Hispanic foods as well as standard American. That store feels... so American where so many other American supermarkets fail to give that feeling of abundance and space.
 
The Wild Oats in South Beach is regularly understocked in it&apos;s bulk department and it took 6 weeks to fix the peanut butter machine.
 
Well it&apos;s still new, and Miami&apos;s market and demographics do not necessarily fall in line with their other markets. It may take time for the store to catch on to what people want, and if you want something that isn&apos;t there tell the manager, just like any other store. A employee unpacking boxes isn&apos;t gonna order you yucca he&apos;ll just tell you they sell a lot of that. 
BTW the garbage bags, plates and stuff like that are cheaper at target or big lots than Publix. Publix is great though and I prefer it to Whole Foods or Wild Oats. The only good thing at Fresh Market is the chocolate. For great organic fruits and veggies check out the weekly organic market on Grand Ave just west of McDonald.
 
BTW, their produce section is abysmal too. I go to Whole Foods to get organic goods like baked beans, kidney beans, mustard, ketchup, etc. I go to Fresh Market for their amazing produce. And I go to Publix for garbage bags and paper plates. Sad that I have to go to three stores to do my grocery shopping. Too bad Epicure won&apos;t go organic.
