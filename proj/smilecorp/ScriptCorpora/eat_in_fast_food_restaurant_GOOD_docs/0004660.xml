How To Eat Healthy At Carl&apos;s Jr
 Mark Feldt — Ranked #1 in Eating Out FOLLOW Eating a healthy meal at any fast food restaurant is no easy task. They usually offer maeals that are high in calories, fat, and sodium. Carl&apos;s Jr has plenty of items on their menu that are definitely an enemy of any heathy diet. In spite of all the unhealthy items on the menu, you can get a meal that is not completely bad for you. 
Carl’s Jr is a fast food restaurant chain that was established in 1941. Most of the locations are in the western half of the United States although they have been expanding to other countries in recent years. Carl’s Jr has concentrated its advertising on taste and has never tried to deny that some of their menu items are less than healthy. In spite of some of their over the top menu selections, Carl’s Jr has introduced a few healthier choices in recent years. You can find a healthy meal at Carl’s Jr, but it takes quite an effort.

 Burgers 

The burgers are the main menu item at Carl’s Jr and almost all of them are contain an extraordinary mount of calories, fat, sodium, and just about everything that is bad for you. If you have your heart set on a burger, then the Teriyaki Turkey Burger is one of your better options. It has 470 calories and just 14g of fat. The Big Hamburger is the best choice if you are looking for a more traditional burger. It is not as big as its name, but it only has 490 calories, 18g of fat, and 80mg of cholesterol. Stay away from the other burgers. Most of them have close to 1000 calories and usually contain a day’s worth of fat.
 
 Chicken 

If you prefer chicken to burgers, there are plenty of menu items to choose from, but the healthy options are quite limited. Almost every choice is well over 1000mg of sodium and most of them contain more than 25g of fat. The Charbroiled BBQ Chicken Sandwich is the best choice with 390 calories, 7g of fat, and 70mg of cholesterol. The downside is that it has 990mg of sodium. Chicken tenders are always the menu item to avoid. The 5 piece Buffalo Chicken Tenders has an amazing 3190mg of sodium. That is a day and a half worth of sodium in just one little box.

 Salads 

Carl’s Jr offer several salads on their menu and they are definitely a healthier alternative to the other fast food offerings. The Original Grilled Chicken Salad has just 270 calories, 9g of fat, 850mg of sodium, and 80mg of cholesterol. The Cranberry, Apple,&amp;Walnut Grilled Chicken Salad is also acceptable with 320 calories, 11g fat, 850mg sodium, and 70mg cholesterol. The big difference is which salad dressing that you choose. Certain salad dressings can add another 300 calories and 25g of fat to your salad. The best choice is the Low fat Balsamic dressing. It only has 35 calories and 1.5g of fat per serving.

 Sides 

The side items are bad no matter which direction you go. The Chili Cheese Fries have a staggering 46g of fat and 1710mg of sodium. Carl’s Jr promotes their Fried Zucchini as a healthy choice, but it still has 18g of fat in one serving. If you have you heart set of French fries, the Natural-Cut Fries are your best choice. The medium size still has 21g of fat and 430 calories, but they are better than the other alternatives.

Carl’s Jr has been touting their Low Carb selections as healthier alternatives to the normal fast food selections. Although they are low in carbohydrates, they are still high in other areas. The Low Carb Six Dollar Burger still has 570 calories 43g fat, 1390mg sodium, and 120mg cholesterol. The Low Carb Chicken Club has 380 calories, 26g fat, 960mg sodium, and 95mg cholesterol. Just because it is low in carbohydrates does not mean it is healthy in all areas.

Eating healthy at Carl’s Jr is truly a great challenge, but if you choose carefully, it won’t completely wreck your diet.

I love Carls Jr. However, the nearest one to me is 2 hours away.
Excellent tips.

I have been eating two meals every day at Carls Jr. this week
since there&apos;s one just down the block from where I&apos;m judging a
youth speaking tournament. As a rule, I&apos;m not into eating at fast
food restaurants, but they do come in handy when one has to eat and
run.
