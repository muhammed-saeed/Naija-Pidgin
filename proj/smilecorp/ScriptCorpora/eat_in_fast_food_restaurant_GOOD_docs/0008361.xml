 Who Uses Holy Tea? 
 Watch the Holy Tea online movie and listen to the personal messages from Dr. Miller and his grateful users. 
 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea was formulated by Dr. Bill Miller (Ph.D. Nutritional Science) of Tennessee, USA. It is a unique, holistic, herbal blend of safe, all-natural, USA-grown ingredients designed to gently cleanse the digestive tract and detoxify the body. Holy Tea is a cleansing tea, a detox tea, a weight loss tea, and a great-tasting herbal tea - all wrapped up in each unbleached tea bag.

But, most of all, Holy Tea is a healing tea . Remarkable things happen when you drink Holy Tea every day. It is gentle, yet surprisingly powerful as a colon cleanse, parasite cleanse, Candida cleanse, liver cleanse, kidney cleanse, blood purifier, and whole body detoxifier. You probably won&apos;t need any more antacids, laxatives, stool softeners, psyllium fiber drinks, acne creams, allergy pills, and many other potions and lotions after you start drinking Holy Tea each day.

 Persons who smoke tobacco or other substances (such as marijuana), and persons who are regular drinkers of alcohol (beer, wine, or liquor) can greatly benefit from drinking Holy Tea on a regular basis to cleanse their lungs, keep their body detoxified, and help protect their liver from damage ( cirrhosis of the liver can be fatal). See Holy Tea Ingredients for more about detoxification and the liver-protecting properties of silymarin found in the herbal ingredient Holy Thistle ( Silybum marianum ) which is also known as Blessed Milk Thistle, Marian Thistle, Mary Thistle, Mediterranean Milk Thistle and Variegated Thistle.

The name&quot;Holy Tea&quot;is taken from the traditional name of one of its effective ingredients, a widely-used medicinal herb known as Holy Thistle , and is not intended to imply any religious significance - although grateful users who experienced remarkable health improvements after taking Holy Tea often thank God for this gift of healing! Some want to call it a &quot;miracle tea&quot;, but this cleansing tea is really just a special blend of high-quality herbs, tested and refined over 20 years of use in Dr. Miller&apos;s holistic health clinics. This secret blend produces fast and effective results that no imitator has been able to copy.
 
The directions printed on the Holy Tea packets are very short and simple. We suggest you read this entire page so you have a full understanding of HOW to brew your Holy Tea properly and use it most effectively - and WHY the instructions should be followed carefully. We want to help you avoid any mistakes and gain the most health benefits from using Holy Tea. And every question about Holy Tea we have ever heard has been answered on this page.

 Read This Before You Brew Your Holy Tea 

 DO NOT MICROWAVE the Holy Tea bags or the water used to make your Holy Tea. Do not subject the herbs to excessive heat that could destroy the essential enzymes. Make your Holy Tea with pure, clean, water that has come to a full boil, then remove the heat and let the boiling stop before adding the tea bags. You may re-heat the Holy Tea mixture later, but do not microwave it. Heat it on the stove just to a gentle boil, not to a rapid boil.

 LEAVE THE TEA BAGS IN THE LIQUID TEA when you store it, to keep your Holy Tea infused with the ingredients. If you are not noticing any effects within a few days to a week, you may have forgotten this and have been drinking Holy Tea which is too weak to work effectively.

 DON&apos;T make your Holy Tea TOO WEAK - ALWAYS USE TWO BAGS when you make your Holy Tea mixture. Using one bag will only get HALF as much of the essence of the herbal ingredients into your Holy Tea liquid and into your body, no matter how much or how litte water you use. Drinking Holy Tea which is TOO WEAK cannot produce the desired results.

 DON&apos;T drink your Holy Tea TOO STRONG. It is NOT like regular teas, and you do NOT use one bag of Holy Tea to make one cup or one small pot of tea! Actually, steeping it in a cup would make it too WEAK because it must be steeped FOR 4 TO 6 HOURS to draw out enough of the compounds in the herbs. Follow the directions and use TWO bags to make one whole U.S. GALLON (or 4 metric litres) of Holy Tea, and steep it for at least 4 hours or more.

IF you use two bags to brew and store a QUART (one litre) of the 4x concentrated mixture, pour ONLY TWO OUNCES of the CONCENTRATE into SIX ounces of water or juice or a favorite tea to make your 8-ounce glass of regular-strength Holy Tea. You need to DILUTE it down to regular strength. Your two bags of Holy Tea should last you 7 to 8 days if you are drinking two 8-ounce glasses per day.

 START OUT with HALF the daily dose and drink Holy Tea WITH MEALS. Since Holy Tea has mild but effective laxative and cathartic properties, drinking too much Holy Tea before your body gets accustomed to it (or taking it without food) can cause soft stools in some users. Drink HALF the amount recommended in the Directions for the first day or two, then increase the amount gradually to two 8-ounce glasses per day WITH MEALS. It helps avoid or minimize any uncomfortable &quot;detox effects&quot; when you START SLOW.

 NOTE: Do not mistake mushy, soft stools for diarrhea - which is discussed below. Diarrhea is very watery, very light brown or yellowish in color, and floats. Real diarrhea can be caused by many things such as stress, a change in diet, certain foods, consuming too large a meal or too much fat in a meal, certain parasites and bacteria - and by at least 600 pharmaceutical drugs which list diarrhea as a side effect.

 Using Holy Tea on a regular basis will provide you with so many important health benefits, that it would be a real shame to try it and then stop drinking it just because you thought it gave you diarrhea. IF you experience soft stools, just reduce the amount you are drinking for a day or two, drink it before a meal, and stay with the program, and you will soon see how much better you feel!
 
 IF YOU ARE TAKING MEDICATIONS OR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS... 

 IMPORTANT: Do not drink Holy Tea less than two hours before and 2 hours after you take any prescription drugs, medications, or birth control pills - to allow them enough time to be absorbed and thus avoid the possibility of reducing the effectiveness of the medication. (This does NOT apply to natural vitamin or mineral supplements or herbal remedies, just to man-made drugs which are &quot;not natural&quot;. If it&apos;s a FOOD, the warning does not apply. If you are taking a DRUG, then don&apos;t drink Holy Tea in the same two-hour time period.)

 Directions for Brewing and Using Holy Tea 

How Do I Brew the Holy Tea?

The instructions which tell you how to brew Holy Tea are listed below, but first you need to understand a few important things about using Holy Tea . The following section should answer most of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Holy Tea.

NOTE: The information provided in this web page is &quot;for educational purposes only&quot; and is not intended in any way to be considered as medical advice or a consultation about the diagnosis, treatment, cure, or prevention of any disease. Consult your medical doctor or professional health care provider if you have a medical condition.

 Frequently Asked Questions About Holy Tea 

Does the Holy Tea Get Weaker After Being Brewed and Stored?

After you have brewed your Holy Tea by letting it steep in pure hot water for at least 6 hours or more, you pour the cooled liquid AND the two tea bags into a sealed container (preferably made of glass, not plastic) to store it in the refrigerator. You should keep the two Holy Tea bags in the liquid mixture at all times, which will keep your Holy Tea drink fully infused with the herbal ingredients. There are still more active ingredients to be released from the herbs even after the initial brewing - and even after you have finished drinking all the liquid Holy Tea a week or two later.

When your container of Holy Tea has been emptied, you can remove the wet used tea bags and place them on a screen or a saucer to let them dry out. Once they are completely dry, you can cut the bags open and sprinkle the edible herbs into foods such as soups, stews, sauces or salads. That way you will get the most benefit from each bag of Holy Tea you buy. (Make sure you put the wet bags in a dry, warm place where they will dry out in a day or two, because you do not want to invite any airborne mold spores to start growing on the paper bags if they remain moist for several days. You can dry them in the oven if you prefer, but set the temperature BELOW 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Centigrade.)

How Much Holy Tea Do I Drink? What Is the Dosage?

First, there is no set &quot;dosage&quot; that applies to each and every person. This is a natural herbal product, not a drug. The directions on the label say to drink two 8-ounce glasses of Holy Tea per day with breakfast and supper, plus an optional 4 ounces with an afternoon snack if desired. This is assuming you have made your Holy Tea with two tea bags in a gallon of pure water, which we refer to as &quot;regular strength&quot; Holy Tea.

Note that &quot;strength&quot; is really about how much of the herbal ingredients are getting into your body, and not about how much water is in the glass. If you brew your Holy Tea by using two tea bags in a half-gallon of water, you will be drinking Holy Tea at twice the strength; and if you steep two tea bags in a quarter-gallon (a quart, or about one litre) of water, you will have a Holy Tea concentrate which is four times (4x) regular strength.

Normally, you would use only one-quarter as much of the 4x strength Holy Tea, which would be 2 fluid ounces mixed into 6 fl. oz. of water or juice. But if you want to take a stronger dose, just drink MORE of the concentrated mixture. Put 3 ounces of the concentrate into a glass (instead of 2 ounces) and fill it up with water or juice, and you will be drinking a Holy Tea which is 50% stronger, so you will be taking 1.5 times the regular dose.

Put 4 ounces of concentrate into the glass and your dose of Holy Tea will be 100% more, or twice the regular dose. It doesn&apos;t really matter if you add a little more or less water to the concentrate, because you are still getting the same amount of the Holy Tea herbal ingredients in the glass.

You may need to adjust the amount of Holy Tea you consume daily to suit your own bodys needs. Everyone has a different body weight and body chemistry, and everyone has different levels of toxicity and different health conditions, so you will have to find the amount of Holy Tea per day that works best for you.

Obviously, if you have a larger body, you may need to drink a greater amount of Holy Tea than the directions suggest, just as you need to eat a greater amount of food each day and drink a greater amount of water per day. If you have a lot of impacted fecal matter clogging your digestive tract (i.e. have a bulging belly) you may need more Holy Tea to help clean it out, and you may have to continue a higher dose for a longer period of time. If your body has accumulated a lot of stored toxins over the years, you may need to drink a greater amount of Holy Tea for a longer time.

 We recommend that you START with a daily &quot;dose&quot; of just one 8-ounce glass of Holy Tea per day for one to three days to let your body get used to it so you don&apos;t start detoxing too quickly. (You won&apos;t get the desired results if you only drink half the recommended dose, so do this only during the first few days.)

 Increase the amount each day until you are drinking two or more glasses of Holy Tea per day - which the directions recommend as a typical dosage for most adults. If you do not see or feel the positive effects by then, gradually increase the amount of Holy Tea you drink per day until you find the right amount that works for you. Some users who were constipated have taken a half gallon or more of Holy Tea in one day.

You should also drink lots of pure drinking water every day, especially when you are first starting to drink the Holy Tea and going through the initial detoxification period. Give your body lots of water to help your kidneys flush out the accumulated toxins that are now being released into your bloodstream.

When Do I Drink Holy Tea?

You will get the optimum effects from Holy Tea by drinking it shortly before or after breakfast and supper (or lunch and supper) as the directions suggest. It is best to drink your Holy Tea at a temperature which is close to your body temperature. But you can still drink it hot or cold, and you can still drink it between meals or at night before bed, if you so choose. (But if you drink your Holy Tea without eating some food, you are more likely to experience some soft stools later on.)

Dr. Miller also recommends that you drink an extra 4 ounces of Holy Tea with a snack, if you wish.

You are more likely to get some heartburn relief or minimize acid reflux if you drink your Holy Tea with a meal, as stated in the directions on the label. It is best to drink your Holy Tea with the two largest meals of the day - and especially when you have eaten way too much food at some special occasion. (It may also help to drink Holy Tea to aid your body in detoxing itself from any excess ingestion of alcoholic beverages.)

Since drinking any liquid during a meal will tend to dilute the stomach acid which is supposed to be digesting the food, we suggest you drink your Holy Tea about 15 to 20 minutes before eating, so that the liquid has time to pass through your stomach before you ingest your food. As we get older, we produce less and less stomach acid, which means we do not fully digest our food. This can lead to digestive problems. Dr. Miller often recommends drinking a mixture of 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon of baking soda in a few ounces of water just before eating a large meal. The acetic acid in the vinegar helps digest the food. The baking soda is alkaline, which helps reduce the high acidity of the vinegar to about the same strength as normal human stomach acid.

Digestive ailments can also be caused by not thoroughly chewing our food, because we eat too fast and are often distracted by other things while eating. This sends larger chunks of food to the stomach, where the stomach acid is not able to reach the inner part of those larger pieces of food. So undigested meat and vegetable matter is sent through the intestines, where the meat rots and the vegetables ferment as intestinal bacteria and yeast feed upon it. Several kinds of pathogenic bacteria which produce poisonous toxins feed on undigested animal meat in the colon. And the Candida yeast produce gas when they consume undigested grains and starches and sugars, so if you are getting gas cramps after eating, you may not be chewing and digesting your food properly.

How Long Will 2 Holy Tea Bags Last?

When you prepare your Holy Tea according to the directions on the package, two bags of Holy Tea will produce ONE U.S. GALLON of Holy Tea liquid , which is 4 quarts or about 4 metric litres.

If you follow the directions and drink one 8-ounce glass or mug of Holy Tea twice per day (with 2 meals, such as breakfast and supper) this will last for 8 days. Thus a pack of 8 bags of Holy Tea will last for about one month (32 days). If you drink an extra 4-ounce glass of Holy Tea with a snack then 2 bags of Holy Tea will last about 6 days, and 8 bags (4 U.S. gallons) will last for about 24 days.

The Holy Tea Club supplies the Holy Tea in sealed packets which contain two tea bags each and have the brewing instructions on the enclosed label. When you order a Holy Tea Sample Pack you get two bags, which should last 7 to 8 days if you use them to make one U.S. gallon (equivalent to 4 U.S. quarts, or 4 metric litres) of Holy Tea and then drink two 8-ounce glasses per day.

Even though the directions say to drink two glasses or more of Holy Tea per day, we suggest you START SLOW by drinking only one glass of Holy Tea for the first two to three days, so your body can get used to the Holy Tea and not detox itself too quickly. If you do this, your Sample Pack will last more than 8 days.

When you order a one-month supply, you get 4 sealed packets with 2 bags in each, which means you have 8 bags and can make 4 gallons or 16 litres of Holy Tea. If you drink exactly two 8-ounce glasses per day, your Holy Tea will last for 32 days.

I Have Trouble Drinking Liquids, So How Can I Drink Holy Tea?

You could follow the brewing instructions below for METHOD #2 to make a quart of the Holy Tea 4x CONCENTRATE instead of a full gallon of regular-strength Holy Tea. Then you could add just 2 ounces of the Concentrate to other liquids which you ARE able to consume, such as broths or soups. Or just drink 2 ounces of the concentrated Holy Tea with a meal, if you are able to.
It really doesn&apos;t matter HOW you get the essence of the herbal ingredients into your body, so you could mix 2 ounces of the concentrated Holy Tea with just about any kind of food, such as cereal or porridge or spaghetti sauce or chili. It does not have a strong flavor, so it can be blended without any significant change to the flavor of the food.

Remember to keep the Holy Tea bags in the concentrate after you make it, so that the herbs can keep infusing the liquid and keep it at full strength.

And do NOT put the Holy Tea concentrate into foods before they are about to be cooked at high temperatures. Add it AFTER they have been cooked and cooled to less than the boiling temperature of water (100 degrees Centigrade or 212 degrees Fahrenheit).

We DO NOT recommend eating the fresh herbs right from a new bag, because the ingredients really need to be infused into water for 4 to 6 hours and mixed together to do the proper job. This is not likely to happen if you just put some of the dry herbs into your food. You may get way too weak a dose, or find that the Holy Tea does not work as expected. You can eat the herbs after drying a USED bag. We are saying don&apos;t eat the herbs from a fresh NEW bag.

Can&apos;t I Just Put One Bag of Holy Tea Into a Cup of Hot Water?

To use one bag of Holy Tea to make just one cup of tea would be an expensive way to take your Holy Tea! It is a special kind of healing tea, and NOT a regular kind of tea.

 Two bags should make a whole GALLON of Holy Tea. Using a full bag to make one cup of hot tea would make your Holy Tea too WEAK because it would not steep long enough before it went cold. It normally takes four to six HOURS before a quart or gallon of water is fully infused with the essence of the herbs.

Making Holy Tea by the cup would not allow you to produce a mixture of the proper strength. And you would use up your week&apos;s supply of two bags in one day!

Can I Drink More Holy Tea Per Day?

Yes. But we recommend you start with a small dose and increase it gradually.

Although the directions on the label tell you to drink two 8 fluid ounce glasses per day, we recommend you START with just ONE 8-ounce glass of Holy Tea per day with a meal and see how it affects your body, then gradually increase the amount over a few days to two glasses per day. Let your body get used to the Holy Tea for a day or two, and start to detox gradually.

If you have made and stored the CONCENTRATE of Holy Tea (brewed with 2 bags in 1 quart of water), an alternate method is to START by drinking half as much of the Holy Tea concentrate (ONE fluid ounce instead of two) mixed with the same amount of plain water or regular tea (6 fl.oz.). Then drink one glass of the weaker mixture with each of two meals per day, and gradually increase the amount over a few days to two ounces of concentrate with six ounces of water or regular tea.

Only drink less for two or three days, then start drinking the full dose of two or more glasses of Holy Tea per day, because taking less than the recommended dose will just not get you the desired results.

Everyone is different and may have different conditions. If you are a large person or have a great deal of impacted fecal matter in your colon, which you can see in the form of a bloated belly or midriff bulge, you may need to drink more Holy Tea per day than the directions advise for the typical user. But start with the recommended amount and gradually increase the amount taken per day to let your body get used to the Holy Tea.

It is not harmful to drink larger amounts of Holy Tea than the instructions indicate, but you may trigger some symptoms of a &quot;detox&quot; if you drink too much too soon (see above). If that happens, simply reduce the amount you are drinking. Do not stop taking the Holy Tea, just reduce the amount.

If you are taking your Holy Tea according to the instructions and not seeing or feeling some positive effects after a few days, either increase the amount of Holy Tea you drink per day, or increase the concentration (make half a gallon of Holy Tea with 2 bags, instead of 1 gallon with 2 bags, so you get more of the herbs in each glass you drink).

When Should I Drink the Holy Tea?

The directions on the label tell you to drink your Holy Tea with meals. You can drink the Holy Tea on its own if you wish, but when you drink it just before a meal it helps the food pass through your small intestine more easily and reduces the chance that you will suffer from acid reflux or heartburn.

Two of the herbal ingredients in Holy Tea, Marsh Mallow and Malva Leaf, help coat your esophagus and intestines with a slippery natural plant substance called mucilage which protects the delicate linings and helps soothe any irritation from spicy foods, stomach acids, and parasites.

Acid reflux or &quot;heartburn&quot; symptoms are caused by food being regurgitated from the stomach up into the esophagus, where the stomach acid covering some of the undigested food can cause a painful burning of the lining of the esophagus. Drinking the Holy Tea before a meal can help reduce any irritation caused by ingredients in the food or from stomach acids moving up into the esophagus. This is a better solution than taking an antacid to neutralize the stomach acid, for that would also inhibit the proper digestion of the food in the stomach and send only partially digested food through your intestines.

Remember that drinking Holy Tea on its own between meals (such as before bedtime) may at times cause soft stools or &quot;loose stools&quot;. Do not worry, this is NOT diarrhea , which is very light brown or yellowish in color, looks oily or shiny, and floats - and is VERY smelly. Loose stools are just stools that are softer and smaller than usual. They may be a dark brown or contain black patches. The stools may have a more foul smell because they contain stinky gasses like hydrogen sulphide released by intestinal bacteria acting on undigested food; or because they may contain more of the old and rotten material that is being removed from the layers of impacted fecal matter ( mucoid plaque ) which have built up over the years in your colon and small intestine.

It is GOOD to be removing that toxic waste! That is what Holy Tea is meant to do! But if you do not wish to have loose stools, drink your Holy Tea just before or just after you eat some food - not on its own. Or drink a little less Holy Tea until your stools return to normal (the diameter of a normal stool is half the width of your wrist, and it should be as firm as toothpaste from a tube).

You will get the best results if you keep drinking your Holy Tea. It is better to lower the dosage for a while by drinking less per day than to stop drinking it entirely.

How Long Should I Take Holy Tea?

How long do you need to keep drinking Holy Tea? Well... how long will you be breathing and eating and drinking?

In today&apos;s world, every day you are taking new toxins into your body from your air, food, and water.

If you want to keep eliminating all those new toxins and keep your body healthy, you may want to keep drinking Holy Tea for a long time. If you smoke tobacco, you may want to keep drinking Holy Tea to help keep your lungs and body free of the more than 200 toxins contained in cigarettes. If you are a regular drinker of alcoholic beverages, you may want to keep drinking Holy Tea to help protect your liver from damage ( cirrhosis of the liver is often fatal).

It is generally safe to drink Holy Tea constantly for months or years at a time to help keep detoxing your body of the new toxins you are ingesting every day from polluted air, polluted water, and processed foods with chemical preservatives and carcinogenic food colorings.

After you have fully detoxed your body and cleansed the impacted fecal matter from your colon, you can probably reduce the amount of Holy Tea you drink to just one glass per day, or every second day.

But realize that it took many years to accumulate all that mucoid plaque in your digestive tract that is building up inside your intestines and making your belly bulge out, hindering the passage of waste material, and continually poisoning you with all the toxins that seep into your bloodstream and get carried to every organ and cell of your body. It can take many months to completely remove the build-up of old fecal matter, especially if you have a large belly.
 It is vitally important to your health and well-being (and longevity) that you remove all of that toxic waste that is constantly poisoning you! The mucoid plaque forms a habitat and feeding ground for pathogenic bacteria which excrete their own toxins that can pass through the colon into your bloodstream and be transported to every organ in your body, including your brain.

The greater the build-up, the longer it will take. You should keep drinking your Holy Tea until your belly is as flat as a trim teenager&apos;s tummy.

Maintaining a healthy colon and digestive tract is so vitally important to your health, well-being and longevity, that it is well worth what little effort it takes to drink Holy Tea every day. The cost per day is less than a cup of regular tea or coffee in a restaurant, and you can get your Holy Tea at a discount or even free when you join the Holy Tea Club and recommend Holy Tea to others whom it may help.

Why Should I Keep Drinking Holy Tea?

Think of your digestive tract as being like the pipes and passages in your car engine which carry oil to all the moving parts. When dirty sludge forms in the oil and starts to clog the oil filter, it restricts the flow of the oil which is supposed to protect your engine from seizing up and being destroyed. You would not run your car or truck for years with a dirty oil filter, and a smart car owner would not change the oil only half as often as the manufacturer recommended. Without proper preventive maintenance, your vehicle won&apos;t last very long.

Similarly, why would you want to leave all that dirty and toxic sludge in the &quot;pipes&quot; of your digestive tract for years, until it causes some painful disease - or leads to death by colon cancer? Why would you drink only half of the cleansing Tea necessary to clean out that toxic sludge - or drink it only half as often as recommended in the instructions?

&quot;Preventive Maintenance&quot; for your body will pay off in so many ways. You will be glad you took steps to prevent diseases, rather than suffer from them.

Tips and Warnings

There are some more important tips and warnings to read about using Holy Tea after you read the following Directions for Preparing Holy Tea ...

 Directions for Preparing Your Holy Tea Beverage 

 IMPORTANT: 
To effectively infuse the water with the herbs, the Holy Tea should be steeped in water which is HOT - just under the boiling point - but NOT at a full rapid boil with vigorous bubbling. Boil the water, then take it off the heat for a minute until the bubbling stops.

 DO NOT MICROWAVE the tea mixture or the water. Microwaves OR excessive heat will destroy the important enzymes in the Holy Tea.
If using a kettle to heat the water, then after it has come to a rapid boil let it set for a few minutes to cool a bit so that the bubbles and steam are no longer being produced.

Note that one U.S. quart is equivalent to about one metric litre. Four U.S. quarts or about four metric litres are equivalent to one U.S. gallon. Four cups (8 fluid ounces) equal one quart or 32 fluid ounces, and a gallon is equal to 128 fluid ounces. Thus 128 fluid ounces (1 gallon) is equal to sixteen 8-ounce glasses. This is why two bags of Holy Tea will produce a gallon of liquid Tea, and that gallon will provide you with 16 glasses of regular Holy Tea, which provide for 8 days of use when you drink 2 glasses per day.

Instructions for Brewing Holy Tea

 METHOD #1 - To make the REGULAR STRENGTH Holy Tea . Start by making one OR one-half gallon (that&apos;s 4 quarts OR 2 quarts) at a time. You can start with plain drinking water heated to a boil in a saucepan, or start by making 2 or 4 quarts of your favorite brand of decaffeinated or herbal tea , to which you will later add TWO bags of Holy Tea while it is still hot. Starting with just a half-gallon of water or the regular tea will produce a stronger-tasting and more potent Holy Tea . At first, you are advised to start with a weaker mixture (use 2 bags in one gallon or 4 quarts of water) to get used to the Holy Tea. Later, increase the strength (use less than 4 quarts per 2 bags of Holy Tea) to your personal taste and desired potency.

 METHOD #2 - To make a Holy Tea CONCENTRATE which you can later mix into hot water, other teas, or juices. It is easier to store a quart of the concentrate in your refrigerator than a gallon of regular strength Holy Tea. Start by making just one QUART (or metric litre) or 1/4 gallon at a time. You can start by boiling 1 quart (4 cups or 1 litre) of pure water in a saucepan or kettle, to which you will add TWO bags of Holy Tea .

Starting with just 1 quart or litre of water will produce a very CONCENTRATED Holy Tea which you can later dilute by adding it to other beverages, to your favorite tea, to hot water, or to ice water. Since you have made the tea with only 1/4 of the liquid, it will be 4 times as strong as when made with 4 quarts or 1 gallon of water. So DO NOT drink the dark-colored concentrate by iteself!

Now you can add ONE part Holy Tea concentrate to THREE parts of hot water or hot tea to make the equivalent of one &quot;regular strength&quot; Holy Tea . So to make an 8 ounce mug of regular Holy Tea , add 2 ounces of the concentrate to 6 ounces of hot water or herbal tea.

Using this Method #2 makes it easy to take your cold Holy Tea concentrate from the refrigerator and just pour it into some hot water or regular tea to make a hot Holy Tea . Or you can add 2 ounces of the Holy Tea concentrate to a tall glass of ice cubes, add some sweetener and lemon, then fill with 4 ounces of cold pure water to make a nice iced Holy Tea for the summertime (assuming the ice will melt into 2 more ounces of water).

You could also add 2 ounces of the Holy Tea concentrate to 6 ounces of your favorite fruit juice or vegetable juice.

When using the concentrate, your supply of Holy Tea bags will last for the same period of time, as long as you use 2 ounces of concentrate to make 8 ounces of regular Holy Tea . That&apos;s one part Holy Tea concentrate mixed with 3 parts plain water, juice, green tea, herbal tea, or your favorite regular tea. Thus when you are drinking your 8-ounce glass of Holy Tea, you are using only 2 ounces of the 4x Concentrate in each glass.

 With either METHOD #1 or #2, heat pure water to a full boil in a large saucepan or pot, turn off the heat, and as soon as the fresh water has stopped bubbling, or the regular tea has finished steeping and you have removed the regular tea bags (and have sweetened the tea and/or added lemon, if desired) drop TWO of the Holy Tea bags into the liquid while it is still very hot.

 Always use TWO bags to make a quart, half-gallon, or full gallon of Holy Tea at a time. Adjust the amount of regular tea or plain drinking water in the mixture if desired, but do not use less than TWO Holy Tea bags or you won&apos;t get enough of the herbs for the Holy Tea to be effective! 

 Cover the new Holy Tea mixture and let it sit overnight - or let it steep for AT LEAST 4 to 6 hours - to allow the herbs to fully infuse the mixture. Then, WITHOUT removing the Holy Tea bags, pour the entire mixture into a container with an airtight lid and refrigerate your new batch of Holy Tea. We recommend using a glass container rather than plastic, if possible, because plastics can leach a small amount of harmful chemicals into any liquid.

The Holy Tea herbs inhibit the growth of bacteria, so don&apos;t worry if you leave it out at room temperature for a day or two, but it is still best to keep it refrigerated if you have made enough Holy Tea to last a week or more. If you want to take some Holy Tea with you when traveling by automobile, bus, or train, you could keep the cold mixture in a vacuum flask or any air-tight container. If you are traveling by air and are not permitted to carry any liquids, just take your Holy Tea bags in their sealed packet and make a quart of your 4x concentrated Holy Tea mixture in a clean coffee pot or tea pot when you arrive at your destination.

 Leave the Holy Tea bags in the mixture until you have consumed all of the liquid Holy Tea. The directions tell you this because it helps keep the Holy Tea infused with the herbs and at full strength, and so you can get the most value from each tea bag. Then you can let the used bags dry out on a plate or screen, cut them open to remove the edible dried herbs, and sprinkle them into various foods such as chili, spaghetti, sauces, stews, soups, or salads.

 You can drink your Holy Tea cold or as an iced tea, or even add it to a favorite juice if desired. Some users add 2 ounces of the concentrate to decaf coffee (the Swiss water process is the healthiest, since the other methods leave some chemical residues in the decaf coffee). We do not recommend adding your Holy Tea to regular coffee or any caffeinated drinks because the caffeine causes a loss of water in the intestines, which makes the fecal matter drier and harder and more difficult to pass. This would work AGAINST the purpose of the Holy Tea .

 Remember, DO NOT MICROWAVE the Holy Tea or the water! Microwaves can destroy the natural enzymes and render some important ingredients ineffective (which is why you would be wise not to microwave your meats and vegetables because it destroys natural enzymes in the foods that help you digest and absorb the nutrients).

 If you wish to drink your Holy Tea warm or hot, you can heat it in a saucepan or tea kettle - but do NOT heat the Holy Tea mixture to a high boil, for high temperatures can also destroy enzymes. Or just use the refrigerated concentrate, and add it to hot water or hot tea.

Holy Tea for Children?

Can children drink Holy Tea? Consider this... are you letting your children drink colas and soft drinks loaded with caffeine, phosphoric acid, and sugar or aspartame? Holy Tea will be much healthier for your children than those things!

For legal reasons, we have to recommend that you consult your doctor or your child&apos;s pediatrician before serving Holy Tea to a young child.

But we can tell you that even young children have taken Holy Tea. If you chose to give Holy Tea to your child it would be important to adjust the quantity in proportion to their lower body weight. Smaller bodies should get a smaller amount, just as they should get a smaller amount of food per day. Note that there is NO caffeine in the herbal ingredients used in Holy Tea. 

Pregnant Women and Nursing Mothers

Should a pregnant woman or nursing mother drink Holy Tea? For legal reasons, we can not answer this question nor give any medical advice, as we are not health professionals. We suggest you consult your doctor about any medical questions. When asked this question, Dr. Miller often replies: &quot;Do you want to have your baby born in a clean body or a dirty body?&quot;

 Warning: Holy Tea is a Cathartic 

 Holy Tea contains some natural herbs which act as a cathartic . In medical terms, a cathartic is a substance which ACCELERATES defecation. By contrast, a laxative is a substance which EASES defecation, usually by making the stools softer. Many products sold as &quot;laxatives&quot; are both a laxative and a cathartic. Holy Tea acts as both a mild laxative and a cathartic, but does not contain harsh laxatives like Cassia Senna or Cascara Sagrada - and because Holy Tea does NOT cause &quot;bowel dependency&quot; it is safe to drink it continually for weeks or months or years.

In some special cases, speeding up the flow of digestive waste is not what your doctor would advise under the circumstances. We advise that you consult your health care professional before using Holy Tea if you fall into any of the following groups...

 Women who are pregnant or nursing, persons who are elderly or very young, and persons with an existing medical condition or undergoing treatment with drugs should consult their personal physician before using Holy Tea or any herbal product. (Make a copy of the Ingredients to show to your doctor, if necessary.)

 Warning: If You Are Taking Prescription Drugs, Medications, or Birth Control Pills 

 Do not drink the Holy Tea within 2 hours before AND 2 hours after you take any prescription drugs, medications, or birth control pills. 

The detoxifying effects of the Holy Tea might inhibit the effectiveness of the drugs or medications you are taking. Allow at least 2 hours to permit the drugs to be absorbed before you drink any more Holy Tea. In other words, take your medications at least two hours after the last time you drank Holy Tea, and then don&apos;t drink any Holy Tea for at least two hours after you take the medications.

The Holy Tea stimulates your body to get rid of drug residues, and can have the same effect on prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications that you WANT to help with your healing.

NOTE: This warning does NOT apply to natural vitamin and mineral supplements or natural herbal supplements, but only to drugs which are &quot;man-made&quot; and are therefore not recognized by your body as &quot;natural&quot; substances.

 Suggested Use of Holy Tea 

The directions tell you to drink your Holy Tea with a meal, twice per day. We suggest that you drink the Holy Tea shortly before eating food or shortly after eating. Drinking any liquid while eating will dilute the stomach acid which is supposed to be digesting the food.

Although the directions on the label tell you to drink your Holy Tea with meals, you CAN drink Holy Tea on its own. But if you drink it with a meal it helps the food move through the small intestine and reduces the risk of acid reflux which is actually caused by partially digested food being regurgitated up from the stomach into the esophagus, where the stomach acid covering the food particles can burn the delicate lining of the esosphagus. Taking antacids to neutralize the stomach acid just makes it harder for your food to be digested properly, and may keep it in the stomach even longer.

 Drink about 8 ounces of Holy Tea with meals like breakfast and supper, or lunch and supper. It is best to drink your Holy Tea with the two largest meals of the day. You can also drink an extra 4 ounces of Holy Tea with an afternoon snack or light lunch if you wish.

Also drink your Holy Tea when you have consumed too much food during a meal at some special occasion. It can help avoid cramps and bloating. If you drink Holy Tea after consuming too much alcohol, it can help detox you and lessen the severity of a hangover. Drink lots of water too because alcohol poisoning causes dehydration - and diarrhea.

When you first start drinking Holy Tea, we suggest that you start slow to let your body get used to it. Start with one glass per day with a meal to start detoxing slowly, then over the next few days gradually increase the amount per day to the recommended two glasses per day, one with each of two meals. If you are not seeing or feeling any results within a week, gradually increase the amount until you do.

A standard teacup holds only about 6 ounces of liquid, so using a larger cup or mug may be best.

Holy Tea can be taken cold, warm, or hot - and even makes a nice &quot;iced tea&quot; for the hot summer months. But it is healthier to drink liquids at a temperature close to body temperature, not too hot and not ice cold.

Remember to drink lots of water - at least eight 8-ounce glasses or 64 ounces (2 quarts or 2 litres) per day. You can count your glasses of Holy Tea as part of your daily water intake, but you should NOT count any beverage with caffeine, such as coffee, because the caffeine can cause more water to be lost than the beverage itself provides.

If you need to drink more or less of your Holy Tea beverage, you are free to do so. But remember that it is a cathartic  and detoxifying tea, so it is possible to experience a little discomfort during the first few days when your body is going through the initial cleansing and elimination of accumulated toxins and old waste material. You might feel things moving in your gut, or have a little cramping as things that were stuck start moving out.

When you consider that doctors say 85 to 95 percent of all human diseases result from an unhealthy colon filled with impacted toxic waste, bad bacteria, yeast, fungus, and parasites , it is certainly worth some possible short-term discomfort to help avoid some really painful digestive disorders and other debilitating ailments!

 Cleaning your colon and digestive tract is essential to maintaining good health and a long, active life. Keep drinking your Holy Tea according to the directions, and soon enough you will be feeling the positive effects of detoxifying your body - such as more energy, more mental clarity and focus, and perhaps relief from some ailments that were being caused by toxins, bacteria, yeast, and parasites.

After starting to drink Holy Tea you will likely be going to the bathroom more frequently. Don&apos;t worry, you won&apos;t have to run to the bathroom! And don&apos;t worry about having an embarrassing &quot;accident&quot;.

Holy Tea does not cause diarrhea or watery stools, though it will probably make your stools softer and perhaps smaller or thinner. If they get too thin or watery, reduce the amount of Holy Tea you are drinking per day. Eating an apple and its skin on can help absorb excess moisture in the colon. which helps make the stools firmer.

Remember that some of the herbal ingredients in Holy Tea have a very effective laxative effect, and drinking too much Holy Tea can sometimes result in soft stools, especially if you drink it too long before or after eating some food.

Unlike many laxatives and cathartics that can weaken the ability of the muscles of the intestines to contract and keep the fecal matter moving (through the action called peristalsis ), Holy Tea does NOT create a bowel &quot;dependency&quot; and is safe to use over a long period of time. Holy Tea does NOT contain the irritating herbal laxatives Cascara sagrada (California Buckthorn) or Senna (known as Cassia Senna or Cassia angustifolia or Cassia acutifolia ) which have been known to cause bowel dependency if used for more than a week.

Holy Tea is very effective, yet more gentle than most colon cleansing teas and detoxifying products.

You will just be getting a natural urge to go more often than before - perhaps two to three times per day. That is NORMAL. Going once every second or third day is NOT NORMAL and not healthy. Going only once per week, or even less frequently, means you would be wise to call your doctor as soon as possible.

But if you are drinking Holy Tea, your constipation is likely to be relieved rather quickly, perhaps overnight. After a while, you may also see a reduction in the number of times you suffer from acid reflux, heartburn, abdominal cramps, and excess gas or bloating. After using Holy Tea for a time, you might see these ailments just disappear as your colon and small intestine are restored to their normal healthy state.

It is unlawful to make any &quot;health claims&quot; for any herbal product, so we cannot imply that Holy Tea will prevent, treat, or cure any disease. It merely supports your body in restoring itself to an optimal healthy state.

Restoring &quot;Regularity&quot;

You might think that sitting on the toilet two or three times a day would be inconvenient and would take up too much time. But think about this... after drinking Holy Tea your bowel movements will be comfortable, quick and easy. 

If you were constipated before, you may have set up a magazine rack in the bathroom because you would have lots of time to read while sitting &quot;on the throne&quot;. Or maybe when you went to the bathroom at a social event, you would be gone so long that a search party came looking for you!

Please understand that it won&apos;t be that way anymore. The hardship has passed. You can live like a &quot;regular&quot; person now.

After taking Holy Tea, you will probably have a bowel movement first thing in the morning. You feel a normal urge to go, so you go to the bathroom, sit down, and the softer and narrower stools just come out on their own, with very little waiting. No pushing or straining necessary. It can all be done in only a few minutes when your colon and rectum are working normally.

You may then have one or two more bowel movements during the day, as the food you ate a few meals ago makes its way through your digestive tract more quickly and easily, has much of its water absorbed by the colon, then gets compacted and collected in the rectum, ready to be evacuated when there is enough to create the feeling that it&apos;s time to go to the bathroom.

Though Holy Tea is gentle, it also acts very quickly. You may feel that something has changed the same day or the next day. In a few days or a week you may notice you are feeling somewhat better.

You may seem more &quot;focused&quot; or &quot;clear headed&quot; and may seem to have more energy to do things. Instead of avoiding doing things you really would like to do because you were just &quot;too tired&quot; to do them, you may find that you have more energy to do things and can live life to the fullest.

If you have been suffering from food allergies; or over-sensitivity to tobacco smoke, perfumes, or chemicals in the air; or allergies to pollen and grasses, then your might find that your allergic reactions have lessened or gone away. The Candida yeast can release over 70 types of allergens and this MIGHT have been the underlying cause of your allergies. Allergens from Candida yeast can cause symptoms of itching, hives, skin rashes, nasal congestion, cough, bronchitis, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome.

If an overgrowth of yeast or a Candida infection has been the root cause of female cycle disorders or male dysfunction then you might see things improve as the yeast overgrowth is brought back to normal levels. You might have more interest and more energy when it comes to your sex life.

As your colon is cleansed of more and more of the layers of mucoid plaque that restricts the movement of waste, and your digestive tract returns to optimal health, the waste will start passing through you more quickly, as it should. Eventually you may find that you are eliminating food you ate only 12 to 15 hours earlier, and you will be going to the bathroom two or three times a day, perhaps after every meal. Just like a healthy baby with a brand-new, clean colon!

Welcome to the world of &quot;normal&quot;. It&apos;s just too hard to be constipated!

And welcome to The Holy Tea Club !

 Holy Tea Movie with Testimonials 
 
 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea may also be used as an element in any Weight Loss Program and is much more effective than Chinese Tea or Green Tea or Wu Long Tea or Rooibos Tea. Just drinking Holy Tea regularly often results in a reduction in the amount of stored fat in the body, and a significant reduction in the size of the abdomen or belly. For some people, the weight loss has been achieved quickly and rather dramatically (see the Holy Tea Testimonials ), but individual results will vary.

 When the excess weight is actually from pounds of impacted fecal matter stuck to the inside wall of the rectum, colon and small intestine, no amount of dieting or fat loss or exercise can reduce the size of the belly.   But Holy Tea can! 
If you have bloat, midriff bulge, a &quot;beer belly&quot;, a &quot;pot belly&quot;, or a protruding abdomen, then drinking Holy Tea can help you shed pounds and lose inches around your waist, without dieting or changing your eating habits. (See Bulging Bellies .)
 
 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea is a safe, mild, all-natural, detoxifying health tea. It is gentle in its action, yet more effective than most other colon cleansing teas, colon cleaner products, laxatives, and detoxifiers. Holy Tea has a dual action: (1) colon cleanse, and (2) whole body detoxifier. It&apos;s also a very good-tasting herbal detox tea which is simple to use - you just drink 8 ounces twice per day with meals!

No restrictive detox diet, no diet pills, and no complicated procedures. Just take the Tea. You don&apos;t even have to drink it with meals, but doing so could help provide heartburn relief or reduce acid reflux.

Holy Tea LOOKS like any other herbal tea, but don&apos;t be fooled. Just two of those Holy Tea bags make ONE GALLON of Holy Tea - an 8-DAY supply! And this is a HEALING TEA. Most people feel positive effects within a week, and often within a day or two!

 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea - The Bottom Line 

 Holy Tea contains only safe, natural ingredients and is made from the finest quality edible herbs found in Nature. All the herbs are grown pesticide-free in the USA in the southeastern states of Georgia and Florida.

 Holy Tea contains NO caffeine, ephedra, stimulants, drugs, harsh laxatives like Cascara or Senna, salt, sugar, pesticides, harmful chemicals, or fillers. 

 Holy Tea has no harmful side effects. There is no discomfort, and no constant running to the bathroom. It softens hard stools, but does not cause diarrhea. It helps you get back to having two to three quick and easy bowel movements per day, the way you are supposed to.

 Holy Tea contains well-known herbs which have been used safely for hundreds of years, and have been the subject of various scientific research studies in recent years. It is the quality and the precise combination of these herbs which makes Holy Tea unique and effective. The secret formula has been imitated, but no one has been able to produce a product as effective as Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea .

 Holy Tea helps you lose weight, reduce fat, and lose inches off your waist without any change in diet or depriving yourself of foods you like to eat. It can be used alone, or along with another weight loss program. Much of the weight and inch loss is due to cleaning out pounds of impacted fecal matter and parasites from inside your colon, something which no fat loss diet can achieve.

 Holy Tea provides the very best colon cleanse and body detox available today.  And it helps remove toxins from every place in your body - organs, tissues, blood, fat cells, and your entire digestive tract. It is also a gentle yet effective parasite cleanse, Candida cleanse, worm remedy, and herbal home remedy for heartburn, acid reflux, gas, bloating, constipation and various colon diseases.

 Holy Tea supports the body in detoxifying and healing itself of all kinds of ailments caused by:
(1) toxic build-up of decaying impacted fecal matter in the intestines ( mucoid plaque ) and the resulting autointoxification;
(2) bacteria, yeast, microbial parasites, amoebae, worms and flukes; and
(3) the poisons and toxic compounds released by some of these bacteria and other microbes. 
Restoring the colon, liver and kidneys to a healthy state reduces the risk of many painful and potentially fatal diseases.

 Holy Tea is made by a hands-on expert in Nutritional Science who actually cares about your health . Dr. Miller has devoted his entire professional life to researching, formulating, testing, and perfecting this remarkable healing tea while working with clients at his two holistic health clinics.

 Holy Tea has been used successfully for over 20 years at Dr. Miller&apos;s two health clinics in Tennessee.

 Holy Tea has been proven to work. Just ask his thousands of happy clients!

 Dr. Miller has hundreds of testimonials from grateful users of his Holy Tea. You can read some of their testimonials , or hear them in the online video.

 Holy Tea is convenient and easy to use. It&apos;s as simple as making a gallon of tea, then drinking two glasses per day.

 Holy Tea tastes very good. It is clear and flavorful just like any good herbal tea. And you can mix it with herbal teas, decaf teas, or juices to suit your taste. You can vary the strength, and you can drink it hot or cold. You can even open the dried used tea bags and add the herbs to foods like salads, sauces, soups, stews, or chili.

 Holy Tea is very affordable. It costs less than over-the-counter remedies or prescription drugs that do less for your overall health. Two daily servings of Holy Tea cost about the same as buying just one regular tea or coffee per day at a fast-food restaurant. When you see and feel the results, you will realize Holy Tea is worth a lot more than you pay for it.

 Holy Tea Movie with Testimonials 
 
To keep this information from being told far and wide would be a shame - especially in the United States, where Irritable Bowel Syndrome cannot be cured, diabetes is rampant, the incidence of allergies is accelerating with the cause being unknown, and over-the-counter drugs are a multi-billion dollar business. We ask: &quot; Where is the HEALTH? &quot;

It looks like the &quot;wellness&quot; industry is really the &quot;illness industry&quot;. Giant corporations earn billions of dollars selling products that deal with symptoms of sickness but don&apos;t deal with the underlying cause of the sickness itself. Healthy people don&apos;t buy drugs, so why would they want you to become healthy?

 Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea is designed to initiate the restoration of health and well-being. It works on causes rather than symptoms, and as your body heals itself the symptoms sometimes just go away. Getting back to health means getting away from dollar-draining drugs and budget-breaking medical treatments. And you get your life back. The long and healthy life you were meant to live.

In the USA huge amounts of money are being spent on...

 Antacids: $1 billion Laxatives: $850 to $900 million Antihermorrhoidals: $250 million Antidiarrheals: $100 million

But the healthy people aren&apos;t the ones spending all that money. Gaining your health can stop draining your wealth.

It would be reprehensible to deny health to the multitudes looking for something, anything at all, to relieve their suffering and make them feel better - and stop feeling so sick and tired.

Why is the U.S.A. the world leader in deaths by cancer and nearly every other disease; while China has 1.5 billion people who remain healthy simply by drinking tea? Dr. Miller has a patented Tea. But not just any Tea. This Holy Tea not only has an enzyme that works on the toxic waste in the small and large intestines, but on every organ in the body. Each organ is connected to the colon, either directly or through the bloodstream.
 
We have the choice to drink a marvelous Holy Tea which can help improve our physical health and mental clarity and give us a new outlook on life. Or we can choose to look forward to every kind of illness one can imagine.

 If you&apos;re sick and tired of being sick and tired , it&apos;s time to try Dr. Miller&apos;s Holy Tea !

Holy Tea is a natural food, not a drug, and this general information is not intended to provide any diagnosis, treatment, or cure. If you have a medical condition, consult your personal physician or health care practitioner.
 

 This food product contains natural herbs which act as a cathartic (i.e. increases rate of waste excretion). Women who are pregnant or nursing, elderly persons, young children, and individuals suffering from any illness or health condition should consult with their personal physician prior to using this or any herbal supplement.

Holy Tea stimulates your body to detoxify itself by eliminating all toxins and foreign substances, which may include drug residues and even current pharmaceutical drug medications. If you are taking medications, we suggest you do not drink Holy Tea for two hours before and after you take your medication, to avoid weakening the effect of the drugs.
