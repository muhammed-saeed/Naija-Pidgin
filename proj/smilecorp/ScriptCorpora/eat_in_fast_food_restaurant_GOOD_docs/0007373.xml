 Funny Story. Menu: 3 chicken strips for $3.99 
 3 chicken snackers for $2.98 (basically, three chicken strips with lettuce, sauce, and bun) Me: I would like 3 chicken snackers without the bread please.

Employee: then that would be 3 chicken strips

Me: No, I want 3 chicken snackers without the bread because it is cheaper that way.

Employee: But, I would have to charge you for the price of the 3 chicken strips since you don&apos;t want the bread

Me: Ok then give me 3 snackers and I will take off the bread my self....no lettuce or sauce then.

Employee: let me ask my manager.

Me: Let ME talk to yoru manager, I am pulling up

Manager: you want 3 chicken strips?

Me: No just give me 3 snackers with no sauce or lettuce.

Manager: ok

ME: rolling my eyes as I am throwing the bread away and eating my chicken strips!!!!!!! …

 For more than 60 years, this all-American institution has been serving its signature chicken and home-style sides.. In Short 
Established in 1939, this fast-food restaurant still makes its legendary fried chicken with the closely guarded blend of 11 herbs and spices originally created by founder Colonel Sanders. Modern additions to the menu include oven-roasted renditions of its chicken sandwiches, popcorn chicken, potato wedges and wraps. Classic sides include flaky, oversized biscuits, steaming-hot mashed potatoes and gravy, smoky-sweet baked beans and crisp, generously dressed coleslaw. Kids and adults love the &quot;little bucket&quot; parfaits of pudding desserts. …

 dirty, loooong waits, out of original chicken a lot. this location is horrible, my husband and i might not even return!! this weekend we went to pick up their summerfest special and it took 30 minutes to get our order filled! the line was so long in the drive thru that we went inside. only 2 people were working and the cashier kept messing up people&apos;s orders. they were out of original chicken, just like the last time we were there! our biscuits were overcooked and cold when we went to eat them, yuck! i usually LOVE their biscuits. a few weeks before when we were there every single table was dirty, even though there was only one other couple eating there at the time. one of their workers was on break and sleeping on the tables where people eat. Meanwhile their manager talk to the man sleeping and left. she obviously didn&apos;t care. seems like a management issue, so i let corporate know. take your money elsewhere. …
