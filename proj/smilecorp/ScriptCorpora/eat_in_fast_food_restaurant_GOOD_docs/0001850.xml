 PROCESS 

 Each member will act out one of four roles: 
 
 
 
Role 
Goal 
Marketing Director 
To advertise and promote your restaurant 
Nutritionist 
To provide your customers with well-balanced meals 
Entrepreneur 
To organize and manage your restaurants needs 
Customer 
To patronize the restaurant and supply ideas for a new menu item 
 

 Five class periods will be allotted to work on the project. If additional time is needed, the team is expected to do the work outside of class. After selecting your restaurant, review the background information for that particular restaurant. This will help to give life to the statistical research you will do in the WebQuest. 
 
Marketing Director

 The Marketing Director will create a brochure highlighting the restaurants strengths. This may include data on history, cleanliness, employees, atmosphere, menu items, etc. This brochure will also include promotional items and special offers and discounts. The Marketing Director should also type a business letter to the CEO stating ways in which the business can improve. Support your findings with the evidence that you have collected. Give your recommendations of steps that your restaurant should take to change the conditions in order to improve its image. 
 
Nutritionist

 The Nutritionist must use ratios and percents to compare the daily nutritional requirements to those received in a standard fast-food meal. The Nutritionist must also find the most healthy and most unhealthy meal at the restaurant. The findings must be put in spreadsheet form and charts must be created to illustrate the results. 
 
Entrepreneur

 The Entrepreneur will chart the stocks trend over the last year. How does this stock compare to other fast-food restaurants? Charts should be used to show comparison. How many locations are there for your restaurant? This must be done in database form. 
 
Customer

 The Customer must take a poll of the members of your class for their favorite menu item at your restaurant. Are there other menu items that the restaurant should offer? Your findings should be done in spreadsheet and chart form. Using this information and any other resources, the Customer must develop a different menu item not offered at the restaurant that will be submitted to the CEO for approval. Your new product may be done in a computerized art form or explained by using descriptive terms. 

 After all team members have presented their information to the group, your team must summarize your findings in a slide show. Working together as a team, a 5-minute computer generated slide show presentation (8-12 slides) must be prepared and presented to the class for evaluation. Include one or two slides on historical facts about the restaurant. Also include the factual findings from your research, the charts, and any explanations and conclusions.
