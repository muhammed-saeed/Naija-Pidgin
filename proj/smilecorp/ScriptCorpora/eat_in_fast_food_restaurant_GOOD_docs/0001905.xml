 just went to this Smiths Fish&amp;Chips along Tanjong Katong for dinner this evening. They claimed to be British Authentic Fish&amp;Chips.

Long queue for food and for table. Very crowded. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and about another 5 min for our food (order was placed immediately upon arrival there). Tables are free-seating, much like food court, so there are people standing around waiting for others to finish.

Quite a few type of fish are on the menu including cod, haddock, plaice, halibut, dory, etc, plus chicken&amp;sausage for non-fish lovers. No Tartar sauce, just salt&amp;vinegar. The food are wrapped in paper, british-style, no plates.

We did not try their pickled eggs and pickled onions. Not daring enough 

the fish was nice&amp;fresh. definitely worth the wait.

 What&apos;s the price point? Expensive?

That&apos;s quite reasonable. Another place to try out.

 Hi tankee, thanks for the suggestion!
I will be going to siglap for massage tomorrow and was wondering what to eat until i saw your post.
Will definitely drop by tomorrow to eat.
Thinking of the cod and chips and the fried mars bars (i read about the fried mars bars on ieatishootipost.sg) really make my mouth water.

 Fried mars bar? Sound tempting and scary at the same time.

How was it done? Covered in same batter as the fish?

 Finally made my way to the eatery.
Free seating as mentioned by tankee.
Some seats were inside and others outside.
Menu is on the wall.
Go in and order like a fast food restaurant and they will call your number when order is done.
Ordered a cod and chips for $17- it was delicious and the meat was thick. The batter was unique.
Battered mars bars were delightfully sinful - $5.

Things that i did not like were
1. No chilli sauce
2. No tartar sauce
3. Fish wrapped up in paper, no plates given so difficult to eat when it is windy.
4. Too much salt in the fries.
5. For that amount of money paid, i would expect better service.

Will I return for more?
The answer is likely no, unless i happened to be in the vicinity and other food stores are crowded.

 Will drop by and try their fish&amp;chips, seems like there&apos;s quite a lot of positive ratings on it.
