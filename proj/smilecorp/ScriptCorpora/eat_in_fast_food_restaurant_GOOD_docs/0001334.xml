How to obtain used cooking oil from a fast food restaurant.
 With today&apos;s rising fuel costs, and the promise of homemade or readily available &quot;biodiesel&quot; for diesel engines, I was wondering if someone could make an instructable on how to get used cooking oil from a restaurant- most likely of the fast food variety. Used cooking oil is in excess in these restaurants yet it is a valuable resource to be recycled in diesel engines.

Probably the best thing is to just tell the manager you&apos;ll give him 20 cents a gallon. You might try smaller &apos;mom and pop&apos; fish places. THey use lots of oil too. Reply
