 Background Edit 

 Political views Edit 

Randy Marsh is shown to be an actual liberal. He often fights for huge changes and only turns to conservatism when he is in a major problem, goes into an obsession stance, or misunderstands something. His liberalism is first seen in &quot; Spontaneous Combustion &quot; when he tells the people of South Park that they have to fart all the time in order to avoid being burned alive. He was also shown to support the people of the future in &quot; Goobacks &quot; and thinks of them just as normal people. He even grounds Stan after he calls these people Goobacks in a fast food restaurant but his grounding was lifted after Randy loses his job to one of those people from the future. In &quot; About Last Night &quot; Randy&apos;s political views are confirmed after he is seen supporting Obama.

 Masturbation Edit 

As first seen in &quot; Two Guys Naked In A Hot Tub &quot; Randy has a very unhealthy addiction to masturbation. He often masturbates without thinking straight and becomes obsessive on whatever he is masturbating on. In the episode &quot; Scott Tenorman Must Die &quot; he was watching Mrs. Tenorman take her bra off. Later, in &quot; Over Logging &quot;, he sneaks in the room where the internet is hidden then he goes on it and starts looking at unusual pornographic material and in &quot; Crème Fraiche &quot; he was beating it to cooking shows. This soon became an obsession and it forced Sharon to give Randy an &quot;old fashioned&quot; in order to end his obsession and save their marriage.

 Alcoholism Edit 
 Randy and his &quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism Added by Toadstool In &quot; The Red Badge of Gayness &quot;, &quot; Clubhouses &quot; and &quot; The Losing Edge &quot;, it was hinted that Randy has a drinking problem. This drinking problem (although in &quot;The Red badge of Gayness&quot;, it was shown that most of the men in the town are involved in the manipulation by Cartman . Cartman also mentioned it in the episode &quot; Grey Dawn &quot;, at one point stating, &quot; Looks like Stan&apos;s dad&apos;s been hitting the bottle again. &quot; His problem was more closely examined in &quot; Bloody Mary &quot; after he was caught drunk-driving. He soon got a D.W.I on his criminal record and was found guilty of it. The judge then revoked Randy&apos;s license, made him go around schools including South Park Elementary to explain to kids why heavy drinking is bad, and sentenced him to 2 weeks of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. As a result of the A.A meetings, Randy misunderstands the concept of Alcoholism and believed that only spirituality can cure him of this.
He has been depicted as everything from a casual drinker to a heavy alcoholic. He still isn&apos;t as bad as Kenny &apos;s father, Stuart McCormick , as, unlike the latter, he is sober most of the time. He also had a job until he got himself fired in &quot; About Last Night &quot; for a drunken tirade directed toward his boss. (It reveals again, though, that he was re-hired as a Geologist in You Have 0 Friends ). It appears Randy Marsh is a binge drinker - one who stays most of the time sober but drinks heavily at suitable instances. He might have a family history of alcoholism because his son Stan was seen getting drunk in order to avoid his cynicism. It may be that Randy had the same problem Stan had and that Randy was constantly drinking to avoid hallucinating and seeing the entire world as a huge mass of excrement. This might mean that Randy was also diagnosed with cynicism and that his immature and dumb behavior might have been caused by the side effect of the alcohol he was consuming to cure him of his cynicism.

 Marijuana Edit 

He appears to be extremely drawn to marijuana, going as far as to intentionally giving himself cancer just so he could get his hands on legal marijuana. He tried many ways to get cancer, such as smoking, getting a tan, and attaching cell phones to his face. He eventually came up with the idea of sticking his testicles in a microwave, as seen in &quot; Medicinal Fried Chicken &quot;, just to get weed. Ten other men, including Jimbo and Ned , soon follow Randy&apos;s example.

Despite being drawn to marijuana in aforementioned episode, he seems to display some level of contempt for it in &quot; My Future Self n&apos; Me &quot; as not only do he and Sharon hire someone to scare Stan from drugs, he also is the one to defame mairjuana at the end, however, it&apos;s possible Randy simply does not want Stan to end up like himself.

 Musical Talent Edit 

It appears Randy Marsh is very musically talented. He is a good singer and he can play guitar really well as seen in Guitar Queer-O and Over Logging . He also sung and played the guitar in You&apos;re Getting Old , but this was not a display of good talent.

 History Edit 

It is also implied in &quot; Die Hippie, Die &quot;, that Randy and his wife, Sharon used to be hippies , and they met at Woodstock in 1969. If this were the case, though, they would be in their mid-forties to mid-fifties. But Randy stated in one episode in Season 9 that he was thirty-five years old, so this may have been simply a cutaway joke. Also, Randy and Sharon were revealed to have met in a tree-fort playing Truth or Dare, in the episode &quot; Clubhouses &quot;.

Randy tells the other adults in town, at the end of &quot; Child Abduction is Not Funny &quot;, that he studied Mongolian in college, possibly minoring in the subject. He then speaks it to the children, who have joined a tribe of Mongolians. However, it appears that he doesn&apos;t apply his knowledge of the language to his life, as this is the only time he is heard speaking it. He may also have a PhD in Geology as he has been called Dr. Marsh on two separate occasions (although one of those times was himself).

In &quot; Make Love, Not Warcraft &quot;, Randy makes a World of Warcraft account (which is named Falcorn and is a level 2 human hunter, which is not possible in the actual game at the time of the episodes creation.) after seeing his son Stan play it.

In &quot; Pinewood Derby &quot; he made Stan cheat in his derby race, accidentally discovers warp drive, and consequently becomes first contact for aliens coming to Earth. He and the leaders of the world keep trying to cover their lies. He grounded Stan for telling the truth, however, he and the others lied to the aliens. As punishment for failing that test so badly, Earth and the Moon are permanently enclosed in a gigantic, cubical force field and isolated from the rest of the Universe — to which Randy says, &quot;Well, that sucks.&quot;

Randy is named after, and based upon, Trey Parker &apos;s father, Randy Parker. Randy Parker is also a geologist.

 Vehicles Owned Edit 

Randy has driven red sedans, Lexus RX300s, and Lincoln Navigators. In &quot; Smug Alert &quot;, he is seen driving a Honda Civic Hybrid.

 Careers and Occupations Edit 

Randy is a geologist. He also serves the City Council .

 Boy-Band Singer Edit 
 Randy in his band Added by Wilhelmina Will In &quot; Something You Can Do With Your Finger &quot;, Randy reveals to Stan that he was in a boy band when he was eighteen, after having been in a choir during high school. He was so eager about this new career, that he dropped out of school, left his girlfriend and his family, and immediately joined up. The name of his band was The Ghetto Avenue Boys, which is meant to be a parody of The Back Street Boys. They had a hit single, &quot; You Got It &quot;, and they made millions, living in a big mansion with dozens of women sharing his bed with him at once. But one year later, all of the group members were fired for being too old for a boy band, despite the fact that Randy was only nineteen at the time. Randy was in debt to the studio, and in order to make up for it, he had to give up all of his possessions. He then returned home at last, and used up what money he had left resuming his education.
An interesting thing to note is that Randy is shown to be very proficient at the guitar in &quot; Guitar Queer-o &quot;. He also mentions in that episode that he knows how to play several famous rock songs on the guitar, such as Carry On Wayward Son by Kerry Livgren. 

 Geologist Edit 

Ever since his first appearance, he has been shown to be a geologist. In later seasons, notably in the season 8 episode &quot; Goobacks &quot;, he is known to be a worker for the United States Geological Survey. He became famous for his theory on moderation in the episode &quot; Spontaneous Combustion &quot;, and won the Nobel Prize Award for it. He is often called upon to perform many scientific tasks, due to his education and positions. He usually is unable to perform the tasks, though, despite the fact he is a geologist and thus has a high level of understanding of many areas of science, including chemistry, biology, physics and mathematics. However his skills in geology might not be that good as well, as in &quot; Volcano &quot; he had to call someone to figure out why the &quot; needle thing &quot; was moving and what it meant when the mountain was smoking, and even after discoving it was a Volcanic Eruption, he casually finishes his coffee first.
He lost his job in &quot; About Last Night &quot; for verbally and physically abusing his boss and then punching him, obviously mistaking him for a McCain supporter while he voted for Obama.

Due to the fact that Randy told Stan he saw his new Facebook page while at the office, in You have 0 Friends , its implied he found a new job or was re-hired by his old one.

He may hold a PhD in geology as he has been referred to as Dr. Marsh on two occasions; once by a Republican Senator in &quot; Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow &quot; and once by himself in &quot; T.M.I. &quot; while he was teaching children about penis measurement. The Surgeon General rebuked his complicated formula for measuring a penis; she doesn&apos;t consider him to be qualified enough, which is hardly surprising as his doctorate is in Geology, not human sexuality.

 Wall-Mart Employee Edit 

In the episode &quot; Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes &quot;, Randy worked at the &quot;Wall-Mart&quot; in South Park until Stan saved him from being killed as the store was destroyed in the end.

 South Park Elementary &apos;s Chef Edit 
 Randy as a celebrity school chef in the cafeteria. Added by Neocarleen Randy becomes obsessed with cooking after seeing the Food Network in &quot; Crème Fraiche &quot;. He loves it so much, that he becomes the boys&apos; new cafeteria chef. He creates his own show, called &quot;Cafeteria Fraiche&quot;. Other celebrities of the Food Network then challenge him to a cook off. However he used this position mostly just to show off his cooking skills rather than serving meals to the students.
 Tween Wave Singer Edit 
 Randy Marsh as &quot;Steamy Ray Vaughn&quot;. Added by Alejandro López Hale In the episode You&apos;re getting old , Randy impulses his career as a solo singer of a popular musical genre called &quot;Tween Wave&quot; naming himself as &quot;Steamy Ray Vaughn&quot;.
 Obsessions Edit 

Out of almost every unhealthy obsessions Randy had, Sharon has always been very oppressive of his idiotic ambitions except for his obsession with broadway shows to which she finally supports him for.

 Anti-war movement - &quot; I&apos;m a Little Bit Country &quot; Mormonism - &quot; All About Mormons &quot; Baseball fights - &quot; The Losing Edge &quot; The 12 step program, alcohol, and the virgin Mary - &quot; Bloody Mary &quot; Playing World of Warcraft - &quot; Make Love, Not Warcraft &quot; African American Culture - &quot; With Apologies to Jesse Jackson &quot; Guitar Hero and Heroin Hero - &quot; Guitar Queer-O &quot; Taking the largest crap - &quot; More Crap &quot; Weird internet pornography - &quot; Over Logging &quot; Keeping a video record of events - &quot; Pandemic &quot;, &quot; Pandemic 2: The Startling &quot; Post-election euphoria - &quot; About Last Night &quot; Believing in the economy as a god and margaritas - &quot; Margaritaville &quot; Farting and banning queefs- &quot; Eat, Pray, Queef &quot; Winning Pinewood Derby and alien space cash - &quot; Pinewood Derby &quot; Acquiring cancer to legally purchase medicinal marijuana - &quot; Medicinal Fried Chicken &quot; Facebook - &quot; You Have 0 Friends &quot; The dream world - &quot; Insheeption &quot; Being a celebrity chef - &quot; Crème Fraiche &quot; Penis size - &quot; T.M.I. &quot; Tween wave - &quot; You&apos;re Getting Old &quot; Broadway shows and Blowjobs - &quot; Broadway Bro Down &quot; 

 Appearance Edit 
 Randy&apos;s first appearance in &quot; Volcano &quot;. Added by TheyKilledKenny! Randy wears a blue colored shirt with chest pockets on each side and dark gray trousers. Under his jacket, it is implied is a white shirt. His left-side pocket usually has a yellow, a red, and a blue pen with a pocket protecter. He has thick, black hair with parted bangs, and a thick black mustache, both of which seem to evoke a 1970s hairstyle. In early episodes, though, his hairstyle was somewhat different (see left). Up until &quot; Chickenlover &quot;, he didn&apos;t have a dimpled chin. But in and after that episode he mysteriously developed one (of course, in the early stages of South Park, many things changed).
At bedtime, Randy wears deep blue pajamas with a long-sleeved shirt, and gray slippers. Though he appears slim and in shape when clothed, he is rather flabby, and has a protruding stomach, as seen when naked. Randy also has prosthetic testicles following the removal of his own due to his self-induced testicular cancer as seen in season 14&apos;s &quot; Medicinal Fried Chicken &quot;.

In his special occasion outfit, which consists of a white dress shirt, a light blue tuxedo, blue pants, and a gold tie, he has a gold handkerchief in his blue coat pocket.

 Personality Edit 
 Randy gets caught drinking and driving Added by TheyKilledKenny! Randy is often portrayed as an intelligent but simultaneously dim-witted, quick to think, naive man, while all the same a caring, doting father. However he is also obsessive and when he gets engrossed in something, his personality turns to the exact opposite. He becomes immature, childish, and dumb during the obsession phases. He has a habit of being led astray by new fads or events, like many of the characters. All the same, he has also been known to go completely against such things, though his reasons are usually selfish and immature. He will also try to do a heroic thing, but will then be distracted due to a selfish reason as seen in &quot; Insheeption &quot;. However, this was caused by Mr. Mackey because Randy ignored the psychaiatrist&apos;s wanting about Mackey&apos;s dream being so unstable. Randy also seems to drink a lot of coffee, shown carrying a cup in most episodes he is in at one point or another.
Randy has a tendency to act very melodramatic. Whenever things get surreal in the show, and Randy is calling for his son, he usually puts on an act of being very ill and weak, and moaning Stan&apos;s name out: &quot; Staaaaaan! &quot;. Randy is also shown to be a hypochondriac .

In the episode &quot; My Future Self n&apos; Me &quot;, &quot;Future Stan&quot; reveals that Randy doesn&apos;t like chicken. He also doesn&apos;t like cherry pop-tarts, as he expressed disgust when Linda Stotch pointed out that those were the only ones left in &quot; Night of the Living Homeless &quot;.

In the episode &quot; Guitar Queer-o &quot;, Randy can be seen strumming a guitar with his right hand; he may therefore be right-handed. 

He is obsessive with a few things, as evidenced with his video camera in &quot; Pandemic &quot; when he videotaped his father Marvin Marsh in the bathtub, Sharon, Stan and Shelly eating dinner (which is implied to have happened multiple times), a Peruvian flute band outside the house (asking Stan to go outside next to them), Sharon and Shelly watching CNN, Sharon talking to the Broflovskis and Tuckers about their missing boys, Sharon calling someone to help with the missing boys and the gargantuan guinea pigs rampaging through town . Sharon frequently reprimanded him for doing this, calling him an idiot at one point.

 Violence Edit 

Randy is shown to be very violent at times. He often is in mobs and flips over Korn&apos;s truck. He chops off a man&apos;s hand, and perhaps kills him, in order to stop Stan from knowing that he was a fake. He is shown in the end of &apos;A Little Bit Country&apos; fighting with Skeeter. He is shown to be very violent again in the &apos;Losing Edge&apos; beating up rival baseball dads. He shoots off a man&apos;s head and when he fears the man is becomig homeless when homeless people take over the town. He beats up a woman in &apos;T.M.I.&apos; after she questions his theory, gets sent to anger management, and then takes over a Fedex building with Catman, Tuong Lu Kim, the Tall Goth, and Butters. He also joins the civil war reenactors with Cartman and loots, rapes, and tortures.

 Family Edit 

 Sharon Marsh Edit 
 Randy with his wife, Sharon. Added by Lemniwinks She is Randy&apos;s wife. She seems to be more sensible than him at the best of times, although they both are known to be very hotheaded on occasion. In &quot; Clubhouses &quot;, they were constantly bickering, and finally they divorced. Randy then became an incompetent father who spent the whole time partying the nights away, and never seemed to have time for his children. At the end of the episode, Sharon decided she still loved Randy, and they had sex in Stan&apos;s tree fort. They then presumably remarried. Up until this episode, they had been inseparable from each other; afterwards, they&apos;re still loving, but their relationship is a bit less normal. In more recent seasons, Sharon has become more annoyed with Randy&apos;s over-the-top and childish behavior, such as the events of &quot; Pandemic &quot;, where she freaks out and attacks him, when he spends all his time playing with a video camera while the family&apos;s lives are in danger. Even worse, this turned out to be pointless, as he had forgotten to put film in the camera. In &quot; You&apos;re Getting Old &quot; episode they have been divorced due to his actions and, Sharon has been faking her love for him. However they reconcile in &quot; Ass Burgers &quot; and remarry.
 Stan Marsh Edit 
 Randy&apos;s son, Stan Added by Nikolaitttt Stan is Randy&apos;s son, and youngest child. Randy loves his son very much, and goes out of his way to either protect or save him, as shown in episodes &quot; Grey Dawn &quot;, &quot; Die Hippie, Die &quot;, and &quot; Pee &quot;. When events suit him. Stan, however, gets very annoyed and frustrated by Randy&apos;s dim-witted behavior, and usually only takes his advice because he feels obliged to do so.
In &quot; About Last Night &quot;, Stan got so irritated by the street party outside which was being led in large part by his father, that he made a noise complaint. All he could say when they tipped Officer Barbrady &apos;s car over was, &quot; Jesus Christ! &quot; and continued to watch in annoyed horror as his father&apos;s action became steadily worse. Things in-fact became even worse when Randy refused to help with Kyle &apos;s younger brother Ike , who had fallen out of the window and Randy ended up getting fired from his job for acting like a drunk-idiot towards his boss. Also, it may be noted that Stan didn&apos;t want his parents to move back together in Ass Burgers , this may be also taken as a sign that he doesn&apos;t like his father&apos;s behavior.

He also will publicly vocally express his annoyance in certain incidences in which Stan was apart of, most of the time being incredibly harsh in situations that do not call for it.

 Shelly Marsh Edit 
 Randy&apos;s daughter, Shelly . Added by Nikolaitttt Shelly is Randy&apos;s daughter, and elder child. She is very violent to her younger brother, Stan, although she is very nice or at least indifferent whenever her parents are around. Because of this, Randy and Sharon have remained completely oblivious to her abusive nature. and when Stan told them what she did, they didn&apos;t believe him. Shelly however, like Stan and Sharon often gets annoyed with her father&apos;s behavior, rolling her eyes but rarely saying anything other than, &quot;Mom, what&apos;s up Dad&apos;s ass?&quot;
 Marvin Marsh Edit 

He is Randy&apos;s ancient father, who is 102 years old. He is suicidal, though everyone merely laughs at his requests to be killed, saying, &quot; That&apos;s our silly Grampa! &quot; In &quot; Grey Dawn &quot;, he was frustrated by the way Randy spoke to him as if he were speaking to his son, rather than his father. Stan then explained that that was partly why Grampa waged the war between the young and the elderly, because he didn&apos;t want to be &quot;treated like he was 12&quot;. In &quot; Fantastic Easter Special &quot; it is revealed that Marvin brought Randy to the Hare Club for Men when he was little.

 Grandma Marsh Edit 
 Randy&apos;s mother Grandma Marsh . Added by Nikolaitttt She is Randy and Jimbo Kern&apos;s mother. She apparently divorced or cheated on Jimbo&apos;s father to be with Marvin. However due to the fact that they do not live together and Marvin had a sexual encounter with a contortionist in Quintuplets 2000, this would imply that she also left Marvin eventually. She is currently suffereing from an unknown illness in the hospital. She frequents Facebook, and often calls Randy to bully Stan into keeping up with her facebook status as seen in &quot; You have 0 Friends &quot;.
 Jimbo Kern Edit 

Jimbo is Randy&apos;s older half-brother, as Matt Stone revealed in an interview. He said that they were birthed by the same mother, but each have different fathers. They appear to have a decent friendly relationship, often drinking together and talking about normal guy stuff. Despite the fact their mother left Jimbo&apos;s father, Jimbo himself seems to hold no ill-will towards his younger half-brother

 Trivia Edit 

 Randy Marsh bears the same name as an umpire in Major League Baseball Randy&apos;s animation has been edited more times than other characters: his original appearance in Season 1, his new design in Season 2 that lasted until Season 11, with a different hair and slightly different outfit, and a cleaned-up design from Season 11 forward with thinner, more subtle pockets and collar.
