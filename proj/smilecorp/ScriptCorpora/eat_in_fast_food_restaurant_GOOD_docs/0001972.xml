 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care OB/prenatal and postnatal care should operate from the assumption that all mothers will breastfeed as the norm and all staff both in clinics and hospitals should suppport that notion as well. Breastfeeding should be the standard.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences When babies are not gaining weight, I feel that doctors tell mom&apos;s to stop BF babies just because they don&apos;t know how to help them and they would rather cover themselves and tell the mom to give the baby formula. Medical school should require more educaton in Lactation/Nutrition or MD should be referring to an IBCLC.I also feel that doctors don&apos;t seem to try and prescribe medications that are compatible with BF. They just tell the mom she can&apos;t BF rather then doing some research on which ones are safe. BF is important too!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Post delivery practices in many, if not most, hospitals are strongly anti-bonding and anti-breastfeeding. A baby needs to be with its mother after birth and the mother needs to be with her baby. Eyedrops, weighing, measuring, and bathing do not need to be done right after birth. Many procedures can be done while the baby is lying on the mother&apos;s chest. Wrapping the baby up like a cigar with even its little hands cocooned inside the blanket is an exercise in sensory deprivation - the baby should remain connected with the mother - able to feel, touch and smell her. Studies have shown that many of the reasons given for separating the baby from the mother are actually caused or made worse by the separation itself. A baby kept warm on its mother&apos;s chest with the help of her body heat and a blanket maintains its body temperature quite well and babies put to the breast immediately after birth and kept close to their mothers tend to have more stable blood sugar than babies kept apart. Even the way babies are suctioned after birth interferes with nursing as the rather rough (sometimes almost brutal) way the doctor shoves the syringe down the babies throat can abrade the tissues. Let&apos;s make the baby as important a patient as the mother and tend to its needs. I love the motto from one organization: It&apos;s my birthday; give me a hug!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Suggestions for encouraging breastfeeding in these settings include routine examination of nipples during prenatal care. Doctors/midwives can diagnose inverted nipples and alert women that they may need extra help with initiating breastfeeding. Prenatal care providers should also recommend a Breastfeeding 101 class, video, book, or group meeting (LLL, etc.) to every woman and encourage partners/dads-to-be to start getting educated about the committment it takes to breastfeed.
In the hospital, formula samples are an enormous breastfeeding deterent. Discourage formula companies from giving samples to every patient. Encourage rooming in with babies and mothers. Discourage bottles, pacifiers, formula feeding or sugar water feeding while mothers are trying to intiate breastfeeding. Provide education and support for fathers too since understanding dads encourage breastfeeding mothers to perserve. Lactation consultants in the hospital should examine babies for frenulum abnormalities, tongue length, and other mouth anatomy issues that could affect successful breastfeeding. The sooner those problems are diagnosed, the easier they are to address.
Post delivery care: care providers should make asking about breastfeeding part of the follow up visits and be prepared to refer women to lactation consultants or groups for guidance. Provide breastfeeding-friendly waiting rooms with lots of water, footstools, pillows, etc.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I think the Call to Action has to be very explicit in calling for Baby Friendly. I am negatively impressed by alternatives like the Texas Ten Steps, which has over 60 hospitals, but only 4 have no formula bags, and only 1 (or none) are Baby Friendly, and they have below average mPINC scores.
I also think related to this, that it is imperative that health organizations sever ties to the formula industry. I think AAP&apos;s ties to industry is one of the single biggest barriers to Baby Friendly. I think conflicts of interest should be explicitly discouraged, and this is the most egregious one-- and there is ample evidence that it harms policy and public health.

 Paid Maternity Leave This needs to be strongly supported in the strongest possible terms. Not only is it important to breastfeeding, but lack of paid leave is one of the reasons why mothers have higher poverty rates (see MomsRising statement on paid maternity leave). I would emphasize this as a top priority, and also encourage research that shows it is potentially cost saving if it can promote longer durations of any- and exclusive breastfeeding.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Insurers should pay for access to IBCLCs, as they would pay for physical therapy and other allied health professionals. Forcing families to pay out of pocket for breastfeeding support only increases the already-serious disparities in breastfeeding.

 Use of Banked Human Milk I strongly believe that instead of cow&apos;s milk, humans should have access to human milk. Women should be given the option to pump their milk for public consumption.
 16 Concerned Citizen
 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I believe that employers should be sensitive to breastfeeding mothers by allowing a clean, quiet non-bathroom location to pump. They should allow breaks for milk expression or to breastfeed children directly. Onsite childcare is the best and easiest way to keep breastfeeding mothers engaged.
 17 Concerned Citizen
 Paid Maternity Leave It&apos;s embarrassing that the United States is behind so many other industrialized countries in the world in this respect. Mothers should be paid for 3 months of maternity leave to establish breastfeeding. Research shows that the longer a woman takes maternity leave, the more likely she is to continue to breastfeed. This is easy to understand since it is far simpler to directly breastfeed a baby than it is to pump and then bottle feed the human milk. Paid maternity leave would give all mothers and infants a healthy head start towards establishing a strong breastfeeding relationship.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings The International Breastfeeding support symbol (found here http://www.mothering.com/sections/action_alerts/iconcontest/icon-winner.html) is one start to making nursing mothers feel more welcome. A public awareness campaign is needed to emphasize that breastfeeding is not taboo or sexualized, but a way to feed a child. Please consider encouraging nursing mothers of small babies and toddlers too.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Providing worksite lactation areas is key for women to be able to contribute to their own economic well-being while providing the best food available to their infant. I think providing onsite child care is important when feasible but there are plenty of job sites that are not appropriate for babies and children. Focusing efforts on providing clean, private lactation facilities will be more effective in supporting nursing mothers as well as more economical over establishing and operating child care facilities.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Education needs to take place on the detremental effects of maternal and infant separation. More research needs to be pulled out and dusted off showing the long term effects to these babies, one day to be adults. Health care professionals see no worth to keeping baby and mother together. Routine administration of Pitocin is unbelievable, adding to the distressing experience of childbirth for mother and baby. Each postpartum nurse should be required to have extensive lactation training and experience. They should not have bias opinions towards formula feeding. Employees should be repremanded for not supporting breastfeeding or giving formula without medical reason. Exclusive breastfeeding is going by the wayside. The importance is not noticed anymore. The benefits to exclusive breastfeeding should be highlighted in bold. What benefits are lost once that one bottle of formula is given? The mother should know that info. Each mother should be given information related to the risks of forumla feeding and sign a consent form prior to their first feed or before going into labor.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends At this point, I don&apos;t think educating the moms are not enough. We really need to take it to the next level and start educating support persons like the grandmother and significant other.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid maternity leave is essential to allow a mother and child time together to bond and establish the breastfeeding relationship. We can&apos;t ignore the financial pressures on families and the influence of those pressures on a parents ability to make choices for their child. Many mothers need to go back to work earlier than desired due to financial pressures. This separation from the baby at 6 or even 12 weeks interferes with the ability for mothers to establish milk supply and the breastfeeding relationship.
In a related matter, employers should have incentives to provide flexible work arrangements once a mother returns to work. Telecommunting, alternate work hours, temporary reduction in work hours, etc. should all be encouraged to allow a woman and a company to provide necessary work while still supporting the breastfeeding relationship.
Perhaps a tax incentive for companies who provide paid maternity leave and a different tax incentive for those companies who allow flexible work arrangements would allow a company to provide these necessary

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends I believe that breastfeeding needs to be brought to a students attention long before they are to become parents themselves. We live in a world where bottle and formula feeding are what is perceived as normal due to lack of breastfeeding education and exposure to our younger generations. Our schools teach many things on human nature and development, but overlook the subject of breastfeeding. Higher breastfeeding rates are needed in our society and one way of promoting breastfeeding is through education.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media A battle for breastfeeding is currently being fought and has been active since June of 2007. This is due to the current policy of the deletion of photos that depict breastfeeding, on the social networking site, facebook. (Many of the photos can be viewed at: http://www.tera.ca/photos6.html)
We live in a &apos;social networking world&apos; these days. Many parents and future parents use these sites to share their lives with friends and families. A mother who has a right to breastfeed her child in public should also be given the right to display a photo of breastfeeding online. In deleting such photos facebook is sending the message to others that breastfeeding is wrong and should be hidden or even not practiced at all. This is not a message that ever should be sent. Deleting theses normal depictions of child feeding is equal to advertising breastmilk substitutes, since photos of feeding a child artificially are accepted on the facebook site.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am a Public Health Nurse who visits mothers/newborns shortly after they are discharged from the birth hospital. One goal of ours is to visit every breastfeeding pair to offer education and support in the home. We do this free of charge. I have noticed that of the pairs that I visit the ones that expect to use/need a pump have the highest success rates. I believe it would help if the mother was prepared more for the usefulness of the pump during prenatal visits or child birth classes. It is difficult to train and hook the pair up with an expensive pump after birth when they had not considered using a pump prior to delivery.

We do make in home visits to new mothers/infants shortly after they return home from the birthing hospital and we do this free of charge. We take a nice folder with breast feeding education information in the folder as well as other community resource and parenting information. We are very often successful in our support efforts and help for the pair during their transition from the hospital to their own home environment. We strive to decrease the anxiety that a new mother might experience by offering baby weights as often as the mother desires until the pattern of healthy weight gain is established in the infant. We believe this practice is appreciated by the new parents as most of them accept the offer.

 Research and Surveillance Strengthen the benchmarks for breastfeeding support i.e. CDC Report Cards. Please add benchmarks which include what states are doing to reduce disparities in breastfeeding rates among African American and minority women. Fund us! Provide funding to states in order to conduct research which may offer more insight into the barriers associated with bf among African American and minority women in various communities. Provide funding for the implementation and evaluation of wide spread peer support for women/infants at greater risk for early breastfeeding cessation. There is something about the language being used to suggest that a number of states are meeting HP objectives: only some of the women/infants living in those states are meeting the objectives. While increasing bf rates are reason for celebration, the possibility exists that the celebration may actually mask the vast disparity which exists for some women and their children in our communities. Let&apos;s get serious about addressing disparities. Thank you for providing a forum for discussion about this important topic.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media Breastfeeding in the media is often portrayed rather badly. It&apos;s ironic that in our society those that come out and say all the downsides of breastfeeding are the ones that get all the press. Our society views breastfeeding as somewhat sexual, telling us to cover up. But what they don&apos;t understand is that we are using our breasts for what they were intended for.
Unfortunately a lot of moms also give into the peer pressure of formula and doctors and nurses who push it on them starting on the hospital. I feel so badly for this mothers who do not have the support they need to continue the breastfeeding relationship. Formula is pushed at first in the hospitals. Moms are given a bag to take home with them. It&apos;s almost too easy to use it when you&apos;re tired at 2am with a child who is screaming for you. Breastfeeding is a commitment. I have nursed my son successfully for two years, and we are going strong. I will continue to do so for as long as he wants to.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a breastfeeding mother, a member of a breastfeeding coalition, and a WIC breastfeeding peer counselor, I believe that the health of our children in the U.S. can be dramatically improved with increased breastfeeding rates. As a WIC BFPC, I see women who are eager to try breastfeeding only to be discouraged when hospital staff do not support them in their decision and may even discourage breastfeeding. I would like to see universal and mandatory breastfeeding training for all hospital staff who are involved with prenatal, birth, and postpartum visits. Mandatory training would ensure that clients/patients are given positive messages and correct information regarding breastfeeding. As our breastfeeding rates increase, we will continue to see a rise in the number of healthy children in our country.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There is little acknowledgment in the medical industry that increased intervention during labor and birth and immediately post-delivery can have negative effects on the breastfeeding relationship. It is no wonder that, with a 30%+ c-section rate, we have such low initial breastfeeding success. There is little understanding about how natural hormones and other physiological processes work in labor, birth and post-partum, and even less understanding of how unnatural interventions effect those. I believe that, in addition to social factors, as long as the birth intervention rates stay as high as they are, breastfeeding difficulty will continue as well.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression It is my strong belief that breastfeeding needs to be supported in all settings. For many centuries, it was the norm. It still should be. It is a way for mother and child to bond, a great source of nutrition and a transmission of immunity. The fact that we do not have paid maternity leave discourages many mothers from continuing breastfeeding, as they can not take the time to be with their child. Additionally, many employers are not pumping friendly. Pumping in a unlighted storage closet or bathroom is far from pleasant, but it is what many mothers must endure if they wish to feed their infant with their own milk. Government incentives and guidelines are a great start to changing the popular thinking in relation to treatment of lactating mothers and mothers in general.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I think there should be medicare and medicaid money linked to baby friendly practices.

 Paid Maternity Leave While we as a nation clearly would like our mothers to breastfeed for a least a year, we are only willing to provide women and (and sometimes men) 6-12 weeks of unpaid family leave. By mandating year-long paid maternity leaves (as do Canada and a host of other nations), we would provide women the time, space, and supportive-environment in which to successfully breastfeed for at least one year. Breastfeeding while working outside of the home is extremely challenging: finding a place to pump, especially for working-class women who work on factory floors with only 2 15-minute breaks and 1 lunch break in an 8-hour day, is nearly impossible. Taking the time out to pump is generally looked down upon, and juggling pumping with earning an income, taking care of a household, and caring for an infant is difficult in even the best circumstances. If this nation truly cares about family values, it should provide families the support they need to be as healthy as they possibly can be.

 Use of Banked Human Milk I think this is a wonderful concept that needs to be implemented in more areas. Many women have an abundance of breastmilk while breastfeeding their child(ren) and it would be great for them to be able to donate to others in need and not just let it go to waste. If there was an organization that specialized in collecting and storing this extra milk and distributing it to babies who NEED it that would be great!

 Paid Maternity Leave I would like to see ALL mothers allowed 6 months leave with full pay. That first 6 six months is the crutal period for infant growth and development. All infants should receive breastmilk only during this period and if mothers could be with the infant the baby can be directly breastfeed. After this period the workplace should provide 3 pumping breaks per 8 hr. shift of at least 20 minunets each. The location of a breast pumping area should be with in a 3 min. walk form the employees work area and not a tolet area.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid maternity leave should be mandatory.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings There needs to be greater support for breastfeeding out in public. The reality is that all babies eat frequently, breastfed babies usually more so. If women feel that they need to retreat to their cars or often dirty public restrooms to nurse, their inclination will be to stop nursing or never start to begin with. It is too inconvenient. And it sends the message that when we feed our children at the breast, it is shameful somehow and should only be done behind closed doors.
I have breastfed all 3 of my children for over a year. For the first 6 months of life before they can yet receive solid food, that has meant nursing in public at times. I am comfortable with it and think of it as not much different than giving a bottle. Out of respect for others&apos; potential discomfort with public nursing, I have learned to be quite discreet (meaning that some people may realize I am nursing, but no onlookers are seeing my breast), but I have nonethless been the target of occasional unpleasant comments and many, many unpleasant looks.
I also find that even close friends who have breastfed their children and very intelligent people with no children give me a look when they learn that I am breastfeeding a 14 month old. It&apos;s as if they think that my toddler or I are deriving sexual pleasure from nursing at that point. I find it confounding.
I think much of this discomfort and hostility is related to the oversexualization of the female breast in our culture. The breast is portrayed, first and foremost, as such an object for men&apos;s viewing and playing pleasure that many have difficulty moving past that to realize that it is also the source of optimal nutrition for our offspring. More magazine ads, TV ads, and billboards that show the same amount of breast we routinely see in bikini ads and movies, but with a nursing baby latched on, would go a long way in fixing this problem. It just involves changing our culture&apos;s associations with the breast.

 Other Areas While most mothers with perseverance and support can have a successful breastfeeding relationship, I am concerned that very few people address the needs of mothers who pump exclusively. Following a traumatic birth experience that resulted in almost 2 days separation from my daughter and 2 months of lactation consultants appointments, I made the decision to pump full time to provide my child with breast milk. Thankfully, I live in Portland, where breastfeeding has more support than in some other US cities. I was unsure however of my legal standing for pumping in public. While I know some people may find this to be a trivial concern, it was a very large and looming concern of mine. In order to maintain a sufficient milk supply I had to pump up to 12 times a day. In order to do anything, work, run errands, go to the grocery store, I had to pump in public. I think there should be more research on the EP&apos;ing mothers and their particular needs.

Breastfeeding mothers are made to feel that they must be cover-up when breastfeeding and be as discreet as possibly, often causing discomfort to the baby and the mother. Many feel like the must use a restroom when in public to breastfeed which in itself speaks to how we view breastfeeding as a culture. We need to encourage breastfeeding mothers by portraying breastfeeding mothers in all types of publications. One thing that strikes me is it is nearly impossible to even find children&apos;s books with breastfeeding mothers.

 Paid Maternity Leave The 12-week maternity leave available to most mothers in the United States pales in comparison to what is offered to mothers (and fathers) in the vast majority of other developed nations worldwide.
A 2004 Harvard study of 168 nations revealed that 163 had some form of paid maternity leave; the United States (along with Lesotho, Papua New Guinea and Swaziland) was not one of them. The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act provides for 12 weeks of job-protected leave, but it only covers those who work for larger companies.
Not only is 12 weeks just not enough time (both physically and emotionally) for a mother to be home with her newborn child, but it also leads to many mothers to wean much sooner than they would if they were afforded the chance to stay home longer with their young infants. Many mothers choose to switch to formula when they return to work for a number of reasons (time, convenience, lack of pumping space/time in the workplace, etc.); and many of these mothers would probably be more than happy to both stay home and breastfeed longer. Unfortunately, our society rewards the ambitious working woman, but penalizes her if she also wishes to stay home and breastfeed her babies for longer than the prescribed 12 weeks. It is a sad situation and there are countless mothers, babies and families who suffer needlessly because of it.

Its also important to ban formula bag give-a-ways at hospital and dr offices and through US mail as well. It may help to have health warnings on formula cans.

 Paid Maternity Leave WHen I look at the numbers from countries that provide a paid maternity leave, I think about what a difference it would make to mothers in the US. As a lactation consultant (IBCLC), I see so many mothers who stop nursing when they return to work for a variety of reasons. If they had a little longer to stay home, those babies would receive breast milk longer - the numbers from Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Australia are very clear - it does help. I see mothers who return to work or school within 2 -3 weeks after delivery because they cannot afford to stay home and then add the cost of artificial milk to that as well and it is a burden to our families. I also see quite a few mothers who return to work and decide they cannot make ends meet and so they come out of the work force and go on public assistance - what good does that do for anyone? It is sad that in the US, we cannot provide that benefit to our families. I felt fortunate that I could return to work part-time, but not all mothers have that as an option.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression It has been my experience as a childcare provider to infants that the number one reason many moms give up breastfeeding before their child is 1 is that they are unable to pump at work as much as they need to in order to keep up their milk supply, which leads to formula supplementation which leads to even less milk production which leads to the end of the breastfeeding relationship. Moms need to be near their babies and breastfeeding in order to maintain the breastfeeding relationship, in my opinion.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support As an in hospital Lactation Consultant, I would recommend that all new mothers have a Lactation Consultant assess them prior to disharge home. Many potential breastfeeding problems can be averted with early assessment and intervention. I would recommend that hospitals be staffed according to the guidelines attached.

Mannel, MD Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Rmannel1@cox.net A retrospective review of data from a lactation program’s productivity reports at a large tertiary care teaching hospital (4200 births per year) measured actual hours worked by international board certified lactation consultants (IBCLCs) over a 2-year period, allocated the hours to their respective activities, and developed ratios for optimal IBCLC staffing for each component of service delivered. Optimal IBCLC staffing was calculated as follows: mother/baby inpatient requires 1 full-time equivalent (FTE) per 783 breastfeeding couplets; neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) inpatient requires 1 FTE per 235 infant admits; mother/baby outpatient requires 1 FTE per 1292 breastfeeding couplets discharged; NICU outpatient requires 1 FTE per 818 breastfeeding infants discharged; telephone follow-up requires 1 FTE per 3915 breastfeeding couplets or infants discharged; education requires 0.1 FTE per 1000 deliveries; program development/administration requires 0.1 FTE per 1000 deliveries; and research requires 0.1 to 0.2 FTE total. Using the formulas provided, IBCLC staffing can be calculated for desired services based on patient numbers. Key Words: lactation program(s) • staffing • IBCLC staffing

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am a lactation consultant and have been helping women for 39 years. I feel that many maternal services do NOT check women&apos;s nipples for being flat or inverted prenatally. This lack of looking can lead to very frustrated women.
Also, tongue-tie has been a problem in many infants, not enabling them to latch-on properly. I think that this situation is often overlooked or simplified as not a big enough problem to address.

 Paid Maternity Leave The shorter the maternity leave, the shorter the duration of breastfeeding. This has been documented in multiple high-quality studies.
Currently, with UNpaid maternity leave, many women struggle to take time off of work- and many (lower AND middle class) cannot afford 12 weeks off without pay. Thus, they return to work earlier which, in turn, shortens their duration of breastfeeding.
By implementing Paid maternity leave, we can help lower and middle class mothers stay home longer with their infants. This will lengthen breastfeeding rates. While this may threaten some businesses who would prefer mothers to take very little time off... in actuality, this type of policy will likely increase recruitment and retention of female employees. Added benefits will be healthier children- decreasing societal costs of ill or unhealthy (i.e. obese) children.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I am happy to see this initiative here and would like to say that public ad campaigns are desperately needed. Breastfeeding is sadly viewed as a taboo practice now and most people would prefer a feeding mother and child be hidden from view. This is of course completely unacceptable and so damaging to a breastfeeding pair. As a result mothers feel pressure to quit way to soon as they no longer want to remain in hiding and then babies are thrust onto synthetic milk and feeding devices. Cut out boards of mothers nursing strategically place throughout town and in malls as awareness campaign is a great way to encourage the normalization of breastfeeding. After all as we all know human milk is for human babies and they should all be fed that way. Thank you

 Paid Maternity Leave Many mothers-to-be, who have to work, have very little maternity leave and then not paid. I think maternity leave should be at least 3 1/2 months so that the normal growth-spurt increases to the milk supply and bonding can be well established.

 Paid Maternity Leave I strongly believe that this is one of the biggest barriers to breastfeeding - especially long term breastfeeding. Many women, myself included, need to go back to work at least part time after a child is born because the family cannot make ends meet without her income. The stress of going back to work, finding appropriate childcare, and trying to find adequate pumping facilities/time at work is a challenge. Stress is known to have an effect of reducing one&apos;s milk supply. In addition, some mothers have difficulty performing for a pump. I was committed to breastfeeding and pumped religiously when I went back to work part time, but I barely eeked out a couple of ounces. Had I not absolutely refused to buy formula and feed that to my child, I would have given up. Paid maternity leave would reduce the mother&apos;s stress, allow for time to establish an adequate milk supply ad breastfeeding relationship. It would also reinforce the fact that family is more important that work. Many European countries provide paid maternity leave and have much higher and longer rates of breastfeeding.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There is a tremendous deficit in the provision of breastfeeding support by Health Care Providers. This lack of support begins in the prenatal period, when most expectant mothers receive little (if any) breastfeeding information from their health care providers, and frequently the information they are given is inaccurate. In addition, more and more expectant parents inform me that not only are they not being referred by their HCP to prenatal classes where breastfeeding information is provided, they are being told that such classes are unnecessary.
Mothers encountering breastfeeding difficulties after the baby is born cannot rely on the provision of evidence based breastfeeding support by either their HCP, or the infant&apos;s HCP. Mothers assume that the obstetrician and/or pediatrician will provide competent breastfeeding information and support, but often it is the physician&apos;s lack of basic breastfeeding knowledge that sabotages breastfeeding support.
At the hospital where I work, we are making a concerted effort to provide research/evidence based breastfeeding training to our MCH staff, and to encourage staff to utilize this training in their clinical practice. This however, sometimes seems futile, when the physicians are not also committed to evidence based practices.

 Paid Maternity Leave As a nursing mother, I am pleased to have experienced the positive effects of changes in medical care and in federal and state laws to promote breastfeeding in the U.S. If the goal is to increase breastfeeding rates even further among American mothers, we must first target paid AND unpaid maternity leave policies. Going back to work has got to be one of the most significant obstacles to long-term breastfeeding. Many women find ways to manage pumping at work, but many others find it onerous or impossible for any number of reasons. The difficulties women face in balancing career prospects with the care of their children have implications for families in many areas other than breastfeeding, as well.
Women need more choices in order to establish a satisfying work-family balance. Paid maternity leave certainly needs to be extended beyond six weeks. Six weeks is just barely enough time to overcome many nursing problems, let alone introduce a breastpump into the routine, let alone establish a strong, healthy bond with your new child. In addition, mandatory paid paternity leave would help encourage breastfeeding as well. In the first couple of weeks, nursing alone can be more than a full-time job, and it will work best if the father is present to reduce stress by helping with other aspects of care and household tasks. Perhaps this could be accomplished through some sort of joint mandatory paid leave policy, where working parents are guaranteed the right to a certain number of weeks but can divide it in whatever way works best for them.
Since mandatory paid leave places a heavy burden on employers, we should also extend unpaid leave opportunities for both mothers and fathers. This will allow mothers in particular more flexibility to be available for their children and develop workable nursing routines, without sacrificing their job and income in the future when they are able to return to the workforce.
In my view, however, one of the most important ways the workforce should change to accommodate nursing mothers and mothers in general is to offer more part-time work opportunities in every field. The standard 40+ hour work weeks is the expectation that forces parents to choose between their careers and their families, and that choice is not one that people in this country should have to make on such a regular basis. This priority should be followed closely in importance by the establishment of on-site child care facilities in most work environments, which would allow mothers to take nursing breaks without a breast pump.
On a final note, I believe that expending resources to pressure women to breastfeed cannot begin to substitute for the changes in labor practices I&apos;ve discussed here. In fact, these efforts can even be counterproductive, as the positive response to Hanna Rosin&apos;s Atlantic article has shown.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression The single largest barrier to breastfeeding, in my opinion, is lack of Work and Family Balance in our culture.
Women are expected to give birth and be back to work after physical recovery from the birth. Short-term disability policies reflect this, but allowing only 6 weeks of insurance to be taken after a vaginal birth.
What about AFTER the baby is born? Giving birth is only a START to providing a good life for a new baby... not an end.
If we want a healthy society, we MUST cultivate healthy families. Cultivating healthy families means enacting family-friendly policies such as onsite child care, ease of breastpumping at work, and MOST IMPORTANLY, flexibility for working mothers. Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries/continents have demonstrated that this works nicely!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The Baby Friendly Health Initiative is the best model for hospitals to follow in promoting and protecting breastfeeding, yet very few hospitals in the US are Baby Friendly Certified. I think many people in hospitals, like in our society as a whole, see breastfeeding as a &apos;nice bonus&apos; rather than an important infant health measure. If the US government put a strong emphasis on Baby friendly certification and provided encouragement and possibly incentives, more hospitals would seek this certification. With certification and the education/skills/attitude that come with it, I have no doubt that more moms would leave the hospital with stronger breastfeeding success.

Hospitals are looking for profit, and breastfeeding is not profitable, formula is. They will be beholding to those who give them money (big formula companies do this) and they will be more willing to send home formula samples, coupons, etc. When breastfeeding becomes a required topic in the courses for becoming an RN or a doctor, then we will see a marked improvement in breastfeeding rates. When doctors give free well baby visits to those who are breastfeeding exclusively, that will increase the rates, too! I knew a doctor who did this in southern California many years ago...

However, there are way too many barriers for non-profit (hospital birthing units) to be able to provide this support since we cannot get reimbursed for the cost of providing this service. Billing is tied to medical reasons and seeing a physician. Lactation services need to be supported for ALL MOMS, not just those infants having medical issues. It makes no sense , nor is it cost effective to mandate a pediatrician visit when what they need is a lactation consult.

All medical professionals who are dealing with pregnant women, labor, delivery, post-delivery care, and newborns/infants need to have accurate information and policies that promote successful breastfeeding.
Of my friends, those who had their babies prematurely face the worst odds with breastfeeding success. Staff in the NICU especially need training on how to support (not actively undermine!) breastfeeding in those challenging circumstances. Making disparaging comments about the lumpiness, small amount, etc. about the colustrum pumped should be prohibited. They need to minimize separation from the mother and ALLOW nursing at the breast whenever possible. This also means creative solutions about allowing a mother to rest near the baby, to respond to baby&apos;s cues, which probably means a total redesign of most NICU spaces.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid maternity leave MUST be longer in this country if women are to succeed at breastfeeding. So many women begin breastfeeding their infants but switch to formula when they go back to work, which is often when their baby is only 2 or 3 months old. Formula is expensive and hard to prepare, and a child who is not nursing must be given formula until s/he is one year old, significantly raising childrearing costs for families who already may be struggling if they are the type of family who cannot afford for the mother to stay home. Many women are successful with pumping, but it requires an enormous commitment of time and energy, especially until the baby reaches six months of age and can begin on solid foods. I know many mothers who have stopped nursing their babies at 3 or 4 months because they cannot handle the demands of pumping at work multiple times a day every day. Encouraging employers to have lactation rooms would certainly help, but the most positive (and drastic) step would be to increase paid maternity leave to six months or even a year so that women can be WITH their babies when their babies need them most. A woman&apos;s body is made to nurse a child, not to be hooked up to a breastpump, and more milk is actually produced when a baby nurses than when a woman pumps in the absence of her baby. Though I realize that there would protests from employers and many special interest groups if mandated paid maternity leave were lengthened, it is a vital step that this country must take to keep pace with maternity trends in other parts of the developed world.

Many states have laws like this on the books already, which is a wonderful trend. However, some states simply have laws that mention the legality of breastfeeding in public, rather than explicitly prohibiting discrimination against breastfeeding mothers. No mother should be made to feel that she cannot feed her hungry child in a public setting, but too often, women are asked to stop nursing or are made to feel guilty for doing so in public, and these comments come from both strangers and from people who work at the location they&apos;re visiting, such as employees of a museum, an airport, or a restaurant. I feel blessed never to have had such comments directed at me, but I know many women who have heard them and been disheartened. Fear of nursing in public plagues mothers across this country for many reasons (social pressures, modesty, etc.), but laws to protect these mothers AND public service announcements to promote general awareness about such policies would be two enormously helpful steps in the right direction.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Every effort should be made to increase the midwifery model of care for pregnant and nursing women.Midwifery tends to have less interventions into healthy birth with good outcomes.More freestanding birth centers are needed.Healthy, well-screened women need to be empowered to believe that they can birth safely without technical interventions.Safe standards for healthy childbearing are published but are not regularly followed; too many inductions for frivilous reasons,c/sections on request should be stopped.Late preterm babies cost lots of money and have pooer putcomes in health. All of these practices tend to sabotage breastfeeing initiation,exclusivity and duation.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I feel that it is necessary for ALL areas of medicine from OB/GYN, Nurses, Hospital Staff, Pediatricians, etc. to have the SAME knowledge and training on the benefits of breastfeeding. I know that when I have talked to various doctors ranging from various degrees in medicine that the same knowledge is not consistent on breastfeeding. Most of them do support breastfeeding, but I feel that the sectors are not working together. It seems that the OB/GYNs are just concerned with the mother and her health for breastfeeding and that the pediatricians are just concerned with the babies and their health for breastfeeding. I just think that the gaps between need to come together in order for breastfeeding rates to increase and for mothers to get the appropriate care, education, and awareness needed for breastfeeding.

 Paid Maternity Leave In Europe, there is 3 to 6 months maternity leave, and one may opt for an additional 6 months. As you know, this time is vitally important in an infant&apos;s development; and as a clinical psychologist, I believe that all women, including nursing mothers, should be able to choose a time to go back to work without fearing job loss and discrimination.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In a sense by providing free formula in the WIC program we are endorsing and promoting artificial milk for human babies. We are communicating that formula is important enough that the government wants to give it to you for your baby&apos;s benefit and that therefore it must be as good as or better then human milk (as my own mother believed in the early 50&apos;s. Apparently we let the marketplace decide what was best and re-educate a whole culture. How will we ever reverse this, if even among the most educated people will nurse as a lifestyle choice, not because their baby&apos;s survival depends on it. We started giving free formula in WIC, we better start rewarding every women who BF exclusively with more then an extra jar of peanut butter and charging women a discounted price for the formula so that they consider at least their pocketbooks.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a breastfeeding mother, I would like to make a suggestion about hospitals. I gave birth to a baby boy in November of 2008 at Sacred Heart Hospital in Effingham, IL. I thought ahead and decided to hire a private lactation consultant to be there to help the baby and me directly after delivery and to be on-call for the remainder of my time in the hospital. The reason I had to hire one is because the hospital did not provide one for me. I had to pay out of pocket, insurance did not cover this. I could only imagine the amount of mothers that give birth at just this one hospital that get frustrated with breastfeeding, since the first few weeks are the hardest, and give up because they didn&apos;t know what to do or have the money to hire their own lactation consultant. I had some nurses come in when my consultant was not available and they were of very little use since they did not know much more than myself on the topic of breastfeeding. My suggestion would be that every hospital be required to keep a certified breastfeeding consultant on staff to handle only breastfeeding support and education. I believe there was a nurse that was certified while I was there but I never saw her because she was busy doing her nursing job. It was not her job to help the breastfeeding mothers. Even better would be to have a certified lactation consultant that is affiliated with the Le Leche League. It would also be nice if the hospitals were required to allow new mothers to contact this lactation consultant for the first few weeks after birth to help with any problems. Mothers should also be referred to the nearest Le Leche League to find help for the remainder of their breastfeeding time with their infants. Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns.

 Use of Banked Human Milk I had a lot of extra milk, and was going to donate it to a milk bank. The nearest bank was in North Carolina, and they said that they were always happy to accept donations. It turns out that there were so many people in my community that needed or wanted my extra breast milk so I never did donate any to the bank. With this level of demand I think we need more milk banks and more options for parents who do not want to feed their children formula.

 Paid Maternity Leave There is nowhere near enough paid maternity leave for mothers compared with other parts of the world (specifically Europe). Once mothers are forced to return to work (becasue of financial pressure) it is difficult to continue breastfeeding as pumping at work is challenging at best and it is better for mother the bring children to their breast to breastfeed instead of giving their children bottles. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of a childs life and then breastfeeding for a minimum of a year with complementary foods. I suggest that women get given a minimum of six months fully paid maternity leave to bond and breastfeed their babies (in line with the AAP&apos;s recommendations) and to look to increase this to one year. I believe this will support breastfeeding efforts. I also suggest that a woman&apos;s job be held for her upon her return to work.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support We need to be careful that lactation care and support is provided by health care providers and not by those who financially benefit by selling pumps, pillows, equipment, books, etc.
Physicians have little to gain in hiring a Lactation Professional as there is no reimbursement for providing this service to their patients - so they give opinions based on their own experiences or what they learned years and even decades ago.
Postpartum support needs to be intense in the first month postpartum - but can be offered by telephone or e-mail with scheduled visits when necessary. Evidence shows that if mothers are assisted during this time, they will be able to exclusively breastfeed for longer - which accomplishes better health outcomes for baby and mother.
Mothers who are returning to work or school also need support, and this can be cost-effective for the employer, especially if tax incentives and penalties are present.

 Paid Maternity Leave US pays so much emphazis on breastfeeding but only 4 weeks are paid for maternity leave. Working with breastfeeding is not a very convenient option for mother and child. This is the time when mother should bond with the child but to support child financially, mother takes tough decision to do away with the bonding and direct breastfeeding and goes to job. We all know that pumping is not as effective as direct breastfeeding. Even countries like India offer full year paid maternity leave, look at UK. INdia is going to 3 years of paid maternity leave. If we want healthy citizens in this country and children brought up with care and enough of mothers love we should look for options to provide full year maternity leave(paid). This will not only help with increased breastfeeding but child will get enough of mothers love and we will have well balanced children who r future of this country

It took 6 months for my pediatrician to take me seriously, and she still called it lactose intolerance, which is a very different thing. For babies like mine, breastfeeding is the only real option, and the mother has to avoid milk products.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care health care providers, specifically postpartum nurses and pediatricians need to be better educated on breastfeeding. So often mom&apos;s are given info that is either outdated or blatantly inaccurate. This education needs to at a minimum include breastfeeding frequency, duration, weight gain, identifing proper latch. Also, these health care providers need to understand their education is superficial in this area. (I&apos;m sure they have more indepth knowledge in their field of expertise.) So, it is imperative that they know when to refer to a knowledgeable lactation consultant.
On another note, it would be nice to have a growth chart based on breastfed babies, instead of comparing my baby to those fed synthetic food.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care More doctors need to take the time to talk to their pregnant clients about the benefits of breastfeeding before women get to the hospital. In the hospitals doctors and nurses need to ensure immediate skin to skin contact between moms and babies unless special circumstances arise. This needs to be standard protocol instead of the exception as is current practice. APGAR scores etc. can all be preformed while the baby is on mom&apos;s chest and still attached to the umbilical cord. We should also encourage more rooming in of mom&apos;s and babies, and discourage circumcision, sugar water, bottle feeding, and pacifier usage. All of these things interfere with breastfeeding. We also need to discourage such high rates of c-sections, epidurals, and narcotic drugs during births. This can be greatly facilitated by encouraging more home births in America as most other industrial nations currently do These other countries also happen to have better maternal and infant mortality rates than us, so home birth safety is not an issue.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Laws should be passed to ensure that all women have the right to time and a clean private space to pump their milk while at work in every state. Onsite child care would be tremendously helpful as well and encouraging employers with tax incentives would be a good first step. Many women that have trouble pumping would be able to breastfeed longer if they had access to breastfeed their child at an onsite child care facility. This also ensures adequate milk supply since no pump is effective as a baby in stimulating milk production. High quality pumps are also very expensive. Mothers that are going back to work should get tax breaks for buying such expensive pumps, or be covered under their insurance policies and given to them in the hospital.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Women in every state need to have legal protection to feed their babies in every public setting which they have a right to be in. Babies need food and it is unacceptable to say that because someone is choosing to feed the baby breast milk instead of formula or solid food that they baby is not allowed to eat and must leave. This is a human rights issue as in all babies have a right to eat. I agree that public rooms women can go to nurse their babies is a nice thought. However, it gives the impression that just feeding the baby is some how incident and needs hidden. Babies should eat where ever they need to whenever they need to. They should not have to wait until their mother can locate a suitable location etc. If it is acceptable to see a bottle at a restaurant, mall, school, etc. then it should be acceptable to see breastfeeding too. This will help shift the public thought of breastfeeding as normal and not something shameful to be hidden.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Women need to be encouraged to have as natural a childbirth as possible. Techniques such as Calm Birth, a program developed by Robert Newman and being used at forward reaching hospitals such as Overlook Hospital in New Jersey, should be promoted and taught to ALL pregnant women who choose to use Integral methods to prepare for childbirth.
Women&apos;s choices need to be respected, the choice to have a home birth is as valid as the choice to have a hospital birth and needs to be treated as such by health care practioners and insurers. Women should not feel that a transfer to a hospital during a home birth should be difficult. The U.S. needs to look at the model Holland uses for birthing, OBs should be used for high risk pregnancy and midwives for uncomplicated births.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Currently, it is up to each individual hospital and physicians office whether or not to offer lactation assistance to their patients. I think that getting the insurance companies on board with providing lactation services to patients would really help women succeed with breastfeeding. If private lactation specialist could bill for lactation visits much like chiropractors can bill for services, this would allow women to seek competent help with breastfeeding. A free market must exist in regards to lactation specialist services with IBCLC being the mandatory credential. This way, patients would be able to seek qualified individuals to help them and not have to depend on the help provided by the pediatrician&apos;s office or the hospital where they delivered. This service would be very cost effective for the insurance company and the US government in the case of nationalized health care or medicaid since breastfed infants are healthier throughout their lifetime. Many insurance companies offer 10 visitts per year to the Chiropractor; whereas a woman would only need several visits per child for her lifetime.

I have to say that if formula were not pushed so much and given away at hospitals that would help beginning parents. Having good lactation specialists and support during the stay in the hospital, but also to visit the home to assist in that crucial time once a new parent arrives at home. Being all on your own can make it seem much harder. I went out to La Leche League meetings and found lactation specialists on my own, but I think that if the hospital would make some kind of an effort to extend the care into the home it would greatly benefit. The first few days and weeks can make or break that breastfeeding relationship. Having a really good start can mean all the difference.

This needs to be clarified as many babies on day of life 2 are needlessly supplemented with bottles of formula because their weight has dropped 7% which is considered acceptable.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Our country&apos;s breastfeeding success rate is severely impacted by the climbing cesarean section rate - now at 32%. By encouraging healthy, low-risk women to seek primary maternity care from a nurse-midwife (CNM) or certified professional midwife (CPM), we will come a long ways toward increasing breastfeeding success rates simply by decreasing surgical births. Birth by surgery is an independent risk factor for breastfeeding failure for several reasons: 1) the delicate hormonal/physiological design of birth has been disturbed, 2) mother&apos;s body is exhausted and recovering from surgery which hampers her ability to establish a full milk supply, and 3) baby is often separated from mother in the first hours of life. If breastfeeding is not accomplished in that first hour of life, it is statistically very unlikely that the mother/baby will ever be able to exclusively breastfeed.
In a recent large-scale study published in the British Medical Journal, 96% of women who delivered with a CPM both avoided a C-section and were still breastfeeding at 6 weeks. *96%* Here is a link to that study from the National Institutes of Health database: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid;=15961814
Unlike routine protocol in typical hospital labor/delivery units, Certified Professional Midwives encourage natural births by providing continuous one-on-one support during the entire labor. They encourage the mother to labor and deliver in vertical positions, because laying down restricts the contractions of the uterus, narrows the birth canal, and makes labor more painful. By following vertical birthing techniques, the need for medical intervention and the request for pain relief is minimized -- thus, the chance that labor/delivery flow smoothly in a normal, natural, healthy way is maximized. Thus, that bonding hour after birth critical to successful breastfeeding initiation is protected. The mother/baby are free from external disruptions to their body&apos;s natural hormonal balancing system, and the stage is set for instinctual nurturing at the breast. During the following days, mother should be educated on safe co-sleeping arrangements according to the research of Dr James McKenna and Dr William Sears. Mothers who have had natural births free from tearing or surgeries are free to focus energy and attention on breastfeeding during the postpartum weeks, rather than on fresh, painful wounds that make even picking up baby a difficulty.
Any program to encourage breastfeeding will fall short of potential success without addressing the physiological design of hormones that accompany the natural birthing and bonding process. Conclusions of the literature on positive implications for breastfeeding by the use of CPMs and CNMs as primary maternity care providers are quite invariable, as supported by Cochrane reviews: http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004667.html Currently, only ten states provide CPMs reimbursement for taking on Medicaid clients, so entire sections of the less-fortunate population are unable to afford access to professional maternity care support that maximizes their chances of avoiding surgery and successfully breastfeeding.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care It is my fervent belief that a majority of women giving birth in America today have no reference for breastfeeding as an integral part of the maternal-infant relationship. The baby as an active participant in the breastfeeding relationship is too often forgotten. Mothers dedicated to the notion of providing their babies with the best nutrition are missing perhaps the most important aspect of breastfeeding—when mother provides her “self” to her baby and begins the natural process of forming secure attachment. This oftentimes missing element causes great struggle for the new mother who faithfully attempts to follow a rigid schedule or some arbitrary set of rules provided by someone who has never met her baby and who has no idea whether the baby&apos;s behavior indicates he wants to feed, to be held, or simply to sleep. Moreover, while we have been very successful in alerting the public to the importance of breast milk and breastfeeding, we often create an impossible situation for the new mother who has just experienced a medicated hospital birth, rife with interventions, and expect her to manage breastfeeding as if she or her baby was not impacted by the birth setting. We unintentionally set mothers up for failure because the baby is not able to follow the “rules” and breastfeed on schedule. Nor is he able to latch like the 2-month-old baby in the breastfeeding video. I believe that the generic breastfeeding instruction provided by videos, books, and prenatal classes fall short of the individualized instruction mothers and babies require in the immediate postnatal period. Nurses, pediatricians, and even lactation consultants are typically not trained to provide individualized systematic observations of babies to give parents their very own personalized “tutorial” of their baby. It is my belief that empowering mothers with the lost art of recognizing and interpreting their babies’ signals rather than applying cookie cutter rules will have a much greater impact on breastfeeding success rates. This effort should be made in the immediate postpartum period (i.e., in hospital) before irreparable damage to the breastfeeding relationship (and milk suppy) occurs.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Expectant mothers need to be given thorough information on the benefits of breastfeeding and - even more importantly - the drawbacks of formula.

The way we word things now (breastfeeding benefits) actually makes formula feeding the &apos;norm.&apos;
No formula samples or bottles should be given at the hospitals, except in extreme cases where nursing is actually (not theoretically!) impossible.
Newborns who are not in need of immediate emergency care should be given immediately to their mothers, placed on her bare chest and allowed the opportunity to discover her breasts and latch on by themselves. The infant should be allowed to continue to nurse at will. This skin-to-skin contact should be allowed and encouraged for as long as the mother desires, baring medical emergency. Baths, weighing, etc. can wait at least until after the first good sleep together.

 Paid Maternity Leave I think this is BY FAR the most important hurdle to the breastfeeding epidemic in this country. If all mothers were given at least 6 months of paid maternity leave, breastfeeding would be easier to establish and maintain, there would be no stress about pumping and supply, nipple confusion, mothers would be less stressed. All mothers should have at least 6 months of time to devote exclusively to their newborn, making breastfeeding and bonding with your baby a priority.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support pediatricians and obstetricians should be referring patients with lactation problems to LC&apos;s if they are unable to assist them. Many of the breastfeeding problems that arise early on can be helped easily with a consult and can prevent early weaning. Also, women that do make the connection with the LC often decline the service due to the cost. If health insurance companies would reimburse for this important service, many more women would be able to get the assistance they need. In the long run this would save the insurance companies money by avoiding steep medical costs attributed to early weaning and a diet consisting of artificial milk.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support The WIC Program needs to be reevaluated, especially considering that it provides free formula to over 50% of American families. I have worked within WIC, at different sites, and it is painfully obvious that formula is given greater value than breastfeeding. Does the government realize that new mothers are given formula packages, even before a lactation consultation takes place; even before the mother is referred to a peer counselor, (if this even happens)? When the American public is so intensely aware that they can get free formula, without even considering BF, and WIC staff supports and encourages this notion, the message is clearly sent that BF is not important. There should be a medical reason for giving formula, right from the start, or mothers should be willing to pay out of their own pocket for formula, if they make the choice to forgoe BF for a convenience reason. Why is the government funding the formula feeding habits which lead to increasing health problems affecting American babies? At the very least, there should be allocations for IBCLCs on staff at every WIC office, in proportion to the amount of clients. Peer counselors must have experts to refer to and this is not the case at the majority of WIC offices across the nation. Peer counselors have a different set of skills than IBCLCs and can not take the place of lactation professionals. At the same time, the government must insist on IBCLCs as the recognized lactation professional; not CLCs or nutritionists, or other WIC staff who can be briefly cross trained but must perform other duties. If the government is serious about increasing BF rates, especially in the WIC population, then they must provide early access to IBCLCs and they must stop giving free formula to such a vast percentage of infants, based primarily on the mother&apos;s choice to receive free formula. WIC does not go far enough to point out the fact that BF is normal and formula is inferior. As long as the public &apos;hears&apos; that formula is the norm, they will continue to formula feed, and babies will continue to pay the price in terms of their health.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Why doesn&apos;t Medicaid pay for lactation consultations by IBCLCs who are not nurses? There are numerous studies to point out that mothers are not receiving lacation care after they leave the hospital and the fact that private practice lactation consultants are in extremely short supply. There are very few BF clinics across the nation, unless one happens to be in a metropolitan area, and even then, most are staffed by nurses. One does not need to be a nurse to be an IBCLC and there are clearly discriminatory practices at work whereby non-nurse IBCLCs can not secure employment in the community. This is a travesty when the need for the services and educational expertise of IBCLCs is so obvious. Let&apos;s see the government fund a BF clinic in each community. Isn&apos;t it time we stop depending on our maternity clinics to provide this service, especially when these same clinics receive a great amount of government funding, but fail to allocate for the services of IBCLCs? Let&apos;s take BF completely out of the WIC clinic, too, for when state governments receive rebates from purchasing formula, it only fuels the budget for more formula. Isn&apos;t this an inherent conflict of interest, depending on organizations who receive the lion&apos;s share of their funding from NOT breastfeeding, but formula?

Currently, the program promotes use of formula, infant cereals, and processed and baby and toddler foods high in refined white sugar. This program should be a center of breastfeeding education and promotion of good nutrition for mother and child. It is an uphill battle for a mother in the WIC program to continue breastfeeding in the current environment. Formula and infant cereals should not be pressed on a mother who wishes to nurse her child and wait the recommended six months to introduce wholesome first foods, especially after she ays she does not want it. Women on WIC should not have to battle with grocery clerks when using vouchers for vegetables or other whole foodss that are accepted under the program rules but evidently not promoted.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Prenatal -- There needs to be more emphasis on breastfeeding by OBs. Pediatricians often don&apos;t see mothers until after the baby arrives, and if a mother hasn&apos;t already decided to breastfeed by the time the baby&apos;s born, she&apos;s probably not going to decide to at that point. OBs need more education about the benefits of breastfeeding, and they need to be actively encouraging mothers to pursue it.
Hospital/Post-Delivery Care -- We need more maternity care provided by midwives, who are more supportive of breastfeeding and overall maternal-baby care. We need fewer c-sections, inductions, and instrumented deliveries, as these lead to more discomfort post-delivery and result in more complications with babies, which means babies are separated from their mothers more often. We need more natural deliveries, in general, as this really seems to empower mothers to have confidence in their own bodies. We need more babies placed skin-to-skin with mother immediately after delivery, instead of being wrapped up in blankets and hats. We need babies to remain with their mothers after delivery, instead of being sent to the nursery for labs, monitoring, etc. We need babies to reside in their mother&apos;s rooms full-time in the hospital, and we need to eliminate the option of sending babies to the nursery at night, except in unusual circumstances. We need to eliminate formula-company gift bags. We need lactation consultants on-call at the hospital during the night, as this seems to be when most mothers become frustrated with breastfeeding and resort to giving formula. We need fewer circumcisions, since the stress and pain involved often decrease breastfeeding for several hours to a couple of days.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Thank you for this opportunity to comment on a new Call to Action. I&apos;m a nurse-midwife who has worked for a number of years with women from communities of recent immigrants. These new Americans often have jobs in the service sector that carry few if any benefits. Some examples are fast-food restaurant workers, and hotel or office building cleaners.
Many of these women come from cultures where breastfeeding is the norm and successfully breastfed one or more children before arriving in the United States. Then, somehow, the child(ren) born here don&apos;t get the benefit of their mother&apos;s milk and when one investigates why, one learns of these barriers put up by employers:
1. Having to choose between pumping/expressing and eating during meal breaks; 2. No other breaks during the work day for pumping/expressing; 3. Lack of proper storage facilities for pumped or expressed milk; 4. Lack of a clean and private place to express or pump; 5. Employers viewing requests for these basic amenities as &apos;troublemaking&apos;.
As you may imagine, when the woman in question is undocumented, there is no motivation on her part to try to improve her situation as in doing so she might easily lose her job.
I bring this to your attention because I believe the stereotype of the working, breastfeeding mother is the manager/professional who manages her own time, can store her milk in an employees&apos; lunchroom refrigerator, and may even have an office with a door that locks for privacy while pumping/expressing. It&apos;s a pretty picture, but it&apos;s not reality for many, many women, and they are the ones whose babies stand to reap the greatest benefit from being fed their mothers&apos; milk.
I urge, when policies/legislation are being formulated, that the framers not forget those mothers in the lowest level service jobs. Their babies deserve mother&apos;s milk just like those of middle and upper class mothers. Their employers must understand that and take action to make it possible.

 Paid Maternity Leave This is huge. The truth is it is extremely difficult to work full-time and maintain a 100% breastfeeding relationship with your baby. I&apos;ve done it, and being a pediatrician, I was extremely motivated, but I can attest that it was very hard. Biologically, women were not intended to be physically separated from their babies for longer than a couple of hours. The 8-10-12-hour separations we require in our society for a working mother simply are NOT conducive to breastfeeding. Even pumping every 3hrs with a high-quality breastpump does not maintain a milk supply the way direct breastfeeding does. Biologically, it is EXTREMELY difficult. We talk a lot about family values in this country, but if we really believe in family values, then the truth is that women should stay at home with their babies for at least a year, preferably 18-24mo. This sounds radical, I know, but other developed societies do it. Babies deserve to have their mothers at home giving them the best care possible for much longer than the 6-8wks we allow them. This would undoubtedly result in healthier, happier children and families for our society.

 Paid Maternity Leave Unpaid leave is also a critical option - may women choose to sacrifice financially to stay home already, but having the option to return to a job after up to one year out would be incredibly supportive of increasing nursing rates. Unpaid leave may be MORE productive on that front even that increasing paid leave availability or length (since at this point 1 yr paid seems like a non-starter). Getting paid leave increased by a few weeks does not address the difficulty of continuing to work out of the home and continue to nurse (supply challenges, difficulty getting to pump, etc) beyond a few months whereas the option to take an extended leave albeit unpaid would likely allow many many women to nurse much longer.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media CRITICAL, CRITICAL, CRITICAL ISSUE!!! We need positive role models being seen - subtly - nursing. For example, not a targeted pro-breastfeeding ad, but more seeing it weaved into a sit-com where you just happen to be aware that a mom is nursing, but it is not necessarily a plot line. Art depicting the beauty of nursing, showing nursing moms in children&apos;s books, etc. to have it be a normally observed behavior. Also, leveraging positive role models that are recognizable - Salma Hayek for example!! More studies about benefits psychologically for the mother and child from bonding associated with breastfeeding. Again, indirect messages though since many women who were unsucessful breastfeeding are vocal critics as they may feel a sense of failure or guilt and have negatively biased views against breastfeeding that they feel compelled to defend their choice/situation. Finally, images of toddler nursing so that people can understand the normalcy and beauty of this. More toddler nursing books, too.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care A pilot program entitled, Mother&apos;s Own Milk (MOM), has been implemented at a women&apos;s hospital in Tampa, Florida to improve breastfeeding compliance of mother&apos;s who birth premature infants. The targeted population is geared towards high risk obstetric patients with diagnosis that may warrant premature delivery. Participants are assigned to a breastfeeding resource nurse who then performs an antenatal lactation assessment, schedules one-on-one learning sessions and delivers hands on training with breast pumping equipment. After delivery, breastfeeding behaviors are further supported up to 60 days after delivery to assist with transitioning to the breast and promote long term compliance through peer counseling. Areas of weakness include lack of lactation support from the institution and pediatricians, lack of knowledge regarding current breastfeeding methods, and lack of equipment or breast pumping capability primarily among low income families. In addition, many insurance companies do not reimburse health care providers or IBCLC&apos;s for lactation services.Which limits availability of lactation resources.

I believe this moms networking is one of the most important support avenues we can offer to mothers. It is free, the moms know it is always the 2nd and 4th Monday of every month at 12:00. Moms who have little ones in preschool or school are typically able to still attend the group and still get to school to pick up an older child. Mothers who come into the group who do have issues find many warm arms around them to help them make it through a difficult time and see the light at the end of the tunnel.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Our attitude towards breastfeeding needs to radically change in this country. Many people still think women should breastfeed their babies in toilets. Who wants to eat in a toilet? I don&apos;t. And neither do babies. If a strong signal is sent that breastfeeding in public is legal, perhaps more people would see it and accept that it is natural. Woman should be able to breastfeed wherever they can comfortably and to it. It would also help (until we as a nation get more comfortable with ourselves and our humanness) to have designated places where more self-conscious woman can breastfeed. These should by no means be the ONLY places women can feed their children, but rather a place to encourage woman who might otherwise feel self-conscious. Or when a quiet place is needed. If women see more of these places and hear more signals that support breastfeeding, it will go a long way in encouraging more woman to choose this healthier form of nutrition for their children.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings In order to encourage breastfeeding on a larger scale, it clearly needs to be publicly accepted. A mother, in a simple act of love and health, should not feel ostracized, ridiculed, wrong and out of place, and uncomfortable just because that crucial, unpredictable moment of need by the child has presented itself.
In a “Puritan” American society, the image of the exposed breast must become common-placed instead of taboo. This image must be re-associated with maternity, wholesomeness and goodness in lieu of sexual evocation. And, the image of the breast must be pervasive.
To further increase the comfort (because that is the root of the breastfeeding discussion: comfort) the image of the 12- to 24-month old nursing must also be pervasively accepted. Why do we accept so easily the sight of a pacifier and a bottle in the mouth of a 18-month old and not a breast?
Apart from spreading positive breast/breastfeeding image the other requisite change is that of preconceived notions. It has somehow been anchored in the collective consciousness that breastfeeding, especially after 6 months, reduces autonomy, “spoils”, creates a dependence, is psychologically unhealthy. Perhaps new reports and studies need to be issued, not only promoting the positive health aspects of Breastfeeding, but the positive psychological ones as well.

I was lucky that my employer paid for half of the cost of a good breast pump. Many women simply cannot afford a good dual electric breast pump when they go back to work. They want to continue breastfeeding, but they can&apos;t make it work. You simply can&apos;t use a cheap pump and get enough milk to feed your baby within a reasonable amount of time. I think the government should subsidize breastpumps for women, so everyone can afford them.
I also think that all employers with 50+ employees in one location should be required to provide a suitable lactation room. This means a clean room with a door that locks, power outlets, a comfortable chair and table/desk, and a small refrigerator.

Breastfeeding is not only a feeding method, the best in my opinion, but it is also the glue for mother/baby bonding and father/baby bonding. But it takes education, encouragement, and no other back up plans. If you think you can do something another way, or have a way out, then the other way ends up winning. Education is the start but free anything is worth the taking, and why not, IT IS FREE. Mom&apos;s don&apos;t have to do anything to get free stuff for their new baby except put their hand out. Feeding at the breast is a stigma to some cultures, negative and positive.

 Paid Maternity Leave As a father of two young children, I have recently experienced life with newborn children. My wife has been lucky enough to receive paid maternity leave from her employer, but I had to use vacation days for time off. I can&apos;t imagine being in the situation of many families of having to juggle work responsibilities around the stress of caring for a newborn, with round the clock feedings, diaper changes, and crying. It is ridiculous that so few new mothers and virtually no new fathers receive paid leave. Nearly every other nation in the OECD grants paid leave automatically to at least new mothers, if not new fathers. If this nation truly cares about families, we need a law mandating paid maternity and paternity leave for at least three months.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings A woman&apos;s right to breastfeed her baby in any setting needs to be protected by law, as it is in most other countries, and the fact that breastfeeding in all setting is protected by law needs to be publicized, both by healthcare providers and by publically-sponsored advertisements. A federal law should be passed that would make public breastfeeding a protected activity in all states (I understand that some state do not protect the activity at present).
When I had my baby I was living in the UK. It was made very clear to me by my midwife that breastfeeding was legally protected in all settings, and this made me feel so much better about going out into public with my baby, since I knew wherever I was I could feed him. When you can breastfeed anywhere, breastfeeding becomes MUCH easier than bottle feeding (since you don&apos;t need to take bottles along with you when you go out), whereas when breastfeeding cannot be done in public, bottle feeding is the easier option. The ability to go places and get things done with your baby is a huge quality of life issue for new mothers, and I personally know of some women who have stopped breastfeeding because they feel it ties them to home. Nothing could be further from the truth - when you breastfeed, you can go anywhere, anytime because you bring the food with you. The only barrier to this attitudeis the lack of legal breastfeeding protection.

 Paid Maternity Leave It should be fairly obvious to any thinking person that the lack of paid maternity leave in the US has a hugely negative impact on breastfeeding. As you know, the US is the only dveloped country that does not guarantee paid parental leave, and I think one of only 3 or 4 countries in the world with this situation. As you also know, the standard paid maternity leave even for upper middle class women is six weeks. I was lucky to have 16 weeks and the ability to take another three months unpaid.
I know from experience as a former breastfeeding mother that it takes six weeks just to get breastfeeding properly established. I was still ready to give up every day at six weeks! Only when my baby was around 2 months did I really start to get the hang of breastfeeding. That was also the time that the weight started to come off (after 8 months of breastfeedings, I ended up 15 pounds lighter than before the pregnancy). As any lactation consultant will tell you, expressing breast milk is difficult under any circumstances, but its almost impossible when a woman starts trying before her milk supply has been properly established through breastfeeding her baby. Plus, many women (me included)can sucessfully breastfeed their baby but can never use the pump.
In light of all this, it makes sense to work towards guaranteeing at least 6 months of paid leave. This would allow women to breastfeed for the 6 month period that the world health organization has identified as critical for a baby to be breastfed in order for it to reap the benefits of better immunities from infection, lesser risks of asthma and cancer, lower rates of ear infections, etc,.

Give mothers the opportunity to do what they were designed to do . . . parent their children.

 Paid Maternity Leave I think that all the better-informed health care professionals, public service announcements, and community support will only go so far to increase breastfeeding rates. Until there is paid maternity leave and better government regulation to protect a nursing mothers&apos; right to pump, breastfeeding rates will continue to stagnate while mothers have to work outside the home to support their families. If our government truly supports breastfeeding for at least a year and the preventive health benefits that arise from a child receiving breastmilk, then it needs to support a comprehensive paid maternity leave. The countries around the world with the highest and longest breastfeeding rates are those that enact policy to protect the right to breastfeed and offer paid maternity leave.

 Paid Maternity Leave It is extremely difficult, emotionally and physically, for a mother to leave a new baby and return to work. In so many cases, there is no choice. Breastfeeding is almost certainly interrupted when this happens. Pumping at work presents so many challenges, from finding a private place to pump, to having enough breaks in the day to do so, to maintaining your milk supply. I returned to work when my son was 3 months old, and it was the most difficult thing I had to do. I was fortunate to have a supportive workplace, but even so I had to make some difficult arrangements involving a coworker giving me her office (in exchange for my cubicle). I had been told by the building manager I could no longer lock the bathroom door and pump there. Others are not so fortunate, and give up on breastfeeding because it becomes so difficult. Teachers (my sister included) have very difficult times finding break times to pump milk.
Having a baby in this country, with no paid maternity leave, creates financial hardship for the family. I am pregnant with my second child, and this time around I will not receive any pay while I am on maternity leave. It will be a significant financial hardship for my family, but we are able to make that sacrifice, at least for 3 months. I know of people (including my aunt) who must return to work after just a few days.
Paid family leave is something that many developed countries offer. It would undoubtedly increase breastfeeding, and it would be an important investment in the health of babies and mothers that would last long-term. It would be one of the most effective policies to improve breastfeeding rates, and also relieve the financial burdens placed on new families.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I&apos;ve never had a baby in a US hospital (thank god) but from what I have heard the situation is absolutely terrible in many, many ways, but especially in terms of establishing breastfeeding.
I had my baby in a birth center in the UK where breastfeeding was a top priority of the midwives (I&apos;m American, but was living there for two years for work). The practices they used to help sucessfully establish breastfeeding were as follows:
a) Uninterrupted skin to skin contact of baby and mother for at least one full hour immediately following birth. Science tells us that this contact is critical for getting prolactin flowing. In normal circumstances, there is no reason to separate mother and baby immediately after the baby is born. When my baby was born, he was placed on my chest and we were left alone in a quiet place to bond.
b) Rooming in. My baby never left my sight after he was born. The baby and my husband slept in our room with me at the birth center. This allowed me to try to feed the baby whenever he cried, and to have my husband there to help me.
c) Breastfeeding class. Prior to the birth of the baby, the birth center offered a relaxed afternoon where pregnant women sat down with lactation consultants to learn more about the benefits of breastfeeding and proper techniques. We were also told who we could contact if we needed help once the baby was born and we&apos;d gone home.
d)Educated midwives who supported breastfeeding. The midwives who cared for me truly believed in breastfeeding and had been trained extensively on its benefits and techniques. From what I have heard of labor and delivery nurses in the USA, they are at best uneducated about benefits and at worst hostile to breastfeeding.
As you know, labor, deliver and post-delivery care in the US in general has many, many problems causing it to be far more expensive and have far worse outcomes than the predominately midwife-led care in almost every other indistrialized nation. While this is a much bigger problem than the task you have set out to do, I believe that the initatives to implement the pro-breastfeeding practices I have enumerated above would go a long way to making US maternity care more humane and produce better results in general, and especially in breastfeeding rates.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have worked in postpartum settings, and also have worked in community health with both prenatal and postnatal clients plus I have many children and have breastfed them all. I was recently able to be at the birth of one of my grandchildren and it was my daughter&apos;s first child. Because of my experiences both professionally and personally, I was able to greatly enhance her beginning breastfeeding with her baby. Seeing how much better it was for her to have someone to show her and work with her through each feeding (at least through the day!), I really think most new mothers (to breastfeeding, at least) would be able to have success more often than the little bit they receive in hospital and from community health. This is not to say that nurses or other lactation professionals are not doing their best; rather, it is just not possible to give such one-on-one help to each mother. But, I do think this would make breastfeeding be the experience we all want for these moms.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression A supportive workplace, where managers and coworkers understand the importance of breastfeeding and make space for milk expression, is so critical to working mothers to continue breastfeeding. I returned to work after 3 months of maternity leave, and there was not a set place where I could express milk. After being told I could no longer lock the bathroom door to express milk privately, I managed to get a female co-worker to give me her office so I could have some privacy. It is tramautizing and embarrassing to have to figure all of this out with managers who do not value or understand why it is important. I have talked to women who have designated milk expression rooms in their workplaces, and it increases morale and makes continued breastfeeding so much easier.
Being able to express breastmilk to nourish your infant is a basic human right, and there need to be policies supporting this right in the workplace.

 Paid Maternity Leave When pregnant women begin a breastfeeding discussion, there is a huge disparity in response related to the support that woman will have following the birth of her child. I work with low income women. As a group, these women are less likely to initiate breastfeeding and half as likely to continue breastfeeding for 6 months because they will be returning to work shortly (often within two weeks of giving birth) and have zero support to help breastfeeding happen. Paid maternity leave would allow mothers to breastfeed and provide the optimal nutrition and nurturing babies need. Why is the US so backward on this????

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I believe breastfeeding rates and breastfeeding success would skyrocket if women&apos;s insurance policies covered one home visit or outpatient visit with a lactation professional (IBCLC) after mother and baby are home from the hospital. The costs for covering one postnatal consultation would easily be justified by much lower costs for breastfed infant health care. Although more and more hospitals have lactation consultants on staff for mothers immediately after birth, so many breastfeeding problems do not occur until after the mother-baby pair is alone at home, lacking good information and support.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospital - the good news is that breastfeeding is recognized as important by RNs. The sometimes bad news is that some RNs now rush the baby to the breast and force it on before the baby has shown readiness to breast feed. Also, mothers report to me that within 24 hours some RNs have mothers using breast pumps instead of the baby to help bring the milk in. They also get mothers into the mindset of feeding baby every three hours. Finally, RNs and Pediatricians get the parents focused on baby&apos;s weight and especially the dreaded 10% weight loss as a signal that baby needs formula supplementation without regard for the baby&apos;s condition, accuracy of the scale and/or the fact that mother (and baby) has received IV fluids that women (and baby) take on in their tissues and that take time to release (so the baby&apos;s weight is artificially higher than it would have been otherwise).
What would be better would be 1. undisturbed birth and immediate postpartum with baby on mom&apos;s body; 2. baby-led initial breastfeeding; 3. evidence-based postpartum support and education while still in hospital; focus on education to get a good latch.

 Use of Banked Human Milk As a pediatric dietitian for over 30 years, I encourage all mothers to provide their babies with optimal nutrition...breastmilk. Breastfeeding according to the AAP&apos;s recommendations is the gold standard, but when a baby is sick or hospitalized, this is not always possible. I have assisted many breastfeeding mothers when their infants/children were admitted to the hospital and worked with them so even if the baby couldn&apos;t actually nurse at the breast, the baby was assured of receiving mother&apos;s milk as the source of nutrition. Many mothers find it difficult to maintain their milk supply and are unable to provide enough milk for 100% of their child&apos;s feedings. Other mothers, for whatever reason, do not provide ANY breastmilk for their babies. I have seen a marked difference in the overall progress of babies who do receive human milk for their feedings in the hospital. Donor human milk is an option that is recommended by professional organizations when baby&apos;s own mother&apos;s milk is not available, but it is rarely ever used in clinical settings. More needs to be done to educate healthcare professionals in the use of donor milk, especially neonatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric dietitians. Academic curriculums should incorporate information on HMBANA and how donor milk can and should be used. Currently, there is a huge gap in knowledge in this area for these professionals. The establishment of more regulated milk banks should be encouraged in this country to make donor human milk accessible and easily utilized.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In my experience through three pregancies and hospital deliveries, the vast majority of medical professionals who are not International Board Certified Lactation Consultants have consistently given me poor and in some cases, damaging advice about breastfeeding. They seemed unaware of some of the basic facts about lactation, unaware of some of the normal occurrences&amp;variances that can take place, and unaware of current research concerning effective breastfeeding management.
After coming into contact with these people who were supposed to be able to help but actually were unhelpful, and being made aware that this is not at all an uncommon experience among mothers, it seems that if a staff member at a clinic or hospital is going to be given the task of assisting and caring for a lactating woman and her breastfeeding baby, they actually need to be aware of how lactation works and how caring for a lactating woman and child is different than caring for a mother who is formula feeding.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Breastfeeding in public should not even be an issue. Any one who is offended at the sight of a breast that is nurturing a baby/child needs psychological therapy. We as a society have let this go on far to long. It is outrageous that breastfeeding mothers can be thrown out of resturants and public places for breast exposure!! A mother should have the right by law to do whatever she has to do for a pain-free nursing experience, and a child should not be forced to cover their head to eat their meal; even if this means complete breast exposure. How talented are we expected to be and how many arms/hands do people think we have? With one hand/arm carressing and positioning baby/child and one hand positioning breast for correct latch-on for pain-free nursing there are no hands left to fidget with clothing or blankets all while needing to be able to see. Are we to be expected to put a cover over our heads and our bodies to save some immature person the embarrasment of blushing when they see a breast? No, a woman should be free to nurse her child when ever, how ever and where ever she sees fit. And people who have a problem with that should be expected to get over it or seek psychological therapy for help getting over it. And any person, people, business or organization who makes a woman feel uncomfortable in any way because of breastfeeding should be charged with harrassment and should be faced with fines, or for multiple offences, imprisionment.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support The U.S. is close to reaching the initiation goal for breastfeeding; however, reaching the goal for 3, 6, and 12 months is nowhere near the goal. I feel this is because the mother loses touch with the LC at the birth hospital, and may be asking her pediatrician for lactation assistance. Unless the pediatrician has obtained specialized education in the management of breastfeeding, or employs someone who does, mothers are likely to get wrong or no advice except to formula feed. No wonder we are not reaching our long term breastfeeding goals! The promotion of lactation consultants, and reimbursement for their services must be encouraged and promoted so that more women can be assisted and breastfeeding goals can be met. If every pediatrician utilized an IBCLC (or even employed one!), breastfeeding could be preserved in many of the mothers who decide to stop breastfeeding.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) Breastfeeding education should start while a woman is still pregnant. In general, there is a lack of information for women and their partners about breastfeeding unless the woman seeks it out on her own.

Without support, it is hard for a mother to continue breastfeeding through any problems or difficult circumstances she might encounter.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I teach nutrition education and cooking&amp;shopping skills to limited resource families. Virtually none of my clients have breastfed. A recent client told me she had wanted to breastfeed, but after her C-section they gave her morphine and then she could not breastfeed her baby(her fourth child). Ideally, someone should have provided her a breastpump and taught her to use it to discard her milk while on morphine so that she could then breastfeed her son after she was done with the morphine. Alternatively, other pain medication could have been provided that would not have affected her milk.
Unfortunately, we need to reach these moms when they are pregnant with their first child, not their last. However, due to their youth, and the attitude that often accompanies that age, they are not so interested in information on healthy choices at that time of their lives.

Any breastfeeding handouts are included in maternity mailings, but they are very generic and in my opinion, don’t really stress that “Breast is best”. Also, check out NCQA.org and HEDIS. The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America’s health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. For example, HEDIS rates will tell a plan how well their female members are doing in regard to receiving mammograms and pap tests. If rates are poor, Quality Improvement initiatives can be put in place to increase compliance. The same thing could be developed for breastfeeding rates with incentives to increase those rates.

We must find a way to create programs that will give moms the confidence to keep breastfeeding! It&apos;s very easy to look up, say, what a fever temperature is for an infant. It&apos;s less easy to find out whether your child is getting enough milk. Moms are supplementing because they don&apos;t know any better.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The routine use of medical interventions and medical pain relief has a profound effect on newborn&apos;s readiness to feed at birth. The breastfeeding community needs to get active promoting normal, un-medicated, un-induced, un-augmented birth. The C-section rate is now over 30%, and many mothers are delivered of their babies before the baby is ready. These practices are interfering with breastfeeding. We have done a great job in getting lactation professionals into the hospital to help mothers breastfeed soon after birth. Now we have to listen to what these professionals are saying about the impact of routine interventions during labor and birth on the initiation of breastfeeding. We have great answers to these problems. Doulas attending births help reduce the need for medical interventions and help mothers start breastfeeding right away. In addition, home births with Certified Professional Midwives has been shown to be safe and to reduce the use of medical interventions and to improve breastfeeding success. It&apos;s time to use evidence based practice in labor and delivery, just as Lactation Consultants have been doing for breastfeeding.

I am a pharmacist, so I was able to basically tell my employer I would be pumping, but there are a lot of mom&apos;s who do not get to do this because they don&apos;t have a good job with a degree to back it up. Breastfeeding decreases the time off a mom needs because it is better for mom and baby, and employers need to be made aware of this. All mothers should be allowed to breastfeed and work full-time if needed. Unless it is made a law that mom&apos;s be allowed to pump without negative effects, then only mom&apos;s who are in professional level jobs and stay at home mom&apos;s will be able to do this.

 Paid Maternity Leave Remove maternity leave as a disability and call it maternity leave again. 6 weeks is an unrealistic amount of time for mothers and babies to establish lactation and prepare for separations. The unrealistic deadline to get back to a job or school interrupts the normal pattern of establishing lactation and the mother baby bond. This often results in a belief that a mother might as well not try, beginning introducing other feeding methods and products, and increasing weaning behaviors. There needs to be an honest understanding of the unrushed TIME it takes complete the the pregnancy/birth/breastfeeding cycle...even under normal circumstances. Add an unexpected difficulty and TIME needs protected to establish good health practices in infant feeding. Take some dollars from the HUGE drive for an increase in infant child care and provide a stipend to mothers. There is a driving concern that there are not enough infant slots for child care.

 Paid Maternity Leave I think that most people only take the 6 or 8 weeks because that is all they are paid by their employer. Some women are forced to go back earlier than this. For a good breastfeeding relationship, mom&apos;s need at least 12 weeks off with their babies. Breastfeeding your child should be considered a reason to continue short term disability/paid maternity leave. You should be able to get paid for the 6 weeks for the mother and the other 6 weeks for the baby. I don&apos;t think you should necessarily be paid your full income, but there is no reason not to pay them for the full 12 weeks. I was able to take 12 weeks off because I have a significant income that allowed me to save plenty while pregnant. Lots of women cannot do this.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Agencies that provide health care should make liberal use of video teleconferencing and other modern technological opportunities to increase training to health care professionals who interract with the perinatal population.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Lactation information should be a required part of all medical education- in medical school, chiropractic school, nursing school, and in all programs training dietitians. As a lactation professional, I understood ignorance 25 years ago but there is NO excuse for ignorance today. There are too many pediatricians that have no knowledge about breastfeeding, do not want to help mothers when problems arise, and feel that formula is just as good. That is just plain wrong. There are too many infants who do not get help from medical caregivers if they have ankyloglossia because pediatricians rely on old information and refuse to believe that this can destroy breastfeeding sometimes. Because they don&apos;t care, and don&apos;t care to learn new information, breastfeeding is lost.

 Use of Banked Human Milk Banked human milk is a valuable commodity. It is available, safe, and extremely important for premature and sick infants, as well as adults who have severe health issues. There is too much ignorance from physicians who do not know about providing this medicine for infants, and who choose not to learn. Physicians who take the time to learn about the importance of banked milk would be very impressed with the usefulness and safety of this practice.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media I understand that in Brazil, the government had women breastfeed on the soap operas, and so many of the women were exposed to breastfeeding, and their breastfeeding rates improved.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings All states should have laws about the legality of breastfeeding in public. Most do already. But, it is important that the word gets out that moms should not have to stay home or hide to breastfeed their infants. It is a cultural expectation in the US that women will bottle feed, so people are used to seeing bottles. It will be just as culturally acceptable someday to see moms nursing in public, without fear of being ridiculed or ask to move to another place. Women are terrified of offending others, so they would rather stay home or feed their babies by bottle out in public. This needs to change.

They need to understand how much better it is for them and their infant to breastfeed for as long as possible, and the financial and insitutional support must be put in place to support this choice.

In one country the postal workers were actually taught to support breastfeeding mothers, and as they went from home to home they offered support.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care It would be great if there were lactation consultants available at all hospitals and birthing centers, including water birthing centers. If I had had one at my disposal when I gave birth and started to nurse my baby, I&apos;d probably still be breast feeding him. I didn&apos;t have that, so I didn&apos;t know what I was doing and during the time that I did nurse my baby, we fought every time I tried to nurse him. He would basically bite me constantly and I would have to either bare the pain, try to re-latch him or let him starve. It made us both very angry with each other, and I was ready to hurt him for hurting me, my version of postpartum depression, which was bad. Luckily my mother and husband were there to support me and help me and my baby through it. I have since been pumping daily to keep him fed and he is healthy and happy. We don&apos;t fight about feeding at all, which is great and he still gets his nutritional needs taken care of, but the bond that grows between mother and baby during nursing was cut very short in this instance.

 Paid Maternity Leave Yes! We are the only developed nation in the world that does not require employers to offer paid maternity leave, and in fact still allow employers to discriminate against mothers (and fathers). Employers are part of social fabric and should have to participate in the social contract...infants need to be with their mothers, especially during the first few months of life. The benefits of this are enormous (breastfeeding is just one part of it). The long term outcomes of a healthy, bonded, breastfed infant are so much better than those who are not, and yet our goverment has to yet to see this as a priority because of the cost to business. If a healthy future generation of workers and citizens is not our goverment&apos;s priority, than what is? I am a stay at home mother in the Washington D.C. region and I see a LOT of infants cared for by nannies. These nannies are experienced and caring women for the most part, but the care they provide does not even compare to that offered by an infants parents, especially a nursing mother. In this area, just making the mortgage payment often requires both parents to work, and the absence of paid maternity/paternity leave forces many many parents back to work before they or their infants are ready. My husband and I make a lot of sacrifices so that I can stay home with my son, but at least we have the option. Many families do not, especially those with children who need a mother&apos;s care the most.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Please support a federal law that allows women to openly breastfeed anywhere. It is a shame that we even need this law, that there are people and institutions who would view this natural, nourishing process as offensive in any way. I was ordered to cover up as a breastfed by a security guard at an outdoor fountain which serves as a play area for children. I refused, and fortunately I was in a public place and my rights are protected here in Maryland. But what if they were not? Or if I was inside a private store? This happens all the time, and most women are too ashamed to refuse these unreasonable demands. I also feel that the lack of women nursing openly in public is part of the reason that more women don&apos;t breastfeed. It&apos;s not seen as a part of everyday life. It&apos;s embarrassing, it&apos;s a pain to cover up every time...just one more incentive to switch baby over to that synthetic nipple and chemcially formula. Good heavens, it makes me angry!

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) I think many programs and physicians are not emphatic enough about the importance of breastfeeding. I don&apos;t know if this is for lack of knowledge, fear of offending mothers who choose not to breastfeed, or pressure from the formula companies (they give a lot of free stuff to pediatricians and then young mothers get lots of flashy formula ads...it is totally uncool). Every new mother should be offered at least one free visit in the home from a certified lactation consultant, and then unlimited free consultation via phone or internet. The benefits of this would be enormous compared to the costs. Early breastfeeding presents many women with a lot of questions and challenges, and this support could help so many make it through that difficult neonatal period and onto the road of long term breastfeeding.

If the mother does not have a committment or the knowledge base behind her infant-feeding decision, she will not be as committed to continuing breastfeeding if she encounters a barrier (no matter how big or small). Peer mentors who can assist adolescents in breastfeeding decisions may encourage younger mothers-to-be to breastfeed initially and longer. Keeping mothers with their babies after the baby is delivered will also ensure the proper bonding and breastfeeding initiation while in the hospital.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media It&apos;s pretty amazing that babies are so typically portrayed as all being bottle-fed in traditional popular media.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I believe it is very important for everyone in the hospital to express to new moms that the breast should be offered any and all times that an infant (under 3mos) seems to be fussy and/or hungry. This is vital to ensure that you will be producing an adequate supply of milk. Eventually an infant will be on a more definitive schedule for eating, but I have found from my own experience that by offering the breast often in the early months, your milk supply will be plentiful.
 608 Concerned Citizen
 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I believe it would be helpful for all who work with pregnant women to assume that the new mothers will breastfeed. This would mean not asking right off whether they plan to breastfeed or bottle-feed. I do not mean that women should not have the choice, but rather breastfeeding should be the default assumption until a mother makes it clear she does not want to.
Working on the assumption that all women will breastfeed leads to some obvious positive changes- education and support should begin immediately, as a part of prenatal care. Education that is primarily the stories of other women (La Leche League style) rather than the common drill of how much better breast milk is than formula would be very helpful- remember, this is operating on the assumption that women will nurse, so there shouldn&apos;t be the same focus on the superiority of one over the other. Statistics, studies etc have their place and many women are interested in these things, but I think a greater impact is made by KNOWING another woman who nursed or is nursing. Seeing women nurse their babies, hearing stories or reading, these are the kinds of things pregnant women need exposure to, and less of the guilt-creating bombardment of stats.
NO samples of formula.
Mothers who have birthed their babies should be gently enabled to hold their babies immediately after and put them to the breast as they like. All non-emergency care of the newborn should be postponed for some hours after the birth. This is critical for helping foster a positive nursing relationship early on.
I could go on and on, but those are my two major concerns: changing our assumptions and allowing the mother to nurse soon after birth without interruptions. Thank you for listening.

I see more moms looking online for help, or possibly phoning a support line or person who is dedicated to breastfeeding. I think that there needs to be more follow-up care in person from all types of organizations in those first few days and weeks postpartum. Having a collaboration of services to ensure the timing of visits is also crucial. If there could be one group that all organizations point to for reference, specifically La Leche Leauge, I feel more mothers would utilize that in the interim when they are not sure who to contact and when (from the other organizations). La Leche League is available for online help, phone calls (at any hour), and in-home visits. There are no strings attached to contacting them and I think many mothers would appreciate a non-governmental agency who is soley dedicated to breastfeeding success in today&apos;s mothers. And to have their services free of charge is also critical for many, too.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Making workplaces more breastfeeding friendly is critical to the health of mothers and nursing babies. I believe a national campaign informing mothers of their rights and getting more workplaces to change policy is a step in the right direction. Lactation support in all areas of life will make it easier for moms who have to work to continue to nurse their babies. I feel many moms already plan to quit nursing when going back to work, and this way they don&apos;t have unneeded worry placed on them from the beginning. Onsite childcare would be a huge advantage to all involved -- moms, babies, and employers. Making more jobs baby-friendly is a good balance for today&apos;s working moms. Milk expression in regards to working should be held in such a regard as being able to breastfeed. Too many moms are pumping in bathrooms stalls or in utility closets. This can&apos;t be good for milk production or the pysche of a nursing mom who has to express milk at work.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Despite many initial struggles with breastfeeding my daughter, I persisted and was able to feed her exclusively with my milk. However, once my maternity leave was complete and I returned to work, I faced a whole new set of issues.
I am a registered nurse. My primary concern when returning to work would be whether I would have someplace clean and private to pump. We have a locker room (with no seating, and is open to all) and a break room (again, open to all). When I asked human resources about pumping at work, they knew nothing about it and referred me to my manager to find a solution to my issue.
In my opinion, HR should be making the effort to find me a clean, private place to pump. It seems like in a hospital filled with nurses (the vast majority of whom are young and female), this is an issue that should have already been addressed, but it&apos;s been ignored. My manager ultimately let me use her office to pump, but that&apos;s only a good solution because I work every weekend and she isn&apos;t around on the weekends. I cannot use an empty patient&apos;s room to pump because I do not feel it is sanitary and the rooms do not have doors I can close.
I know some states have laws mandating that a clean, private place be available for pumping, but PA is not one of them. I strongly believe this should be a law that spans all 50 states.
It is hard enough for me to find the time to pump during my 12.5 hour shift. Sometimes I&apos;m lucky if I get to pump once during the entire day. It&apos;s unfortunate that the very hard work that goes into making breastfeeding successful with a newborn becomes even more difficult once a mom returns to work after 3 months or less. The WHO and APA recommend breastfeeding (or formula) strictly for the first 6 months, and the challenges of work make this more difficult to make a reality.

 Research and Surveillance More research needs to be done on weight gain in breastfed infants. Very frequently, doctors hinder breastfeeding by suggesting the baby is not gaining enough weight and should be fed with formula. Once a new Mom starts using formula, she most likely will not successfully breastfeed. Supplementation can be responsible for a plummenting milk supply and a feeling of inadequecy in the new Mom. These factors (especially when combined with other outside stessors) are often responsible for the Mom believing that she &apos;just couldn&apos;t breastfeed&apos;. If she encounters a stressful introduction to breastfeeding, she will likely continue to formula feed all of her children.
Simiarly, more research needs to establish the benefits of feeding formula to babies with jaundice. This practice is highly determental to breastfeeding.

I personally provide home visits for Healthy Start and I would love for every new Lactating mom to have a home visit during the first 2 weeks post partum. So many moms I talk to quit before they have really given herself and the baby a chance to learn how to breastfeed. WIC is a wonderful program, but most moms know they can always get free formula, so why should they make breastfeeding work. Prenatal Breastfeeding Education is paramount for all pregnant women,but most women do not read or watch anything on breastfeeding.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I know that when I had my two children, I was given formula samples and coupons many times by mail, the hospital and my children&apos;s pediatrician. If we want to truly support women breastfeeding, I believe this practice has to stop. I&apos;m not saying the free samples shouldn&apos;t be made available to those who do choose to formula feed their babies, but to just send/give formula samples by the doctors and hospitals it sends a message that formula is normal. I also believe that every woman should have extended access to lactaction consultants after childbirth. This should be something covered under all health plans as well as being available to women who don&apos;t have health coverage. Thank you, Michelle Finseth

If the government really wants to help and encorage these to moms breastfeed, offer additional $ to let them do that. Give families the option of decreasing WIC $ for money to live on for a set amount of time,say 6 months. Is this not how long our AAP recommends to exclusivly breastfeed.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Many moms are very timid and nervous about breastfeeding in public because they are scared someone will complain or make negative comments and rude remarks to them. There also has been a lot of news of brestfeeding moms being kicked out or banned from certain places of business for breastfeeding in public. This sort of behavior is what creates a negative effect on breastfeeding mothers; many of whom want to avoid as much conflict as possible. It is stressful enough to have a hungry baby, and to stop what you are doing and find a place to nurse while maybe even taking care of other children at the same time. Added stress is not necessary! I think society needs to come to terms that breastfeeding is the most natural and beneficial act and leave us breastfeeding mothers alone to feed our children in peace.

They also need to have ready referrals to breastfeeding support systems (Lactation Consultants, Peer Counselors, La Leche League, etc.) to give to moms who are struggling.
Additionally, doctors need to be reeducated on the different weight charts for infant formula versus breastfed babies. The WHO has published charts for breastfed babies, and it&apos;s obvious from comparing them to the AAP charts that formula babies are naturally heavier than breastfed babies, but that doesn&apos;t make breastfed babies less healthy! However, it does mean that more moms are pushed to supplement with infant formula, ultimately reducing their supply, and

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media I have already made this comment. Storylines of Television programs could include breastfeeding and information regarding why it is important. Human milk banking would be a great drama and worked into a story. Much of the truthful information about human milk would blow people away. They would think it is science fiction and then the screen credits could give the resource bibliography. A whole movie about an infant born to a family could include breastfeeding. This does not even have to be a main focus, just show people breastfeeding in the story. For instance, a movie about a family trapped in a blizzard or flood could save the baby and toddler because the mother was lactating. Or a movie about a dad who is a coach of some notariety could just happen to have a wife that breastfeeds.

 Paid Maternity Leave As a working mom, it was incredibly difficult for me to continue breastfeeding after my daughter went into full-time day care at 6 months old. My day care center was a drive from my workplace, which made it impossible for me to go to my daughter in person to breastfeed her. I had a supportive workplace in which to pump, but my daughter did prefer to breastfeed at the breast. If I had had the luxury (like they do in many Western countries - France, Canada) to have an extended, paid maternity leave of at least 1 year, my breastfeeding experience could have been so much more positive for both me and my daughter. As it was, we had to supplement with formula. In all it turned out fine, but I wonder why we, of all nations, treasure motherhood less than other societies. I realize that now, in the midst of an economic crisis, that providing for extended paid maternity leave may be a pipe dream, but it could do wonders to help this generation of moms who struggle for that delicate balance the first year of a child&apos;s life, as well as the children they are nurturing.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In my experience with maternal and infant care in through ob-gyn&apos;s as it relates to breastfeeding there is not enough support or encouragement through the ob-gyn&apos;s for mothers to breastfeed even when they are determined to do so. The doctors/nurses send the baby&apos;s off to NICU so many times and do not promote the mother baby nursing bond that is essential in the first hour after birth to make nursing a learned practice for the baby so that it is not so difficult for the mother. The nurses should not be putting pacifiers and bottles in baby&apos;s mouth and instead giving baby to mom so she can breastfeed. Doctors need to stop giving out formula and act as though it is the norm to bottle feed. A plan to breastfeed for fifteen to twenty minutes after the birth should be enacted so that the baby has nursing down pat and then mom and baby can get cleaned up and baby returned to mom for more nursing. If the first hour goes by and the baby does not nurse, he sleeps through the most important learning time and from then on it is much more difficult for both baby and mom. Doctors/nurses need to have this on the front of their minds after baby is out of mom&apos;s belly. Lansinoh is a huge help. It should be on hand and given to mom to put in her nipples so it does not hurt. Nursing also helps mom&apos;s uterus contract so it stops the bleeding and she does not need pitocin etc..... so if she nurses right after birth the benefits are: baby learns to nurse and this makes long term nursing possible and likely and easier, mom&apos;s uterus contracts and she stops bleeding and begins to recover from birth immediately which eliminates hemmorhaging possibilites etc......

For example, nurse on demand, supplementing can wreck havoc with milk supply, there are many ways to increase supply, don&apos;t hesitate to call a lactation consultant.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I was a Neonatal ICU nurse for a number of years before I had my own children. I realize that breastfeeding in our society is sometimes not the most convenient. But I think 80-90% of our moms pumped in the Nicu, they may have not continued to nurse at home or they just pumped milk in a bottle. But they saw the importance of the milk . We as nurses and the medical community see a difference in outcomes from BM to formula. In my own experience when both my children were sick they would only take BM and could only digest that when vomiting, diarrhea, or bad colds...and at least they were getting nutrition. Not just pedialyte. But we live in this society where we do not want to make others feel guilty , rather than eduacting them on the seriousness of breastfeeding and also what baby needs most is their mothers. Any amount of time a mom nurses is better than no nursing.
I went to a children&apos;s museum the other day with my boys and I only saw one mom nurse, in a nursing dungeon corner. Every mom or caregiver was bottle feeding. We frown upon a mom nursing in public, standing in a line, etc....what would mom then com to. Do what everyone else is doing. Anyway, we need more prenatal and hospital support. thank you.

 Paid Maternity Leave As a graduate student on a federal fellowship, I needed a way to take maternity leave but there was no mechanism included in the fellowship to do so. Many women in science face this dilemma at all levels of academia. If you work hard enough to win a grant or fellowship, you are basically &apos;not allowed&apos; to take leave to establish good breastfeeding practices because of the time sensitive nature of the funds.

How can a new mother establish a breastfeeding relationship with her child when she has to return to work within weeks of giving birth? Just when they establish it, at 5-6 weeks, a majority have to return to work because they are not receiving paid maternity. With the prospect of breastfeeding or returning to work to keep their house, most moms will choose to return to work, stop breastfeeding and switch to formula.

My son was born 5 weeks early and could not breast feed or bottle feed. We basically had a nurse scare us into formula feeding through a tube--even though the nurse instead should have had me pump and provide colostrum instead. When we finally had a lactation consultant to help us on Monday; they were outraged (as when they had me start pumping I produced ample amounts of colostrum)that the nurses chose formula rather than have me pump. As a first time mom I had absolutely no clue. Over the next month I worked very closely with the lactation consultants as I had a intensely strong desire to breastfeed my child.

It would be great if the NBME would make breastfeeding a focus of the boards--it would force breastfeeding to be a more prominent topic in medical education. Medical students should learn medications and substances that are safe or contraindicated for breastfeeding, infectious diseases that are compatible/non-compatible with breastfeeding, common breastfeeding problems and their management, the composition and immunology of human milk, and current recommendations for breastfeeding.
Also, many woman physicians find it very difficult to breastfeed and pump milk during their medical training. This leads to less personal experience with breastfeeding and less comfort counseling women on breastfeeding. Medical colleges and residency training programs should provide sanitary places (not bathrooms) for mothers to pump, and publish guidelines for instructors and administrators on how to support nursing mothers during their medical training (the AAP has already done so).

The center in which I choose hd no knowledge of how to heat or how long breastmild could be stored before my daughter arrived. All the other children her age were formula feed.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Comments/warnings on package inserts and PDR info on various drugs are often needlessly restrictive and ignore existing research on breastfeeding and the drug. If the AAP includes information about a drug in their listing of medications&apos; compatability with breastfeeding, then inclusion of that information should be required in any manufacturer&apos;s statements on that topic.

 Paid Maternity Leave The U.S. ranks in the bottom of industrialized nations for maternity leave benefits. If women had paid maternity leave benefits, breastfeeding would be much easier because moms could take the time to stay home with their infants and establish this feeding option. Breastfeeding takes time and patience, and many new mothers feel the pressure of returning to work keeps them from having breastfeeding as an option. In addition, if fathers had some paternity leave benefits, this would further encourage and support mothers who are breastfeeding (especially in homes with more than one child).

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Encouraging for breastfeeding should start at the first prenatal visit. Breastfeeding education should be mandatory. In the hospital after baby&apos;s birth, every effort should be made for mother and infant to have time as soon as possible after delivery for breastfeeding to start. Lactation specialists should be available for every mother in the post-delivery period, so that breastfeeding can begin successfully before mother and infant are discharged home.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media Even in the most advanced cities in this country, so many people are very unaware of the true benefits of breastfeeding. It has been demoralized and sexualized by many so that when a mom is out with a baby and needs to breastfeed, she is made to feel ashamed and asked to cover up or go to a private place. Though mom&apos;s have the legal right to breastfeed in public, most of the public is not educated on the legal rights. Whenever the media has a story about breastfeeding in any context, breastfeeding is always described as Hard to do or difficult, or something easily substituted with formula. There is more of a negative light when it comes to breastfeeding that it is truly sad many new mothers and mothers to be will often follow that unsound heresay and go against what is best for mom and baby or following their natural instinct. Popular media continues to only portray the difficulty of breastfeeding while many moms do not have difficulty and find it easy to do. Society is so far away from the day where a mom can breastfeed her child and not get dirty looks, shunned upon or be asked to not do that. Breastfeeding is not an act of bad behavior!!!

Hospitals need to stop handing out formula bags (diaper bags with free formula samples given by the formula companies). Studies show that hospitals which do not hand out these bags have a higher rate of breastfeeding mothers when mother and baby are discharged. The mother and baby couple needs to be provided with a positive and encouraging lactation consultant. There should be enough lactation consultants on the floor so that the consultants have plenty of time to assist all mothers.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media As a parent, I have found it practically impossible to find books, movies, videos, and other media that portray breastfeeding as acceptable and normal. Bottles abound, even in adds for breastfeeding. Breastfeeding, if mentioned, is usually negatively commented on unless the book or movie came out before 1950 or after 2000. Prejudices against breastfeeding are still being emphasized. It&apos;s truly frustrating to raise my children without them becoming confused. But I think what&apos;s worse is that there have been many places where the topic could have been raised in a respectful manner in the media, and instead they&apos;ve buried the topic because of controversy and the possibility that people may become uncomfortable or they&apos;ve sensationalized one area making it into a war, when it shouldn&apos;t be.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Many health care providers are ignorant of the benefits of breastfeeding. I knew a nurse who tried to convince her daughter-in-law that breastfeeding was going to harm her child because she ate things like pizza and soda and these things would contaminate the milk and thus the baby. Now, we all know that pizza and soda are not the best things to eat, but the value of breast milk by far outweighs the value of formula even if the mother eats an occasional cheese burger. All health care professionals should have to attend mandatory conferences to educate them on the value of breastmilk. Also, it should be in the curriculum for upcoming health care professionals to learn in their training.

After only a few months into breastfeeding as a first time mother it became very apparent that all of the people who medically cared for us knew less about breastfeeding (technique, problems and growth of breastfed babies) than I did. I live in an area where it is more accepted, so I shudder at the tales of women who don&apos;t. The care industry is supported and coddled too much by formula companies. Formula is too readily available and care providers don&apos;t seem to be able so voice their risks to patients. Formula samples are given all the time, but where are the breastfeeding materials? Our care providers should be voicing the true order of infant feeding: 1. At the breast. 2. Expressed milk from mother. 3. Expressed milk from donor. 4. Formula.

I think some women aren&apos;t aware that this support is separate from and better than their doctor&apos;s. They don&apos;t know who to call, how much it will cost and if insurance covers it. They also don&apos;t know when to call. It would be nice to get information either at the hospital or in a prenatal visit. It should contain contact information of specific lactation consultants and specific indicators of when to call.
Where possible it should be mandatory that a lactation consultant meet with a patient before discharge.

Over 90 percent of medical and nursing schools do not teach the basics of breastfeeding.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support As a mother of three, I have enjoyed breastfeeding, but it is not without challenges. Fortunately our income allows us to pay for expensive breast pumps and lactation consultants. I believe ALL mothers, regardless of income or social status deserve access to GOOD lactation consultants, and hospital grade breast pumps, and nutrition supplements or herbal supplements to help increase milk supply if necessary. ALL mothers DESERVE this for themself and their babies. The hospitals should STOP giving free formula, and give free lactation visits and free pump rentals until breastfeeding has been successfully established. Here in the US we have WIC to help with food and we have food stamps, formula assistance, free birth control - WHY DO WE NOT HAVE FREE HELP FOR BREASTFEEDING? Breastfeeding in the long run is MUCH CHEAPER than buying formula for 12 months, and gives babies much better immunity - less cost for health care - AND reduces mother&apos;s risk for breast cancer...etc. In the long run, the US would save money by investing in breastfeeding.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings There are many public places where women are harrassed or even forbidden to breastfeed. Breastfeeding is FEEDING - it is NATURAL, it is BEST - we are mammals!! Women should be able to breastfeed ANYWHERE, ANYTIME without hassle from employees or store managers. Babies need to eat often, and women have to leave home with their babies - especially single moms.
Most stores and restaurants have womens, men&apos;s, and family bathrooms, or at least a changing table. Stores and restaurants need to have a nursing room - a rocker in the nice corner of the bathroom at a minimum - or a proper little room with a rocker and a changing table - where a mom can get privacy.
If a store or restaurant does not want to provide a separate nursing area, then they should be required to adopt a policy that a baby can nurse ANYWHERE - even on the best display couch in the store - because it is a baby&apos;s right to be fed.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There are not enough mother - baby friendly hospitals. I am referring to placing a TOP priority on the mother baby bond - starting with support for less medicated birth, and including no separation for baby (unless truly medically necessary). Early bonding for baby immediately after birth has HUGE consequences on breastfeeding success. There are WAY too many PROCEDURES done on a newborn, that could be postponed by an hour or two with no adverse health effects - thus allowing a baby and mom to bond and establish breastfeeding as a FIRST not a last after the baby is upset and has undergone shots and tests and poking and prodding.
Also, prenatal care has a MINIMAL focus on breastfeeding. Breastfeeding classes should be taught and include mothers who come breastfeeding (ask for volunteers from La Leche League - they&apos;ll come!) Sitting in a class taking notes will not teach you much - you need the information and the EXPERIENCE of SEEING babies breastfeed to learn how it is done.
All moms to be, should be contacted BEFORE birth by a Lactation specialist who WILL meet with them after birth, unless they are already successful and confident in their feeding.
Too often the lactation consultants employed by hospitals are FAR below the level of knowledge and helpfulness as the private, expensive lacation consultants. This should not be - we pay ENOUGH for our doctors and hospitals, they should have the best lactation consultants!

 Other Areas In my opinion, the ten most important actions, that must be taken immediately, to promote breastfeeding in the U.S. are:
1. Allow mothers and babies, unless a medical emergency occurs, to spend the first hour after birth together. 2. No infant should be given supplemental sugar water or formula, unless the mother requests it. 3. Preemie babies need breastmilk and human contact as much as, or more than, full-term babies. Hospitals should be required to allow these best-health practices. 4. The c-section rate must be lowered! Mothers who deliver by surgical means, statistically, have a harder time with breastfeeding. 5. Mothers should not be sent home from hospitals with bags of formula samples! 6. Eight weeks of paid leave plus four additional weeks of unpaid leave should be given to all new mothers. 7. Fathers should be given two weeks of paid paternity leave; this would allow for new mothers to have support during the crucial first days of breastfeeding establishment. 8. Every state should have laws protecting mothers&apos; rights breastfeed in any public place they have the right to be in and should be able to take legal action if this right is suppressed. 9. WIC programs should discontinue the practice of giving free formula to women who are capable of breastfeeding. This is a waste of taxpayers&apos; money and is unhealthy for the mothers and babies who receive this

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There seems to be a lot of importance on the prenatal and hospital stay part of these practices for the mother. I noticed that they drop the ball on the post delivery care for the mother and the child. There is no national standard in place to check up on any new mothers right after birth. That is a overwhelming feeling to be a new mom and I think more education and home visits to the new mothers home would be great to put in place. It would answer a lot of questions new moms have and that there would be an increase in breastfeeding.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support As an IBCLC, my clients report that they had to repeatedly request lactation help during their hospital stays; breast pumps were difficult to obtain and were not properly explained; and the lactation care that they did happen to receive was almost always rushed, poorly timed, and often more confusing to the mom than helpful. The moms are being taught very bad technique that results in painful latch, poor milk transfer, low weight gain, low milk supply, formula supplementation, and high breastfeeding failure. I believe that this is the main reason that our breastfeeding initiation rate is high, but most of those couplets wean in the first few weeks.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences As an IBCLC, my job is to provide education, information, support and encouragement to breastfeeding mothers and babies. It&apos;s so frustrating when I offer accurate, current, evidence-based information to my clients, but they are reluctant to believe my information when their pediatrician or OB provides conflicting information that is outdated, opinion-based, and usually detrimental to the breastfeeding relationship. I am required by my certification to remain current in breastfeeding information, yet doctors are allowed to go around spewing whatever thoughts or ideas they scrounged up. Many health care providers are biased toward formula feeding and push formula when breastfeeding problems arise, rather than urging the mother to get help with her breastfeeding problems. Doctors really need to get on board with the AAP, who urges mothers to exclusively breastfeed for the first six months, etc. Add in the WHO code as it relates to the marketing of breast milk substitutes, and we would have a much healthier USA.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression An area that would help promote breastfeeding for working lactating mothers, is mandatory areas for milk expression and the time needed to do it. Many mothers are not given this opportunity and it makes it much more difficult to pump during working hours if expression needs to take place somewhere inconvenient or less than welcoming. Women who have to resort to restroom stalls, storage closets and cars are much less likely to continue breastfeeding. In addition, lactating mothers have different expression needs. Babies are individuals too and aren&apos;t necessarily on feeding schedules that are every 3-4 hours. Therefore, mothers that are only given time during meal hours may be forced to have a lower milk supply because they are unable to express milk as often as necessary to keep up the needs of their baby/babies.

 Paid Maternity Leave Maternity leave is a vital time for mothers to recuperate from labor and delivery, connect and bond with baby/babies, and adjust to a major life change. From first-time mothers adapting to breastfeeding, to a mother having subsequent children and the challenges of a growing family, time off after birth is imperative. Most mothers and/or families cannot afford to have extended unpaid time off. Employers should realize that paid maternity leave, or even partially paid leave, is not just a financial issue. Employees will have more job satisfaction and the future generation of the working population will be getting the best start possible. Additionally, it would be helpful to have paid leave that coincides with the Family Medical Leave Act. Every woman should be granted the opportunity to be home after the birth of a child for 12 full weeks if desired. When other developed countries offer citizens 6 months and more of leave and paid time off, it seems that the United States should be more than able to provide women with 3 months. Furthermore, paid leave should also be available to mothers that work part-time as well even if it is partially paid.

 Paid Maternity Leave I see to many women worrying about going back to work and how they will juggle pumping, working, and taking care of new baby not to mention finding quality daycare for a newborn. I think we need to look at how other countries help families take care of there youngest citizen. I am not asking for a nanny, but maybe a longer paid maternity leave. Full pay for 8 weeks. 75 % pay for the next 2 months, 50% pay for the next 4 months 25 % until the baby is a year . One of two things will happen families will learn that they can live on less and parents will be raising there children. We will have older babies going into daycare. (As former daycare provider I can tell you that the older a babies is the easier on everyone) or families will see they really need a job and go back to work before the 6 months. We are spending this money already between daycare assistance and medicaid. Why not let the person best equipped for the job do the job and give her a little money to make it work.

 Other Areas My grown daughter is a 3rd generation breast feeder.She and her husband have 3 children,ages 5, 3,and 1.Circumstances have now placed into her life 2 more children, ages 3 and 1.They are her husbands niece and nephew.The one year old has only known formula.My daughter is standing by her convictions to breast feeding, and is now pumping to give this little boy all the benefits of breast milk.Her own one year old has been weaning, so her milk supply has been on the decline.Fortunately her friend has had a baby in the last 5 months, and has a reserve of breast milk in her freezer and is willing to share until her own breast milk increases again. I am incredibly proud of the fact that my daughter refuses to give in to polluting this little boy with what his own mother has thought to be the way to feed a child.I have often wondered about moms who claim to not have enough milk, along with other various excuses as to why they with held breast feeding from their babies. This has not been easy for my daughter and son in law, quite the contrary.They are completely exhausted, and yet refuse to give in to the easy way of feeding this precious little boy.Bottling a new baby should not be an option for parents.My children were raised believing that bottles had no place in the home,even for pretend.Parenting is not an easy endeavor.Breastfeeding can sometimes be a challenge.With all of the new ways of researching parenting and what is best for your baby, no mom needs to pollute her baby with infant formula.I see that as an incredibly selfish and ignorant form of abuse on a helpless human. So new moms and dads, go ahead and do what you must,but know this, when I see you bottling your baby in public, I will be seeing abuse to an infant.I know that this is very harsh, but it is time to take a stand on this issue.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am an American citizen who has been living in Copenhagen, Denmark for the past year and a half. I consider myself very fortunate to have given birth in a Danish hospital which has the WHO Baby-Friendly certification. (See http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/bfhi/en/index.html for complete text on the guidelines.) I wonder why hospitals in the U.S. do not follow these same principles? Thanks to the WHO Baby Friendly guidelines, I believe I had a very good support in becoming a successful breastfeeding mother.
I think the single most important guideline that U.S. hospitals need to adopt immediately and wholeheartedly is compliance with the international code of marketing and breast-milk substitutes. In a nutshell, free samples of baby formula should not be distributed in a hospital or in pediatrician&apos;s office. Further, even nipple shields or pacifiers can be a hindrance to developing good breast feeding practices in the crucial hours and weeks after birth; hospitals should not give these out under any circumstances.
Next, I think it is extremely important that a newborn child be given the opportunity to breast feed from its mother immediately following birth. In my case, the hospital staff placed my daughter on my chest, helped me guide her to my breast, and allowed my baby and I to explore breastfeeding in an unpressured setting for the first two hours after birth. Weighing, cleaning, etc. was postponed until after the first feeding, and all procedures were conducted in the same room with mother and father present. The baby was never whisked away to a nursery for or other location for any reason; she was in my immediate care for our entire 48-hour hospital stay and I was encouraged to feed the baby on-demand around the clock so that my milk supply was quickly established.
I know new mothers who unfortunately did not receive the same type of hospital care and guidance. They were given nipple shields, ointments and pacifiers at the hospital, and their babies were not able to establish good suckling wit the breast. In other cases, the baby was not able to have a first feed with its mother immediately after birth. It then became an uphill battle to teach the baby how to suckle in the days after birth.
The birth process should be viewed by hospitals as a natural event, not a sickness needing to be treated, and as such mothers should be given plenty of time and support to develop positive breast-feeding practices with their children. I hope my comments will help the US to develop more baby-friendly practices so that other new mothers can have the same positive experiences with breastfeeding that I have had.

 Use of Banked Human Milk There is great opportunity to expand human milk banks in this country. I believe the greatest resistance to using banked milk is the lack of understanding of its safety. The government needs to put out a statement supporting its value and safety. Only then will the administrators and neonatologists in our Baby-Friendly certified hospital agree to purchase, store and use banked milk. I believe that in situations where babies need supplementation in the hospital, supplementing with banked human milk would greatly encourage mothers to work thru those early feeding challenges and ultimately provide their own milk. Many women give up when they see the bottles of formula appear for their babies in the hospital. The formula undermines their confidence, especially in hospitals that provide poor lactation support. I did a survey of pregnant women in our community in 2006 regarding interest in banked human milk. The majority of women (62%) replied that they would either prefer banked human milk or use banked human milk if recommended by the physician if their babies needed supplementation in the hospital. Interestingly, more than 70% of all women surveyed answered that they would be willing to donate some of their milk. The greatest concern among the pregnant women surveyed was safety of the milk. This is the same concern that I have heard from physicians and administrators in our hospital. Now is the time to move forward with this relatively untapped resource by providing funds for more research and a government statement about safety

 Other Areas Pharmacists in most major pharmacies are still using the PDR for drug information on breastfeeding. Unfortunately, women are often told to &apos;not breastfeed&apos; by pharmacists when this information is absolutely not true. This is unethical medical practice. A recent example is a lactating woman for whom I provided a clindamycin prescription. She was told by the pharmacist that she should not breastfeed while taking the medication! Something needs to be done to teach pharmacists lactation physiology and appropriate resources for drug information during lactation. And, if pharmacists believe that a woman should not breastfeed while taking a certain drug, they should contact the physician who wrote the script. This sort of advice is not appropriate for a pharmacist to give casually to a patient. It should be handled in the same way that an allergy is. If a patient has an allergy to a med that is prescribed, the pharmacist calls the doctor to find an alternative for the patient.

 Use of Banked Human Milk With current childbirth practices, it seems that many babies lose at least 10% of their birth weight, and parents are told that they must supplement. If only babies were supplemented with banked human milk instead of formula, the risk of diabetes could be lowered, and babies would be healthier. It would also emphasize, to parents, the importance of human milk and the risk of formula! If supplement were given with spoon, tiny cup, or dropper, it would decrease the risk of nipple confusion.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Returning to work has been linked to reduced breastfeeding duration (Fein, Mandal, and Roe, 2008).
Feeding the infant directly at work and pumping at work have been shown to promote increased intensity (number of breast milk feedings versus supplemental artificial baby milk feedings) and duration of breastfeeding, with feeding the infant directly being the most effective practice for both increased intensity and duration (Fein, Mandal, and Roe, 2008). Of the women who stopped breastfeeding when their infant was between three and five months of age, 21.3 percent – or one in five mothers – said they could not or did not want to breastfeed at work (Li, Fein, Chen, and Grummer-Strawn, 2008).
Actions Desired Congress should enact legislation that supports breastfeeding and/or pumping at work. Baby-Friendly Workplace legislation should contain the following points for businesses to follow: 1.Providing unpaid breaks as needed for milk expression, 2.Making accommodations for privacy when pumping, 3.Providing a source of clean water, and 4.Providing a place for milk refrigeration (Wilson-Clay, et al., 2005).
When possible, employers should support direct breastfeeding of children in the workplace. It is acknowledged that having access to the infant at work may be difficult or even dangerous, and not all occupations lend themselves to breastfeeding or pumping in the workplace. In these extreme situations, companies could be exempted from the legislation.
Legal Precedent for Desired Action (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2008) Other states have laws or resolutions that promote, encourage, or protect breastfeeding in the workplace. A summary of those legal actions follows: Twenty-five states, including Arizona, protect breastfeeding from any claims of public indecency. California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming all have laws or resolutions that either encourage or require employers to provide breaks, privacy, and/or refrigeration facilities to breastfeeding mothers. Texas, Florida, and Washington allow a “mother-friendly,” “baby-friendly,” or “infant-friendly” designation to be used by businesses that agree to abide by certain provisions that support breastfeeding.
Arguments Against Breastfeeding in the Workplace Many employers might not support mandated support for breastfeeding in the workplace for a variety of reasons: disruption to work and staffing schedules and costs to provide privacy and refrigeration being two of the major concerns. However, for every dollar spent on breastfeeding, companies save three dollars because women return to work earlier and take fewer sick days, while staff turnover is reduced (American Public Health Association, 2007). Unpaid breaks for breastfeeding or pumping can be rolled into already scheduled breaks during the workday, thus minimizing workplace disruption.
Conclusion Nearly half of all states (21 out of 50) support breastfeeding in the workplace, which shows political will, but more should be done. Because of the health, social, and financial benefits, Congress should develop legislation to strongly support and protect breastfeeding in the workplace.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I work at a hospital with no lactation support for employees...I had to beg and borrow rooms to express milk in. I think that supporting women&apos;s breastfeeding when they return to work would really increase the amount of women who continue pumping after their maternity leave is over. Longer maternity leave or even paid maternity leave would also be a huge help. Breastfeeding is amazing for the mother and the child, but it is also a struggle when you have no support from your employer-if a hospital doesn&apos;t provide support how do we expect other companies too??

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Evidence based quailty care is strong when making protocols and practices in the hospital setting. Evidence based quality care does not mean that one person tells you one thing and another person tells you another. Quality care in the field of breastfeeding means that you have been educated and know evidence that you are basing your teaching on. Good evidence based research is out there and the health professional must be on top of his/her game to make quality breastfeeding decisions. A MD ordering supplementations based on weight loss only is not providing quality or evidenced based healthcare decisions. Looking at the big picture;is your milk in?, how is the infant breastfeeding?, what is jaundice level, is the infant waking to eat and eating well at the breast? Quality care should be to order a IBCLC consult rather then ordering supplementation.
 832 Health Care Provider
 Research and Surveillance Anyone making guidelines or protocols in the field of breastfeeding should have an IBCLC on the committee. The AAP just published a Safe and Healthy Beginnings pack for the clinician on breastfeeding and jaundice. Their expert team DID NOT have an IBCLC on the team.

NJ has a law which allows women to breastfeed wherever she is allowed to be otherwise, yet mall personnel felt compelled to remove her from the premises because she was using her breasts for their primary function.

 Paid Maternity Leave The barriers to successful breastfeeding in the United States are wide ranging. We lack role models (positive images of successful breastfeeding), appropriate lactation support in our medical institutions, poor access to home birth, and the list goes on. The majority of US mothers cannot rest and establish their milk supply and bond with their babies because they are under such intense pressure. Even before they give birth they anticipate their return to work or worry about how they will manage when their salary and benefits disappear. Many times their carrier track, all they have worked for, is lost when they make the choice of staying home over returning to work after a very short maternity leave. It is really obvious to me as a postpartum caregiver working with new mothers that we are shamefully behind in supporting families when compared to European, Scandinavian and many other countries. I am not a scholar or statistician. The statistics of how the US ranks in maternity leave (paternity leave too) is outline in the film “Motherhood Manifesto”, a devastating look at how we value motherhood as a nation. Breastfeeding is a job. It is a time consuming job and for many, a challenging job. It a woman’s work and we do not honor women&apos;s work and compensate women for this uniquely feminine function that is ideal for nourishing newborns and babies. We need to support (with paid leave and medical benefits) women and their families better in the first year of life after the birth of a child. This will go very far in increasing breastfeeding rates in the USA. Karen Fleischer, Postpartum Doula, Kensington, CA, -- Metta Doula Service

 Paid Maternity Leave The facts are there if we just look, the USA has one of the worst breastfeeding rates in the world, and the shortest paid maternity leave in the developed world. It is a very obvious link. What is more valuable, our children, or business? When we invest in people, it comes around to better business too, unfortunately we have all been told otherwise. The USA is supposed to be wealthy, so how can people argue that we can&apos;t afford a long maternity leave? That business would suffer and so would our wallets? Other countries afford it just fine (Canada for one) and they are poorer in the first place! There is no argument that holds water, what we save in short maternity leave we pay in medical bills, look at the statistics for breast fed and bottle fed babies, we are buying drugs, Dr. visits, and hospital stays for all those formula fed babies!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a mother, a professional nurse, and now a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, I find that a key to successful breastfeeding is during the initial postpartum period (the initial 48 hours after giving birth). Also, the following 2 weeks after discharge from the hospital.
I think breastfeeding is a public health issue. If we look at England, nurses continue to take care of the community like the US used to do.
I believe we need to bring nurses back to the community and support our breastfeeding mothers and promote the duration of breastfeeding.
As a mother, I needed someone to tell me that I was doing it right. It is very stressful to continue to do something when you think you are not doing it correctly.
As a former home visiting nurse (I conducted postpartum home visits to all women in a community hospital in IL)most women could not wait for the nurse to visit. They were overwhelmed, stressed by dad&apos;s and grandma&apos;s advice.
As a pediatric nurse practitioner so many women are needlessly supplementing with formula. There is a gap in knowledge with many women about milk supply, they are not aware the importance of nursing on demand, as well as many of the other benefits that breast milk has.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends I think Mom&apos;s need to be encouraged to talk about what they do, why are we not educating girls and young ladies about good mothering skills? We are teaching all sorts of information to kids these days but very few real life skills. It is almost like breastfeeding is the taboo topic of our century, sexuality is freely discussed but nursing babies is not?! I am a breastfeeding advocate and freely talk to all who are interested, unfortunately that is very few people, but the ones I have talked to are glad that we did.

 Research and Surveillance Not sure what is wanted here as far as comments go but I just like to mention that truly there is very little research needed, the entire history of the human race depended on, and successfully populated the earth powered on breast milk. We don&apos;t need research to tell us that what our bodies naturally make is better than anything that man can make, we don&apos;t even understand all the details of breast milk yet, the complexity escapes us. Why replace something that is perfect with something that is not? Not to mention the expense, time, and health risks involved. The evidence is all there....

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Prenatal care should include breastfeeding information presented as a health care choice, not merely a feeding choice. All the emphasis is placed on the birth rather than care for the infant. The delivery takes hours, breastfeeding benefits last mother&amp;child a lifetime. Infant formula should be provided by prescription. Hospitals should have resources in place to provide each post partum couplet with in patient&amp;out patient access to breastfeeding assistance. Policies should support&amp;reinforce the breastfeeding pair and providers, especially the pediatricians should be required to complete ongoing continued education in terms of new research on breastfeeding. Hospital beds should be configured to allow moms&amp;babies to sleep together, skin to skin as desired.

 Paid Maternity Leave As a working mother, I feel that our current maternity leave system is unacceptable. Basically if a new mother can afford to take unpaid leave and if she and her company meet the requirements, she can take 3 months off unpaid. Others, unfortunately only end up with 6 weeks (if that)of short term disability and sometimes that too is unpaid. My mother worked with someone who came back to work at 2 weeks post-partum. Based on my experience, 6 weeks is not enough time to establish a good breastfeeding relationship with a new baby. I remember when my son was 6 weeks, I was still having many breastfeeding issues including lots of pain and soreness and luckily I was able to take off my unpaid time (I had 18 weeks total) and those issues finally were resolved a few weeks later. My supply was still establishing itself as well. I feel that if the new recommendations are to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months, then we need our economy, government and private companies (large&amp;small) to support that. Ideally a minimum of 6 months should be given and in order to encourage more women to use that time off, it should be paid. Whether the whole 6 months is paid should be up to the government to institute a fair policy, so all women, whether they work at large or small companies can take advantage of it. Also I think its important to have some sort of transition period back to work, like allowing the employee to work reduced hours for a few weeks so its not a shock to her or the baby to be separated all day. For me, returning to work full time after being off for 4 months was extremely difficult especially since he was still so young. I cannot imagine going back to work in a high demanding job after only 6 weeks off. A 6 week old still needs his mother. A comparison study should be done comparing breastfeeding rates with countries with no paid leave versus those who give several months or a year of paid leave.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression In order for the mother to continue breastfeeding after going back to work, better laws need to be put in place in order for her to be able to pump without fear of losing her job or just getting flack from other co-workers for taking breaks during the day. I count myself very lucky that my company has mothers rooms for pumping and so far I have made good use of it, by being able to pump 2x per day with support from my supervisor. My son is nearly 8 months old and I feel happy that I am still able to pump enough milk for him. Others, however aren&apos;t so lucky. I good friend of mine, only had time to pump at lunch and she had to use the bathroom and her outcome was unfortunate in that her supply dropped very quickly and she had to give her son formula at 3 months old. I encouraged her to talk to her boss, but given that she had just started her new job, she said she was afraid of losing her job. I felt so bad for her. I get upset every time I read a news article where the mother is forced to pump in a bathroom or is not allowed to take pumping breaks. A lactating woman needs those breaks to express milk since it does get uncomfortable and can lead to plugged ducts or mastitis (missed days of work)if one hasn&apos;t pumped in awhile. State laws and federal laws need to be updated to include worksite milk expression for working mothers in order for them to continue being able to feed their baby breastmilk.

There are far too many mothers who are confused about how to get a good start with breastfeeding because of conflicting or misguided information. Then they leave the hospital with an arm full of formula samples, instructions about formula feeding, and uncertainties about their abilities to exclusively breastfeed... Or if to continue at all!

 Paid Maternity Leave I work in an environment supportive of me pumping milk for my children. However, paid maternity leave is not offered. I needed to return to work when my first son was only 5 weeks old to make sure the bills were paid! I&apos;m expecting my second son in a few weeks, and I have managed to better save up for my maternity leave this time around. However, my leave time is directly corelated with how much money I have saved, not with how well my son will be doing or with how well our breastfeeding is going. The irony of this is that if I have a hard time establishing a healthy breastfeeding relationship with my son (unable to latch due to health issues, etc) I will end up spending more money and time on supplementation or doctor visits or sick leave in his first year. Having even one month of paid maternity leave would allow a mother to get her child off to the best start possible. This would benefit the employer by having a more at-ease employee with a healthier infant; resulting in higher morale, more productivity due to less distraction, and less time away from work during the first year.

 Use of Banked Human Milk Especially in the medical setting, a higher value should be placed on using human milk for human newborns. This is a crucial time for infants. Breastfeeding mothers should be able to be screened locally to donate locally to better enable hospitals to use human milk for sick/premature or healthy supplemented infants. If the medical community clarifies to a postpartum mother how this can benefit her child, not only will she value her own contribution to her baby&apos;s milk, it can also open her eyes to the vast difference in formulated infant milk vs natural. In other words, if a doctor tells her that he would like the newborn to use banked milk vs formula while in the hospital, that mother will be more likely to continue her own breastfeeding (or pumping) while buying/using less formula once at home.

 Paid Maternity Leave It is very difficult for young families these days just to make ends meet. If we could pass some type of legislation that would allow moms that want to breastfeed and stay home with their babies to do so. It would make our nation a much healthier place to live. Moms are so pressured to get back to work, get these new babies in daycare. Very little support at most jobs for breastfeeding if it could even be arranged. It would be great if more employers would and could offer onsite daycare. That way moms could be there to breastfeed and know that their babies are in a safe place.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care To be truly breastfeeding friendly, the medical industry must cut ties with the formula industry. Instead of being bedfellows with formula companies, professional associations should diligently rout out such blatant and harmful conflicts of interest. Until a woman is not bombarded with formula propoganda from the time she is a girl, until pregnant mothers are not surrounded by formula advertisements in their OBs offices, magazines and television shows, mothers are going to continue to assume that formula is just as good, exactly as the formula companies imply.
If the United States would finally get serious and implement the WHO Code for the Marketing of Breastmilk Subtitutes, ending the harmful relationship between care providers and formula companies to help create a truly breastfeeding friendly medical industry would be exponentially easier.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a first-time mom who successfully breastfed my child for 18 months I found that having access to affordable classes, a lactation consultant and a hospital setting that was conducive to breastfeeding extremely important. I had retained some of the placenta duirng delivery and did not know that until a weeek post-partum. Consequently my milk did not &apos;come in&apos;. Without all of the things I listed above I would not have been able to eventually breastfeed, which I did exclusively until my daughter was 6 months old (and she started some solids) I was never encouraged to give up by the hospital staff. I was showed how to use a pump to help with my supply while we were figuring things out and after the D&amp;C;I needed (which then allowed my milk to come in). When I had to supplement until my milk did come in,I was shown how and encouraged to use a tube to deliver the milk at my breast, to keep my daughter interested in breastfeeding rather than become used to a bottle (we never used bottles). I visited a lactation consultant at the hospital we delivered at regularly during the first three months of my daughters life and had access to support groups. After my daughter was born the hospital also gave me the chance to nurse her right in the delivery room before anything else happened. She slept next to my bed and noone suggested I should place her in a nursery away from me and the chance to breastfeed. My husband was also given the information he needed to support me. When I needed to stay at the hospital for my D&amp;C;to remove the placenta I had retained I was able to bring my daughter with me and she stayed with me the whole time I was hospitalized. This allowed us to maintain our connection and breastfeeding relationship as I was able to nurse her right up until my surgery, pump with a hospital pump right after and continue nursing her as soon as it was safe. During my process of learning to breastfeed, many others (family and &apos;friends&apos;) told me to give up and often I wondered if they were right, doubting my ability to provide for my daughter in this way. Other times I was frustrated and thought maybe it wasn&apos;t worth it. But the hospital and post-delivery care staff never doubted me, provided me with research based information to guide me and helped me reach my goal for which I am eternally grateful. All of this was covered by my insurance. I would hope not only lucky people like me would have the support I recieved and that the services I was provided with would be available to ALL mothers and children.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media I breastfed my daughter until she was 18 months old and exclusively until she was six months old (she started solids then). I definitely am a strong supporter of breastfeeding. However, I have been sad to see and even angered by the way breastfeeding is being promoted in some commericals. One of these features a pregnant woman riding on a mechanical bull and then the comment is made to the effect that &apos;you wouldn&apos;t approve of something as risky as this so why would you take the risk of not breastfeeding&apos;. Commericals like these are shaming to women and do not get to the heart of why women don&apos;t breastfeed. Many women don&apos;t breastfeed because they don&apos;t have the support from friends, family, hospitals, lacation consultants, peditricians,and work places. Many women don&apos;t continue or try to breastfeed because they are overwhelmed with parenting without extended family and helpers. Breastfeeding is taxing, can be painful when you don&apos;t have the &apos;latch&apos; thing figured out, and can be isolating (so many restrictions about when and where,etc). Media attempts to encourage breastfeeding need to understand these factors and make use of this knowledge or they will not succeed in their efforts. Don&apos;t &apos;blame the victims&apos;,confront the reality and educate with care.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings As a culture we need to accept and support mothers doing what is natural and right for themselves and for their children; breastfeeding is one important example of this. Personal comfort should be secondary to the wellbeing and comfort of our infants&amp;children; mothers should be able to feed their babies at any place, at any time neccessary, and without feeling malice or pressure from onlookers. It&apos;s time we acknowledged and accepted the breast for it&apos;s true meaning and purpose, beautiful and lovely and wholesome as it is- why are we more comfortable and accepting of a barely-there top or massive faux implanted breasts hanging out of a woman&apos;s shirt, than a mother caring for her child on a most basic level?

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings One of my biggest challenges as a mother who wanted to exclusively breastfeed was the isolation I felt as I tried to achieve that goal. My daughter did not accept a bottle or a pacifier. I also breastfed on demand to ensure a healthy supply and to meet my daughter&apos;s needs, which meant in the first several months I was often breastfeeding every hour. Furthermore, I never saw why I should have to put my daughter and myself (already sleep deprived and stressed) through pumping, preparing bottles, carrying around bottles and trying not to spoil them, forcing my daughter to accept a bottle or get on a schedule when babies are meant to breastfeed and I was being encouraged to do this! For all these reasons not breastfeeding in public seemed next to impossible to me - unless I went outside for 30 minutes at a time (and you try grocery shopping or running any errand with a baby in thirty minutes having gotten two to four hours of sleep- ha!) At the same time I found that others did not understand any of this and were often downright rude (staring, making nasty comments, suggesting I might want to go &apos;somewhere else&apos;). I often felt as though I was trapped in my house and completely alone. I thought during these times about giving up and it made an otherwise enjoyable activity for myself and my daughter feel like a burden. I found myself going to Babies R Us alot because they had a nursing station in their store. I didn&apos;t need anything there, I just needed to be out in the world with other people. I can&apos;t express how difficult it is and depressing to feel trapped, alone, with a small baby and feel the choice is between your sanity and giving her what you believe is best and want for her! I eventually was able to let go of my hangups and others and did what was best for my daughter and I. This took alot of courage and at times was scary. I am fortunate that it is against the law where I live to harass or cite a woman for breastfeeding in public. That doesn&apos;t mean people don&apos;t but I could at least repeat that to myself again and again (as well as my husband) as I braved the public. I wished during that time that there were special rooms and signs even in public places everywhere that welcomed women to breastfeed. Something like that would truely have sent a message to others, legitimized what I was doing was a natural and the right thing for my baby, reduced my feeling of isolation, and made it one less hassle I had to deal with during those trying early days of first-time parenting. I believe if such a thing were to happen you would have many, many more women breastfeeding sucessfully.

 Other Areas I think breastfeeding will become the norm in this country if and only if the United States government backs it 100%. Less than 100% of the government (HHS,for example) being 100% behind it will not work. When we pass legislation that backs the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and then enforce it, I will know that we are serious about making breastfeeding the norm. Right now we allow the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture formula to advertise and sabatoge breastfeeding in any way they can. Breastfeeding initiation and duration rates will rise and fall, but breastfeeding will never be accepted in this country until formula becomes the much needed substitute when nothing else is available and nothing more than that.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I feel it would benefit the mother&amp;baby&apos;s health if all OB would put the baby to the breast as part of the delivery process, much like suctioning them. It would help control blood loss in mom and boost the baby&apos;s immune system. Mom&apos;s could still decide not to continue breastfeeding, but this would be a health benefit the baby would get before formula is introduced.
Many of our health care workers aren&apos;t aware of the benefits of breastfeeding and don&apos;t support it as the first (only if no contraindications) feeding choice and educatoin in that area would help. At prenatal visits and yearly physicals the benefits of breastfeeding and know how should be given to women. Example of supporting could be by telling an early prenatal that her breast are tender because they are preparing for feeding her baby and 2nd trimester visit telling them colostrum is there waiting even if they don&apos;t see it, etc. Always something about positive about it. Even if a mom has a risk for low supply encourage her to breastfeed, but refer her to the lactation consultant at the hospital when baby is born.
The diaper bags given out at hospitals should have to all support breastfeeding and in place of formula put a good quality manual breast pump in them and breast pads. Take out formula samples, but leave compaines option of mail in coupons that moms could send in for formula sample if they want them AND leave it up to moms to find the coupon on their own and mail it in. (it isn&apos;t supportive of breastfeeding if hospital staff encourage moms to fill it out).
Too many doctors tell mom&apos;s it is ok to change to formula without telling them what health benefits they are giving up. And many mom&apos;s say that doctors aren&apos;t supportive of breastfeeding past the six months and will even ask them why they are still breastfeeding. This is why I think educating health care workers is important.
Before we can help a mom breastfeed she has to want to. Understanding the health benefits of human milk and believing it (doctor&apos;s actions even before pregnancy)may help more women consider it. When teaching or doing a breast exam teach on one breast and have mom do the other while observing. This will give women confidence that they are doing it correct and help them remember how to do it while at the same time get them used to their breast which could impact feelings toward breastfeeding. Women need to take back their breast.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression My employer has a mother&apos;s room for use and allowed me to take as much time as I needed for the purpose of expressing milk when I returned from maternity leave. The mother&apos;s room was private (one person at a time in a dedicated location) and it had a rocking chair, a refrigerator exlusively used for storing milk and cubbies for each woman to place her pumping supplies, etc. I used the room initially four times a day without any problems whatsoever. I was allowed to arrange my work schedule around my pumping needs and was not docked any pay for the time I was using the mother&apos;s room. I believe these benefits provided to me by my employer were crucial to avoiding the use of any formula throughout my daughter&apos;s life! The privacy of the mother&apos;s room setting let me actually relax and focus, so I pumped a large amount of milk and never saw a dip in my supply. I also could be assured of the sanitation of the milk I collected and maintain my own privacy by not having to put it in a more public refrigerator or risk spoiling by having to figure out my own arrangement with icepacks. Currently, too many employers say they provide similar things but everyone knows you really shouldn&apos;t ask for it and it is privately discouraged in political ways on the job. These services need to not only be provided for women at work but the penalites for using them need also to be taken away.

The major cause of breastfeeding being discontinued is working mothers who do not have the opportunity or the support to pump in the workplace.

As a working mother, the hardest part of breastfeeding has been the pumping and the difficulty surrounding it.

 Paid Maternity Leave The United States&apos; maternity and paternity leave system is disgraceful. It is very telling of how little value we truly place on the relationship of the family and the health of the child. Having NO paid leave and unpaid leave ONLY for certain members of our society (under FMLA) is both inequitable and unacceptable. This is not a states issue, and should not be left to the state to implement. This is a human rights and public health issue. Our national government must implement paid leave comparable with other industrialized countries. Please consider this issue very carefully and issue strong recommendations or policy providing for adequate parental leave for ALL parents following the birth or adoption of a child. The health and future of our society depends on it.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Combined with dismally inadequate maternity leave, lack of support in the workplace is one of the most impacting conditions leading to non-initiation of breastfeeding or early weaning. Recent statistics on the status of lactation programs showed that only 1 in 4 employers provide any sort of lactation support for milk expression. For government employers, the rate is only 11%. This is not a states issue, and it should not be left to the state to provide regulations requiring support for the working mother of a nursing child. Our federal government MUST provide strong incentive for our workplaces to recognize the importance of breastfeeding in maternal and child health and strong policy to create space, time, and support for milk expression or nursing of the child.

While many tribal areas have rooms for the BF moms, there usually isn&apos;t sufficient time. The moms state it is just easier and they dont want to get into trouble with their employer. There needs to be more worksite support, maybe legislation to protect the moms. There also needs to be discreet methods to express milk.

They allow discharge formula packs to be distributed to their patients during pregnancy and are the ones who most often recommend supplementation for no medical reason. Baby Friendly Hospitals are impossible in this country because hospitals depend on the funds provided to them by formula companies for programs. The AAP MUST be held accountable for this problem.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am very concerned about the ways in which women and infants are treated before, during, and after birth and its affects on breastfeeding. Studies have shown that it is more difficult to establish a good breastfeeding relationship after a cesarean birth, and yet the newly released CDC statistics demonstrate that cesarean births continue to rise. Shameful induction rates and bans on vaginal births after cesarean are just two factors contributing to this crisis. I urge our federal government to support policies that promote mother and baby-friendly hospitals and birth centers, reward those institutions that are committed to improving womens health throughout their pregnancies and childbirths, and urge hospitals and birth centers to practice evidenced-based care while caring for pregnant and laboring women. These institutions need to demonstrate their commitment to womens health by making a sincere effort to lower cesarean, induction, and epidural rates, and create calming, supportive spaces for birthing and for the bonding and breastfeeding period following the birth. Our representatives should support legislation that requires both public and private health insurance to cover the costs of homebirth and birth center births with certified nurse and professional midwives, who are proven to produce excellent results for mothers and babies, as well as doula support and access to highly qualified lactation consultants.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Working with women in the immediate post partum unit, I find it so very obvious that the majority of knowledge a woman has about breastfeeding has been received by her own (active or passive) doing. They either pursue literature, classes, website ed, etc. or they have learned via family/friend experiences and stories. I feel that prenatally the caregivers are extremely lacking in providing good education re. what to expect with breastfeeding. It seems as though they are asked during their pregnancy how she plans to feed her baby, breast or bottle, and they check the box. This is a prime time, 9mos of time, to help a mom know what to expect as a norm with breastfeeding. When we see them after 32hrs of labor, birth, and up for a day and a half learning to care for a new baby, the education window is pretty much closed. We, as a country and society have done moms and babies a disservice in taking away a healthy, normal feeding pattern and substituted it with plastic and milk-in-a-can. So, now, women need help from their careproviders (ob/gyn&apos;s, nurses, midwives, pediatricians, LC&apos;s) to learn what the aunts, neighbors and grannies would teach women years ago before the formula makers came into existence.

A home visit can reveal many potiental barriers to breastfeeding. A knowledgeable lactation specialist who is aware of community resouces can assess any early problems and link mom to ongoing support (WIC, mothers groups etc).
Passively waiting for mom to initiate help limits the help to only those most able to ask for it. Those most at-risk do not seek out support.

 Paid Maternity Leave I work with many moms that also work full time. The average paid maternity leave is 6 weeks long. I do not see how this supports a woman to establish a healthy and comfortable breastfeed relationship, build up a frozen supply at home and feel comfortable enough to be away from her child and pump at work. This is a lot to happen in 6 weeks. I have a 5 week old and I currently do not have to return to work until my son is 6 months old (unpaid). I am making this decision because I know I would be too stressed to keep up with constant pumping at this point. When my son is 6 months the number of feedings go down and it will be easier for me to either pump or find a way to be with him for his feedings. At 6 weeks old my son will be needing a feeding every 3 hours still and this is too much for a person to deal with. Pumping for those feedings and not getting a full night sleep. This is hardest on blue collar workers. The work environments do not promote pumping. Sure, it&apos;s the law to give space, but when the space is the same break room share with others, or an open cubical or the corner of a room where other employees are told to avoid if they hear the pumping machine, that does not make for a very comfortable environment to pump. Also, in blue collar jobs your breaks are very rigid. 45 minutes for lunch and a 10 minute break. If you are watching the clock the entire time you are pumping you probably are not going to get that much milk because you are stressed. Paid maternity leave and availability of pumping space on the job is a major hindrance on promoting a healthy and established breastfeeding relationship.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Most breastfeeding difficulties do not require the support of a certified or licensed health care professional. Most problems stem from mothers&apos; lack of understanding of how they make milk and how babies breastfeed. Usually it is a simple matter of breastfeeding management and rarely is it a medical issue.
Experienced peer support offers the information and support most moms need to reach their personal breastfeeding goals. However, this support must be readily and conveniently accessible since mothers are most often unaware of the simplicity of their troubles and make rash decisions about discontinuing breastfeeding.
Women call their nurse hot-line when in dire need. Let&apos;s staff a peer counselor at that calling center. Women also go to their babies&apos; doctors first.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences I&apos;m a nursing student, intending to become an IBCLC down the road. I breastfed my own son for three years, and I&apos;ve been advocating for and assisting nursing mothers for seven years as a peer counselor. One issue that has cropped up over and over again is the poor advice from medical professionals. I&apos;m well aware of how little training HCPs get regarding practical support for nursing mothers, and really, that&apos;s understandable. There&apos;s a lot that we have to know, and lactation support is most certainly a specialization. However, here&apos;s the problem: these untrained professionals give out breastfeeding advice, and it&apos;s taken seriously because it comes from someone in scrubs or a white coat, and it&apos;s very often poor advice. Anesthesiologists telling mothers to pump&amp;dump for imaging without contrast - or even with a contrast that&apos;s perfectly safe. Pediatricians telling mothers to schedule and withhold feedings, and applying growth charts appropriate for formula-fed babies to breastfed babies. Doctors telling mothers - this is my favorite - that they have to pump and dump for the same anesthesia and painkillers that were administered at birth (and which weren&apos;t perceived as posing any risk at that time). It&apos;s bad enough that HCPs aren&apos;t aware of Thomas Hale&apos;s book, but worse - they often aren&apos;t even aware of the AAP&apos;s list of medications compatible with breastfeeding!
And that&apos;s just in regard to medications - there are other areas in which HCPs are giving out uneducated, incorrect advice.
The solution, to me, is not to turn every HCP into a lactation consultant. As I mentioned, it&apos;s a specialized field, and most of us are more general practitioners. But HCPs need to recognize that they are not educated in giving practical assistance to nursing mothers, and refer them to those who are, i.e. IBCLCs, LLLI leaders, etc. And on the pharmaceutical front, I would love to see Hale&apos;s book getting more widespread use and recognition - and at the very least, the AAP&apos;s opinions could be followed.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Our hospitals need to encourage, support and help mothers initiate breastfeeding by asking every mother if they would like to put their baby to breast or pump, even if it is just for a few days. Often this is enough to get a mother to continue to breastfeed. I have seen it too many times where a woman gives birth and her baby has to go to an NICU,(for instance) and noone gets her a pump and it will be a day or two before she starts pumping and subsequently her supply never gets to where it needs to be, nor does it last often. We need to, as a society, expect that every mother is going to breastfeed, and bring in formula only when asked to by the mother. Currently we do it the other way, assume she is formula feeding and only when asked by the mother for help with lactating does she than get assistance. Women need to know how much better breastmilk is for their child and if they did not get any education before they gave birth, it is the responsibility of the delivery and post partum nurse and doctors to educate and support alll women in the quest to get all babies breastfed, even if it is for a short time. If any of us were posed the question;

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Every employer should offer lactation support and care just as it offers employee assistance services. Supporting a mother postpartum with lactation care and services provides benefits to the employer as well as the mother. The return of investment includes less sick days taken, more likely to return to work after maternity leave, less health insurance claims for breastfed baby and a greater satisfaction with employment. Providing lactation support is a small and inexpensive way of supporting new mothers and babies to begin a healthy life.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In many instances, health care providers give varying and often misguided advise to new mothers about breastfeeding. Especially for those who are new to breastfeeding, without anyone else to turn to for advice, this causes great confusion and frustration when attempting to establish a breastfeeding relationship with their child. Such as not allowing for a newborn to latch on as soon as he or she is born. This critical moment can define whether a child is will be able to instinctively latch on in the future or not. The child also delays getting much needed colostrum. Instead, babies are often given glucose water from an artificial nipple causing other confusions. The advice given is often outdated, causing major mistakes which instead of helping, actually undermine a healthy and successful attempt at breastfeeding. For example, some nurses and doctors often say to supplement with formula until one&apos;s milk comes in. This causes problems such as nipple confusion in the infant and actually reduces the ability of one&apos;s milk to come in successfully.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) I believe more should be done to promote awareness and being comfortable with public breastfeeding. As a new mom I was terrified to have to feed my baby outside the home, mainly because I hardly see women doing so. Of course eventually I became more comfortable but I think I would have felt differently sooner if there were more public awareness and support for breastfeeding. Also during all during my prenatal care and hospital stay we are given tons of items with formula information and free formula supplies. Why not give expectant mothers breast-feeding supplies and accessories, such as creams, pads, gels for the breasts, etc.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support It is my experience that lactation support is hart to come by. Aside from a lactation consultant at the hospital who was only there 3 days a week, there were no other interpersonal resources for me provided my the hospital, and an understanding of what the cost, if any, there may be when contacting them. It felt as if you had to be well off in order to afford contacting someone. My friend on the other hand, who receives WIC had regular consultations with a lactation consultant as well as a weekly support group. I am so grateful that she was able to get that kind of support. I feel like that kind of support should be easily available and advertised to all new moms.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Education on breastfeeding needs to start early. Prenatal visits NEED to cover evidence based benefits of breastfeeding, and where to find breastfeeding support in the community. The hospital caretakers ie Doctors, Residence, Nurse Practioners, Nurses, Lactation Consultants, Social Workers, Case Managers, and all others caring for the breastfeeding dyad need to be educated on the benefits of breastfeeding and SUPPORT the breastfeeding dyad. One way this can be done is by NOT ordering or encouraging supplementing with formula, especially when human milk is available. Hospital staff needs to encourage 24 hour rooming in, and not sending baby to nursery, so dyad can learn breastfeeding on demand. Post-Delivery Care- Breastfeeding support should be readily available and encouraged throughout the breastfeeding experience with ongoing community and workplace support.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Work places are a huge support or hinderance to the breastfeeding mother. The employer can elivate some of the pressure associated with pumping/expressing at work if a room has been set aside and adequate breaktime specifically for expressing are outlined to the mother. Milk expression is sometimes a long process to express if the mother doesn&apos;t have an appropiate pump for her needs and the work place is uncomfortable emotionally or physically. Onsite child care would be the prefect solution to even expressing. It is easy on baby and mother and less time would be used at breaktimes because storage and clean-up would be eliminated.

 Paid Maternity Leave Nothing is more frustrating than when a hard working Mom has to make the decision to be separated from her baby due to finanacial constraints. I am a 33 year old non-profit local WIC program director and my employer only allows you to be paid for your maternity leave by utilizing the vacation or sick time you have earned, which I understand is better than some women get. When my son was born in Nov. 2007. After my 8 weeks of paid time off and my husband&apos;s new job wasn&apos;t creating as much income as we had planned, I felt a huge amount of stress and pressure to return to work before I reached my 12 weeks of FMLA. My son was also diagnosed with low birth weight due to my poor milk supply at this time. The most frustrating part is that there are so many other countries that have provisions for new mothers to stay home with their babies. Why can&apos;t our country allow at least 6 months to a year for a Mom to stay home and still return to her job that she worked so hard for. I have a wonderful job as a local WIC program director, but now being pregnant with my second child I am struggling to find a way to balance my committment to exclusively breastfeed my baby and return to work by 12 weeks so that I won&apos;t lose the job that I worked 12 years to get.

 Paid Maternity Leave We are one of the four countries out of 170 that don&apos;t compensate for any maternity leave. Our society makes it difficult for middle class Americans to raise children and need to work to keep up with mortgage, taxes, food and bills but don&apos;t qualify for any assistance programs. The middle class families are suppressed and are forced to limit the amount of children they can have because of money and lack of support. We are forced to return to work early because it is hard these days to have three months of salary savings in the bank to cover for the time out of work.

 Paid Maternity Leave This country is ridiculous in its lack of maternity and supportive family leave policies. Some employers use the excuse that a mother has a choice as to when she gets pregnant, so she doesn&apos;t deserve paid leave. That is just plaion discriminatory.
Forget that staying at home longer makes for more stable families and society. It takes a woman&apos;s body almost a full two years to recover from one pregnancy. Studies also show that the longer a mother stays home, the more likely she is to be able to exlusively and successfully nurse. Many women are victims of the rush to get back to work; they feel as though they have a deadline to get it right by 6 weeks or they&apos;re done. This results many times is either ending nursing abruptly or prematurely once mom returns to the work force. Mothers, and especially mothers with small children, are going back to work en force. Mothers many times do not have the option of staying home with their children even for a short period of time because there is no icome coming into the house if they don&apos;t work. Providing for our children is nothing new, but having to choose between nurturing and nourishing your child in the healthiest way possible and keeping a roof over your head is not a choice any mom should have to make. A paid maternity policy for a minimum of three months postpartum would put us only the path to healthier moms, babies, and in turn, a healthier society.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Lactation is seen as a specialty in some hospitals and they hire only 1 or 2 IBCLC&apos;s, who work only in the daytime hours. In working with moms they say that their babies seem more willing to breastfeed at night and then there is very little help in the hospital. At our facility, we have daytime and evening assistance, maybe up to 11pm. When we can, we have had someone up to 1pm but due to cut backs, we had to eliminate that time slot. But we noticed that when we had the additional help during the evening hours, that the mothers did better and the percentage the mix fed dropped. Perhaps, because the main help they need is general education and latch on, if the facility can not afford IBCLC&apos;s they can hire lactation educators with a IBCLC team leader ( if baby has specialized issues) The educators are affordable and they can halp the mothers with more one on one. This is what will help moms feel comfortable with their breasetfeeding skills.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I nursed two children while working - for a year each. It was hard. The state I lived in (UT) does not require employers to give employees any breaks, so I had to make a special request. I was given two ten minute breaks to express milk - not really long enough, since I had to wash pump parts, too. And I ended up expressing my milk in a telephone maintenance closet, which while better than a restroom, was still not great, as it did not have a lock on the door.
Nursing mothers need breaks, they need a secure place to express milk, and they need support from employers. I don&apos;t think employers understand the benefits of breast milk for them, mainly fewer sick days for mom due to baby being breastfed. And there still is a level of embarrassment that women have to overcome due to the sexualization of breasts in the US. This is part of the reason I try to nurse in public often, so that people can start to see it and know it is normal.

One example that barred my workplace from having onsite care is the need(?) to have an outdoor play area.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospitals need to become baby friendly by never giving formula to anybody to take home after delivery. Not just the breastfeeding woman but all woman delivering. Formula should be only given to the baby while in the hospital if mother is unwilling or unable to breastfeed.When these formula giveaways are given it make it look like the formula is the best choice to feed baby. Formula companies have caused a lot of the disruption of breastfeeding. There should be consequences for nurses and staff member at hospitals that discouraged mothers to breastfeed.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Even the most comfortable breast feeding moms can feel uncomfortable nursing in a busy public area like airports and malls. It always amazes me that we donate huge private rooms to smokers but nothing for a nursing mother and baby except a smelly, dirty bathroom. The fact that private nursing areas are not spotted all over our towns, cities, states and throughout our country is surprising at the very least. Breast feeding is something that has always been here and always will be and should be supported and encouraged.

Fifteen minute breaks just don&apos;t do it! Also having to express milk in a bathroom stall is not possible! We need to give breastfeeding mothers more time to express at work or more time to actually go to the child care and breastfeed their infant. I have so many mother tell me that they aren&apos;t even going to try to breastfeed at birth because they&apos;ll have to stop it when they go back to work in 3-6 weeks.

 Paid Maternity Leave 6 weeks is in NO WAY enough time to establish a successful breastfeeding relationship with you child. 6 weeks is just enough time for your body to recuperate from giving birth. Not only has your supply not settled into supply and demand mode, your child is still very dependent on you. Many babies don&apos;t take to bottles as easily or if they do, have trouble returning to the breast. Each of which can seriously effect a mother&apos;s supply. Maternity leave should be AT LEAST 3 months, though personally I would hope for more. 12 months is the ideal time to have a child bond with their mother, successfully breastfeed as long as they need. Though I know paid maternity leave can&apos;t last that long, job security and benefits should for the sake of a happy healthy family.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I think the single most supportive thing that can happen to help mother and baby to be successful with breastfeeding, is to give them at least an hour together skin-to-skin with no procedures beyond drying baby and covering the two with a little blanket. Eye-to-eye and skin-to-skin until the infant starts hunting for the breast naturally, and then with a little help from mommy, the baby will initiate breastfeeding and imprint

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Many hospitals are giving out formula to moms who are breastfeeding (even to exclusively breastfeeding moms). For the establishment of a good milk supply, this practice should be limited to those moms whose milk has not come in yet. Many moms are also getting information, when they deliver, that it is OK to breastfeed just once or twice a day--and then when their supply disappears they don&apos;t understand what happened. We need a push for exclusive breastfeeding for at least a month before the introduction of formula, even in moms who plan to partially BF and partially formula feed.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support As a breastfeeding mother, I wish the lactation consultant at the hospital was more available or even on-call for questions.
Mothers need to know that there are many avenues of support, and that nursing isn&apos;t inconvenient. Midwives and doctors need to provide information about La Leche, Kellymom, and the lactation consultants. And they should strongly encourage mothers and partners to attend meetings. It&apos;s easy to get support if you know where to look. Care providers need to make it easy to get support.
I suppose paying for it is an issue, so insurance should cover it. Or state aid programs like WIC. WIC will buy formula, why not a lactation consultation or breast pump?

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I am an American living in Europe as my husband is in the military. I think Americans need to realize that breastfeeding is not obscene and educated that it&apos;s normal. When I have been with Americans breastfeeding, I have experienced people getting up and leaving even though you couldn&apos;t see a baby underneath my coverings. When among Europeans nursing in public, if you are covering up, they look at you like you are smothering your baby. Who wants to have their face covered with a blanket anyway? On the other hand, they don&apos;t even seem to notice if you aren&apos;t trying to be modest while breastfeeding.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings As a health care professional, and mother, I would strongly encourage all public settings (especially shopping malls, targets, wal-marts, restaurants) to make a special place in the women&apos;s bathroom for nursing mothers. If you want mothers to breastfeed we need your support in an appropriate location. For example, one day while shopping at Target my daughter was hungry so I had to sit in a bathroom stall in order to find a place to sit down while nursing her. Some stores have taken the initiative to set aside breastfeeding rooms which is fantastic!!! I am a huge supporter of breastfeeding in public settings, but there needs to be somewhat of a comfortable place to do it, instead of trying to nurse while standing up. I personally applaud those stores who have set aside a special place for mothers to nurse their infants, and obviosly like to frequent them more often. If it were mandatory that businesses have nursing rooms for mothers, their business might seen an increase in sales! Once I was also at a conference for work and had to pump while away from my child in a library meeting room, where there was very limited privacy. If we want to encourage mothers to breastfeed we&apos;re going to have to have some privacy.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Every office should have a designated area for a woman to pump or bring her baby in to breastfeed. The company should allow a breastfeeding women more breaks, a longer lunch period and/or flexible work hours in order to accomodate her and her breastfeeding child. A company should also allow women to bring their babies into work with them - at least for a certain period of time. Babies up until about 4 months of age usually sleep and eat a majority of the day. If it is not affecting her work, then the mother should be allowed bring her baby with her. Also, if there are mulitiple women in an office setting who have babies and are breastfeeding, then in-office child care should be allowed, and at the mother&apos;s expense. Mothers can then combine funds to help cut the cost of the child care and the babies would have their mothers close for feeding and any other needs only the mother can provide. Companies should also be more flexible in allowing a breastfeeding mother to work from home for the first year - if she is able to perform her job out of the office. A company should also not make a mother who is breastfeeding travel over night or work longer than normal working hours.

It would be great for our employers to offer this as a benefit, instead of us having to try to build up extra PTO, only to use it all during maternity leave and have nothing left when we return to work and need a day off for a sick child. The United States is greatly lagging behind other countries in this area. I think in the end everyone especially families would greatly benefit form this, and mothers could feel good about taking their time off to bond with their new infant instead of having to rush back to work b/c they have no time to take off or can&apos;t afford to. And in order to be fair to those people who don&apos;t have children and are in the workforce, maybe they can get compensated somehow with extra paid leave as well.

In addition, the state should pass legislation requiring healthcare providers to provide hospital grade pumps for nursing mothers. Breastfeeding promotes affordable healthcare and should be encouraged and supported by government and all healthcare plans. If healthcare plans are truly interested in reducing overall costs they must start supporting and fully funding preventative healthcare measures such as breastfeeding.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a lactation consultant for over 10 years, I consistently see that physicians are rarely if ever targeted and given the responsibility not only to educate themselves about breastfeeding, but to be the ones responsible for educating their clientele on research based information about breastfeeding. Not that they can do this single handedly. My recommendation would be to somehow enforce a policy requiring all OB/GYN and Pediatric physicians to have a Board Certified Lactation Consultant on staff at their facility. It would be this properly educated individual that would be able to instruct and support the patients and staff members on all of the very important matters regarding breastfeeding. I feel physicians are very negligent about how serious of a health issue breastfeeding really is. They need to be held accountable. Also, hospitals need to make it mandatory for any nurse working in the Maternal/Child field of nursing to take continuing education classes in breastfeeding. I have worked in facilities that do not require this for their staff and I have even seen a facility where at one time it was mandatory but later dropped as a mandatory rquirement with no explanation as to why educating their staff about breastfeeding was no longer a priority. Hospitals are not required to comply with the recommendations of the ILCA policy and procedure guidelines that plainly state how many board certified lactation consultants should be on staff at a facility according to the volume of babies delivered at that hospital. Why doesn&apos;t JAHCO enforce these policies?

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care New mothers often do not receive adequate breastfeeding support in the hospital. They can receive inaccurate information that pressures them to supplement with formula unnecessarily (I did when my baby had jaundice). Artificial nipples are introduced by hospital staff (in the form of pacifiers and/or bottles) with little concern for the affect they can have on a newborn&apos;s ability to learn to latch well onto a mother&apos;s breast.
In addition, the current practice of sending mothers and babies home 48? hours after birth often means that the mother is sent home before her milk comes in. This can mean being at home with little to no support if she faces common breastfeeding difficulties such as engorgement and/or poor latch. And the free package of infant formula that she received from the hospital or in the mail becomes a very easy solution to a confusing and often scary situation when a mother is worried that she is unable to breastfeed her baby well.

The company provides a &apos;room&apos; in another building that is 10 mins away from mine with old musty couches and old magazines and considers that an adequate area for pumping. They do not provide hospital grade pumps that mothers could use either. I find it disgusting to use a bathroom that people use to have a private bowel movement and then have to sit for half an hour in the stench to pump milk for my son.

 Paid Maternity Leave I work for a large company and our paid maternity leave is 6 weeks for natural birth and 8 weeks for cesaerean section births. I have many friends who live in Canada and they are given ONE FULL YEAR of paid maternity leave. I don&apos;t understand how a country considers it healthy to put a 6 week old child in daycare. There are many sick children due to this and this is causing healthcare costs to rise. I had to take 2 months of unpaid maternity leave in order to make sure that my son was taken care of. I would have preferred to be out for 6 months (the maximum amount of time my company will allow for unpaid leave) but with the current economy issues, I was forced to go back to work early.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Fear of retaliation for breastfeeding in public areas represents a major barrier to breastfeeding, in particular among low-income, WIC populations. Federal legislation that unequivocally protects the right to breastfeed in public which includes a strong enforcement provision will be a major step toward ensuring that no mother is afraid to nourish and nurture her child regardless of where she is.

 Paid Maternity Leave If the government is serious about encouraging mothers to breast feed longer than 12 weeks a government sponsored paid maternity leave needs to be put in place. I am currently visiting Sweden were mothers are given a year-long paid (~80% of their salary) maternity leave. Here is Sweden their rates of exclusive breast feeding at 6 months exceeds 70% (I believe). When I speak with mothers in Sweden they wonder how women continue to breast feed if they are expected to return to work after 12 weeks. And that I believe is the biggest barrier to extended breast feeding in America.

 Paid Maternity Leave Many women do not breastfeed (or continue to breastfeed once returning to work) because their maternity leave is so short and they cannot afford to take an extended leave without pay. As a breastfeeding women that has recently returned to work after 6 months off (un-paid leave) I feel that a new mom needs AT LEAST 3 - 4 months home with baby to establish a strong breastfeeding relationship before returning to work. I took 6 months unpaid leave because establishing our breastfeeding relationship was so important to me. If all women had at least 3 - 4 months paid maternity leave they could have that important time home with their baby without worrying about money or if there would still be a job for them when they returned.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I believe women need more lactation care and support after delivery. Hospitals need to have lactation consultants on staff 24 hours, and these nurses and professionals should be experienced in helping women with difficulties such as flat/inverted nipples, poor sucking reflex, and engorgement. I did not receive the support I needed after the birth of my first child and could not successfully breastfeed her. When my second child was born, I knew more, and I did receive more help, but only because I sought it out myself. With more staff, hospitals could offer women on-going support, and even appointments after they leave the hospital. Without the help of La Leche League Leaders, I would not have been successful the second time around. Not every woman has the energy or initiative to seek out a new group when they need help, so returning the the hospital would be a beneficial option.

Why couldn&apos;t the manufacturers of these pumps pair with the hospitals or independent practices to ensure that a breast pump is available to purchase and could be included in the medical bill, or at no cost to qualified individuals, and not just to rent, as this is more expensive than buying one?

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media Yesterday, I saw for the first time, a commercial for Medela products, which showed a woman breastfeeding her baby. The media is always showing bottle feeding, or assuming bottle feeding as the norm. We need more public service announcements about breastfeeding on television, on you tube, in parenting magazines, everywhere. Once people see breastfeeding in the media, it can compete with the cultural norm of bottle feeding as a more acceptable alternative in people&apos;s minds. This will also help women and their families feel more comfortable with breastfeeding in public areas. In addition, the media can help promote breastfeeding of toddlers, to encourage women to continue breastfeeding past infancy.

Upon delivery of my son at the hospital, I was given a diaper bag, courtesy of a formula company, complete with formula samples and coupons. I was given no literature on breastfeeding. The hospital had a strict policy against rooming in with your baby and the nurses were very resistant to bringing my son to me when he cried. There was a lactation consultant available who offered very little assistance when I experienced difficult with the first day of nursing. The only help that I recieved was from my wonderful lamaze instructor. Unfortunately, I only knew her from a class that I had to pay for.

 Paid Maternity Leave I was employed full time at the time I had my three children. Thankfully, working for a school district I was able to take unpaid maternity leaves that ranged from six to nine months based on the time of year my children were born. I cannot communicate to you the stress involved due to the fact that I wanted to breastfeed exclusively yet still needed to work. So far I have breastfed all of my children for at least two years each. My success in breastfeeding is due to working for a school district, having a very supportive husband who juggled his schedule and brought our children to my work to nurse and parents who chipped in financially to help during the unpaid leaves. In return for our struggles we have three children who are exceptionally healthy, well-connected to both of us and showing signs of giftedness. The United States needs to support breastfeeding mothers by assuring every breastfeeding mother up to two years paid maternity leave. This is not unheard of in other developed nations. If breastfeeding exclusively for six months and continuing for at least a year is recommended than there needs to be some financial support available to help all women achieve this.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Women need to be able to receive Lactation support more readily than they can receive formula support in the U.S. Every new mom should have the option to see a lactation consultant while in the hospital and during the crucial weeks after delivery. She should not be sent home with a free bag of formula, but rather with tools and resources to give her and her baby the best start at life! Right now women who qualify for WIC and women whose Pediatricians provide LCs have access to lactation support, but what about the women in between? In addition, breastfeeding needs to be publicized more as the natural way to feed your baby. Breastfeeding should be the norm in public and bottles should be the exception to the rule. The government can help promote lactation care and support by encouraging hospitals to go baby friendly. Tax breaks could help subsidize the money that is normal provided by formula companies.

The International Breastmilk Project (IBMP) is a wonderful example of how generous American moms are with their extra milk. Women are willing to donate their pumped milk to those in need. However, this is not a known or readily available option for most women. In addition milk banking is costly and difficult for organizations like IBMP to access.

 Other Areas It is important for the United States of America to take a lead in the promoting of an understanding of breastfeeding. When I breastfed my daughter in the 1970s, there was not a lot of support for breastfeeding in restaurants, public places, or the workplace. Today that is still the case. Doctors need to be trained to support breastfeeding and they need to discuss this with their women patients. The media needs to start approaching the female breast from the perspective of its function in providing quality food for offspring. We have no problem showing cows nursing their young, but humans are viewed as somehow different. People also need to be educated that breastfeeding should not automatically be stopped at 6 months. Finally, policies should be in place that promote breastfeeding and child welfare. This includes paid maternity leave of at least 12 weeks and facilities on site at workplaces for onsite childcare so that mothers can continue to breastfeed and for pumping so that nursing mothers have a clean and safe environment for pumping.

Studies of both the contest of these lipophilic contaminants in the lipid-rich breast milk may allay the concerns before they emerge widely or show that women with high levels of contamination should limit the term of their breast feeding.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Lack of support for mothers who breastfeed in public, and a negative societal view and sexualization of breasts has led to a low breastfeeding rate. This is because mothers will often choose to formula feed, rather than deal with the persecution and isolation they may face if choosing to breastfeed. Mothers will formula feed as they are frightened of harassment when nursing in public, or of having to stay at home or find a place to sit by themselves whenever they need to nurse their child. As most breastfed children eat every 1-2 hours throughout the day, this is a cause for isolation. I am sure I don&apos;t need to explain the ramifications of this, but I will anyway. The end result of this is that children are being deprived of vital breastmilk, and a special bond with their mothers. This results in diminished mental and physical health for the child. The mother too suffers diminished physical health, and breastfeeding has many protective factors. She also suffers more mental health issues due to isolation from the community when she is forced into bathroom stalls or sequestered within her own home. I believe that there are a number of things which can help work towards making brestfeeding more accepted by the community, such as laws to protect against discrimination of nursing mothers, in public, and in the workplace. Public service announcements on TV with imagery showing nursing mothers as a normal part of life, as well as posters, billboards, signs, magazine ads and other printed media doing the same can help. Banning formula makers from advertising their products as equivalent to brestmilk, and from gifting formula to new mothers could certainly help. I would even go as far as to suggest that formula be available by prescription only, as it is responsible for the death of many children, and should only be used as a last resort. I also feel that the creation of communicty areas for parents to congregate would help to restore a sense of the community raising family, and would help with the problem of isolation that brestfeeding moms often feel.

It is jammed down our throat at every turn. Education is not the problem here. Availability of formula in hospitals is not the problem. The fact that I had to pay $80 a visit for a lactation consultant is the problem. The fact that my husband had to go back to work two days after my daughter was born and I had no family nearby to help is the problem. The fact that I had to pay $300 for a pump or rent one for $30 a month is the problem. The fact that I had to go back to work after only a 7 week (unpaid) leave that was really only a part time leave as I had to answer emails and field calls is the problem. I gave up breastfeeding after two weeks because all the various demands on me physically, emotionally, and financially, just weren&apos;t worth it. My child deserved a sane mother more than breast milk in my mind. If I have another one I will try harder to line up support and save more money beforehand, but I feel like it&apos;s a battle that I probably won&apos;t win. Please put energy toward dealing with some of these very real problems rather than running more ads about how not breastfeeding is as dangerous as bullriding while pregnant. We KNOW it&apos;s best, now work on making it possible!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Doctors offices and hospitals should stop giving formula samples, coupons, and literature related to formula feeding to every mother who is pregnant or delivers a baby. This is prohibited by the WHO code, yet the health industry in this nation seems determined to violate this policy. For mothers to be truly successful at breastfeeding, they need to be given easy access to lactation consultants and tools that make breastfeeding easy; NOT shown that if they give up quickly, it&apos;s ok, because the formula is always right there...

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression This nation needs a federal policy that supports a mother&apos;s prerogative to pump her milk at work to feed to her baby. There is a mentality that a mother who does this is somehow cheating the company or is less productive; this is simply not true. The facts show that a child who receives mother&apos;s milk is healthier, which therefore helps the mother miss fewer days at work due to her child&apos;s health.
In addition, more workplaces need to be given the legal and financial support of the government to establish child care centers, so that mothers can be close to their children. This will help reduce the amount of time a mother is away from work, and will help her to be even more productive because she&apos;ll have peace of mind that she can tend to her child&apos;s needs more easily.

This mindset is far too prevalent, and the best way to combat this mentality is to use scientific facts to show how breastfeeding differs from sexual acts and other bodily fluids. Mothers should not be made to feel ashamed for providing the most natural and healthy food to their child in public. Eating is eating, and if breastfeeding is considered gross, then so too should neverending buffets that contribute to the obesity epidemic in our country -- these buffets cause far more health issues than breastfeeding ever could.

Mothers know their children well enough to be able to choose when they need privacy for nursing, such as when the child is at an age of being easily distracted by their surroundings. The choice should be up to the mother regarding whether she needs a private location or not, and she should not be forced into a back room just because someone else is uncomfortable.

 Other Areas Cultural competency in breastfeeding education, promotion and support for all health care staff is imperitive to its success. It is especially important for maternity care services and staff including Physicians (OBGYNs, Peds and Family medicine providers). There are numerous cultural reasons why a woman decides not to breastfeed and unless educators/ promoters/ supporters understand her needs they are not going to be successful. There is research to help understand the cultural influences and aspects of infant feeding that need to be looked into. When a culturally supportive message comes from a primary care provider, it makes a huge difference. With increasing cultural diversity in the U.S, cultural competency in patient education is an urgent need. Research also tells me that though the need is great, understanding is less.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In all honesty, I do not think that we will improve breastfeeding rates and duration in this country until we improve birth practices. When she is pregnant, a woman is on a trajectory that lasts through the birth and into the first year of her baby&apos;s life. How well she has eaten, how well she understands self-care, and her expectations for her delivery are important and a part of this trajectory. But so are the practices of her caregivers-- her doctors or midwives, and every other professional she encounters. And most of the time, these medical professionals operate in a vacuum and know little or nothing about breastfeeding and how their decisions and practices have an impact on their patient and her decision to breastfeed, her ability and success at breastfeeding, and how long she continues.
If I were making policy, then I would increase the numbers of midwives (CNMs and CPMs) across the country. I would move as many low-risk women into their care as I could and I would encourage the continuation of the midwife-client relationship in the event of transfer of care because of complications.
Then we would see prenatal care/education, birth practices, and postpartum follow-up that are conducive to fostering healthy successful breastfeeding relationships among women and their babies.
We would see a drop in epidural use, a drop in inductions, and a drop in the cesarean section rate.
And while we are at it, let&apos;s encourage the use of birth and postpartum doulas.
More midwives. More doulas. That would be a very cheap way to improve the breastfeeding outcomes in the US.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support In general, it seems to me, that women find it hard to get good lactation support and care. There are not enough IBCLCs. Obstetricians and pediatricians know little or nothing about lactation. And they seldom even know enough to refer women to IBCLCs.
What if we were to eliminate the access that artificial baby-milk makers have to the medical profession? Now that would be a positive step towards improving things. Then when a mother comes in and says she is having difficulty with breastfeeding, the first response might not be to suggest artificial baby-milk.
Perhaps the government could consider launching a reward campaign, not unlike that the formula companies have. So for every referral to an IBCLC, a doctor&apos;s office or the nurses at a hospital could win points towards a cruise or a nice dinner.

 Other Areas I think that if basic healthcare were framed as a right, not a privilege, it would go a long way toward encouraging breastfeeding. In the current system, mothers can be separated from their babies because if they quit their jobs, the whole family will be without health insurance. If that weren&apos;t an issue, mothers could be free to choose jobs that would allow them to be with their babies most or all of the time, instead of separated from them for 8-10 hours of every day. Of course one can breastfeed while working full time--I did it--but so much separation from the baby is detrimental to milk production, and it means that some of the precious few hours that one *does* have to spend with one&apos;s baby is taken up by pump use and maintenance.

Once in the hospital, mothers should have lactation support professionals available to them for consult within hours of delivery. Once that baby is actually in your arms, all the book learning goes out the window&amp;you need someone who can make breastfeeding a positive situation.
Once released from the hospital, mothers should have lactation specialists available to them. Insurance companies should be required to cover lactation support for the first 12 weeks postpartum since this kind of coverage may cost more up front, but the child will be healthier over all in years to come. Pediatricians should not hand out samples of formula without the parent requesting it.

Forcing women to return to the work place by not paying them for the time they are on maternity leave is a disservice to them&amp;to their children. The longer a mother can stay home with her baby, the longer she is likely to breastfeed. The longer she breastfeeds the less likely the child is to be afflicted with a variety of serious ailments. By paying mothers to spend quality time with their children in those first months, we are showing that we respect the role of mother, the responsibilities of bringing a child into the world, and we are looking out for the future health&amp;well being of our nation&apos;s citizens.

I believe that if women were told that they need to breastfeed&amp;receive lactation support postpartum, the money that goes into the WIC program would go a lot farther, and babies would be healthier overall.
There have been numerous cases of mothers who water down baby formula so that the amount they receive through WIC or food stamps will last them longer. This can cause serious health issues for the baby, or could result in the death of the infant. Breastfed babies always get the proper nutrients, and their milk is never diluted.
By providing nursing mothers with the additional foods they need for healthy breastfeeding practices, you will be benefiting the mother&amp;child, and the cost of the additional groceries is much less than the cost of baby formula each month.

Public service announcements on television and radio need to enforce the benefits of breastfeeding. We need to get people used to breasts being for babies as well as for lovers. Breastfeeding needs to be a common and familiar term to everyone as the bottle is.
We, as a society need to be informed how very important it is to breastfeed. We need to change the mindset of our society to be pro-breastfeeding.

Although I am comfortable nursing my baby in public and being modest (using a blanket to cover breasts while nursing), many other people in public are not. If no private place can be had, at least having a chair or some other place to sit in public restrooms would help tremendously. Oftentimes the restroom is the only private place in which to feed your baby. Usually there is no place to sit, which makes it very difficult to breastfeed.

Brochures should be readily availible to parents on breastfeeding in the doctor office. Actually as part of sex education classes in the schools breastfeeding should be promoted as the norm. We have moms that want to , but their partners say NO or that is gross or that breast is not for a baby its for me! ( that is lack of education) INformation on how to fit it as part of their life style and most important they need to hear it from their own doctors. There are pediatricians in the U.S. that don&apos;t even promote breastfeeding . They may know breastmilk is the best for the baby but that does not mean they aren&apos;t quick to jump in with formula because deep down they doubt the woman&apos;s body to provide for their infant. Women are underminded on what their body is able to provide. HOSPITAL: They need to keep babies with the moms so they can breastfeed their baby and allow women to be empowered. Medicine is quick to jump in and find so many reasons why the baby can&apos;t possibly stay with the mom and then breastfeeding never happens because the baby has already received the formula. Routine procedures like checking a newborn blood sugar does not have to be done unless their are symptons that show problems or the mom is a diabetic herself with out of control blood sugars. Hospitals are in too big a hurry to allow the normal physiological process to occur between a mother and her baby. Formula should not be advertised from the hospital. Formula companies provide diaper bags and treats for all to promote their product. I am not against formula and it DOES have its place but the WHO CODE is being violated daily. EMPLOYER: Support to allow breastfeeding moms to go pump when needed. Hospitals are the worst for not supporting this in many areas. Majority of woman have to start back to work early and going to pump with some jobs is unheard of and you may as well not even show up because they would loose their job. Having babies in the U.S. is not valued nor supportive for woman at all and they have to return to work at a very early time. My goodness their body has just had a baby and in many times surgery as well. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER: Why would insurance companies not want to support and assist moms with electric breastpumps? Don&apos;t they know its going to cut down on that baby being readmitted back into the hospital. There is a reason the goverment stepped in and said moms get 48hr for a vaginal delivery and 72 for a C section. Its because they were being readmitted for complications and costing the health care provider even more money. Research shows the value of the preterm, near-late term and newborn infant getting mom&apos;s milk and she can&apos;t do that if she does not have the support of a pump, place at work to pump, no pressure from her job when she needs to pump, no threats of loosing her position or made to feel like she might loose her position for taking breaks to pump.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Employers need to realize the value of the lactation consultant who is board certified and keep them on staff. Our culture does not have a lot of moms that breastfed their infants so this is new and they have not been around it.

The ecomony is not good, but that doesn&apos;t mean lactation should be the first job to go. IN the long run its the most important one because it is going to cut down on the health cost if the baby can stay on breastmilk to promote better health. Health care providers need to help remimburse for an outside consult when a mom and baby are having difficulty keeping their baby on the breast and they need one on one assistance. Again in the long run it will cost that insurance company a lot less money if babies can stay at the breast to receive mom&apos;s milk. Its an investment of which you don&apos;t see the end results until years later.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends This is another barrier that really affects a mother&apos;s likelihood of meeting her goals. No matter how much education we give mom, it will fall apart if her support system is giving conflicting, contradictory advice. We know from studies and clinical experience that our words tends to go out the door when a trusted peer offers advice. Mothers are more likely to believe bad information from a good friend than good information from an unfamiliar source. I have seen many family members giving advice (sometimes culturally relevant) that reinforces unhealthy nursing practices, but it is still followed because of the strong obligation mother feels toward the family member. I think a lot of this is due to healthcare disparities that lead to mistrust of &apos;men in white coats&apos;. This allows people to justify following the advice of friends and family members. That&apos;s why the Peer Counselor and support group programs are very important--it&apos;s info that&apos;s accurate, up-to-date from another mom, not coming from an authority figure. Building rapport with the families is an integral part of keeping mom nursing exclusively and for longer periods of time. Info from a peer rather than a doctor helps people get out of defense mode regarding old beliefs and to a point where they can more readily change their behaviors for the better. This is VERY important for nursing moms and babies, especially in the early learning days.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression While I understand that not all employers can provide onsite child care, I think that every employer should be required to provide a sanitary room with a lock, a place to sit, and an electrical outlet for pumping, or feeding a child. Preferably, in a way that the employee can continue working (a laptop and desk with a phone so that work is not interrupted), or work their breaks to fit their pumping schedule. They should also have access to a clean sink to wash pump supplies. These facilities should NOT be a bathroom or a locker room for either pumping or washing. So many moms tell me how hard it was at work to find a place to pump that they just stopped pumping which led to stopping breastfeeding all together. I have fought to have an office to pump in and not to be sent to the locker room. It has been hard, but another mom here caved and is using the locker room. She only made it 3 months with her last child, and I think she will probably only get that far with this one too.

 Other Areas WIC currently provides formula, which makes it convenient for parents to give formula. Breastfeeding, while it is much less expensive, does have a financial cost for many. Nursing pads are a necessity for many women. These are not cheap.

I suggest that WIC provide nursing pads and breastmilk storage bags for women who are breastfeeding.

Although the restroom was fairly clean, the thought that I was preparing my child&apos;s meal in a restroom (surrounded by germs) was disgusting.
Also, I recently went to a WIC office. Although there were many posters that encouraged breastfeeding, there wasn&apos;t an area that was private where a woman could do this. I found this to be very ironic. Many women, especially those that are new mothers, or are having difficulty, do not feel comfortable breastfeeding in an open waiting room area, where there is a lot of people, noise and bright lights. So, My suggestion is to provide small rooms, or designated areas that are private or semi private, clean and quiet, and have an outlet (for an electric breast pump) in public places.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a new mother who is solely breastfeeding her son, I must say that the medical industry must take a stand along side mothers who wish to breastfeed their child starting at the first prenatal visit! It was my experience that my wishes to breastfeed did not matter much until I enrolled and completed the Newborn Care and Breastfeeding classes at 6-8 months pregnant. However, if I had not sought those courses, I would have been ill-equipped to properly breastfeed right after delivery.
Most women express their difficulty in holding the baby properly in the various holds (i.e. football hold, cradle hold, etc.) however, due to the courses it was second nature. He was latched on and eating colostrum long before the lactation consultant or nurse came around to ask about my choice for his nutrition!
Also, during a mother&apos;s stay at the hospital she should be given a breast pump hygiene kit (~$50) and shown how to pump on a hospital grade pump in case her needs would dictate that she pumps to continue providing her baby with the best nutrition in the next 6 weeks to 1 year.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media The WHO Code for International Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes should also cover this area and not allow marketing of their product directly via magazines, billboards, radio, TV, internet, or any other public forum. There are many magazines (BabyTalk, Parenting, for example) that market directly to pregnant and new moms, and while they occasionally publish articles on breastfeeding, they are ALWAYS flooded with advertisements for formula. The ads themselves are very sly, potraying breastfeeding as inconvenient, messy, and insufficient to meet a baby&apos;s nutritional needs. This is obviously not the case, and because so much is at stake with public health, these should not be allowed to even insinuate that breast milk is somehow inferior. It&apos;s just plain false advertising, and it costs this country billions of dollars in poorer health outcomes every year. Like cigarette ads, they portray the product as something more than it is, and the truth is that lack of breastfeeding puts our population at higher risks for disease. The Surgeon General should require a big, bold warning label on all ads if they are allowed, as well as the packaging materials. All of this visibility is made to undermine a woman&apos;s confidence in her ability to nurse, all for the sake of making a buck. If we truly can put a price on the health of our children, it sells for around $14 a can... Making a policy with teeth, actual ramifications for companies and facilities who violate the law, would be the best way to make sure these folks stop making women feel as though their breasts can&apos;t do what we know they were built to do--nurse children.
I would also like to see a more positive and normal portrayal of breastfeeding. Places like social networking sites that can&apos;t differentiate between pornographic display of nudity for the purpose of arousal and a breastfeeding mom need to fall under the Right to Breastfeed Act that many states have. Technically, that protects a mother&apos;s right to nurse in any place, public or private, and internet sites are owned by private companies, but should be subject to that anti-discrimination policy. Hell, every time I get on the net, I&apos;m bombarded with images of women as sex objects, many times with an image of a rear and, most recently, a photo of a full-on vagina, just on a banner! If those are allowed all over, then surely, we can allow a woman to have a picture of her nursing her baby and not be offended...

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) If nurses are going out into homes to help solve feeding issues, they need to be trained. Nurses tend to get minimal training in lactation, and like doctors, often base their advise on the experience of family members or close friends. Any program that trains parents on how to care for infants should have the basic knowledge of breastfeeding and how to solve common problems. Asking them to share the information without giving them good facts to pass along, can often make things worse by perpetuating myths and misconceptions. If we ask other programs to support breastfeeding, we need to also provide good training to their staff.

If there were on-site child care where moms could go to nurse their children, I think we would not only see hihger job satisfaction, but also much increased productivity and reduced health care costs in the short term. There are too many women in the workplace and too many children suffering as a result of lack of breastfeeding when a woman returns (too early--but that&apos;s another subject). Especially if the government refuses to adopt a paid maternity leave policy, there should be efforts to get the baby close to mom while she is working with on-site care.

 Paid Maternity Leave &apos;With little public debate, the United States has chosen a radically different approach to maternity leave than the rest of the developed world. The United States and Australia are the only industrialized countries that don&apos;t provide paid leave for new mothers nationally, though there are exceptions in some U.S. states.
Australian mothers have it better, however, with one year of job-protected leave. The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act provides for 12 weeks of job-protected leave, but it only covers those who work for larger companies.
To put it another way, out of 168 nations in a Harvard University study last year, 163 had some form of paid maternity leave, leaving the United States in the company of Lesotho, Papua New Guinea and Swaziland.&apos; - USATODAY.com
The lack of maternity leave or job protection in the U.S. for new mothers makes bonding with the new baby difficult, breastfeeding more challenging, and tells our mothers that we, as a nation, don&apos;t value motherhood. To increase breastfeeding rates, we need to enable mothers to spend more than 6 weeks at home with their newborn.

FEW doctors do any breast/nipple assesment during the initial prenatal exam - the perfect time to assess and discuss breastfeeding.
Birthing practices simply cause interference with lactation, yet women are not given accurate evidence-based information about the effects of routine interventions that have become epidemic in the past several years.
Most women are given conflicting (much inaccurate) information about breastfeeding by different nurses. Some units pass out nipple shields with out any regard as to the aftermath when mother and baby return home.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospital Practices:
Despite the AAP’s recommendation that:
Healthy infants should be placed and remain in direct skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after delivery until the first feeding is accomplished.156–158 The alert, healthy newborn infant is capable of latching on to a breast without specific assistance within the first hour after birth.156 Dry the infant, assign Apgar scores, and perform the initial physical assessment while the infant is with the mother. The mother is an optimal heat source for the infant.159,160 Delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed. Infants affected by maternal medications may require assistance for effective latch-on.156 Except under unusual circumstances, the newborn infant should remain with the mother throughout the recovery period.161
Supplements (water, glucose water, formula, and other fluids) should not be given to breastfeeding newborn infants unless ordered by a physician when a medical indication exists.148,162–165 Pacifier use is best avoided during the initiation of breastfeeding and used only after breastfeeding is well established.166–168 In some infants early pacifier use may interfere with establishment of good breastfeeding practices, whereas in others it may indicate the presence of a breastfeeding problem that requires intervention.169 This recommendation does not contraindicate pacifier use for nonnutritive sucking and oral training of premature infants and other special care infants.
They, for the most part, will not change their protocol or practices for the benefit of mothers and babies. Some will grudgingly follow the AAP recommendations when the mother insists on it. But again, this is a well kept secret from the public, so mothers do not even know to protest.
The chiefs of Pediatrics are MIA!! Perhaps it is because the formula companies have them in their coat pocket??
I hate to sound cynical, but I have been at this for almost 30 years. Thirty years ago, most of this information was known to women belonging to groups like Le Leche League. When they tried to educate the public, they were scoffed at and called “zealots” – even by their pediatricians – who should have been there to support them.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) My community needs to give more credance to breastfeeding.It is dismissed as unimportant. All Help Me Grow agencies should have a lactation consultant to make home visits for lactation. It is not enough to send a nurse out to the home of teens and first time moms. We would do better to always send the IBCLC to discover any problems because they happen so frequently when new moms get home and the Help me Grow nurses do not address the problems adequately. Secondly we need to stop bringing in the issue of guilt to breastfeeding and make it normal for all health care professionals to support breastfeeding. We need to supply information and let the mother choose, but never should we as health care professionals say are you going to breast or bottle feed as if they are equal. breastfeeding needs to always be promoted by health care professionals any where. Physicians have great influence and yet little knowledge of breastfeeding. Women are always told to ask the physician when in reality the physician may have the least time and or interest in helping lactating women. People who need physical therapy get referred to the physical therapist. Lactating women need more referrals to lactation consultants. They do not need to be nurses with an IBCLC. Having RN by the IBCLC does not make a better lactation consultant. IT IS THE IBCLC that should be the deciding factor. Physical therapists do not need to be nurses and neither should lactation consultants need to be nurses. The IBCLC is a professional and should be treated with respect and have input into the team of health care providers. I have excellent skills as an IBCLC, but many women in the community go without my services because I am not a nurse. I have thirty years of experience in the field of lactation and yet no credibility. Give the experienced IBCLC credibility and the right to give the qualified help they can give.

 Use of Banked Human Milk I would like to see more milk depots for dropping off banked human milk and I would like to see more milk banks. I would like to see the standard of care for premature babies be banked human milk if mothers can not provide their own milk. In many cases if the hospital is not a birth hospital, the mothers milk is less accessible, especially if the mother is far away or not able to collect more than drops at first. Many physicians want to start trophic feeds before the milk from mother is available. The standard of care should be Mothers Own Milk for all premature babies, however if it is not available get premission to start donor human milk until mom can provide her own milk or for as long as possible until the danger of necrotizing enterocolitis has passed. We could save money on hospitilizations and save great cost, worry and pain for these little ones if we used only mothers milk or banked human milk for premature babies in this country.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) Help Me Grow makes home visits. Home visits with a lactation consultant through Help Me Grow would result in great gains for mothers. Most mothers experience problems in the early days or weeks postpartum. the Help Me Grow nurses are not trained lactation consultants who only focus on the breastfeeding and therefore not all problems can be adressed adequately by the Help Me Grow nurses. Lactation home visits for all teen and 1st time moms would result in greater numbers of healthy breastfeeding couples with longer duration of breastfeeding. Also most mothers are encouraged to ask the doctor about breastfeeding. Many times the physician has little time to spend on lactation and may not have the knowledge base for good lactation help. It would be as beneficial to have lactation consultant referrals by pediatricians or obstetricians as it is to have the orthopedic doctor referral for physical therapy. Just as the orthopedic physician does not do physical therapy because it is not his specialty, It is not he specialty of the OB or pediatrician to do lactation consulting. But it is the physicians job to make sure the mother gets the proper help by referrring to a Board Certified Lactation Consultant. I would also like to see that the IBCLC is the standard in the profession and I would like to see that it is not necessary to be an R.N. to be an IBCLC. Many hospitals and health care facilities and health professionals do not recognize IBCLC alone. They are under the mistaken impression that it is necessary to be a nurse to have enough knowledge. A physical therapist does not have to be a licensed RN. They are part of the health care team with referrals from doctors and respect for what they do. That is the standard that Lactation consultants, with an IBCLC should have as well.

 Paid Maternity Leave I am a lactation consultant and ER nurse with a master&apos;s degree in community health which I focused on breastfeeding issues. While there are many hinderences to breastfeeding, I feel unpaid and brief maternity leaves keep many breastfeeding women from breastfeeding exclusively and as long as they might have hoped. Balancing a new child, and all their expenses, means work often takes precedence over infant feeding choices. Pumping, no matter how flexible your employer is or how nice of a lactation room is supplied, is an extra chore. Since having a child is a primary cause of sending families into poverty, easing that burden with paid leave is crucial to the health of our families.

Needs more media coverage and especially those that are breastfeeding. We need the public to know that the US Government is the worlds largest consumer of infant formual. Most of these moms could be breastfeeding, which is free and better for their child in the long run. The government does not need to participate in feeding a child whose mother can provide.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospitals need to invest more thought and money into breastfeeding support. I feel that lactation consultants are very competant and helpful, but they seem to always be overworked. There should be more of them at most hospitals. Labor and delivery nurses and nursery workers frequently sabotage nursing relationships by giving bad advice. Nurseries are too quick to give newborns a bottle, and this makes it very difficult on a mother and newborn who are trying to learn to nurse. Nipple confusion is a real thing, despite what my baby&apos;s NICU doctor told me. A baby has to work hard to get milk from a breast, but a bottle is easy. After they have a bottle or two, they get lazy and don&apos;t want to learn the breast. Hospitals need to educate their personel! Nursery workers and L&amp;D;nurses need more breastfeeding education. Mom&apos;s need to be aware they can call or visit lactation consultants after they leave the hospital.

My baby&apos;s pediatrician has been amazing, but he knows little about breastfeeding. He&apos;s given me bad advice on more than one occassion. He actually told me that when I wanted to wean, I should just cut it out all at once! It&apos;s a very basic rule of breastfeeding: Weaning slowly is best for comfort of mother and easier on the child as well! I also have 2 friends whose nursing relationships went downhill quickly after their pediatrician told them to supplement with formula. Supplemting is the beginning of the end because it decreases your supply. Almost all breastfeeding challenges can be solved without supplementing, yet pediatricians seem to suggest that first thing. Pediatricians should have the child&apos;s best interest in mind, and breast is always best for the child.

 Paid Maternity Leave In my opinion, this is a major reason women wean. They can&apos;t afford to take much time off work after the birth of their child. I did survive going back to work and continue breastfeeding into toddlerhood, but I am the exception. Pumping is very challenging, and a woman should have at least 12 weeks off to get their nursing relationshiop off to a good start before they&apos;re forced to be away from their baby and start pumping. Not only did I not get paid maternity leave (I took 12 wks off) but my comopany didn&apos;t have 50 employees so they didn&apos;t have to obey the Cobra law. During my 12 weeks off, I paid over $1,000 to keep my insurance, which was very hard considering I wasn&apos;t getting paid for 3 months!

 Paid Maternity Leave Our governement needs to take a global look at how poorly our maternity leave policy is as a nation compared with the rest of the world. Europe activly encourages mother to take Months, if not closer to a year off paid to be with their baby, while many mothers here find themselves rushing back to work at 6 weeks because of fincincial need and/or a lack of support from their employeer. Luckily, I was able to take 6 months off, but in order to continue breastfeeding my son until the year minimum as suggested, I have to make many personal sacrifices just to find the time to pump adequatly throughout the day. If I weren&apos;t so committed to breastfeeding my son, I would have likely weaned him already based purely on the amount of time I lose each day to pump at work. This would not be a problem if we had a longer government supported Paid Maternity leave.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a midwife, I encourage &quot;newborn self-attachment&quot;, which simply means allowing the mother and baby to get to know each other with as little interruption as possible for the first hour after birth. Studies show that having the mother in a mostly reclining position with the newborn skin to skin on her belly triggers breastfeeding instincts in the baby. Just as shown in the videos, I see newborns exhibiting self attachment behaviors (crawling, rooting, bobbing, self-latching). These babies always have a great interest in nursing, and most of the lactation issues have to do with sore and abraded nipples. Any kind of separation of the mother and baby interferes with breastfeeding, and it is unconscionable when non-essential procedures (weighing the baby, newborn exam) are done during this first hour.

They should not be swaddled and sent to newborn nurseries for the convenience of the staff. Nursing staff often HAVE had significant, evidence based educational programs, but persist in placing barriers to proper breastfeeding support.

Employers want to squeeze money out of employess like blood out of a rock, but at what cost?

Although the AAP has a wonderful breastfeeding policy which specifies how mothers and babies should be treated immediately after birth (remain in skin to skin contact until after the first feeding with any exams done while the infant is in contact with mom) almost NONE of the women coming to our meetings, or who I see privately, have experienced anything close to what the AAP recommends. Women often complain that they were pressured by nursing staff to supplement with formula while in the hospital and have no access to help from Lactation Consultants.
Although many hospitals now have rooming in policies where babies are allowed to stay with their mothers in their rooms (which facilitates successful breastfeeding), this is often undermined by other policies. Mothers are sometimes not allowed to have their husbands (or male partners) stay the night in shared rooms, and they are not allowed to keep babies in their rooms while they are sleeping unless they have a support person with them, so babies end up in nurseries where nursing staff often offer pacifiers and formula supplements DESPITE specific instructions by the mothers not to offer pacifiers or supplements.
When women experience early supply problems, they are often told to supplement with formula before the doctor even takes a complete history of her breastfeeding situation or refers the mother to a lactation professional for help.
Women are often also given poor advice from physicians. Women are told to wean when they are on medications that according to &quot;Medications and Mother&apos;s Milk&quot; by Dr. Thomas Hale are safe or pose minimum risk to nursing infants. Women are also told by medical professionals to put their babies on feeding schedules despite AAP recommendations to the contrary that infants should be fed on demand. And even though there is no evidence to suggest it is harmful in any way, mothers are often encouraged to wean by 12 months by medical professional or told they must wean during pregancy despite no evidence that it is harmful or risky to breastfeed during pregnancy (unless there is a problem with pre-term labor).
I feel honestly that many women who want to breastfeed are undermined in their efforts by the very medical professionals who should be giving them correct information and adequate support. Medical professionals seem woefully uneducated about breastfeeding issues.
When research shows that a high percentage of women plan to breastfeed and even initiate breastfeeding only to see those percentage drop dramatically in the first few weeks after birth, there is little doubt that a lack of accurate information and support from medical professionals is largely responsible.

 Use of Banked Human Milk It seems that medical professionals are largely unaware that banked human milk is even an option. I live very close to the San Jose Milk Bank and learned about donation through a local mother&apos;s club. In order to be a donor, I had to get medical clearance from my OB and from my baby&apos;s ped. Neither of them had ever heard of human milk banking despite practicing less than 15 miles from a major HMBANA milk bank.
It also seems that mothers are largely unaware that banked human milk is an option when supplementation becomes necessary, and I have often encouraged mothers to speak to their pediatricians about this option. . . only to find out from the mothers that when they mention this to their peds, the peds have never even heard of using donor milk.

 Paid Maternity Leave Maternity Leave needs to be longer than 12 weeks. Some women get less than that. Many women only breastfeed for a few weeks or months, knowing that they have to return to work soon. Most switch to feeding baby formula so they don&apos;t have to pump at work. I think that maternity leave should be at least 6 months long. This is not unheard of; other countries offer longer maternity leave than even 6 months!

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Make sure that all MDs and RNs get specific training in breast development, lactation, and infant nutrition. As it is, most doctors including pediatricians get little to no education about breast changes during pregnancy and lactation. Unfortunately, many doctors are highly &quot;educated&quot; by formula manufacturers on the amount of milk substitutes to &quot;feed&quot; a baby.
Also, OBGYNs, family practice MDs, and Pediatricians should be educated on post-partum depression and how breastfeeding can help mitigate the feelings. Too often, MDs prescribe an SSRI and tell the mom to &quot;wean&quot; by default without understanding the effects this &quot;treatment&quot; has on the new mother.

 Paid Maternity Leave I believe that it is essential for women and men to have paid leave from work after having a child. If it were mandated on a national level that all new parents were to have access to paid leave, new parents would be much more successful breastfeeding exclusively for a longer amount of time. Paid leave and exclusive breastfeeding would benefit the country with happier employees, higher employee retention, and lower unemployement rates. It would also lead to lower healthcare costs, long-term, and fewer missed days of work once the employee does return to work.
If mandatory paid leave is initiated from a national level, employers would not have the ability to leave an individual state in order to avoid complying with paid parental leave acts.
I believe that it is essential in supporting the mother-baby dyad to provide paid leave for at least the mother, and more realistically for both the new parents. The mother needs to feel supported at home, and the best person to provide that support to her is her partner/co-parent.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media Breastfeeding is hardly ever brought up in media and if it is, it is done so in a negative light...especially if the nursling is older than the &quot;baby&quot; stage. The act of nursing is implied as being something very difficult and a huge sacrifice for the mother, with no discussion of any of the benefits it provides - most notably, an incredible bond between mother and baby. I don&apos;t feel that way and I can&apos;t imagine having parented in any other way. I wonder what would happen if there were a PSA showing a child actually nursing with commentary by a celebrity who was breastfed as a child?

 Other Areas The research clearly shows the risks of feeding an infant formula, but somehow that information is not getting to the consumer, new parents. Many new parents believe that it&apos;s a close second choice to feeding their baby breastmilk. We need to develop a mandatory informed consent to be signed by the parents after all questions are answered by their health care providers before a baby should receive any formula.
This is a feat that I have broached with my facility, and have run into blockade after blockade. I will continue to work on this project, but since formula is considered a food and not a drug it is difficult.
Infant formula should require written informed consent at all health care facilities.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support When I had my first child, I took the complimentary class on nursing with my Lamaze class. Perhaps nursing ought to be taught as a part of the curriculum with Lamaze. The access to follow up care and support obviously is very beneficial. I was in a town where La Leche League meetings were held and the people leading them were dependable and strong. In a town of about 30,000, there was a health fair and LLL even had a table there. With so many women working now, in some areas, those type of meetings may not be feasible. It would be so awesome if LLL had a help line where you could call and ask someone questions. I don&apos;t know if school marriage and family type classes discuss nursing as an option, but if children can carry around life-like baby dolls to care for, they certainly can be exposed to the idea of nursing too. It would give a school the opportunity to bring in a mother to talk about her experience with nursing, which would be a good role model to both the girls and the boys.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) Support programs ought to be a no-brainer when it comes to nursing. Having been involved with people volunteer at food banks, I think it is incredibly unfortunate to see mothers come in to food banks having had professional manicures and other luxuries, but have to get formula donated to them. I can&apos;t imagine how this could be overcome since at its core, it is a lack of priorities. But kind, well-trained people can truly make a difference.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospitals are busy places. The Maternity ward has the most traffic coming in and out of there every day. It&apos;s no wonder that women have trouble finding support! It&apos;s not necessarily the hospital&apos;s fault, it&apos;s just that they have a lot to do.
Statistically, home birth is safer than hospital birth. This is evidenced by the fact that the US ranks very high on the maternal and infant mortality rate scale according to the World Health Organization. In the US, 99% of women give birth in a hospital. Countries that have that majority delivering with a midwife at home or in a birth center show healthier statistics.
I mention home birth because the breastfeeding success rate of women who deliver at home with a midwife is very high. The reason for that is that a midwife provides the constant one-on-one care that a hospital simply can not do. A midwife makes herself available around the clock for her clients during the first several weeks post pardum, thereby providing the best start to breastfeeding possible.
If the hospital could provide one person per birthing mother that will help her through the first several weeks, that would solve a lot of problems. However, that is not likely to happen. Instead, if the safety and benefits of having a midwife as a care provider were made known to all pregnant women, the breastfeeding success rate would be much higher. (And our infant and maternal mortality rates would come down.)
For those that do require a hospital setting for delivery because of a true high-risk status, the hospital staff should be less accepting of formula as a substitute. Breastfeeding and formula feeding are seen as equal, each with their own set of equal perks and drawbacks. In reality, formula feeding can be dangerous for the baby. The mindset shouldn&apos;t just be that breastfeeding has a few perks, It should be that formula feeding can be dangerous and should ONLY be used as an absolute last resort. Hospitals should not send mothers home with formula samples &quot;just in case.&quot;

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends Lack of education is more than a problem just for moms. Mothers aren&apos;t educated enough by their doctors during pregnancy because the doctors aren&apos;t educated enough in the first place. Support for a nursing mother is rare, and the biggest problem area is close friends and family. It becomes exponentially more difficult to continue breastfeeding when you don&apos;t even have support from your USUAL support system, simply because they are uninformed as well.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There is a huge problem with birth in America to begin with. Caesarean rates are too high, intervention rates are too high and because of this breastfeeding suffers. Mother&apos;s and babies should never be separated unless there is a true medical need. There are too many nurses giving old, bad or just plain damaging advice. Nurses should be trained and held accountable to the information they give mothers. There should be IBCLC&apos;s on staff 24 hours for mothers. There is too much formula influence in hospitals. The pen you check in with has Similac on it, your charts say Nestle Good Start on the bottom. You get formula on the way out and sent to you at each critical breastfeeding milestone. This practice is unethical at best. Please ban the bag&apos;s everywhere! Doctors are just not well informed about lactation. Too often they tell mothers to supplement when mothers really need information about breastfeeding management. This is the &quot;easiest&quot; thing for them to do, just give the baby formula. It takes time to council a breastfeeding mother. They are too quick to push it.

Many women will express an interest in breastfeeding, but continue to fall off in numbers with 6 month follow up. Most women give the reason of lack of support for discontinuing breastfeeding. We could help women identify who they consider as supporters, and help with some suggested dialogue they may use to support their decisions with family and friends. This may include the benefits to the infant, which most people are somewhat aware, as well as the numerous benefits to the mother, which less people are aware of.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There are so many barriers for health professionals and lactation professionals to implement breastfeeding. Education is key. Formula companies are allowed to advertise to parents and professionals and help people feel not guilty about not breastfeeding. The education of health care professionals is poor. Hospital administrations continue to take monies and token education from formula companies and undermine lactation professionals from helping families learn and support breastfeeding. Formula should be ordered by a provider and treated like a medication in the hospital and health care providers office. Providers must be reimbursed for lactation support. Education for children and adults and new parents should be provided in school based curriculums and parenting classes. We have to change our culture from bottles and formula to the best.....breastmilk. Thank you for this opportunity to express my opinion.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I truly believe the number one barrier to breastfeeding success is lack of support from health care providers, namely pediatricians. Pediatricians ask mom before the birth of their babies &quot;breast or bottle&quot; as though they are asking &quot;Colgate or Crest&quot;. The importance of choosing human milk for human babies is not emphasized or acknowledged to the degree that it should be based on all the scientific data out there.
Additionally, health care providers are more often than not only support e of breastfeeding when all is text book perfect and unfortunately the growth charts doctors use are not of exclusively breastfed babies so supplementation is pushed for slow weight gain of breastfed babies who are perfectly healthy, but are not rotund like formula fed babies.
Doctors often do not refer mothers to lactation consultants and instead try to quantify the amount of milk baby is getting by telling mom to pump and bottlefeed for weeks to see how much baby is eating, which is bad advice when there are scales available and wet/dirty diapers are a good indicator of intake. They also continually suggest &quot;topping baby off&quot; with formula which is horrendous advice. And they stress that by four months a baby should be sleeping through the night when the reality is breastmilk digests within 90 minutes and it is quite normal for a baby to wake up to eat.
Last, a pediatricians need better training to diagnose type four tongue-tie, which is harder to diagnose but according to the AAP is the most problematic for nursing.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) All Early Head Start programs and child care programs should be required to have a lactation specialist on staff, or as a consultant, to help support the pregnant mothers in the program.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Too many nurses in maternity wards are uninformed about breastfeeding. I received some terrible advice in my first few days postpartum. Nurses need better breastfeeding education since they are so closely involved with mothers in those first two days. Also, allowing formula companies to give free samples to new moms needs to stop. It sends the wrong message and makes it too easy for a new mom to give up on breastfeeding. Furthermore it comes across as an endorsement of formula by the hospital, which undermines the pro-breastfeeding message.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care More women would think about trying to breastfeed if they were given accurate and complete information about breastfeeding from their prenatal care provider and the RISKS involved with formula feeding. Those mothers would also more likely succeed in their efforts if ALL hospital Labor, Delivery&amp;Postpartum staff had a basic knowledge of getting breastfeeding off to a good start via training classes - or at least a detailed resource list to provide to each new mom, of names, numbers and email addresses of lactation consultants, breastfeeding coodinators, La Leche League Leaders or local breastfeeding support groups. Hospitals should also avoid sending mothers home with goodie bags that have formula paraphernalia in them. It implies that mother&apos;s milk will be inadequate, insufficient or immeasurable thus formula should be on hand. Every hospital &quot;going home bag&quot; should be standarized with a manual breast pump, a box of milk storage bags, nipple cream, pamphlets or tear-off sheets on how to tell if baby is getting enough breastmilk, breastfeeding positions&amp;proper latch, typical feeding patterns for the first 6 months, preventing nipple soreness, Myths/Facts about breastfeeding, how the spouse can help in other ways, and how the extended family can be supportive. Then there is the whole issue of formula itself. There should be a STRICTLY followed policy about NOT PROMOTING ANY formula to mothers of and babies 6 months or younger via TV, newspaper or other media - especially in the offices where these women are receiving prenatal care or in the hospitals. Breastmilk needs to be seen as the STANDARD for feeding infants and toddlers. Most importantly, the language surrounding breastfeeding from these care providers shouldn&apos;t be about its &quot;benefits&quot; but about how feeding any other way increases risks of X, Y,&amp;Z.

 Paid Maternity Leave I know many mothers would hapily breastfeed for longer if the burden of not having some kind of second income wasn&apos;t an issue. Paid maternity leave given to mother breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed should be provided by the government for a minimum of 12 weeks or even better 20-24 weeks. Along with this should be the stipulation that they attend a breastfeeding education class prior to birth and a support group for the time after birth they are on government paid maternity leave. This would give mothers time to establish their milk supply, a routine with their baby and even pump extra if they desired so when they did return to work, they had an ample frozen stash to provide to the childcare provider.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression More thought has to be put into finding ways to create lactation programs, esp. lactation rooms, in worksites, such as fast food restaurants, that will never have the room or the numbers of breastfeeding employees to justify creating them, especially in high-cost real estate environments where every square foot is expensive and is expected to yield return. My idea is to have public lactation rooms - with appropriate security such as special passes for entry and combination locks with the combinations given to pre-screened, pre-registered women, in government buildings in dense urban settings, such as downtown Manhattan, where there are both many fast food establishments and many government (federal, state and local) buildings. This is not cost-free, as it requires a degree of administration, but would greatly increase the numbers of young, working-class women who have little or no sick or other leave, need to go back to work soon after delivery, and do not want to wean in order to do so.

Every public place that a mother is otherwise allowed to be that supports public breastfeeding without any hassles should be able to pay a nominal due or fee to be entered into a registry of Public Breastfeeding Friendly Places and inturn will be given a sticker to display for their patrons as well as a tax credit or incentive to stay on the list. If more mothers are comfortable breastfeeding in public - with or without a cover up - society will begin to see that breastfeeding is normal and not have such a stigma about seeing women using their breasts to feed their babies in public rather than just sell cars or other merchandise.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care We must make a more concerted effort to create and maintain baby-friendly hospitals. One problem is that even hospitals with lactation counselors on staff - as is required by New York state regulations, for example - cannot supply adequate counseling pre- or post-partum, because women are discharged within 48 hours after delivery, and many lactation counselors often cannot reach the patient for 72 hours. Patients should be encouraged, during their prenatal period, to visit the hospital and get counseling from the lactation counselor, and to be pro-active and aggressive in reaching out to the hospital&apos;s lactation counseling personnel during (the early stages of) labor and, particularly, after delivery to request help with latching and any other issues.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression While increased use of worksite lactation rooms is important, some businesses do not have the numbers of women workers of child-bearing age (and their male and female partners,who should also be eligible for the program) to justify the expense and trouble to set them up. If, however, they are businesses with several worksites, however small their actual numbers of workers is, a solution would be a free or employer-subsidized pump loaner program, whereby workers could register, a the employer&apos;s central location, for pumps to take to their worksites for the duration of their breastfeeding period, and return them for reuse by other workers. A lactation counselor should be provided by the employer to ensure workers know how to care for the pump and keep it clean. A concomitant part of the program, of course, would be that the employer ensure a clean, sanitary, private space and time to utilize it for pumping and storage of expressed milk.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The impact of the birth experience on breastfeeding is tremendous. The trend toward induction and almost universal epidural use has repercussions that mothers are NOT informed about or prepared for. I hear from mothers with groggy (possibly early) babies who can&apos;t properly nurse that their baby &quot;doesn&apos;t like them&quot; or &quot;just can&apos;t do it&quot;. Their babies are supplemented in the hospital, leaving them with no faith that they CAN breastfeed and provide all their baby needs. The lack of qualified lactation support in the early days compounds the problem and these moms are left to wonder why breastfeeding did not work for them. The lack of knowledge that moms encounter in the hospital setting is unacceptable; outdated and conflicting information given by professionals sabotages the breastfeeding relationship. A mom can overcome a bad start but she shouldn&apos;t have to when the problem was caused by the very people she trusted to help her and her baby.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support More hospitals need to provide board certified LCs available around the clock. I delivered my son at a hospital where the LCs were only available 8-4 or so, Monday-Friday. My son was born on a weekend. For a mother giving birth on Friday night, there is no one available to provide lactation consultation. This was at a hospital seeking WHO Baby Friendly status. The nursing staff, while well-meaning, were only able to provide minimal assistance, or sometimes incorrect/inaccurate advice.
Additionally, I would like to see more pediatrics practice either have a.) physicians who have taken ongoing, continuing education beyond the minimal breastfeeding education provided during medical school b.) provide an in-office board certified lactation consultant or c.) at the very least, *refer out* to board certified LCs as needed. Most pediatricians will profess their support for breastfeeding, but in many cases that support falls away as soon as the mother or child starts to have any issue (slow weight gain, poor latch, pain, jaundice, etc.). The &quot;support&quot; suddenly gives way to recommendations to formula feed, when in many cases, some qualified professional help may be all that is needed to have mother/baby continue the breastfeeding relationship.
One cannot help but wonder how pediatricians only receive minimal education on an aspect of child health and welfare that can be so crucial to preventing Rotovirus, Hib, etc. Child nutrition should be a cornerstone of pediatrics practice, and it starts with breastfeeding.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings It is absolutely time to view this issue as the human-rights issue that it truly is. Children have the fundamental right to nutrition provided at their mother&apos;s breast. Period. It saddens me that there are still states in the U.S. where a mother does not have the legal right to breastfeed in public. Even in those states where supposed breastfeeding legislation/protection is in effect, the mother can face legal ramifications. Not all babies tolerate a cover over their head, and since the AAP recommends a minimum of one year of breastfeeding, I&apos;m sure it is obvious that older infants are naturally curious and will not always tolerate a cover. They may unlatch to look around a room, etc. which is natural. It may mean that a mother provides a brief flash of nipple, which is difficult to prevent. There are mothers who have special circumstances where covering up is impractical for them or their child. Nursing twins in public &quot;discreetly&quot; is all but impossible. A mother should never have to fear that she&apos;ll be prosecuted for feeding her babies. am a physical therapist living in NC, where breastfeeding is supposedly legally protected. There was a recent case in my state where a mother refused to cover up while nursing in public at a Denny&apos;s restaurant in Asheville, NC. She was told the police would be contacted if she did not cover up. She cited the NC law on the topic. Once police were called, she was told that the breastfeeding protection legislation was irrelevant, as now the business owner wanted her removed (*for* breastfeeding), so she was now in violation of trespassing. How is breastfeeding legislation even remotely able to protect a mother and nursing baby if business owners can cite &quot;trespassing&quot; if a nursing mother won&apos;t cover up or leave? Don&apos;t our youngest citizens deserve the most basic of human rights protections, regardless of which state in the Union they reside or travel to? Only a handful of states offer any enforcement for public spaces that violate breastfeeding protection laws.

 Paid Maternity Leave Our breastfeeding initiation rates have reached our goals of 75% but our continuation rates continue to be very low and this points to the problem of continuing to breastfeed while working which indicates a need for paid maternity leave in this country. Breastfeeding a newborn is a full-time job requiring over 8 hours of actual feeding time with the mother&apos;s body being the &quot;factory&quot; making the milk! USA is one of a very few countries that does not have a paid maternity leave policy of some form or another even though we are one of the wealthiest countries! Breastfeeding needs to be counted in our GNP and recognized for its huge contribution to our national health and wealth!!! Also, breastfeeding needs to be &quot;defined&quot; and assessed in a formal way; ie. a national recording of breastfeeding incidence for all infants just like we assess and record immunization rates! Probably the easiest way to do this is to tack on the breastfeeding assessment to all the immunizations!

These young people will grow up to be, not only mothers who want to breastfeed, but also spouses, bosses, health care workers, and friends who support breastfeeding. Research shows that breastfeeding initiation and duration is influenced by the attitudes of people in a new mother&apos;s life. We should do our best to make sure these people are appropriately educated about this important topic.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care One of the things that can make it difficult for people is that they are constantly bombarded with: 1)free formula products, 2) pressure to &quot;protect&quot; your baby from non-friendly nursing actions in hospitals, and 3) lack if instant bonding with mom. 1- Even before my baby was born, I started getting free formula samples in the mail. In the hospital I was given a free bag with more samples and coupons. Breastfeeding can take a little work to get started, so anyone willing to give up has a quick ande easy way out. 2- I covered my son&apos;s bassinet and my room with signs saying &quot;no pacifier&quot; &quot;no bottles&quot; &quot;breastfed baby&quot; I wanted to make sure he didn&apos;t start with nipple confusion. I have talked to far too many people who had difficulties nursing after their baby was given a pacifier or a bottle while still in the hospital. Its sad that our medical staff assume the baby will get these things, rather than what is best for them, the breast milk. 3- So many babies are not given immediately to the mother. Babies are most likely to latch on for the first time immediately after birth. Once the baby has been taken, bathed, etc. it postpones that initial nursing and bonding.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences (may be a duplicate, I think I forgot to submit and closed the window) Many healthcare providers only go by growth charts given to them by formula companies. Breastfed babies have different growth curves. My son has been in the 5th or less percentile since he was a few weeks old. He&apos;s healthy and thriving and I&apos;m lucky his physician sees that. I have a friend who&apos;s daughter is exactly teh same, however, she&apos;s been pressured to supplement with formula to bring up the numbers. If the physicians aren&apos;t aware of the differences between breastfed children (especially long term nursing children) and formula fed children, some mothers start to doubt what they&apos;re doing is good.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care We need to ensure that hospitals are providing accurate information and really supporting the early moments of breast-feeding. As an educator I have visited students in many sites where the hospital staff do not support mothers in the first few days of lactation and hurt the long-term success of breast-feeding. Providing marks of distinction for hospital with high rates of breast-feeding or to comply with BabyFriendly policies could help encourage hospitals to educate their staff and enforce the guidelines established by national agencies. Magnet status for hospitals is huge - why not do something similar with breast-feeding?

Presently there is only &quot;suggested&quot; ratio recommendations. So as a result there is not enough IBCLC availability in the hospital settings in the New York area. I work in Orange Regional Medical Center and there are 2000 births a year. I only work 30 hours a week. That is not enough time for the mothers to get the assistance they need with breastfeeding.

Since my insurance only covered 48 hours, this &quot;early discharge&quot; was really standard discharge and was easy to do. The home visit nurse was specifically trained in breastfeeding and post-partum care, and she was very helpful at improving my daughter&apos;s poor latch and our budding problems because of it.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am a Labor&amp;Delivery nurse at Harrisburg Hospital in Harrisburg, PA. We deliver roughly 4500 babies a year. It has been a sincere concern of mine as to how little breastfeeding is supported and encouraged in the critical time period within the first postpartum hour and thereafter.
Our hospital is set up that there is a floor for L&amp;D;and then a maternity floor for recovery. Time is money, in any business. There is a strong managerial expectation that our patients are transferred off our floor by 2 hours postpartum (at the latest). It is very difficult for most nurses on my unit to rationalize prioritizing skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding when there are so many other tasks to get done.
Once the moms and babies are transferred to the maternity floor, it is standard practice to separate the moms and the babies, taking the babies to the nursery for a assessment, bath, and &quot;observation&quot; until they are at least 4 hours old.
I have long been a proponent for immediate skin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding. The feedback I receive back from my cohorts on the maternity floor is that &quot;my&quot; babies &quot;always&quot; hold stable body temperatures, and latch on for their second latch significantly more easily.
Research and anecdotal evidence continually supports the practice of early, uninterrupted bonding and breastfeeding as the best practice, especially in teaching and encouraging positive breastfeeding experience.
I strongly believe there should be government incentives for Mother-Baby Friendly initiatives to be in practice, especially for those who receive government funding and payment from medical assistance.
Some of the specific hospital practices that need to be addressed are : 1) Education about and encouragement for early skin-to-skin and breastfeeding.
2) Noninterruption of the bonding and breastfeeding process (ie. no separation of the mother/father/baby.
3) Ongoing breastfeeding encouragement and support by nurses, doctors and breastfeeding consultants.
4) No administration of &quot;free formula&quot; to moms. This practice is as if the hospital is writing a prescription for (a specific) formula, even if it&apos;s for &quot;just in case the breastfeeding thing doesn&apos;t work out&quot;.
5) The practice of routinely supplementing breastfed babies with formula in the hospital should be eliminated. Breastfeeding moms should be educated to and highly encouraged to exclusively breastfeed, especially in the early postpartum weeks. Milk supply needs to be well established before interfering with the body&apos;s natural &apos;supply and demand&apos; production based on each baby&apos;s individual feeding needs.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I work as a Labor&amp;Delivery Nurse at Harrisburg Hospital. Four of my coworkers have had babies within the last year and have prematurely (by their own definition) stopped breastfeeding because of the inability to pump at regularly scheduled intervals (or at all) during their scheduled workshifts. Thus, their milk production drastically dwindled to minimal or no amount to store. Because breastmilk production is based on &apos;supply and demand&apos;, the inability to pump at regular intervals will greatly affect the breastfeeding duration for the baby.
It is sad and ironic that nurses, labor&amp;delivery none the less, do not have a system in place that protects their ability to breastfeed for as long as they intend to.

Doctors hand our information while a Counselor can share personal experiences and knowledge learned through years of helping women with breastfeeding issues. When I was pregnant with my child my OB never mentioned breastfeeding. His Nurse asked me once if I planned to breastfeed or bottle feed, that&apos;s all that was ever mentioned in all of my visits. Totally inadequate. The most rewarding part of my position as Nutritionist and Breastfeeding Counselor with WIC was when my clients told me that if it hadn&apos;t been for me&amp;my support and education, they would not have been as successful breastfeeding.

Our BF Support Program model could be reproducible at other health centers. It includes a Lactation Consultant who makes unsolicited outreach visits to all BF patients in the hospital, at two days post days post-discharge, and perhaps at 7-9 days; she is available for home visits and phonecalls as needed perinatally. Other members of the Support Program are nutritionists, Worcester Healthy Start Initiative case managers, and health care providers.

 Paid Maternity Leave This is such an important topic. The USA is so far behind in this area. In order to build stong healthy children and families, we need to spend time with them. Both children and parents benefit so much by spending time together and most families can&apos;t do this if the time is unpaid. I would have taken more time with my daughter if I was paid for my time off. I wasn&apos;t able to stay home as long as I wanted becuase I could not afford it. I think this is something that both the mother and father should be able to take.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences I am a family nurse practitioner and I just recently gave birth to my first child, my beautiful son, Ben - who is now 4 months old. I knew that I would breastfeed my child even before I conceived him, as I knew all of the benefits for both of us. Thankfully, I have had a relatively easy time at breastfeeding - though not without some frustration in the beginning. The frustation came about because I was receiving so much conflicting information from different health care providers about the specifics of breastfeeding. It started in the hospital when each nurse who took care of me had different thoughts about how I should or shouldn&apos;t be feeding Ben, how frequently, and so forth. Some even told me not to worry about the frustration I experienced, since I could always give him formula! The advice I received from the nurses was often different than that of the lactation specialist on staff at the hospital. I was able to consult with the lactation specialist a few times during my stay (and she was GREAT!) - but she was only one person to attend to the 20+ of us who had just given birth.
I found that the misinformation continued after our discharge from the hospital. By the the time Ben was 5 days old, he had lost not quite 10% of his weight because my milk had not yet come in. My pediatrician insisited that we start supplementing him with formula - even though Ben was perfectly healthy, thriving, and such weight loss is VERY NORMAL for breastfed babies. I questioned the doctor about the need for formula, and his reply was, &quot;Well, the formula isn&apos;t poison!&quot;. By the time we returned 3 days later for a weight check, Ben had re-gained 10 ounces....and I should mention that my milk came in during that 3 day period. We had only given Ben 3-4 ounces of formula during that 3 day period (begrudgingly). Ben did not need formula during that time at all - we just needed to be patient!
Healthcare providers need to be well educated about breastfeeding, so that their message to new moms is CONSISTENT. That way, other moms can avoid the frustration I experienced - and that frustration could be a significant barrier to the adoption of breastfeeding!

 Paid Maternity Leave I truly believe that many women choose not to breastfeed because it doesn&apos;t work with their &quot;schedules&quot;. My friends/family members that chose not to breastfeed did so because they had to go back to work after 6-8 weeks and felt that it was not a viable option for them.
I think it would be extremely beneficial to mother and baby if a better maternity leave program was implemented.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support WIC provides free formula to approximately 50% of the American mothers. How can you expect WIC to actively promote breastfeeding when they receive kickbacks from formula companies for the vast amounts of formula purchased by the individual state? This is a major conflict of interest, and should not continue. Either remove free formula completely from WIC, unless medically indicated, or remove funding for BF promotion and transfer it to an independent BF clinic. As long as WIC does not employ IBCLCs in proportion to their client load, breastfeeding will not move forward within the WIC scenario. Most WIC clinics do not even refer to an IBCLC, (with the exception of major metropolitan areas), before giving out formula and vouchers. The public is well aware of WIC&apos;s free formula and view the government endorsement of formula as equal with BF. You cannot endorse free formula and give lip service to BF at the same time, within the same organization. If the government truly wants to better the health of children, it would stop its own affiliation with formula makers. What is the total amount of money spent on formula, per year, within WIC? The GOA could easily save billions of dollars on formula alone, and that&apos;s not even counting the savings in health care dollars down the road for children who are breastfed. Giving free formula and pretending to support BF within WIC is like talking out of both sides of your mouth at the same time, with conflicting words. This will never work both ways. Where is the transparency the public deserves?

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The current standard of care in most births is that after the delivery of the baby, there is an almost immediate switch of caregivers. The mother goes back to her normal doctor for healthcare, the baby to a pediatrician. This is stupid. Under *normal* circumstances, whenever clients switch caregivers you lose vital information and follow-through. Even more so right after a birth.
The only exception I know of is home-birth midwives, where the standard of care is that the midwife continues to provide neonatal care and postpartum care for six weeks. This model works much better to ensure healthy mothers and healthy babies. How can we expand this model to mainstream medicine?

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care 1)We need to work as a nation towards building girls&apos; and women&apos;s belief in themselves. For some reason many of us grow up believing that, despite millions of years of experience, we are unable to give birth naturally. An unmedicated birth is an important first step towards successful breastfeeding. 2)We need to take the insurance companies out of the birth equation. Or we need to make the insurance companies honor mothers&apos; choices; there is no reason that a pregnant woman should be financially forced into having a higher level of medicalization than she needs for her birth. In other words, we need to support mothers who choose to have midwives or who choose to birth in birth centers rather than hospitals. 3)All hospitals need to have trained Lactation Consultants available to talk to every mother. I know the postpartum nurses mean well, but they can sure mess up a breastfeeding relationship. In addition, rooming-in should be a given in every hospital. We should aim to have all hospitals be Baby Friendly.

I&apos;m sure you already know/have read the statistics that compare our nation&apos;s maternity leave policy&amp;breastfeeding rates with those of other nations -- you already know WHY we need paid maternity leave. For at least a year. Minimum. I know with my first child I had 6 weeks. I also know that I&apos;m unusual in that I kept nursing despite that. If mothers could have paid maternity leave for 1-3 years, our breastfeeding rates would actually have a chance at improving, even if we didn&apos;t change anything else! I&apos;ve talked to so many mothers who are in tears that they have to go back to work at 3 months, and it&apos;s always sad when I hear a couple months later that they stopped nursing shortly thereafter -- pumping is so hard!

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression It is appalling that even health care entities, hospitals, neighborhood health centers, etc. do not provide even the most basic facilities for health care workers to express their milk for their babies. It is about time that the government legislate a mandate that all health care entities (with at least 25 employees) provide a clean, safe, private space (that is not a toilet stall) for employees to express their milk. It is about time that workers&apos; rights to break/lunch time for the activity of milk expression be guaranteed. A federal law that requires these health care entities to allow workers to utilize their time for this purpose and which mandates the provision of a private place for this purpose could be tied to federal health care reimbursement. Once health care entities take the lead in worksite lactation support, legislative mandates could be enacted utilizing tax rebates or discounts for employers in other sectors to provide the same support for lactating employees. As far as onsite child care, this is clearly a much bigger issue to tackle. I am not sure what to recommend for the private sector, but I believe a legislative mandate tied to federal health care reimbursement could be enacted to encourage at least the largest health care entities, hospitals, to provide onsite child care for employees.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have found, both from talking with other moms and from personal experience, that the support provided in the hospital setting is not as useful as it could be. Once you are settled into your room with your newborn, it&apos;s very difficult to get hold of a lactation consultant on staff to come when you need her. Often they arrive several hours later or are not working at 2AM when your baby is screaming and you can&apos;t figure out how to latch him on.
I ended up planting myself in the hospital nursery until I found a nurse who was willing to work with me, but many moms don&apos;t have the ability or are aggressive enough to seek out the help they need. They shouldn&apos;t have to be. The help should be offered constantly, the support and encouragement unwavering to those moms.
For those who want to nurse, rooming in with the baby should be a given. We also should have an obvious way to let the nurses know the child shouldn&apos;t receive formula. I shouldn&apos;t have to pack a sign that says &apos;No Formula&apos; to put on my baby&apos;s bassinet in the hospital. Even worse, there&apos;s no guarantee that the sign will be respected.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences It&apos;s dismaying how few doctors and others in the medical field don&apos;t understand what medications are appropriate for nursing moms. Often women are advised to wean when it&apos;s unnecessary. It&apos;s really a matter of making people aware that nursing is vital and then getting them to treat it with the appropriate respect. Once that attitude is in place, it&apos;s a simple matter to do some research on what medications are appropriate - Dr. Hale&apos;s book is a simple reference material that is trustworthy.
I find it amazing that mothers come to me as a La Leche League Leader for advice that should come from a medical professional - and often my resources counter what has been advised by the medical professional.
I have also been in a situation of explaining to my own doctors that I cannot have that medication or asking if the medication they are prescribing is appropriate to a nursing mom.

I believe that through MCC or other support services we could work with women during their pregancies as well as post-partum to encourage and prepare them to breastfeed. Breastfeeding can be a real challenge for women, especially young women, if they are not informed and prepared, and we know that many of our Hispanic women are isolated in ways that they are not accustomed to in their culture.

 Paid Maternity Leave The US is light years behind other industrialized nations in regards to maternity leave. Maternity leave should be paid. Maternity leave should be at least six months by law (instead of the 12 weeks it is now). If it will not be paid, it should still be 6 months. As a new mom who is breastfeeding, the number one challenge I have had is coming back to work and pumping from work. While I find the time and space (not easy to do), being away from the baby for so many hours inevitably leads to reduced milk supply which causes frustration, stress, and sometimes depression.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care We have a large hispanic community here in Walla Walla. The in vogue plan for breastfeeding is doing both. The problem is that moms (despite a lot of teaching) believe that baby isn&apos;t getting enough to eat in the early days before the milk supply comes in. So, they begin supplementing until their milk comes. This creates a whole vicious circle where babies no longer want to breastfeed to receive milk, they get gassy/ and or constipated, and mom&apos;s milk suppy is greatly affected because she&apos;s not taking advantage of the temporarily high levels of prolactin. The long and short of it is that moms end up breastfeeding just about 2 months and then quit. If during prenatal visits, providers could caution moms about starting formula early on, breastfeeding rates would significantly increase in duration as well as quantity.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Why do hospitals routinely test babies to see if they have low blood sugar when all breastfed babies will appear to have low blood sugar. Then they say your baby needs formula. Or when the nurses draw blood for the metabolic testing, they want your baby to have a super full tummy, which requires formula. Is there a way to delay these tests or allow mom to nurse during the test? Would that alleviate the need for formula?

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Places for moms to &quot;sit&quot; and nurse while out in public would hep a lot! A toilet seat in a dirty bathroom is not acceptable. Also, more positive stories and images of women breastfeeding. I have never received a negative comment while breastfeeding in public, instead it was all positive smiles, comments, and thumbs up! Yes, even from our elder citizens! I think a lot of the negative stories about women getting dirty looks, rude comments, or even kicked out of stores etc... has probably scared young mothers from even attempting to breastfeed.
Thank you for listening and good luck with the campaign!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a private practice lactation consultant, I often see the outcome of hospital practices when mothers and babies return home. In Manhattan, the problems that I see would be diminished if the following practices could be improved:
1) a higher ratio of IBCLCs to mothers and infants so that: a) more mothers and babies would have access to professional assistance when needed b) when they do receive assistance from IBCLCs, the IBCLC has the ability to do a full assessment including watching an entire feeding
2) IBCLCs in the hospital are required to do cross training or at least observation with IBCLCs who work in private practice with older babies (and vice versa) so that there is better communications and appreciation of the impact of early interventions and the results once mothers return home.
3) A mechanism of communication and feedback is developed between IBCLCs who work in the hospital and private practice. At present, very little communication exists because hospital work loads and the challenges of private practice make this a low priority item. Finding some institutional mechanism so that both parties could come together without losing income would be helpful.
4) Applied research on what actually happens with specific practices in the hospitals once mothers return home. Most studies on practices are hospital-based. Most notably --- issues such as finger feeding, cup feeding, bottle feeding, tubes on the breast need to be systematically evaluated in the short- AND THE LONG-term regarding usability and effectiveness.
5) Stronger legislation to remove promotional samples of formula to be distributed in the hospitals, since this not only harms the health of infants and mothers, but it also increases costs for parents and opportunity costs for the hospitals.
 1693 Lactation Professional
 Access to Lactation Care and Support At present, the profession of IBCLCs is dominated by in-hospital lactation consultants. Less than 5% of IBCLCs work in private practice. This means that there is very little professional support for women when they return home.
1) A &quot;stimulus&quot; package to encourage more IBCLCs from varied backgrounds such as nutrition, dietetics, psychology, speech and occupational therapy to become board certified and set up private practices.
2) Subsidies for setting up low income clinics for CLINICAL problems to complement mother-to-mother support groups.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am the mother of two boys. My first son was born at Carle Hospital in Urbana, IL. I had frequent visits from a wonderful lactation consultant and a fantastic group of midwives to talk to. The hospital had an extensive breastfeeding clinic that I often visited, where they could watch your baby latch, weigh the baby before and after a feeding to determine the amount consumed, and offered two separate rooms with glider-chairs and changing facilities for you to breastfeed in. They also ran a small store that sold creams, supportive nursing bras, and slings. All of these things were new to me and having this resource available was EXTREMELY helpful and encouraging. I nursed my first son for 13 months happily. My second son was born at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, NJ. What a difference. Although I was asked if I was going to nurse the baby, that was the only time it was really brought up. Although I requested to speak to someone (anyone!) about my baby&apos;s latch, I was told that the lactation consultant was not on duty on the weekends. I ended up speaking with an informed nurse, but that was it. I still continue to nurse my 6 month old son and look back with fond memories of the center at Carle. My recommendation is to put a center like this in each region and to make all hospitals aware of it, so that they can advise ALL new mothers about this resource.
 1695 Lactation Professional
 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences This links back to my comment in increasing access for women once they leave the hospital. IBCLCs are predominantly hospital based which leaves a very short window for assisting women with breastfeeding. Less than 5% of IBCLCs are in private practice. To reduce this imbalance, my suggestion would be to:
1) Increase the opportunities for those with training in other areas such as nutrition, dietetics, psychology, speech and occupational therapy to become IBCLCs.
2) Provide cross training for all IBCLCs to gain an appreciation for a) in-hospital, b) private practice out of the hospital, and c) in public health settings. This is crucial for developing a dialogue among these three areas.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support From my past experiences for my own prenatal care there was little to no education offered by my provider and clinic about breast feeding as well as during and after delivery care likely due to time restraint of most appointment. Currently as a healthcare provider I find most of my WCC first visit for newborn and moms have already started on formula/bottle feeding before being seen, therefore, the education needs to be done during prenatal care and post delivery before discharge and a phone call follow up process by the hospital staff maybe at 24 hour and 1 wk after discharge to improve breast feeding rate.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid Maternity Leave would definitely help to increase breast feeding promotion as a woman and a mom working full time I often wished when my children were newborns that I had the luxury to be a stayed home mom to breast feed but the income was more of a priority without this benefit.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I am a nurse, on a maternal child unit, in a hospital, one of the few places you would expect to reciceve good support for breastfeeding and pumping. Unfortunately my boss had a bad breastfeeding experience when she was a young mom and has written it off, along with anyone who does it, especially for longer than 6 months! Since I came back to work from maternity leave she has called me into her office to discuss &quot;issues&quot; surounding my personal breastfeeding/pumping. Generall the conversations start off something like this, &quot;I know this is personal but...&quot; And then she launches in, asking how often my baby breastfeeds at home, does he reallyneed to breastfeed that often, do I really need to pump that often at work, how long do I plan to breastfeed, why do I need to breastfeed that often, what do I do at night when my child breastfeeds that often, (we have a family bed so...) how are you going to get that child out of your bed... it goes on and on, all of it pernonal and absolutely none of her buisness. I have tried to be patient and educate her gracefull, explaining what I have learned from La Leche League, the American Academey of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, and she rolls her eyes and says things like, well of course LLL would say that, or that is just for underdeveloped countries where formula isn&apos;t available, etc.
I am so tired of being harassed at work for breastfeeding and pumping, those are my personal choices and I have followed rules I gave myself to protect me from letting it ever interfere with the care I give my patients. 1. I never pump with out making sure that my patients needs are taken care of. 2. I always make sure another nurse is willing to be available to my patients. 3. I always ask for permission to pump from my charge nurse incase there is something going on that I wasn&apos;t aware of that I need to help with before I pump. 4. I always carry my phone with me so that if they need me suddenly I can be back immediately to help them. My manager knows about these rules but that hasn&apos;t helped protect me.
We need laws protecting a woman&apos;s right to pump, with out strings attached. I don&apos;t know a single woman who enjoyes pupmping, it&apos;s not something people will abuse like smoking breaks, and it saves companies money by ensuring that their employees do not have to miss work and get sick pay because of mastitis or sick babies. Especially with no paid maternity leave it is expremetly important to helping women succeed at breastfeeding longer to have strict laws protecting a womans right to pump and providing penalties for harassment etc. We need to educate companies about the needs of breastfeeding women and the benifits to them (th companies) from accomidating those needs. In a country where so many women are the primary earners for their families and there are more and more single parent families these things can&apos;t wait.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Lactation consultants should be covered in more insurance plans to make care more accessible to those unable to pay for it out of pocket. As lactation effects the health of both baby and mother life long, it is money well spent as preventative medicine.
 1710 Lactation Professional
 Use of Banked Human Milk Banked human milk should be available to all sick and hospitalized infants when they are unable to receive their mother&apos;s own milk for any reason. Human milk, the biological standard for human infants, should not be withheld from them in times of illness due to their mother&apos;s inability to express or unwillingness to do so. In fact, by making it the standard, it would likely motivate more mothers to change their minds if they had initially planned not to breastfeed or pump.
 1711 Lactation Professional
 Paid Maternity Leave Short or unapid maternity leaves are the biggest factors in mothers&apos; planning the length of their lactation. I have known mothers who have not breastfed or stopped with the first problem, based soley on the fact that they will need to return to work quickly. The health of both mother and child is then effected in a life long way due to this decision usually out of the mother&apos;s control. The health effects then enter our economy due to insurance costs, absent work days, health problems later in life. This is a penny wise, pound foolish way to save the money leaves cost. Add in the psychological stress of mother/child separation at an early stage, too.

 Research and Surveillance There is a huge need for research-especially funded by public rather than industry sources--in many areas of lactation. Ongoing problems we face such as engorgement, mastitis, candidal infection, and so many others have little to no research to back up the treatments we now use. There may be preventative steps we could take or factors we could use to ameliorate risks--but there is no research. Lactation is one of the least researched fields--again showing that we do not value it enough to study it.

The leaders have nothing fancy to give to moms, but lots of good peer support and education. I see much money wasted by some breastfeeding promotion groups. La Leche League book, the Womanly Art of Breastfeeding is excellent, their handouts are also. So many things in society point negative to breastfeeding. When La Leche League was over the Lactation Consultants, I saw better results from them. Most work for hospitals and have to be more concerned about liabiity than actually helping the moms. Almost all I have counseled in last few years, following LC help, have been pumping. Natural mothering needs to be the goal, only way breastfeeding really can work. I have been a La Leche League leader for 25 years in a rural area. If more support could be given to LLL, it would help mothers see them as a good resource. LLL is not in competition with anyone, but some that also promote breastfeeding almost see it as such, wish all could work better with LLL In order for anyone to become a leader they have had to have attended LLL, nursed a baby at least one year, and prove, through extensive reading and correspondense with a person certifying them, that they have the knowledge to help other mothers.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I speak w/ women each week who are planning to breastfeed but after a short stay in a hospital have failed @ their own goal. Many times it is due to the fact that formula is the standard and much easier to &quot;push&quot; in the hospital setting. They are offering free samples, bags w/ logos and bottles of formula are in the room even if they are not used. Helping moms w/ breastfeeding, in our area, is seen as a hassle, something that takes more time than just giving formula. Not only that but our nurses are VERY under educated and still offering their personal opinions on this medical issue. Let&apos;s not forget, as well, that the prenatal environment is making either NO mention of breastfeeding or minimizing the importants of it during the first trimester when we know women are making the choice.

I started in the In Home Breastfeeding Program that was discontinued because of lack of funding,I&apos;m presently with the WIC program in colaboration with a grant from Partnernship for Children. This funding made it possible for me to have contacts with women prenatal,to educate and encourage them to breastfeed. I also provided them with hospital visits and home visits after their baby was delivered. I have seen tremendous advances in the number of mothers choosing to breastfeed and increased duration. But, due to our state cutting funding to Partnership For Children,our breastfeeding program has been totally eliminated and all we have is enough funds for 1person 1 day a week, and that will only cover phone calls to the mother. If the WIC program is really wanting mothers to breastfeed, they should put more money in the budget for breastfeeding support. I personally breastfed 4 children and wish every mother had the opportunity and support to breastfeed as long as they feel they should.

It would be a vast relief to be able to say that you want a year with your child and still have a secure position within your company or workforce.

 Other Areas There is a prejudice against breastfeeding in many segments of society that has created the presumption that breastfeeding is not healthy, that it is shameful, and that the difficulties outweigh the benefits for mothers and infants. These MUST be routed out of society through education and provision of services. In particular, I am appalled by the notion that breastfeeding is something to be relegated to a bathroom or bedroom, like it&apos;s a sex act. The baring of the breast is not sexual in these circumstances, and it should be okay to do so in public. To cover the infant with a blanket during breastfeeding is to block the communion and bonding that takes place between the infant and mother, never mind their perception of the world. The Christian right has exerted entirely too much power in this area. When I breastfed my children, it was okay to breastfeed in public, and it should be so again. No one suffered because of this public action of nurturance.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Women should be able to nurse their babies whenever and wherever they are hungry. Breastfeeding is a normal, natural human function, that should be encouraged, rather than shamed and discouraged. It is a inexcusable for individuals to ban breastfeeding because of their warped attitudes and hang-ups. If it weren&apos;t for breastfeeding, the human race would never have survived into this modern age... period! It is a well established fact that breast milk is healthier, species-specific food for human infants... The health of our nation depends upon our first few months and years... healthier babies become healthier adults.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care All healthy pregnant women should have access to midwifery care and the option to choose home births, as a recent study documented by the BBC has shown that home births for healthy mothers is as safe as hospital births. We need more well-trained licensed home birth midwives. And we need more medical personnel, MD&apos;s, midwives and RN&apos;s, who are trained in how to manage NORMAL births without resorting to unnecessary interventions that can actually precipitate complications. We have spawned a generation of fearful practitioners... let&apos;s let go of the fear. Despite all the high-tech interventions, the U.S. mortality and morbidity rates are shameful and inexcusable considering the wealth that is available in this country. We should look to the many countries that have lower maternal/ child mortality and morbidity than ours and emulate their midwifery practices.

Breastfeeding should be considered a &apos;normal&apos; way to nourish a child. It&apos;s amazing that people wouldn&apos;t think twice about seeing a scantily clad woman. Sometimes those same people would make a nursing Mom feel bad about her decision to nurse in public. Let&apos;s start a campaign to further the awareness of the benefits of nursing!

 Paid Maternity Leave I work for a business association and meet lots of women just back from maternity leave. Most are heartsick to leave they babies. Only the well-to-do women can take a non-paid maternity leave. Poor and lower-income women are forced to leave very young babies, while the well-to-do have choices. Paid maternity leave for all women will keep them breastfeeding longer, and be a huge help in boosting the duration of breastfeeding nationwide.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends I have found by being a breast-feeding mother and living in different communities during the time I had babies that some communities are still in the old prejudice against breast-feeding. This is extremely hard to overcome. Some people link breast-feeding to economic concerns and feel it is a sign of poverty. When this prejudice is part of a person, they are not likely to breast-feed without addressing their prejudice and raising their consciousness first and then teaching the advantages of breast-feeding. Along with this very persistent prejudice can be a revulsion if this group sees a breast-feeding mother, they will associate it with something sexual. This is the biggest challenge I see in getting more people to accept the benefits of breast-feeding. This is trying to change a cultural norm and is not an easy task.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I am a peer counselor for WIC in Miami-Dade County. We have a very diverse community and our breastfeeding rates are pretty high, in part to the large hispanic population we serve. However, it is that same hispanic breastfeeding population that is more likely to supplement than any other population and the concern is always, &quot;my baby was not getting enough&quot;. I think a stronger emphasis on normal newborn behavior and sleep patterns in a breastfed baby would help change that mindset a little. As a hispanic mother myself, I also know that our culture is very hung up on fat babies. It&apos;s a compliment for someone to say your baby is &quot;gordo&quot; (fat). Education on overfeeding and how it affects a baby longterm may also help change cultural sentiment.

It also will boost the babies immune system to get the colostrum and encourage bonding. Stop asking moms to be during the admitting proccess if they are planning to breastfeed! Just treat them as if they are. If doctors put the baby on mom after delivery and tell her to put the baby to the breast for help with blood loss and immunities they will all do without question and may find it is wonderful! we don&apos;t question the doctor suctioning baby or doing an episiotomy why question putting the baby to breast?

 Paid Maternity Leave I returned to work 16 weeks after the birth of my son, after maxing out all possible paid and unpaid leave options. I&apos;ve been trying to breast feed him exclusively, and had been doing so up until I returned to work.
After, even though I pumped every 3 hours at work, in the evening after he went to bed and even set an alarm for 2am to wake up and pump in the middle of the night, I simply could not make enough milk to feed my son. Pumps are fine, but were not able to express enough milk to keep up with my growing boy. I had to introduce formula into his diet, even though the evidence I read says this isn&apos;t the best thing for him.
My friends in Canada, the UK and Norway are not forced to make these types of gut wrenching compromises.
Also, I did my employer few favors by returning to work at 16 weeks. My hormones were still out of control, my son was waking up every hour all night, and had a difficult adjustment to the nanny. I was an extremely inefficient worker, prone to bursting into tears. I&apos;ve spent the last month re-doing everything I tried to do during the first 6 weeks I returned to work.
A true &quot;company friendly&quot; option would be to have at least 6 months maternity leave, covered by insurance or the government. This would have enabled my company to continue to employ a part-time replacement for me, while I tended to my son and regained my sanity.
By 6 months, my son was eating some solids, which reduces his milk needs, he was sleeping almost through the night and my hormones were under control. At this point, I was able to be a competent employee.
The system as it currently operates sets us up to fail, both at work and with our families.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid maternity leave is probably the most critical issue to ensure that breastfeeding is more widespread in the U.S. I was extremely lucky that I was in a position to take eight months off of work to be at home with my baby. Most of that time was unpaid. I had an extremely hard time breastfeeding my baby who was in the NICU and ended up pumping exclusively (and I had access to wonderful lactation consultants). Pumping (and probably breastfeeding as well) was practically a full time job. Through this experience, I learned that it is absolutely unreasonable to put pressure on women to breastfeed who must go back to work within 6 weeks or even three months of birth. If you want to reduce barriers to breastfeeding, focus on paid maternity leave benefits.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression While I think that paid maternity leave is the most important issue to improve breastfeeding rates in the US, onsite child care is probably second. If you must go back to work , it is virtually impossible to continue breastfeeding if your child is thirty minutes away from where you work.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have given birth in the UK and the US. In the UK I was able to stay in the hospital for 5 days-thus I was there when my milk came in and had assistance with this difficult beginning of breast feeding. In the US you are kicked out after 48 hours, or less, which is appaling for first time mothers who will need assistance with milk coming in, engorgement and getting a baby to latch. If women get discouraged at the beginning of breast feeding, as can happen when you are engorged and not knowing what to do, that can put an end to breastfeeding right away. It seems that a very important part of maternal health and encouraging breast feeding is increasing the amount of time women can stay in the hospital after giving birth so that they can receive proper assistance. Once a woman is home wiht her newborn baby, it is very difficult to leave the house due to feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I was just in NZ with my family and noticed many signs in business windows that said, &quot;breastfeeding-friendly business&quot; with a symbol that was part of the baby-friendly national campaign. Also, most large public spaces - airports, museums, shopping malls, etc. had a family room with comfy chairs for breastfeeding, access to hot water to warm bottles and nice, clean changing facilities. The space needs to be big enough to accommodate a stroller or two. So breastfeeding was part of a larger strategy of family friendly - that way it is integral and harder to cut if funds were scarce. PLUS there&apos;s a NZ breastfeeding authority, so it&apos;s part of public policy and recognized on a national level as important. NZ might be a good model for the US.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I cannot emphasize enough the importance and effectiveness of a breastfeeding friendly birth. I trained as a midwife for two years at a successful, busy free standing birth center. Our breastfeeding success rates were well above 90% because of our way of normalizing, promoting and supporting breastfeeding. We allowed unlimited free lactation consulting, provided no formula feedings at births or in birth bags, promoted skin to skin contact immediately following the birth, did the newborn exam in the room, only allowed rooming in (unless of course we transferred to a NICU, which was rare), and generally only suggested or introduced formula if there was a medical indication.
As a mother, I was devastated when my newborn was taken from me for observation for four hours immediately after his birth in a hospital. Breastfeeding friendly lists are easy to find, but the separation of the mother and baby, except in the medically necessary circumstances, is one of the most destructive practices. Lower nurse to patient rations would really help improve this. Mothers should have one to one support in the hours following her delivery, and the newborn nurse could be assigned to her room instead of to the baby (and probably a few others) in the nursery.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Lactation support needs to be encouraged by OB/GYNs, hospitals and pediatricians. Most importantly, it should be covered by insurance. By making the parents pay out of pocket or by making reimbursement challenging (filling out additional forms to send into insurance) it adds an additional barrier to breast feeding. There should be no limit to the number of visits as sometimes it takes parents quite a few tries to find the lactation consultant who works best with them. Additionally, as it was in my case, my daughter had substantial problems with nursing and I worked with a lactation consultant for over 3months (paying out of pocket)...most women would have given up due to the money and not finding the right person to work with--let alone the fact that it is difficult to continue to try and nurse a baby who is having difficulties or is refusing.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression The company I returned to work for after having my first child had a dedicated mother&apos;s room. It was wonderful--the room had a comfortable chair, outlet, sink to clean pump parts and refrigerator. I had privacy and felt safe and comfortable pumping at work. Given how not fun pumping is, reducing the barrier to pump at work is essential. I subsequently left that job and started a new job where I still needed to pump. They had no mother&apos;s room and all offices (of which I did not have on) had windows on the doors. I was left to pump in the bathroom. Needless to say, this was far from sanitary and incredibly uncomfortable. I had to make sure I had enough battery power for the day as well as bring extra ice packs as there was no dedicated refrigerator to put the milk in . Fortunately, I only needed to pump for 2 months at this last job...however, I can imagine stopping sooner had I had to deal with this situation for longer.
I would strongly encourage it to be necessary for all work places to provide a safe, comfortable and private place for women to express milk. I understand a dedicated mother&apos;s room may not be possible for all companies, but an office (or some other more sanitary room) with an electrical outlet is really important.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I was fortunate to be able to afford a good (i.e. fast, quite, efficient) breast pump for pumping at work. If we as a nation are going to support breast feeding, especially for working women, breast pumps need to be covered by insurance--either completely or at least at a substantial discount. This is especially critical given that mother&apos;s are recommended against buying used pumps (the only way to get a pump at a reduced price) because of the risk of infection and disease transmission.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I had a pretty unideal experience at the hospital. It would be highly beneficial to really increase the number of truly skilled lactation professionals. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I know of probably only a handful lactation consultants who are genuinely skilled and knowledgeable - I experienced 2 in particular, Joanna Koch and Gail Fiock. Unfortunately, I did not have their assistance shortly after the birth, and I found myself in a terrible situation where my milk had not come in, the hospital staff was unskilled enough to see that (they just saw an infant sucking and assumed all was well), the hospital staff was strongly against allowing me to use a pump to stimulate milk production (negativity towards &quot;artificial means&quot;), resistant to pushing any formula at all and didn&apos;t have the skill to see the need, and my infant dropped to 80% of his birth weight in the 24 hours after we had brought him home, starving and dehydrated. This really could have been a very dangerous situation. So while it&apos;s nice to have staff encourage breastfeeding, we do really need to step up the level of knowledge and skill so these people can actually be helpful. I believe most people in my situation would have given up, but as I mentioned, I was lucky enough to find one of the few good lactation consultants in the area and pushed through the difficult situation to finally be able to nurse my child after 1 month of pumping to allow the milk to come in, and then be able to catch up to the infant&apos;s needs.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Onsite Childcare would have made a world of difference to me in transitioning back to work. That and extended maternity leave for my situation. My child was a bottle rejector, a very determined one who basically starved himself when I was away. I drove an extra 20 miles every day at lunch when gas was nearly $5/gallon to come home to feed him, and was anguished any time the temperature increased for fear of him becoming dehydrated. Even with all this time and effort, putting my work at risk to try to improve my child&apos;s health, he still continued to drop off all the infant growth curves because of his lack of nutrition with my being gone for the work day. I can only imagine how different it would have been if there was onsite childcare where I might have been able to nurse him regularly. This might actually have an impact on his long term growth, given that this period is the time of the most dramatic growth in a person&apos;s life.

 Use of Banked Human Milk The evidence that use of donor milk decreases NEC is strong. For the premature infant whose mother cannot provide enough of her own milk, having this as an alternative is wonderful. However, the for-profit company provides milk at a cost that is exorbitant. The not-for-profit milk banks provide a safe, lower cost alternative, but have no money for advertisement or research. More information is needed in this field, on a number of different levels.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences It has been my experience with hospital medical personnel that breastfeeding is too much trouble and takes too much follow up in newborn babies. Because these nurses and doctors make only a token effort with moms and babies, the breastfeeding moms often give up in the hospital or very soon after because no one follows up on them. One local hospital has an LC that makes rounds routinely and offers a lactation center for follow up support. Their breastfeeding rates are much higher and the moms are more likely to still be breastfeeding when I see them with public health at 2 weeks - 6 weeks post partum. Our health department also offers free breastfeeding consultations for postpartum moms and is seeing an increase in duration and more exclusively breastfeeding moms. I believe that hospital doctors and nurses must be educated to make EVERY effort to support breastfeeding, and the follow up must be a part of that. Thanks for letting me have a voice.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Access to lactation care and support is a very important part of everything about breastfeeding. As a fisrt time mother it was difficult for me to get the right information about lactation and get the support of family, friends, and doctors. My baby was born premature and my plans were to breastfeed her until she did not want it anymore, however in the first few months of life, I was getting different advices from doctors, family and friends, up to the point where my breast stopped lactating, and when I try to get my breast to produce milk one more time, I did not get the support needed. This is the reason why it is so important for women to have a network of people they can call and ask questions about lactation.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I believe that if we truly believe that mothers,babies, and families are one of the most important commoditee this nation has then we need to have practices that demonstrate this. The following practices in hospitals do not help these families to develop that bond that should last a life time. 1. Unregulated visiting hours. We have gone from long hospital stays and no visitors (boring) to short stays with every waking moment filled up with visitors. We need to protect these new families from being overwhelmed in the hospital. 2. Letting breastfeeding babies go home before they are breastfeeding. If a formula baby was not drinking from a bottle it would never be allowed to go home. Neither should a breastfeeding baby be allowed to go home until it is breastfeeding. Starting formula and sending a mom and baby home with the advice of just keep trying meanwhile give formula is in my opinion descrimination against a group.

Sort of like how a Nanny works but who would be able to give the mom a few more days to adjust to being a new mother. Also would be able to teach the families how to support a new breastfeeding mom and baby. Many of these moms leave the hospitals exhausted and go to homes where they are not able to rest and just get to know their baby.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I have been a breastfeeding Educator for the past 11 years with W.I.C.I have seen the impact and the differnce support has made for low income mothers and their families in our communities first hand.I can attest to a mom having a greater experience and a better outcome if they have a person to give them advice and to help when they most need it. However the funding for some of these programs have been slim to none.It seems that every mom I speak to feels that they would not have continued to Breastfeed if it was not for support that they needed.That means something to me. The program being free,having the visit in their homes instead of taking their baby into a clinical environment,(also some have transportation issues),ease of being able to call when they have concerns,flexible schedule for accomodating clients in a timely fashion,having a trained and knowledgable person with the newest research that is available,these are just some of the reasons that clients have shared about the reason the have been successful.I have seen happier,healthier babies because of the early intervention.In order for moms to Breastfeed longer and with better outcomes for their childrens health,home visiting support is critical. Not to mention I never had that support myself.That is the main reason I decided to get into this profession. I believe knowledge and empowerment is the greatest gift we can give a person and I feel I get to do that everyday.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Working for a Public Agency, there was no support for pumping breast milk at the work place. I was told I wasn&apos;t breast feeding because my child wasn&apos;t there. I clarified that my child was a breast-feed child and it became an office topic of conversation. No provisions were made so that I could continue and it was generally looked down upon. Eventually I could no longer maintain pumping because of lack of time and I was being forced into a public restroom with no chairs, benches, or seating beyond the toilet. Women who choose to continue to feed should at bare minimum be given a chair or some level of accomodation rather than the public scrutiny I was put through. It&apos;s a shame that women have to quit for these reasons.

We need to go beyond the simple &quot;Breast or formula?&quot; question. We need to have a strong belief that breastmilk is best and then we need to advocate strongly with the patient for 6+ months of exclusive breastfeeding. We need to ask what happened with previous babies, and ask what their plans are for current baby, for return to work or school, etc. We need to refer them to classes and Lactation Consultants as needed. There are still so many family/friend/employer messages about how much easier it is to switch to formula. A lot of people truly do not understand the importance of breastmilk.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In our institution, the number of women complaining of difficulties with breastfeeding dropped significantly after our maternity nurses attended a mandatory 3 day training on breastfeeding techniques. Unfortunately, the gains we made are being lost because the hospital does not see it as a critical area for funding. Everyone (the public, physicians, hospital administrators) think that maternity nurses inherently know how to help and support breastfeeding mothers. NOT TRUE!! It doesn&apos;t take a lot of time, but it does require continued attention and occasional assessing of competencies to keep those health care providers who interact with new mothers most up to date on skills and recommendations regarding infant feeding. It has to be important to hospitals to make sure their nurses are skilled in breastfeeding techniques otherwise it will continue to be the case that new mothers receive conflicting (and sometimes false and damaging) advice and information.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have had two children in the state of Alabama. At the first hospital, there was no lactation consultant and while the nurses were supportive of breastfeeding while in the hospital, the most difficult part came after I left and developed a yeast infection. At my second delivery, having a lactation consultant on hand as needed and with followup post-delivery, made for a smoother transition to nursing around the clock at home. In talkig with colleagues and recent mothers, I am also aware that the commitment to breastfeeding must come when a woman is pregnant and that success only seems to occur if the committment is for a minimum of six weeks, as it often takes this long for the pain to subside (2 weeks for myself).

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The prevailing culture of newborn care in American hospitals and medical practices seems to emphasize the importance of feeding (healthy) newborns without much concern for the method. If breastfeeding isn&apos;t an instant &apos;success&apos;, providers at all levels are much too quick to reach for formula, thereby sending the message to parents that they &quot;can&apos;t breastfeed&quot; or that formula feeding is equivalent or even preferable in the eyes of the medical community. Preparation and teaching on breastfeeding needs to begin no later than prenatal care, even for mothers who express a desire not to breastfeed (of course, in a no-pressure, non-obligatory manner). For some women, learning the truths about breastfeeding may reduce some of the psychological barriers they have created; for others, knowing what to expect, including common problems&amp;solutions, will be an encouragement to continue beyond their initial attempts. Many of these principles are central to education on the labor&amp;delivery process and can be translated easily into the realm of breastfeeding.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Citizens for Midwifery, a national consumer grassroots advocacy organization that promotes access to the Midwives Model of Care in all settings, recognizes that successful breastfeeding begins with appropriate, optimal maternity care practices that provide effective care with least harm. The Midwives Model of Care includes “providing the mother with individualized education, counseling, and prenatal care, continuous hands-on assistance during labor and delivery, and postpartum support.” Because it focuses on “minimizing technological interventions” during pregnancy, birth and the postpartum period, this model also reduces the risk of unnecessary harms to mother and baby that can often interfere with successful establishment of breastfeeding. Research shows that a mother who has undergone a minimal number of such interventions is also most likely to be able to establish a smooth breastfeeding relationship with her baby. Also the postpartum support associated with this model is vital to a strong beginning to the breastfeeding relationship.Whether implemented by midwives or doctors, in a hospital, birthing center or at home, Citizens for Midwifery believes that greater access to the kind of individualized attention and support the Midwives Model of Care provides are crucial to improved breastfeeding outcomes.

Having the ability to give birth taken away from mothers by the medical community is one of the biggest mistakes of our times. I hope and pray that one day we will look back on this as the abuse it is. If you don&apos;t have confidence to give birth how can you have confidence to breastfeed?

Breastfeeding is natural and there should be more commercials, print ads, television shows, etc. that portray it as natural and beautiful. Quit pushing formula on everyone with commercials and coupons and offer woman a more visible, positive view on breastfeeding and let them know where they can find the support they need!

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I would love to walk into a restaurant, mall, movie theater, etc and see a sign that says, &quot;breastfeeding welcome here.&quot; Because it is allowed and people should get used to the idea of it. I&apos;m not the kind of mom that exposes herself in public, I am always covered. The problem is that people look at me covered and if they know what I&apos;m doing they still look away and act as if I&apos;m standing there naked! It is natural and you aren&apos;t seeing it, so smile and walk by and get used to it!!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have successfully breastfed two babies, the first for 11 months and the second is continuing at 17 months; a key to this success was having nurses, midwives and lactation consultants available from the very beginning to help me and an assumption by all that I would be breastfeeding. It is very important to also have uninterrupted time with the baby, with all medical things delayed until the mother and baby have bad 45 minutes to an hour to meet each other and start breastfeeding. Hospitals and birthing centers can also support breastfeeding by not giving formula, nipple or pacifier without the mothers consent, ie in the nursery.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Nurses and doctors need to be educated on what is safe medication wise for mom to take while nursing. On several occassions I have been told I had to &quot;pump and dump&quot; my milk for 24 hours due to medication when it was not true. With my first daughter I didn&apos;t know any better, with my second I knew there was someone out there who had done the research, Dr. Thomas Hale, and has provided a concise, clear book for professionals and lay persons, Medications and Mothers Milk. Five minutes with this book and you will find many medications are safe, many of them move so fast through the system that once mom is ready to nurse, it is gone or so little of it crosses to the milk and/or is poorly absorbed orally, that nursing can continue without interruption. And this education MUST go beyond the maternity area. I was recently in the hospital for an extended stay due to surgery complications. I was told by nurses and doctors that I had to &quot;pump and dump.&quot; I was prepared to do so, but when I borrowed a pump from the lactation area, they also looked up my medications. It was safe for the baby to have my milk. The LC helped me sort out when it was best and safest to pump my milk for the baby and we developed a plan. I had nurses and doctors come in and very angrily insist I discard my milk. I had one nurse go so far as say, &quot;if it were my baby I wouldn&apos;t give them the milk&quot;; in all honesty that only showed how ignorant she was of her options, but if I had not gotten the education myself that would have done exactly what she intended, scared me into believing her and doing what she thought was right based on her uneducated opinion.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Key to my success has been the ability to pump at work. My employer has rooms set aside for mom&apos;s to pump. It is a secured area, with outlets, tables, sink and fridge. We can leave our pumps there during the day. Due to wireless internet access, it is also possible for us to work while pumping if we have a laptop. Having a place to pump has been ideal. In Michigan there is nothing requiring this provision but I honestly don&apos;t know how mom&apos;s do it without a place to pump or the break time needed. Overall providing pumping time is a good investment for our communities--babies who are breastfed are healthier so mom is away from work less, there is less need for doctor visits and medications, etc. The only thing better would be an on-site daycare so I could feed my baby throughout the day as the body does not respond as well to pumping as it does to baby. It would be fantastic to be able to nurse the baby throughout the day and would minimize the mothers angst about leaving her baby to come back to work and the possibility that a care provider would ignore the mothers directions and feed a baby too much or insist on formula.

No one questions a smoke break or talking with other people for 20 minutes about sports. Women who work constantly on their feet should also be allowed time to step away if they need to pump. The workplace should also be mandated to provide a CLEAN space for mothers to pump, and NOT the bathroom. More working mothers would pump if they had a clean, private space provided.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospitals and Doctors need to get out of the business of pushing infant formula. Doctors need to stop giving out &quot;free&quot; formula samples because women think that it means formula and breastmilk are equal and they are obviously not equal. When new nursing mom&apos;s have formula in the house, they overwhelmingly give up breastfeeding sooner. Hospitals should be in the business of pushing the best quality care and giving out formula defeats their purpose.
Hospitals should also have more lactation consultants available to assist with issues. Hospitals should stop pushing bottles when weight drops. Early use of bottles hurts breastfeeding relationships and affects proper latching. If a baby truly needs a supplement of formula, it should be offered via a supplemental nursing system, a syringe or a dropper. Avoiding bottle use early on can increase the success of breastfeeding.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media More public service announcement ads need to be on TV portraying breastfeeding not only as normal but expected. We continue to tip-toe around the risks of not breastfeeding because we don&apos;t want to make some mom feel guilty, but it is proven that formula fed babies have higher infant death rates than breastfed babies. We can&apos;t tiptoe around this any longer. More ads need to be on TV and the politicians in this country need to stop caving to the formula companies who pressure them to stop public service announcements or pressure them to water them down so much that the message isn&apos;t good enough.
I realize that formula makers have strong lobbying power, but politicians and health officials should be ignoring them and pushing breastfeeding, with formula only as an emergency backup in the true case that a woman cannot breastfeed.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Insurance companies should either cover the cost to see a lactation consultant. Ideally, women should get at least 3 free visits. Insurance companies would pay out far less in claims if more women breastfed. On average, formula fed babies go to the doctor 10x for every 1x a breastfed baby goes. The math is obvious. Insurance companies just need to get onboard and fully support breastfeeding, whether it&apos;s via fully paid lactation services, double breastpumps or other breastfeeding services.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Companies should be given tax incentives to offer lactation rooms. My company has rooms set aside for this. While my company doesn&apos;t supply hospital grade pumps, I do have access to a fridge, comfortable chairs and tables and chairs and in a private setting so I can pump breastmilk while at work.
Companies that support lactation support can be assured that their employees will have less days off from work from their children being sick AND overall lower medical bills if they encouraged more mom&apos;s to breastfeed.
Women in service oriented jobs need to get MORE support for breastfeeding and pumping. I&apos;m lucky because I work in an office setting so I have a private place to pump. But a Mom who works at McDonalds or Starbucks doesn&apos;t usually have a private place to pump and no mother should have to pump in a bathroom! Women in service oriented jobs would benefit from breastfeeding because their children would have fewer sick visits, which would ensure more paid work time.
The CDC and the HHS department should educate companies on the importance of supporting breastfeeding mother&apos;s.
 1884 Concerned Citizen
 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Women should stay at the hospitals longer after a baby is born. Since breastmilk can take 2-5 days to come in, it is imperative that women get more support for breastfeeding after day 2. Early nursing, where the baby gets colostrum can be challenging, but at least most women can ask for help in the hospitals. But when your milk comes in, oftentimes women get engorged and latching becomes a bit more difficult. If women weren&apos;t forced to leave the hospital after 48 hours, they could continue to get the support they needed to breastfeed.
 1885 Concerned Citizen
 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences Health professionals should not learn about breastfeeding through publications and conferences that are sponsored by Formula companies. The one goal formula companies have is to get more women to formula feed. That presents a major conflict of interest. I have read the breastfeeding information printed by formula companies and they outright lie about how long breastmilk can stay fresh in the fridge and they talk about all the issues you might have (as to make it unappealing so women choose to formula feed).
Doctors (especially OBs) should not be offering formula at all (or if they do, it should be generic brands). Medical schools should cover more about breastfeeding.
It is sickening that formula companies have so much power that they can influence the direction of public service announcements on breastfeeding.

 Other Areas We have many wonderful documents and blueprints on how to improve breastfeeding. They all add up to the need to create a cohesive infrastructure around breastfeeding. We do not need to come up with fancy new ideas-- what we need, desperately, is funding to implement the excellent ideas already proposed. None of these ideas can happen without funding. We need a national director around breastfeeding and we can use the United States Breastfeeding Committee to implement and create the infrastructure needed. That will require millions of dollars so that we can: -Have at least 2-3 full time paid staff through USBC to implement changes -Undertake specific projects that currently address the barriers to breastfeeding. Eg, develop an online training program that is free to enable hospital staff to meet this difficult requirement for Baby Friendly -Organize and create demand for Baby Friendly -Fight formula marketing, using the strategies described by Ban the Bags, and include legislation -Build on workplace support -work on the creation of paid maternity leave.
The reason why so few of the calls to action in the past have been implemented is because there is no funding to back it up.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I attempted to breastfeed all three of my children. I was successful with my last two only because I was more confident in pursuing the help of lactation consultants. With my first child, I didn&apos;t even know who to ask for help. The hospital nurses could only help so much. I had done every bit of preparation possible, and still was not able to breastfeed him.
If every mother who gives birth is given unhurried time with a lactation consultant before she leaves the hospital, the success rate of breastfeeding will improve significantly. I know this was true for me and others I know.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid maternity leave should be available to ALL women. It takes the body at least 6 weeks to recover from even natural birth and yet not all women get even that much time off. It also takes a minimum of 6 weeks to establish breastfeeding, with 12 weeks much more preferrable. We need to sort out how to provide women more time to establish bonding and have recovery time, other nations give up to 2 years and we actually have nothing as a standard. That is absolutely crazy!

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media Breastfeeding needs to be mainstreamed. The right of a mother to feed her infant publicly needs to be protected on a national level. Every mom, every day should be able to feed her baby any where. People will never become comfortable until seeing a mom breastfeeding becomes an every day occurrence in our communities. Truthfully, fully visible breastfeeding will also help eliminate the difficulty many moms have when they first attempt breastfeeding because it is a learned behavior. We learn from our babies and from seeing the successful breastfeeding behaviors of others. Our bottle feeding culture needs to change at it&apos;s core. It begins with the proper education of our children. In Korea the government reviewed and replaced incorrect information in public school texts with current research and evidence based infant feeding practices. In Britain, the government engaged in a program to inform teen-agers. They sponsored a poster contest. The teens were challenged to design posters supporting breastfeeding. The images they created were astounding and compelling for people of any age. The ad council in the United States developed ads that clearly portrayed formula feeding as a risky behavior and managed to convey the message with humor. But to my knowledge these ads were never allowed to be aired. Our media continues to be uncomfortable with breasts for breastfeeding. National leadership needs to somehow be a driving force in how breastfeeding is perceived in the United States. Leadership also needs to combat the continued unethical relationship the formula companies have with the health care industry. This unhealthy relationship continues to sabotage the effort to normalize breastfeeding in our country.

 Paid Maternity Leave In order to become competitive with the other developed nations of the world, and in support of optimal health outcomes for our communities, the United States needs to endorse at least a six month maternity leave that is financially supported either by employers or the government. Every professional health organization in the United States recommends six months exclusive breastfeeding. It can be extremely difficult to return to work while breastfeeding. Rather than expending resources to develop breastfeeding friendly workplaces where mothers are still separated from their infants and compelled to express their milk with electric pumps, we should be focusing on keeping families together during this critical period. The United States needs to stop giving lip service to and begin truly supporting families. Canada has a one year maternity leave; some countries in Scandinavia have eighteen month leaves. We lag shamefully behind the rest of the developed world.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Without good birth it is difficult to have good breastfeeding. Their has been a disturbing trend toward the medicalization of birth. Active management of labor promotes the use of interventions not demonstrated to improve mortality or morbidity rates for the mother and baby. These interventions increase the need for instrumented vaginal and surgical births. At the University of Michigan, where I am employed as a staff RN on the birth center, our institution is building a new facility for the center. It was designed with the anticipation of a 50% c-section rate predicted by our MD&apos;s as they have begun the practice of elective primary c-section. This practice has not been demonstrated to be safer for mothers and babies than a normal trial of labor. There needs to be some kind of oversight. We cannot rely on the physicians and the profit driven hospitals to regulate their practice. There need to be national standards outside of the professional organizations driving the practice. Also profit needs to be removed from health care. The market has no business in the decision making guiding the practices supporting the health and well being of our nation. In most other developed nations the midwifery model of OB care is utilized with much better outcomes for both mother and baby. It is safer and more cost effective. It achieves a much lower rate of induction, instrumented vaginal birth, and c-section which translates to a much lower cost physically, financially, and psychologically to the whole nation; and contributes to improved breastfeeding initiation, continuation, and exclusivity rates. There is no need to re-invent the wheel. Simply,both the World Health Organizations Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, and the Mother- Friendly Initiative should be endorsed by the national government.

 Paid Maternity Leave This seems like a no-brainer. A mother who is not available to nurse because she has no paid maternity leave or very little paid maternity leave cannot nurse.

Unfortunately in hospitals where the majority of America women give birth, health care workers often only pay lip service to providing support to mothers who wish to breast feed. I think there are a number of reasons for this including that they are too busy or overworked to really give mothers hands on help, they are uniformed about how to best help mothers who are having problems, they are too much influenced by formula companies and find it easier to give a mother a free sample of formula instead of working with her to get a correct latch. I am sure there are other reasons, but these are the ones I am most aware of among my cohort of new mothers.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I have been fortunate to have an office in which to pump at work. Even with this, it&apos;s very difficult to reach the AAP&apos;s recommended guidelines for breastfeeding, since pumping is certainly no substitute for nursing. I was also fortunate that I could nurse my daughter during the day, as she was in onsite child care. Unfortunately, this center will be closing in 2 months. I think this is deplorable as I work at the only major medical center in a large metropolitan area. Of all employers, they should see the benefit to having onsite childcare. Among these benefits are those of being able to nurse one&apos;s baby during the day. This has been shown to be better, not only for the baby, but also for the mother.
The only access to &quot;worksite lactation support&quot; I have had is through doctors and lactation consultants that work at the medical center where I work. I have not been told that these people existed. I had to seek them out. While they are pleasant and helpful, their services are not well-advertised. Given the lack of maternity leave in the USA, it seems prudent that employers help employees with childcare and lactation support. The USA is SO far behind in this area that it&apos;s pathetic.

 Paid Maternity Leave While I was fortunate to have 3 months paid leave with my daughter, I know that most are not that fortunate. Even this short amount of time makes it difficult to allow mother and child to breastfeed for a year (the AAP&apos;s recommendation). I can&apos;t imagine only having 6 weeks to establish the breastfeeding relationship (or shorter for some).
Our nation is perhaps the ONLY one of its stature to have such a short mandate for maternity leave. Canada and most of Europe give new mothers at least a year, if not 2. This allows these mothers to breastfeed their children for the recommended year (although the WHO recommends longer). This is one area that I feel our country needs to address. By allowing mothers to stay home with their children for a year, it might ease the burden of needing daycare for young infants, which is the most difficult and expensive to find.
Other industrialized nations are able to function with workers out for a year on maternity leave. They are productive societies. The USA should seriously consider such an option for our families.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As a breastfeeding mother, I am very disturbed by our practices that allow formula companies to give &quot;diaper bags&quot; to mothers in the clinics and hospitals with the free formula samples. One can of free formula is NOT going to make a significant difference to the budget of a formula-feeding mom and they do not have a &quot;RIGHT&quot; to receive samples. These marketing efforts really undermine the message that breastfeeding is best. Also, when I was home only a few weeks with my new baby... very tired, hormonal and full of self-doubt, a full-size can of formula showed up in my mailbox from a formula company. I was SO MAD. It made me start to doubt my decision to exclusively breastfeed. I didn&apos;t use it, but instead donated it to a shelter.
I know formula isn&apos;t evil, but marketing it to women should be treated similarly to tobacco marketing practices. People still have the choice to smoke, but it should not be PROMOTED. Thank you for listening.

They assume it works like bottle feeding (as the baby gets older, it feeds more but less often, for example) or know little about nursing past a year. Their growth curves are based on formula fed babies and they rush to encourage formula feeding if anything is wrong with the baby at all.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I have been lucky to have a working environment that supports pumping but it is difficult in many types of employment. We need to support on-site childcare (for many women, the ability to nurse would be faster than pumping) and also longer maternity leaves (and paid maternity leaves) so that nursing can be encouraged. Many women need to give up nursing when they go back to work, and it is horrible that we make them feel badly about that choice when often their workplace leaves them no choice.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid maternity leave would make it much easier for many women to nurse. It is illogical that we focus on pumping as the solution to no paid maternity leave--how and where are many workers not in high level professional jobs supposed to pump? Paid maternity leave of significant duration would go a long way towards encouraging more women to nurse longer.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media You never see women breastfeed in the traditional media. Think about the toys we give our kids: babies come with bottles. In other countries with higher rates of nursing, girls &quot;nurse&quot; their dolls. Breastfeeding is mostly talked about in scientific terms (&quot;why you should do it&quot;) or as part of the larger debates about motherhood. And it is still portrayed as a &quot;the choice to breastfeed,&quot; which still makes it sound like an aberration and a luxury.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Baby-friendly practices should be standard at every hospital. We need to rethink if many are necessary. For example, when the baby is taken away for observation for hours after birth and isn&apos;t returned until its temperature is stabilized. Well, if it hadn&apos;t been doused with cold water and then separated from warm human arms, maybe it wouldn&apos;t have that problem. we should also provide facilities for women whose babies are not discharged with them to stay in the hospital if they&apos;d like. Imagine if you are a new mother, tired, and told you can go home but your child has jaundice and needs to stay here. Breastfeeding can help reduce jaundice, but how exactly are you supposed to be with your baby when you have nowhere to sleep?

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media I propose a gentle, fun and educational approach in the next national breastfeeding promotion campaign, using the slogan, &quot;Thanks, Mom. I needed that!&quot;
This could be used in a number of ways, including media advertisements with well-known public figures and their mothers in which the public figure, such as Michael Jordan, affectionately expresses gratitude to his mother about his healthy start in life, stating &quot;Thanks, Mom. I needed that!&quot;
This slogan could likewise be used in the media with a preschooler stating the same. Visual images accompanying the slogan could be of the younger person/child kissing mom on the cheek before or after speaking the slogan. Text content could state health benefits such as &quot;up to 3 times/5 times/8 times fewer&quot; incidences of this and that illness in bfing populations, worded for ease of use and effective delivery.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Working mothers need to have their right to pump breastmilk at work protected by law. This means that employers would be required to provide both the space (e.g., a lactation room, which need not be large) and the time (AT LEAST 15-20 minutes 2x a day). I breastfed my daughter for 23 months, and plan to do something similar for my second child, who is due in September. I went back to work when my daughter was 3 months old. For me, going back to work was a positive thing, and I did not want a one year maternity leave. I did, however, want to continue breastfeeding for at least a year. I was able to do so, and in fact I pumped at work until my daughter was 17 months old. I was able to do this because my employer provided me with a private space to pump and the time to do it. I live in California, where that is required by law. I have a cousin who lives in Arizona, which does not have a similar law. She also wanted to breastfeed for at least a year, but stopped after 6 months, because she found it too difficult to pump at work. Her employer provided no space and no time- she was left to try to figure that out on her own, and clearly, what she could figure out didn&apos;t work.
It would be interesting to compare the breastfeeding rates in states with laws protecting nursing working mothers and states without such laws, to see if the statistics back up the anecdotes. However, even if the statistics are not clear, I think this sort of law is warranted, if only as a matter of common human decency. I have had to pump in my car (I was at a conference that did not have any other place for me to pump), and I can&apos;t imagine having to do that every day. Yet there are women for whom there is no other solution if they want to work and breastfeed. A society that allows this to happen is not a society that truly supports breastfeeding.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Be realistic. Some women will mix breastfeeding and formula. The information I was given by professionals did not include information about how to do this without undermining your milk supply.

Surely we also want to encourage women who want to breastfeed but can&apos;t do so exclusively.

 Paid Maternity Leave 6 weeks paid leave is laughable. It is nowhere near enough time to really establish your milk supply. Furthermore, 6 weeks is right around the time of a major growth spurt for the baby, when a nursing baby nurses even more frequently. I think 3 months is the minimum amount of time a woman needs. Unpaid leave is better than nothing, but many women can&apos;t afford to take a month or more off without pay.
Also, better support for part time work would be helpful. I found it very helpful to go back halftime for a month to ease into the new routine of pumping, etc. I was lucky to have an employer who would allow me to do this. I also live in California, and had partial pay for family leave, which helped offset the loss of income from the part time work.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospital nurseries should, as a rule, not provide formula to infants without a doctor&apos;s order. This makes the DEFAULT choice in hospitals to be breastfeeding rather than formula. I am a pediatrician who trained at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, and the RNs there did NOT follow this rule. Therefore, a government policy, could give hospitals benefits for (or penalize for not following) such a guideline. In addition, hospitals should be REQUIRED to have a full-time lactation consultant on staff in order to meet JCAHO requirements.

 Paid Maternity Leave All new parents should be able to access 3-6 months of paid leave, funded through unemployment or disability if necessary (how do they fund it in Europe??). I know a lot of new moms who didn&apos;t want to even start nursing, knowing that they would have to go back to work after just a few weeks. It didn&apos;t seem worth the bother, or they didn&apos;t think their jobs would allow them to take pumping breaks. Even if it&apos;s a law that employers have to allow that, most workplace CULTURES make it uncomfortable for them to do that and thus discourage breastfeeding. Having longer at home would allow moms the freedom to establish a solid breastfeeding relationship, and even if they didn&apos;t want to pump when returning to work at 6 months, having had 6 months of exclusive bf at home would be awesome for babies!

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Public rest stops and airports need to have private breastfeeding areas. It&apos;s SO hard to find a place to bf when traveling. We would usually stop at a rest stop and try to find a picnic table that was far enough from others to afford some privacy, but that was really hard. At airports, I just had to be willing to be a little immodest, which is hard. Just like many public places now have &quot;family rest rooms&quot; (which are great), there could also be little lounges for breastfeeding. The government could encourage these in museums, ballparks, zoos, etc. by providing some kind of grant funding or tax credit or whatever if places will install these. Families with nursing moms would plan their activities around the location of these facilities. Even if you don&apos;t feel embarrassed about nursing in public, it would be nice to have a quiet place for nursing where you could also wash hands before and after, change a diaper, etc.

 Paid Maternity Leave Paid Maternity leave would make it easier and more affordable for mothers to have time off work with their child to bond and establish their milk supply. Establishing pumping at work to maintain your milk supply can be frustrating and difficult and requires a lot of dedication on the mother&apos;s part. Currently, we are guaranteed 12 weeks off without pay, but I know very few people who can afford to take 12 unpaid weeks before returning to work. Six weeks unpaid can be extremely stressing to a family budget expecting high medical bills related to the birth and other costs associated with a new baby.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I was pleased with the lactation support that I received at Bergan Mercy Medical Center in Omaha, NE and believe that it was essential for me establishing a nursing routine. Although nursing is natural, it doesn&apos;t feel &quot;natural&quot; and new moms are filled with questions regarding the topic. I feel that utilizing lactation consultants and OB&apos;s to encourage breastfeeding is essential to promoting and increasing the likelihood of a new mother to choose to breastfeed. The bottle is so easy. Nursing is a committment to provide your child with the best possible start, although it is very difficult to make that choice when only being able to be away from your child or a pump for ~4 hours. Convincing nursing moms that the benefits outweigh the convenience of bottle feeding is imperative to improving the likelihood for mothers to choose breastfeeding.

 Paid Maternity Leave I have recently returned from maternity leave and I am currently exclusively breastfeeding my 11 week old daughter. My paid maternity leave was six weeks. I was fortunate enough to be able to add an additional two weeks of vacation to that for a total of eight weeks. At six weeks my breastfeeding relationship had just barely stabilized. My daughter was finally consistently latching well and I was no longer in pain when she nursed. I definitely needed those additional two weeks at home to cement that bond/routine. I do not believe that we allow new Moms nearly enough time with their newborns before they are forced to return to work. Pumping while you are away from your infant takes dedication and if you are still struggling with breastfeeding, it would certainly be easier to just switch to formula.

Yet co-sleeping greatly facilitates breastfeeding at night, and probably the majority of mothers that breastfeed long-term co-sleep with their babies. There are guidelines for safe co-sleeping and nearly all infant deaths attributed to co-sleeping happened when these guidelines were not followed. The benefits of breastfeeding CLEARLY outweigh the risks of co-sleeping, especially when the safety guidelines are followed, so I think it is short-sighted to condemn all co-sleeping as unsafe while ignoring the impact of sleeping apart on breastfeeding.

 Paid Maternity Leave The USA needs to provide paid maternity leave (and paternity leave). The USA is one of the few industrialized nations that does not provide this support. US outcomes for exclusive breastfeeding, and for duration of breastfeeding, both lag behind most other industrialized nations. Many families living in the USA feel financial pressure to return to paid employment as soon as possible after the birth or adoption of an infant. Too many are not able to spend adequate time fully recovering from the birth experience, adjusting to their new family, and getting breastfeeding well established. Regular separation of mothers and babies makes it difficult, and sometime impossible to maintain a breastfeeding relationship. Belarus provides the option of 3 years of paid maternity leave for new mothers. Their exclusive breastfeeding, and long term breastfeeding outcomes already exceed our Healthy People 2010 goals. The USA should provide at least 1 year of paid leave for all new mothers, and also provide some paid time for fathers. The reduction of morbidity and mortality for mothers and babies; the cost saving from decreased medical expenditures; the reduced impact on our environment; and the enhanced intelligence of our population are some of the reasons why investing in paid maternity leave will benefit our nation.

 Paid Maternity Leave I cannot stress enough how important paid maternity leave is to promoting breastfeeding. Breastmilk is good for babies, but breastfeeding -- actually holding your baby and having body to body contact between mother and baby -- is part of the benefit too. Breastpumps are wonderful, but they also cannot take the place of being with your baby while breastfeeding for a number of reasons: 1) It is much more difficult and inconvenient to pump than it is to just feed your baby directly from the breast; 2) Many mothers, myself included, cannot get as much milk from a pump as a baby can extract from nursing, so it is hard to &quot;keep up&quot; with baby&apos;s milk needs while away from him/her; 3) Many American women do not have a good place to pump at work, nor do they have enough breaks during the day to make pumping successful (see #2, getting enough milk with the pump).
Frankly I find it scandalous that the American Academy of Pediatriacs recommends breastfeeding for 1 year in a country in which there is NO paid maternity leave. It makes sense to expect/recommend to Canadian mothers -- who have a year of maternity leave -- to nurse for a year.
I think the government should cover the costs of maternity leave rather than this being something that is employer-based and employer-dependent. Promoting healthy children and supporting families is about the social reproduction of the nation. It is a vital matter of public interest and public policy and thus, like health insurance, should not depend on the vagaries of where or for whom one happens to work.

We have the WIC program that is in place that assist moms that need help with feeding their infants that can&apos;t totally afford to. We have placed at the helm of this cause the funds set aside monthly for formula. My desire is to see USDA/WIC come up with a system that will instead of using those funds just for formula the first 3 months, use the revenue to #1)Give the mother that desires to exclusively breast-feed an electrical pump. #2)The plan would work to where no formula would be given to mom for at least the first 3 months of the infants life. This will enable her to have a pump with the first weeks of life, that will assist her in storing when she returns back to work/school or separated from baby for any reason. #3)The anxiety alone when looking to leave the infant, seems to slow down moms milk supply, and the desire to nurse longer. This could assist in longer duration of human milk being given as opposed to formula, and will give mom the security to know that she can with the right pumping routine.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I think that most places should have nursing rooms.I have been to a few places that do(a Library and a Shopping Mall),and they are very nice.I think grocery stores like Walmart and Target should have a room for nursing mothers.I know I have gone to get groceries before and my baby got hungry and had to feed her in the car,because there was nowhere to sitdown with her in private.I sure wasn&apos;t going to nurse her in the middle of the store with people gawking at me or in the bathroom,uncomfortable and filthy.
Also I agree with what alot of other women have said about how people are offended by breastfeeding in public,yet they see half-dressed women everywhere,on TV in Magazines on Billboards at the mall (lingerie stores) and that is normal,but breastfeeding isn&apos;t.I think that is just awful,and it does make me feel bad.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support To start I would like to suggest that formula company&apos;s not be allowed to say that formula is &quot; close to mother&apos;s milk&quot;. It is nowhere near. I think that mother&apos;s should receive information about the harmful things that formula can do, for example mothers should be told about the risks for digestive problems, ex. I think that while in the hospital parents and families should receive education and support for breastfeeding. I know from personal experience that family members who are not well informed on the benefits of breastfeeding can be very discouraging to mothers who are not sure of themselves. I also think that insurance companies should cover LC&apos;s as well as good breast-pumps give moms a good start. Mothers should have at least a 12 week paid maternity leave so mother and baby can develop a good healthy breastfeeding routine. I think that if we all raise our voices and join together we can help babies get off to a good healthy start. Maybe we can help teach Americans what other countries already know, that breast is best!

 Research and Surveillance Many comments have indicated that promotion of breastfeeding needs to be accompanied by structural support, such as paid maternity leave, for public health goals to be realized. Some have commented on the lack of positive images of breastfeeding in media as a factor in lower than desired rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration. I would like to add my view that we need more research on specific barriers to breastfeeding, especially cultural barriers (beliefs, practices, and expectations) that limit breastfeeding success. We know that the structure of waged labor for women is a barrier to breastfeeding initiation and duration. We also know that perceived censure for breastfeeding in public limits breastfeeding. But what do we know about the &quot;whole picture,&quot; in other words, how breastfeeding is perceived and represented generally around the country? This question calls for multimodal research methods that address cultural perceptions, economic structures and demands, personal views, ethnic and racial disparities in experience, class influences, etc. When women are asked what they want as mothers, how do they respond? What do women perceive the main barriers to breastfeeding success to be? I am concerned that breastfeeding promotion that depends solely on social marketing and medical information about breastfeeding&apos;s contribution to health misses the concrete experiences of women&apos;s lives, in which they know that breastfeeding is a good idea but cannot make it work in actual fact. We need to address those factors that limit breastfeeding success, and these are necessary to address in conjunction with information and medical support. To do so, however, we need to know more about those factors, and whether different factors affect women in different socioeconomic and demographic categories.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression We desperately need to add breastfeeding women as a protected class under the The Pregnancy Discrimination amendment to the Civil Rights Act. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act included conditions related to pregnancy, which breastfeeding obviously is. Medical experts agree that breastfeeding is part of a women&apos;s reproductive cycle of pregnancy, birth, and lactation. Currently a woman can be fired from her job for expressing her milk at work or can be prevented from expressing her milk. This is discrimination against working lactating women. Furthermore, in the public sphere, a breastfeeding woman can be refused service or charged with trespaasing for breastfeeding in public. Currently there is a hodge-podge of state law regarding breastfeeding. Clarifying that discriminating against breastfeeding women in any state is against the law would go a long way towards promoting the cultural change needed to make breastfeeding easy and acceptable.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings Federal law needs to clarify a woman&apos;s natural right to breastfeed in public spaces and provide enforcement of such a law. Some states protect this right with and without an enforcement provision. Discrimination stiil occurs even in states with an enforcement provision (Gillette vs Delta Airlines). Some states exempt breastfeeding from indecent exposure laws, but a woman can be charged and arrested for trespassing if she breastfeeds after being told to leave. Some states have no laws at all regarding breastfeeding in public.
Restriction or the perception of restriction on breastfeeding in public is a disincentive to breastfeed. Women should not feel that they must confine themselves to their homes during lactation. They should not be afraid or embarrassed that one complaining passerby could restrict their free movement. Perceiving that breastfeeding in public is unwelcome or distasteful will affect a woman&apos;s decision to breastfeed or not and for how long. Promoting breastfeeding in public culturally and legally can remove this issue as a factor in a women&apos;s decision to breastfeed.

 Paid Maternity Leave You have no doubt received many comments in support of paid maternity leave. This is not one of them. I do not think our citizens are ready or willing to financially support women&apos;s breastfeeding. Many feel that this shoud be a personal responsibility. I also do not think that in this current economy we can afford a new entitlement.
Paid maternity leave has not been shown to be consistently effective at increasing breastfeeding initiation and duration. The UK has paid maternity leave but their breastfeeding rates are comparable to the US. France has paid maternity leave and their rates of breastfeeding are well below that of the US. Norway has generous paid maternity benefits and breastfeeding rates approaching 100%. Australia has a lengthy unpaid maternity leave and rate of breastfeeding that exceeds that of the US.
So you can see that paid maternity leave does not correlate to improved rates of breastfeeding. However, I do think most women would agree that flexible work arrangements make breastfeeding much easier. There are ways to do this that do not create a new entitlement.
Some ideas are: 1) Increase the number of weeks available under the FMLA for maternity leave. 2) Include more companies under the FMLA by reducing the required number of employees from 50 to 25 or less. 3) Pass separate legislation expressly for maternity leave that provides for a lengthy (6-12) months of unpaid leave. 4) Be creative. Allow flexible leave such as up to 3 months off, 6 months at half-time, and 3 months at 3/4 time. Such a schedule more closely reflects the intensity of the early days and the gradual introduction of solid foods in the latter half of a baby&apos;s first year. 5) Provide time for women to nurse or express their milk during work hours. Ideally this would be paid time. The minimum amount of time needed to remove milk during an 8-hour work day is approx. 1 hour. This allows three 20-minute breaks, approx. every 2 hours, which closely approximates a baby&apos;s nursing schedule. This should be considered a reasonable accomodation for finite period of time. 6) Require other reasonable accomodations for women to express milk such as a private place to nurse, access to an electrical outlet, access to clean running water. 7) Any attempt to improved maternity benefits should include protection from discrimation against lactating women in the workforce.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care My daughter was born with a cleft lip and palate in a large urban university hospital. The staff was very poorly informed about breastfeeding issues relating to this condition. They were very well intentioned and attempted to provide support. But they told me she might be able to breastfeed even though her cleft was far too large to allow for suction. The doctors were eager to push formula and insisted on feeding it to her immediately in the birth room. The nurses did not know how to use the breast pump and caused injury to me, and I almost lost my milk supply. And they sent me home with only one feeder which I had to wash ten times a day until I could order more to be mailed to me. I ended up pumping around the clock for 14 months to provide my daughter with milk and only supplement occasionally. I did this with support from other moms I found on the Internet, not with medical professionals. I share my story because I am sure I am not alone in this and I think nurses and doctors need better education not only on the benefits of mother&apos;s milk but on how lactation works and what can help and hinder it. A short visit from a lactation consultant does not replace this knowledge coming from doctors residents and nurses in the delivery room and immediately after.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Main concern coming from my mommies at WIC has to do with the fact that hospitals (staff, in particular nurses) are uneducated on the benefits of breastfeeding. Some of my moms who were focused on breastfeeding before birth have complained that the nurses give their babies bottles, even when the mothers tell them no. It seems that if moms have any difficulties breastfeeding, they immediately give babies bottles, which has been proven to discourage from latching at the breast-it is easier to suck formula out of a bottle than it is to latch-instant gratification-the problem with this country! I&apos;ve heard stories that even when moms insist that baby not have a bottle, the nurses will still do it for fear that the baby needs to eat right away. It has been proven a baby can survive &gt;72 hours without feeding! Of course, we don&apos;t want to go that long but they can stand a few hours without feeding until a lactation consultant can help them out. I&apos;ve also had issues with moms saying they have been in public breastfeeding their infants and people will make nasty comments. I give them the Florida Statute card and tell them to hand it to those people so they know she has the right to feed her baby in public. Education is key. Reinforcing, debunking the myths (it hurts to breastfeed is a big one I hear), and having more lactation consultants in public health will help in our efforts to promote, support, and protect breastfeeding for generations to come. On the other hand, corporations make money at selling formula and their marketing efforts are hurting our promotion efforts. Corporations should not be making the important decision of infant nutrition for our mothers. Study after study has proven the benefits of breastmilk far outweigh formula. It is not the same and should be promoted that way. Formula is made from COW&apos;S milk for calves NOT for humans!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I work in a hospital and also as a LLL leader. I believe formula supplements started in the hospital are a major factor in success rates for breastfeeding. Recently the AAP put out guidelines for supplementation when blood sugars are below 50. This new guideline has caused many of our babies in the hospital to be supplemented first before a mother is given the chance to breastfeed her baby. We need to have new AAP guidelines that promote breastfeeding and not hinder it. I also believe that accrediting organizations like JCAHO and others that accredit hospitals should make it so all obstetric and women&apos;s health nurses have basic breasteeding education. Many of our nurses do not and have biased views against breastfeeding, thus not supporting breastfeeding mothers in the hospital.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care There are many phases of self doubt that a new mother experiences from the start.It is very important that breastfeeding advice comes from an experienced breastfeeder. Mother and child should not be separated. Formula feeding should always be presented as a medical treatment and not as an alternative or commonly accepted method of nourishment for an infant. Formula is not and will never be an equal to breast milk. If a woman knows that her choice is to breastfeed then she is more likely to prepare herself intellectually to do so. Once a mother is informed about the social and biological benefits of breastfeeding then she is more likely to do so.
It would be most advantegous for an expectant mother not only to inform herself but also to SEE and observe the nursing relationship between mothers and infants prior to her own delivery.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I went back to work 5 months after my daughter was born with the intention of breastfeeding for another month or so until she reached 6 months. My employer then (BP...one of the only good things I have to say about the company)had provided nursing mothers a laction room and several pumps and booths with curtains. It was fairly easy for me to use one of these room hence I continued to breastfeed until my daughter was well over 1 year. This is a success story! (she has only had 1 sick day in 2 years!!!) Since then I have left BP for another company (much much smaller) dominated by males and no nursing mothers. We want to have another baby and I would like to return to work eventually (perhaps afetr 5 months). Although the men here are very open minded, eventually I will have to bring it to their attention that I will be breastfeeding for hopefully the better part of 1 year of the baby&apos;s life and will have to make arrangements and all of this will be very awkward. If there ware some sort of legistation in place it would make this so much easier and I wouldn&apos;t feel like I would have to justify my decision perhaps as much. (as a side note....good thing I had a pleasant experience with my previous employer or else maybe I wouldn&apos;t have the guts to do this will the new employer).I&apos;m not looking forward to discussing breastfeeing with my middle-aged boss although he&apos;s a wonderful boss.

The United States needs to move to extend paid leave for parents. I believe the first year of a child&apos;s life are the most formative, and having time with your Mom or Dad is the best thing.

 Paid Maternity Leave Breast pumps are less effective and less comfortable than a nursing baby. I strongly believe that a major reason so many women quit breastfeeding before the recommended 12 months is because they go back to work after 8 or 12 weeks of maternity leave and are unable to maintain an adequate milk supply when away from their infant for 8-10 hours a day. If the US truly believes that breastfeeding is important, the government needs to put money behind this belief and give women 12 months of paid maternity leave. This will have benefits beyond higher success rates of breastfeeding, and will result in happier, healthier babies, mothers, and families.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I used Cerified Professional Midwifes working out of a freestanding birth center for two of my three babies. They did not take my babies away to clean them up; rather, they put them on my chest, where they started nursing immediately. My first son was born at a hospital five years ago, where he was whisked away and given formula without my consent. Eventually I managed to successfully breastfeed him for 15 months, but with many more complications than I experienced with my second and third children. Hospital nurseries need to be gotten rid of, except for in emergencies. Babies should be immediately given to their mothers and encouraged to nurse, rather than taken away to be bathed and measured. There will be time for that after the mother and baby have had their time to meet each other and initiate nursing. Furtermore, the overuse of drugs to induce labor and control pain negatively effects the success rates of vaginal births, and a woman who gives birth with a cesearean section is statistically more likely to have difficulty breastfeeding. The WHO suggests a c-section rate of 10%, but the rate in the US is over 30%, and climbing. 90% of women use pain relief, not because they can&apos;t handle the pain but because the hospitals don&apos;t allow them to birth in ways that allow them to manage their pain. All of this is directly related to the inability of many women to successfully breastfeed. Freestanding birth centers staffed by Certified Professional Midwives should be available in every state, rather than being illegal in 11 states, and hospitals should be required to change their practices to be breastfeeding friendly. Hospitals should quit handing out packages of formula, and formula companies should not be allowed to make such donations. Things need to change!!!!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care It was very important to me to attend classes on holistic childbirth, breastfeeding basics, and newborn care prior to the birth of my daughter. Each of these courses reinforced the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and child in terms of bodily health, emotional happiness saving money. It also helped that our insurance reimbursed us for part of the cost of the program.

When my friend mentioned her nursing, the doctor was befuddled and told her &quot;Well, it&apos;s not like you making milk.&quot; You would hope to not have to inform your own doctor of something so basic. Instead, it would help to feel that your doctor was up-to-date for this century.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have had two experiences with child birth and attempting to breastfeed my baby while in the hospital. The births were in the same hospital, however the second time around there was an automatic consultation with a licensed lactation consultant, organized lactation consultant programs, and a 24 hour hotline to call for advice after discharge. My first child did not latch, and my second is currently breastfeeding at 9 months of age. It is imperative for hospitals to have licensed lactation consultants on staff in addition to the nurses trained in latching techniques. It was an important factor in my success in breastfeeding my second child.

 Paid Maternity Leave This is one of the -if not the single- most important way in which governments and companies can support breastfeeding mothers and their families. A six to eight week leave is hardly adequate to restore a mother&apos;s health fully to return to work, much less establish a solid foundation for long-term breastfeeding. It risks jeopardizing both the health of the family and the effectiveness of the woman at work.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media I think that portrayal of breastfeeding in traditional popular media and new electronic media would help society realize that breastfeeding is (and has always been) a natural part of life. It is not obscene and certainly should not be viewed as offensive. The portrayal of women&apos;s breasts as sexual objects is ubiquitous in every form of media.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Prenatal: Better education is needed. I was committed to BFing, but the prenatal classes I took didn&apos;t really help, even the one specifically on BFing. Instead of drawings of latch, real pictures or videos are needed (this would help with the idea that it&apos;s not obscene, too). Better yet, have an infant and mom in the class. The classes also need to be upfront about the possibility for main at the beginning. I thought something was wrong and kept arguing with my delivery nurses because the class has said &quot;if your doing it right, it won&apos;t hurt&quot;. Well, it might for a while! I think people are more likely to quit if they have false expectations. Classes should address the mental aspect of BFing. 1 - Mom&apos;s mental state affects supply and the baby. 2 - Mom is needed almost constantly for several months. Don&apos;t assume everyone pumps. I am lucky to be an at-home mom, my baby is 5 months old and I haven&apos;t pumped yet. The large portion of my class on pumps was a waste of time for me. Since the birth I have been told by several people (professionals) that I &quot;have&quot; to pump (as a solution for baby&apos;s sleep, my sleep, etc). Why do I have to?

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care More breastfeeding education is needed during prenatal care. I wish I had known more about breastfeeding prior to having my baby. I did not buy any bottles, no pump, nothing. I assumed I would breastfeed. I went to a La Leche League while I was pregnant and everyone talked about birth.
I get home with my baby and a few days go by with both of us struggling with breastfeeding. I called the La Leche representative, and she let me know that she would not come to my home to help me. She asked me if I was left-handed or right-handed and then gave me tips that I had already read in The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. I am very disappointed to discover that La Leche is not supportive of women who struggle to breastfeed. Where I live in rural South Carolina, they are on the fringe, and are not doing any outreach to integrate into mainstream. This is very unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that La Leche and the medical world are at odds with one another. They need to join forces. So what if techniques are different?
I called the lactation consultant who did come to my house to help me. She watched me struggle with feeding my baby and at the end said that I may not have enough breast tissue to generate breast milk. My baby lost too much weight by the time the lactation consultant came to my house. The doctor almost sent us to the hospital.
So, me and my family went into emergency mode to get bottles, formula, and a pump. I continued trying to feed and to use the pump, but I never expressed enough milk. After 11 weeks of trying, I decided that my time would be better spent loving my baby and being relaxed around her.
I was working full time while I was pregnant and after talking to some colleagues, I found out that this was pretty common. I feel that first time mothers, especially ones who work full-time, do not know what they need to do to breast feed successfully.
I think that doctors can point pregnant women to good, viable resources - support groups and lactation consultants whose primary goal is for mothers and babies to successfully breastfeed. I live in a rural area and could have driven to a better quality lactation consultant and support group 45 minutes away, but I want it here, in my community.
Now, I am continually bombarded with how much better breastfeeding is. I also know that I am being criticized for formula feeding my baby. I tried, and I know many other mothers who tried but were not successful Getting us BEFORE we have the baby would, in my opinion, be the best solution.
I hope that this helps.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The practice of allowing infant formula manufacturers to provide free samples directly to new mothers in the hospitals is one of the things that reduces the rate of mothers choosing to breastfeed, as it undermines their confidence, and can lead to a reduction in milk production. What other aspect of hospitalization allows a private manufacturer to provide samples of their product without strict quality control and tracking measures in place? Why are formula salespeople allowed direct access to supplies in hospitals???

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) I feel that the only way we are truly going to make progress in the promotion of breastfeeding is to increase support services and funding for breastfeeding supplies. Without financial backing, not only do women not have the ability to purchase supplies that enhance breastfeeding, but support services can not exist.
Personally, I am a Registered Nurse who is sitting for IBCLC examination in July and trying to establish professional and community support systems for breastfeeding mothers. However, since there is currently no reimbursement for these services, it is difficult to justify my time, salary and equipment expences.
I have been working with the local WIC agency to initiate a Peer Counselor program but this will only address the needs of mothers who qualify for WIC. There are so many other mothers who need lactation services who are un-insured and can not afford to pay visit fees or have insurance but the insurance companies do not provide lactation coverage.
I feel that many individual groups are doing what they can to help breastfeeding mothers, but until there is significant financial reimbursement available to breastfeeding mothers and professionals, we will be limited on our ability to collectively impact breastfeeding outcomes.

 Paid Maternity Leave I am appalled at the statistical data surrounding the United States&apos; position on paid maternity leave. We are supposedly one of the greatest nations in the world - the country where millions risk life and limb to come to for a better life - and yet we continue to fail our own.
Our failure to provide for the basic needs for weakest of our society (our newborns and infants)could be considered a case for neglect and child endangerment. The US is consciously and willfully allowing substandard nutrition that has been shown to increase the risk of long-term health problems - not to mention the amount of debt incured to society as a result.
The millions of health care dollars spent each year on managing the illnesses that could have been avoided by breastfeeding could more than provide some form of financial relief to allow mothers to stay home and care for their nursing newborns rather than transitioning to formula at the end of a few weeks to months.
Many feel that pumping breastmilk is a viable option for working mothers, but since there is no coverage for breastfeeding supplies by insurance companies (if you&apos;re lucky enough to have insurance, many women are attempting to use ineffective &quot;affordable&quot; breastpumps which ultimately leads to a decrease in milk supply and early weaning. This does not even address those issues such as: finding time to pump at work, finding a sanitary place to pump, ensuring that you have adequate storage/refrigeration for your expressed breastmilk, and finding a daycare that will support your decision to provide breastmilk to your baby while you are at work.
I would also like to have you consider how keeping mothers in the home for even the first 6 months would affect our children&apos;s cognitive and social development and behavioral patterns. The mother is the one who first teaches the essential skills in life. Many times we must look back in order to move forward. Consider the values and manners of the generations that grew up with stay at home mothers and then look at children and teenagers today. The only way to instill the core values in our children that have prided us to call ourselves Americans, is for a parent to be able to stay at home and teach through example. A child CAN NOT learn these values from a daycare center.
Surely we can do better!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I strongly encourage the US to become compliant with the WHO Code! Our failure to comply with the international code has put our children at increased risk for some of life&apos;s most invasive and preventable health disparities.
One of our greatest travisties is the negation of the impact formula &quot;gift bags&quot; have on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding. In the first few weeks after discharge, new mothers already question their ability to provide adequate milk to their babies and often resort to supplementation as a means of ensuring a &quot;healthy baby&quot;.
In addition to this, because more women are required to work outside the home, we have started to lose our ability to effectively parent and console crying infants. Mothers assume that if they have breastfed their baby, and the baby continues to cry, then the baby must still be hungry and promptly offers formula from the &quot;gift bag&quot; rather than trying calming techniques to soothe the baby.
Because of our maternity practices, lack of financial/insurance support,lack of primary care provider education, and failure to comply with the WHO Code, we are setting mothers up to fail.

Although I don&apos;t watch much TV, I can think of very few times when I have seen or heard references to breastfeeding within programming or on commercials. By making nursing and discussions about nursing become part of everyday life for more people, nursing may start to be viewed as the &quot;normal&quot; thing that mothers do and could make people feel more comfortable with the idea in general. Also, Americans tend to regard scientific information highly and feel scientific proof validates their actions. By appealing to this aspect of the American psyche as well as educating the public about the benefits of nursing, breastfeeding advocates may be able to help Americans to consider nursing as the best option, as it has been proven to be most beneficial for both babies and mothers.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I have 4 children spanning the ages of 13 and 3. During that time, I can confirm that the support for and way of thinking about breastfeeding has changed for the better. However, there is much more that needs to be done. I nursed all 4 of my children, although the length of time varied depending on my support structure in each instance. Hospitals and medical providers must still do a better job in supporting mothers who choose to breastfeed. With my first child, I did not know the importance of keeping a regular schedule in regards to my own nourishment and staying hydrated. Confounding that was my lack of experience with breastfeeding, causing me to stop when my child was only about 4 months old.
When I had my second through fourth child, I was considered a &quot;seasoned veteran&quot;. However, my children were all 3 and 4 years apart. With each child I often felt as if I was breastfeeding for the first time, especially during the first 6 months. It was very difficult for those first 6 months, dealing with trying to increase my supply, as well as with soreness and lack of sleep, while returning to work after 6 or 8 weeks.
While the hospitals I delivered at did provide lactation consultation, it really only consisted of providing literature and occasionally attempting to help my baby latch on and stay on, which was always challenging. Then, going home after 2 days in the hospital, I was pretty much on my own. If it weren&apos;t for my own resolve and determination, I probably would have given up.
It would have been really helpful to have more support during the first 6 months for mothers of newborns, but it still does not exist today. There needs to be better support from the healthcare providers, hospitals and insurance plans.
My OB simply asked if how I was planning to feed my baby, but that was all I got. I always mentioned it to all my other physicians (internist, dermatologist, allergist, dentist, etc.) but they never asked. The hospital only supported me during my two-day stay and that&apos;s it. It&apos;s no wonder so many mothers give up so easily!

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression The lack of worksite lactation support astounds me, especially considering the fact that I work in a hospital, and have always worked in healthcare settings. While my current employer has 2 private lactation rooms located in the nursery, it is not convenient since I work off-site away from the hospital where the rooms are located. I am in a building across the street from where the hospital is located, and thankfully, am no longer breastfeeding.
Since I have 4 children, and different workplace experiences, as well as different personal situations, with each child, I can tell you that being able to be close in proximity to your baby enhances the ability to continue breastfeeding successfully.
With my first child, when I returned to work after six weeks of leave, I attempted to pump breast milk while at work. My breastfeeding experience only lasted about four months.
With my second child, I planned on pumping breast milk when I returned to work after seven weeks of leave. But, because my mother was able to bring my baby to me every afternoon, I only needed to pump once in the morning and then I would feed in the afternoon (in the car). After my child turned two, I began to wean her off so she would only nurse in the morning and in the evening. But even still, she nursed until she was three.
With my third child, I also nursed her until she was about three. However, I pumped and stored milk for her for daytime feedings and nursed her when I was home in the morning and evenings. I was able to use a small storage room that had a lock, a table and some chairs.
With my fourth child, I planned on pumping and storing milk for him for daytime feedings, but since I work minutes away from home, I used my lunch hour to go home and nurse. I was able to keep this up for about 2 years before weaning him off completely.
Had I not had easy access to my children from work and/or access to a private room for pumping, I likely would not have been able to continue nursing for as long as I did.
While my current work location does not have designated accommodations for pumping, the management is usually understanding in allowing employees to take time to pump.
Onsite childcare would definitely enhance the ability of working mothers to nurse. And while I work for a hospital, I think it&apos;s odd that there isn&apos;t more consideration for their employees who are working mothers (in regards to ensuring there is a designated area for expression).

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings While I was able to successfully breastfeed my children, the lack of support in public settings made it very difficult. Most times, I resorted to just nursing in my car. But that isn&apos;t always possible.
The only public places I&apos;ve found that have given any decent consideration to nursing mothers are large shopping malls, especially Westfield. When I was nursing, I did not go on any lengthy outings with my kids unless I thought there would be accommodations for me to nurse. While amusement parks and some malls claim to have nursing rooms, they are appalling. One mall in my city had a room that had no temperature control (it was over 84 degrees in the room) and no way to ventilate, other than opening the door, which negated the privacy. When I visited Sea World in San Diego last year, the nursing/family room I found was just outside a smoky barbecue restaurant. The room was also not well ventilated and hot. I tried to nurse with the door open, but all the smoke came in. When I tried to lock the door, it was hot and stuffy and other families banged on the door because they wanted to change their child&apos;s diaper (the room was also a diaper-changing station). The chair for nursing was not private.
Nursing requires a cool environment (two bodies against each other makes for a very warm situation), as well as one that is private and allows for adequate time without being rushed. It can take at least 20 minutes just to feed, not counting burping and diaper changing time.
The lack of thought to the accommodations strikes me as odd, but then, I just think that it must be men who&apos;ve designed them, without any female input. I guess I should have considered myself lucky to have any accommodations at all, but then I just got angry that family destinations did not consider the entire family at all.
Most nursing accommodations seem like an afterthought to me, except for places like Babies R Us which provides comfortable accommodations, as well as diapers for their customers, and Westfield. These places deserve kudos.
The attitude of people towards breastfeeding needs to change as well. Most of the women I work with think breastfeeding is a nuisance and some think it&apos;s just &quot;gross&quot;. Most of these women also have children themselves. Because of attitudes of people, and because of my own modesty, I tried to keep my breastfeeding as private as possible. There needs to be sweeping change in this regard.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support It is apparent that the US govt. believes it can provide immediate, low cost BF support by investing in the Peer counselor program of WIC. As a professional Lactation Consultant,read IBCLC, I want you to know that the WIC PC program does not work. I spent more than 5 years of my life working as a PC, begging for more training, begging for more work hours, insisting on being reimbursed for my expenses. I had to seek out my own sources of information, motivate myself to continue to go above and beyond the WIC idea of BF, at my own expense in both time and money.
Oh yes, there are supposed to be Federal rules that must be followed, but when individual states leave the inforcement of these rules up to individuals whom do not value BF or care about the hardship of one PCs life, these rules go right out the window. There is not active supervision of PCs; there are no professional lactation consultants to go to with problems; there is no value placed upon BF, as compared to formula (which is obviously the bread earner at WIC); there is no consistency in advice given to clients; there is no future for a PC. PCs are simply seen as a vehicle by which to qualify for large amounts of grant money. The US govt. has no intentions to train IBCLCs via the vehicle of PCing. It has been stated, in writing, that they (US Govt) do not expect to fund any programs which utilize PC money for hiring or training IBCLCs.
Even when one is able to jump through all the hoops provided by WIC management, for many years, at a rate of pay that is well below the poverty level, and is successful in self educating herself to qualify to sit the IBCLC exam, there is no reward...other than loosing my PC job.
Even as an IBCLC, there are no jobs available for non-rn IBCLCs. The local WIC director values the one year education of her LVN over the master&apos;s level education I possess, simply because the LVN is a health related degree. No matter that her LVN can&apos;t spell correctly or even use correct verb tenses, she has that all important &quot;nurse&quot; title. Dr.s could care less that you have the ability to assist them and their clients. In fact, some, like the head of Peds at a local hospital, made it a personal goal of his to prevent me from ever working within the community. This is the reward obtained for providing evidence based care to clients who are told to stop BF and use formula to treat normal levels of jaundice. You cannot expect financially struggling individual IBCLCs to take on the political and financial powerhouses that doctors represent.
Why isn&apos;t there BF support after hospital discharge? Because not many women can survive the minefield that becoming IBCLC necessitates. So you are left with all the nurses that become IBCLC in an attempt to increase their paychecks. The same nurses that would not risk the stability of their paycheck to change the hospital system, which so clearly does not work.
If you want to see BF increases in society, you must, first of all, be able to provide the services of professional lactation consultants, ie IBCLCs. Why should a professional work under the conditions prevalent in US society? You get what you pay for. And as long as the US Government continues to fund BF through the vehicle of WIC, all you will get are temporary PCs.
When you get serious about BF support and protection, IBCLCs will be sought out for their expertise, experience, and education. There will be a BF clinic in every small town in America, and children will be able to reap the normal byproducts of being fed their own mother&apos;s milk. As long as you continue to give away free formula, the US will face an ever increasing health crisis and its children will continue to pay the high price that the pharmaceutical companies who make formula demand.

 Use of Banked Human Milk It would be helpful to address the use and donation of banked milk with new mothers who are already showing an interest in breastfeeding, perhaps with the information the hospital hands out about lactation consultants. I pumped far more than my baby could use and only found out about donating milk through a craigslist posting, by a new mother of twins who was looking for donations. Addressing this topic early, by a medical professional may take some of the &quot;weird&quot; factor away. I talked about the idea with a friend who reminded me that we drink another species&apos; milk everyday before I could get over that &quot;weird&quot; factor.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I utilized a Lactation Consultant after returning home with my new baby. My hospital had LCs on staff but you could not meet with them after leaving the hospital, and my milk had hardly come in before I left, I had no time to develop problems yet! Luckily, I had the resources to pay for this visit but I believe that breastfeeding should be an option for everybody. Perhaps in conjunction with routine prenatal care the issue of whether these visits, or the purchase of a breast pump for use once the mother returns to work, is covered by insurance, or at least encouraging women to determine this information before giving birth, would encourage more women to continue breastfeeding.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I found myself as a breastfeeding Mom scrambling to find a safe, public place to feed. Lots of times, in malls, I would occupy the changing rooms of department stores. One time only, I fed my baby in line for santas photo, he had a blanket over his head of course! It would be great if more public places had areas for BF moms-- like airports and restaurants.

 Other Areas One of the main areas that needs work is the educating doctors on the subject of breastfeeding. Make sure they know ALL there is to know about it and stay up to date on new information that comes out. Many times doctors provide false information or simply don&apos;t know the correct answer. They jump to formula use way to quickly, instead of offering ways to increase milk production, make it fattier, or just making sure the mom is breastfeeding correctly. They need to know what meds are safe too, so they&apos;re not telling a mom she needs to wean, when she really doesn&apos;t. Most meds are perfectly safe to take while breastfeeding. The same goes with alcohol-safe to drive, equals safe to nurse. Educating mothers on breastfeeding would also help. Starting this early on in prenatal care would be fantastic. Also, requiring all procedures to be done in the birthing suite, near the mom and to make sure she gets to nurse her baby w/ in the first hour of its life. Also, the hospital should be REQUIRED to get permission before giving ANYTHING to the baby. Whether that be a bottle, formula, pacifire, etc...At the hospital I just delivered at, they gave my daughter a bottle of formula w/ out my prior consent and we&apos;re still struggling a little because of that. All hospitals should be pro breastfeeding and support that above and beyond/before formula.

 Paid Maternity Leave Not only should maternity leave be paid, but the restrictions on length of employment before leave eligibility should be removed, and the length of leave extended to at least a year. As our popluation shrinks familys should be encouraged to have children and to raise them properly. The structure of our family unit has changed there are many more double income homes, but that does not remove the importance of a mother and child being together durring the first year; for physical and mental well being of both the mother and child. The short unpaid maternity leave is immoral and degrading to the basic structure of our society. Sadly our buisnesses do not recognize this, and in the search for lower bottom lines search for ways to undercut the family unit rather than to help promote a more stable future.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression There definitely needs to be a proper pumping area at all employers. Regardless of available space, all employers should be required to have a private, clean space with a sink and trash can in which to pump. This type of sanctuary is necessary to continue being able to breastfeed once returning to work. Also onsite child care would be idle but I&apos;m sure that would be near impossible to make the companies have due to insurance and health requirements.

 Paid Maternity Leave European countries offer a year of maternity leave! Let&apos;s look at their system and copy that. I am in New Jersey and until this year, only 6 weeks of paid leave was avaialble to vaginal delivery moms. This is just way too early for any baby let alone a breastfeeding baby.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media I find the fact that breastfeeding isn&apos;t in mainstream media appaling. It is hard to fight the trends that are on the television shows, and the fact that on nearly every show in which a woman gives birth the child is given a bottle, we who choose to breastfeed are looked at as the outcasts. Eventhough before the 1950&apos;s breastfeeding was the norm in this country, it is now looked at as dirty or inappropriate. Just recently the social networking sites had to revise their policies because they were not allowing women to post pictures of nursing their babies due to it being considered inappropriate. It makes it even more challenging to continue to breastfeed when you add these social obsticles.

I AM A 21 YEAR OLD SINGLE MOTHER OF A BABY GIRL SYRIANA REYNOLDS, THAT WILL BE 8 MONTHS OLD ON THE 23RD. WHILE I WAS PREGNANT DURING THE YEAR IN 2008 I WAS IN A PROGRAM CALLED “ SMART START”. IT’S A PROGRAM THAT HELPS MOTHERS WITH EATING HABITS, GOING TO KEEP DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS, AND TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO BREASTFEED WHICH IS ONE OF THERE MAIN CONCERNS. AFTER MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED AT CHRIS TANA FOR A FEW DAYS AND TRANSFER ED TO A.I. DUPONT IN WILMINGTON,DE DUE TO A DEADLY BACTERIAL INFECTION IN HER BLOOD AND A BLOCKAGE IN HER INTESTINES. SHE ALSO HAD FLUID ON THE BRAIN, AN UPPER RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, AND A HEART MURMUR. THE DAY SHE TURNED A WEEK OLD SHE HAD HER FIRST SURGERY TO REMOVE THE BLOCKAGE. AFTER THAT SHE HAD AN ILEOSTOMY BAG FOR 6-8 WEEKS AND A PORTION OF HER INTESTINES REMOVED. ON NOVEMBER 19TH SHE HAD HER SECOND SURGERY TO HAVE THE INTESTINES RECONNECTED, IN WHICH ANOTHER PORTION WAS REMOVE FROM HER INTESTINES. DURING THIS TIME, I WAS UNABLE TO BREAST FEED HER, SO THE ONLY THING I COULD DO WAS PUMP AND STORE, SO THAT SHE GOT THE NUTRIENTS SHE NEEDED WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO EAT AGAIN.THE ONLY THING SHE GOT IN THE BEGINGING WAS THE BREAST-MILK. AFTER SHE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL, NOVEMBER 27,2008 , SYRIANA HAD CAME HOME ON “PREGESTIMIL” FORMULA. AT THE WIC APPOINTMENT THE BREAST PUMP THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME WAS TAKING AWAY, BECAUSE SYRIANA NEEDED THIS SPECIAL MILK DUE TO HER ILLNESS. I DIDN’T UNDERSTAND WHY. NO ONE NEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE BORN LIKE THIS OR WITH ANY TYPE OF COMPLICATIONS. THE ONLY WAY I GOT TO KEEP THE PUMP WAS FOR THEM TO DECREASE HER FORMULA THAT I WAS GETTING. I WAS ENJOYING BEING ABLE TO PUMP THE MILK TO GIVE TO HER. I FEEL LIKE I WAS DONE UNJUSTIFIED, BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ASKS YOU TO BREASTFEED ,OR THEY ENCOURAGE IT, BUT TOOK THE TOOL AWAY I NEEDED THE MOST TO DO SO. EVERY SINCE THEN I WOULD SEE THE COMMERCIALS ADVERTISING TO BREASTFEED, AND HERE I AM WITH A CHILD WITH INTESTINAL PROBLEMS AND GETTING TOLD THAT’S THE BEST THING FOR HER AND I GET TREATED LIKE THIS. I FEEL AS THOUGH THEY SHOULD HAVE TOOK IN TO CONSIDERATION ABOUT MY CHILD&apos;S HEALTH, AND WHAT SHE WAS AND IS STILL DEALING WITH KNOW. EVEN WHEN I SEE OTHER MOTHERS OR MY SISTER STILL BEING ABLE TO BREASTFEED THEIR CHILD IT HURTS ME DEARLY, BECAUSE I NEVER GOT TO EXPERIENCE IT. I’M WRITING AND TELLING YOU ABOUT MY STORY, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING ELSE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BESIDES JUST DENYING A MOTHER OR THE BABY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOND THROUGH BREASTFEEDING. I JUST DONT WANT ANOTHER MOTHER TO THROUGH WHAT I DID IF EVER THEY WERE PUT INTO A SITUATION LIKE MINES. I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED IN A BTTER MANNER.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences I believe the government has totally lost sight of the fact that WIC was designed to be a NUTRITION program. When the federal govt. actively promotes the distribution of such an inferior product as artificial baby milk, they cannot promote and protect breastfeeding from within the same agency.
Furthermore, don&apos;t you realize that WIC personnel are not particularly representative of the message they are supposed to serve? If you took a survey of WIC workers, you would undoubtedly find that at least 75%, if not more, are overweight. How can you expect the public to follow the advice of someone who does not eat well in their own life? That&apos;s a bit like hiring a lawyer who is in jail, or a doctor who is an alcoholic and smokes, or a teacher who has been convicted of injury to a child.
Get formula out of WIC! Tremendous savings to the american taxpayer. If women can choose not to breastfeed, they can choose to pay for formula, on their own. If they are truly unable to afford formula, they can use food stamps.
If WIC continues at all, it should get back to nutrition. As it stands today, WIC is benefitting formula companies, and not women and children. Call it what it is - an affair between the dairy industry and the US government. It is doing more harm than good and at a tremendous cost to the taxpayer. Clean up your act, or at the very least, quit trying to pretend that breastfeeding is supported, and admit that you are in bed with formula companies!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Near the end of my first pregnancy, I developed a dangerous condition and ended up having a c-section under general anesthesia followed by several days of magnesium sulfate. Both my baby and I were dazed for several days and had trouble establishing a breastfeeding relationship. I ended up pumping and bottle-feeding for 6 weeks until I finally learned enough on my own to get my baby to latch properly. I am still breastfeeding 18 months later, but it was a huge struggle that could have been avoided with better hospital support.
In particular:
* Hospitals should provide enhanced support to mothers who require medication/monitoring after birth. These mothers may need help timing feeding attempts (it&apos;s hard to do this on your own when you&apos;re in a haze from medication), as well as help getting extra-sleepy babies to latch. Furthermore, care should be taken to ensure that they receive good lactation support even when assigned to special monitoring rooms outside the normal post-partum units.
* Nurses should not use normal baby weight loss after birth to pressure mothers to give formula in the first two days, when they are trying to get breastfeeding to work
* Hospital nurseries should not give formula without the consent of a parent -- especially not before allowing the mother to attempt to breastfeed
* Nurses should encourage skin-to-skin contact between mothers and newborns instead of triple swaddling them (and whisking them away to heat lamps at the slightest concern).
* Nipple shields should not be given for latch problems without explaining the potential dangers to milk supply
* Mothers who do not achieve a good latch before being discharged should be offered a hospital-grade baby scale to monitor weight and feeding amounts so that problems can be addressed before milk supply crashes
* Nurses and lactation consultants need more training in supporting breastfeeding efforts by very large-breasted women. The standard textbook approaches don&apos;t work, but there are many successful techniques out there that do.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I noticed a lot of comments from people asking for lactation rooms at stores and shopping malls. While this is a nice idea and some moms/baby enjoy a quiet environment for nursing, I think it still supports the viewpoint that breastfeeding must be done behind closed doors. The better solution is to support breastfeeding in public. Perhaps showing it on TV a little more to gain public support.
I&apos;ve personally nursed two babies - each until after they age of 2. When I was pregant with my first I accepted the &quot;free diaper bags&quot; from my ob/gyn and the hospital because it was &quot;free&quot;. I never had any intention of using the formula and donated them to the food bank. With my second child I flat out told the hospital and my OB that I would not accept the formula companies propoganda and refused my &quot;free bag&quot;. I was told I was the first person to do that.
I understand that it is not possible to stop the formula companies from marketing thier products, but perhaps for every free sample they hand out they also have to contribute to a breastfeeding advocacy fund. But then again &quot;Breatfeeding is best - compliments of Similac&quot; is similar to &quot;Stop smoking now - compliments of Phillip Morris&quot;. (I understand it&apos;s not an equal comparison, but you get the idea).

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I am a breastfeeding mother, as well as a full time nurse that works at the hospital. I float to 8 different med surg units of the hospital for 12 hour night shifts 3 times a week. The most difficult part about pumping breastmilk for my child is that there is not always a place to pump that is sanitary or that has a working electrical outlet. The hospital I work at provides a pumping room on the 1st floor but it takes almost 10 minutes to get there from other areas in the hospital that I work in. I am only able to pump three times a night and be away from my patients for 10 minutes each time. Its so hard to get away to pump when you have a busy night with patients who need you. I have been back to work from maternity leave now for about 3 wks. I feel like when I am at work I have to work twice as hard to get the milk I need for my baby. I definitly belive it is worth it but I see why so many mothers give up. It takes a lot of dedication and you really have to believe in what you are doing and why you are doing it.

 Paid Maternity Leave I believe that significant paid maternity is the very most important factor in increasing breast-feeding rates nationwide. I would urge you to compare US breastfeeding rates to those in Canada and other similar societies that provide significantly more paid maternity leave. It doesn&apos;t make sense to tell women that it is important to breastfeed and not provide them the means of doing so. Obviously one important condition for being able to breastfeed is that of being able to be with one&apos;s baby. It is true that it is possible to pump milk in the workplace but there are several problems with this: 1. Few workplaces, especially those employing people in blue color and service sector jobs, provide appropriate support for this. 2. Women who choose to pump often end up being able to spend LESS time with their babies, since their workday is extended by their pumping breaks. 3. Expressing milk and feeding it to a baby with a bottle does not realize all of the benefits of breastfeeding.
Thanks for your consideration.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Several current practices impact the establishment of breastfeeding. The high rate of induced labor increases the cesarean section rate. It is incredible that we have c-section rates above 30% in many hospitals.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Somehow hospitals need to get formula companies out of their facilities. As long as formula is a free, far too easily accessable item, staff, physicians and new parents will continue to use and abuse it. The overwhelming research that supports that breastfeeding infants is the best nutritional option and then to make formula so easily accessable is sending the wrong message. Formula is needed in some cases but should have to be ordered by a physician not because mother wants to rest or staff doesn&apos;t want to bother mother with feeding. I feel formula should be a prescription item or at least require mother to sign a consent that she has been educated in the risks to her infant with giving formula.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Stronger language on the expectation that healthcare providers must promote, support and protect is necessary. Identification of the need for all healthcare personnel to be responsive to the need from the CEO to the enviroment staff. They should all receive education and demonstrate supportive behaviors for breastfeeding. Evaluation of these behaviors needs to start at unit levels and be reported on quarterly within the organization administration and annually within the state. Federal evaluation of the state performance should occur every 5 years and be published. This support needs to have a monetary value in cost to the organizations and benefits to the health of the public to include projections for 5, 10 and 25 years ahead. Since govenment places so much value on dollars and cents, there must be some recognition of how many dollars will be saved if breastfeeding becomes the standard of care. If we could find a way to include formula in the same catagory of other medication, we could force the issue of it being by prescription only. Since it is created in a laboratory, by pharmaceutical companies, this seems a logical connection. A stronger media campaign should be designed and supported by the government with a clear prevention of formula lobbists from stopping information getting to the public. All efforts should be made to enforce the International Code of Marketing Breast-Milk Substitutes. Too many American women continue to believe that formula is as good as breast milk.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Thoughts for prenatal breastfeeding outreach: Many mothers no longer take childbirth or other prenatal classes where breastfeeding has traditionally been taught. Prenatal care providers may be helped to discuss breastfeeding with a set of core knowledge regarding breastfeeding and a script for discussion and answering of questions and concerns. Faith based organizations can host community &quot;baby showers&quot; where breastfeeding is presented. Support for a national breastfeeding promotion campaign sponsored by Best for Babes (a non-profit breastfeeding organization) can be supported in their efforts to make breastfeeding more mainstream and reach young mothers at their level. More prenatal breastfeeding information could be disseminated through electronic media (mothering blogs, email alerts, text messaging, social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
Hospital support may be improved by repeating the mPINC survey with follow-up. Massachusetts conducted a breastfeeding summit, inviting the hospital administrators to learn about best practices and how to implement them. More targeted interventions for administrators should be planned with regional conference aimed at changing hospital practices. We also formed a collaborative of hospitals with certificates of intent or those interested in changing practice. State and regional collaboratives may be helpful in effecting change. Joint Commission should be supported to make exclusive breastfeeding a core measure that is addressed during hospital assessments.
Post-discharge care is vital and needs to be covered by third party payers. More should be done in regards to exploring pay for performance measures with insurers.

 Paid Maternity Leave Many mothers stop breastfeeding or prematurely introduce formula because they have to go back to work at 12 weeks postpartum, or sooner. Breastfeeding can be better supported through a longer leave of maternity with a partial paid leave. The return of investment of a healthy breastfed baby and healthy breastfeeding mother would almost even out the cost of a partially paid maternity leave. Offer incentives for families who do breastfeed their baby with a longer maternity leave, these babies save money in the long run on sick days, doctor visits, and chronis disease.

 Use of Banked Human Milk Pasteurized donor milk for premature and high risk infants has been shown to reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and infection, resulting in shorter hospital stays. Healthcare providers should educate mothers who are unable to provide breastmilk for their own infants about the use of banked human milk. In order to provide a safe product and maintain the maximum active beneficial components, banked milk should only be processed and dispensed in accordance with the Guidelines from the Human Milk Banking Association of North America.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Businesses today are continually looking for ways to improve the health and productivity of their workforce. Breastfeeding support in the workplace can offer a considerable benefit to employers by lowering healthcare cost, increasing employee satisfaction and retention and improving corporate image. Education needs to be provided to employers explaining that supporting lactation in the workplace is one way to address the health needs of working women and to improve staff performance. Employers should be encouraged to develop worksite lactation support programs and policies. These policies should include providing a private place, with electricity, for women to express milk and a place to adequately store breast milk. Other considerations would include providing adequate breaks during the day, flexible schedules and onsite childcare facilities.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends Research has shown that peer support, in group or individual settings, has been effective in increasing breastfeeding initiation and duration rates. Training is a necessary component of peer support and should include basic breastfeeding management, counseling techniques, and criteria for making referrals. Peer counselors should be mentored and clinically monitored by a professional in lactation support such as an IBCLC, nurse or nutritionist. Evidence supports that paid peer counselors are more effective than volunteer peer counselors. The WIC Breastfeeding Peer Counseling program is an example of peer support that includes the training and supervision components, with paid peer counselors making contacts by telephone, in the home or in the clinical setting.

We are also not supposed to bring them to events we have outside of school hours. Us mothers have talked, and we would feel much better about taking care of other people&apos;s kids, if we could also have ours here to take care of. Not having our babies near us, make us less patient in the classroom and in a hurry to get home instead of putting our best efforts into our work.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care As you know the support and current challenges of exclusive breastfeeding is multifaceted. As a bedside nurse, a RPPC regional nurse educator, and seeing what family and friends are doing, I am glad to see that we are reassessing what can be done to more positively impact exclusive breastfeeding. Below is a list of what I have pondered:
• A better organized and more consistent assessment of the breastfeeding requisites of all pregnant women during the prenatal period by OBGYN/trained Staff. • Increased educational support by perinatal staff in OBGYN offices. This could provide a more positive environment for patients and allow a time to reflect about the benefits of breastfeeding their infant, fortify their position and commitment to breastfeeding, and to provide tools for successful breastfeeding. This can also be a time to identify challenges like flat/inverted nipples, medications…..so forth • “All pregnant women” should be offered a referral by their physician to a “free” community based breastfeeding class during their 3rd trimester. The class should focus on benefits, challenges, general latching techniques, the “hospital stay” and first few months of infant’s life. • We need to continue to strongly support and educate hospital staff (including physicians) to learn how to better support exclusive breastfeeding. • We need to have more experienced lactation support in the hospitals • We need to limit the sublime message formula manufacturer’s are sending to the public, “formula is of equal or better nutrition to breast-milk.” • We need to have more public information announcements and other venues that support breastfeeding and to impact the culture at large. • We need to establish community based breastfeeding clubs for women to support each other in their communities. • We need to have resources from various government agencies to support exclusive breastfeeding.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Other than having paid maternity leave and not returning to work while breastfeeding, on-site child care is a good option so the mother can visit the baby often and breastfeed whenever the baby needs to eat. Pumping is so labor intensive and often fails to adequately stimulate and maintain a full milk supply. There is nothing like the baby! Of course, the third possibility to support breastfeeding is to have access to lactation rooms where mothers can pump. While not the best option, this also will encourage breast milk feedings to the baby for as long as possible.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Prenatally: continue to provide education and counseling for pregnant women on benefits of breastfeeding, including practical strategies for breastfeeding when returning to work.
Hospital: do not allow formula company freebies in discharge packs. Eliminate unnecessary interventions that compromise mother&apos;s health and infants ability to latch and suck (e.g. medications associated with epidurals, c-sections, etc...) Do not separate infants from their mothers after delivery unless medically necessary. This does not include routine newborn testing. That can be done in the room with mother and infant. Enforce hospital policies and parental wishes to not give glucos water or pacifiers to infants when they are separated from their mothers. Encourage, support and enable mothers of babies in NICU that cannot suckle to pump and provide breast milk, and work to establish breastfeeding as early as possible, even when infant is still in NICU.
Post-Delivery: Provide resources for lactation support, hotlines, home visiting, support for partners so they can support the mothers, emphasize that all babies feed differently.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I think it is important to empower women during pregnancy to make decisions concerning breastfeeding immediately after giving birth. This is a critical time for breastfeeding and women should know thier rights and not feel ashamed or afraid to begin breastfeeding in the hospital. Too many times, hospitals introduce formula or sugar water by a bottle to infants, which greatly reduces the ability for a new mother to breastfeed her baby. In addition, nurses should be trained to encourage breastfeeding and help mothers in the hospital to establish breastfeeding practices and address any latch on issues before the mother is sent home and discourage any supplementation in the hospital or at home.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I think it would be helpful for breast feeding rates if hospitals would NOT issue formula to parents. They are given a &quot;diaper bag&quot; that has a free sample of formula. If we make it seem that breast feeding is not important then moms don&apos;t make it their priority. If we have nurses @ the hospital giving a bottle when mom has specified that she wants to breast feed then that sabbotages her breast feeding and thus the child is left with a lesser food. Some seem to think formula is just as good as breast milk, however no body has been able to replicate breast milk and it is still the best food for infants up to the age of 1 yr.

As a nurse for over 40 years, the human body does not offend me in any way, but I do not believe we should impose our beliefs on others around us. The simple habit of draping a small blanket over the chest during breastfeeding, in my opinion, is sufficient to avoid making the situation uncomfortable. My experience in working with mothers and babies is that the baby usually likes having a &quot;little tent&quot; over them or caresses the blanket edges thus making for a calm and peaceful interaction with mother. A preferable place to induce a serene experience for baby is away from noise and crowded areas - their &quot;quiet time&quot;. But if it was choice between a stinky noisy bathroom and a quiet place in an airport waiting area, I would choose the waiting area.

When a community doesn&apos;t support mother&apos;s to BF it is difficult. Giving formula for mother&apos;s to take home just implies you can&apos;t do it.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression I think it is very important that we do not give the impression that women have to choose between working and breastfeeding. Unfortunately this is how our society operates today. With the help of the community and support of employers, women can do both and should be encouraged that both can be accomplished. Accomadations should be made for women who choose to breastfeed while working part or full time, including flexible work schedules and time to breastfeed or pump during work hours. Even though there are regulations in place to protect breastfeeding mothers in the workplace, I think it needs to be enocuraged instead of looked down upon by society and employers.

 Research and Surveillance &quot;Any&quot; breastfeeding is not the same as &quot;exclusive&quot; breastfeeding. Many states report having achieved the HP2010 goal of 75% breastfeeding initiation, but that is based on surveillance that considers a woman to have initiatied even if she put her baby on formula as soon as she left the hospital. We need to define breastfeeding as exclusively feeding an infant from the mother&apos;s breast. Feeding pumped breast milk is not the same as breastfeeding. We need to build questions into our surveys that distinguish between any breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding (like in NIS and PRAMS) and also distinguish between exclusively fed breastmilk (could include expressed) vs. exclusively fed milk from the mother&apos;s breast. We need to create goals for percent of babies that are exclusively fed from the mother&apos;s breast.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care In hospitals, I suggest that there be more training with nurses on the importance of breast feeding over bottle feeding. My experience with a nurse in the hospital, is that they are usually quick to feed newborn infants with bottled formula when babies are jaundice. Even at the insistence of the mother thaat she wanted to breast feed. I guess that the jaundice baby needs formula at this time, but should work with the mother who ic concerned about using the bottle to feed infants.

Unfortunately, I only have access to a limited amount of the population and cannot spread the word wide and far. From feedback my clients have given me, they are not receiving adequate information about breastfeeding throughout their pregnancies. I think it would be most helpful if there could be multiple points of exposure during the prenatal process for the mother to receive information on breastfeeding. Doctors and their staff need to be more equipped to provide education and answer questions about breastfeeding. The medical professionals working with the maternal and infant population need to be up to date and informed on the latest research and developments related to breastfeeding and the benefits for both mother and infant. The sharing of knowledge to our clients and patients falls on the shoulders of all health care professionals who come in contact and we need to do our part in sharing all the information we have.

 Paid Maternity Leave If the United States government really is serious about increasing breastfeeding rates, then the United States Government really needs to get serious about providing decent paid maternity and paternity leave for parents. The US lags all developed countries in terms of the leave provided. How can you seriously expect a woman to breastfed her infant when she has to go back to work when said infant is only 6 or 8 weeks old?
If all medical experts agree that breastfeeding is the best option for both mother and baby, then why isn&apos;t the US government doing anything to ensure that mothers and babies are together for at least the first six months of a child&apos;s life?
This effort is just empty promises and lip service unless significant long-term changes are made to how working mothers are treated. I&apos;m in no way hopeful that this will really change and in ten more years, the US government will be talking about how breastfeeding rates in the US are too low and must be increased. The only way that will ever happen is to ensure that mothers and babies can be together for at least the first six months without the mother being concerned about how the family will survive without her paycheck.

I have addressed my concern to many people (i.e. hospital lactation consultants, and HR). 3 weeks have passed and nothing has been done to label the room or find an alternative.

I&apos;ve met many staff that stated that the information on lactation during their course of study was brief.

 Other Areas If U.S. Breastfeeding were a business and I were the executive running it, I would start by identifying exactly what was keeping my product from gaining share against the competition (human milk substitutes). I would then develop action plans to address each inhibitor identified—and establish budgets, management and metrics linked to these plans. Here are my initial thoughts on the top five. 1. Formula is perceived as an acceptable substitute 2. Mothers and babies are separated (due primarily to employment needs) 3. Breastfeeding is perceived as inconvenient (or even oppressive) for mothers 4. There is insufficient for mothers to breastfeed (and stakeholders to help) 5. We lack a coordinated, consistent plan with accountability for breastfeeding promotion, protection and support A starter-set of actions against these inhibitors follows. This is incomplete, but helps illustrate my recommended approach. 1. (formula acceptable substitute) Reign in formula industry marketing tactics (truth in advertising) (tobacco model—engage healthcare industry). Reframe message—and create social groundswell (beyond health benefits—green, economical, emotional and social). Fund “breastfeeding sales force” (polished, educated and professional) to promote breastfeeding to key stakeholders (e.g. physicians, birthing centers, educators, mothers’ groups) (stop relying solely/primarily on volunteers). Develop irrefutable evidence (targeted research). Establish peer support/education system targeting specific populations/segments (stop relying primarily on volunteers). Join forces with existing organizations with shared vision/objectives (e.g. Komen foundation) 2. (separation of mothers/babies) Advocate for better maternity (and family) leave – paid leave with job protection—address legislators, private sector and general public. Join forces with existing organizations with shared vision/objectives (e.g. MomsRising). Study other breastfeeding-friendly countries/societies and identify practices that could be adopted in U.S. 3. (breastfeeding inconvient/oppressive) Establish peer support/education system targeting specific populations/segments (stop relying primarily on volunteers). Make formula less convenient (cost, accessibility). Make breastfeeding more convenient (nursing in public, widespread breastfeeding accommodation, workplace support). Reframe message—and create social groundswell (objective cost-benefit view, positive feminist message). Fund “breastfeeding sales force” to garner the support of stakeholders that directly support new mothers (stop relying solely/primarily on volunteers). Fund breastfeeding support infrastructure (Lactation Consultants, etc.) to enable individual breastfeeding success. Reign in formula industry marketing tactics (truth in advertising) (tobacco model—engage healthcare industry) 4. (insufficient incentive) Complete economic analysis that financially justifies breastfeeding at multiple levels (individual, business, state, country). Remove formula influence in WIC (eliminate conflict of interest); strengthen WIC breastfeeding incentive. Make formula less convenient (cost, accessibility). Develop irrefutable evidence (targeted research). Reframe message—and create social groundswell (objective cost-benefit view). Pursue creative breastfeeding incentive programs in partnership with healthcare industry and/or public health organizations 5. (lack of coordinated, consistent plan w/ accountability) Increase funding, authority, accountability and visibility of U.S. Breastfeeding Committee. Name a Breastfeeding CEO—run breastfeeding like a business as well as a public health imperative. Identify/recruit a prominent breastfeeding champion (e.g. Michelle Obama). Fund targeted breastfeeding initiatives (stop relying solely/primarily on volunteers)

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Because most breastfeeding difficulties don&apos;t become apparent until several days after birth, many women develop problems after they are at home without support or resources. These women don&apos;t know where to turn for help with breastfeeding, and many resort to formula. Medical systems would do well to provide women with resources to use for breastfeeding assistance following discharge from the hospital. During the hospital stay, staff should provide each woman with information about the lactation resources in her community, including who to contact and where to go if difficulties arise in breastfeeding. Pediatricians, likewise, should be able to direct women to the available resources and provide assistance in accessing those resources. Insurance companies should provide coverage for lactation services following discharge from the hospital.

This perpetuates the health problems of another generation that we will need to support. Why not put that money into education and incentives for WIC moms? Personally, I do not understand why we give away any formula at all. It encourages mom&apos;t not to breastfeed and we are telling them that formula is wonderful when it&apos;s not.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression As a part-time working and nursing mom of a 3 1/2 year old and a 10 month old, I am thrilled and pleased to see the CDC take an interest in supporting working moms in continuing their breastfeeding efforts.
While I don&apos;t disagree with the comments about paid maternity leave and better facilities at workplaces, these are costly benefits that are going to take a long time to implement. There are many smaller steps that can be taken now. Also, many working nursing moms are part-time employees and would not qualify for paid maternity leave even if available.
The single most important factor influencing my decision to continue nursing while working was the middle-aged African American nurse who taught my nursing class at Mary Washington Hospital. She told of how when she delivered her babies 20 years ago and was working in the labor and delivery ward of a hospital, she experienced the supreme irony of helping women learn how to breastfeed yet received no support from the hospital personally to continue nursing her own children. She took her breaks in the bathroom and pumped milk with one hand and ate a sandwich with the other. She told us, &quot;You do what you gotta do.&quot;
That simple phrase stuck with me. Knowing the sacrifices this nurse had made to nurse her children made my struggles seem small. I learned to pump in my car before work and in my closed office. I have the benefit of better technology in the nursing pumps of today. I put my pumped milk in a bag in the office fridge and never had anyone complain about it. There were many days when it was (and is) hard to continue but I remember the nurse and her phrase, &quot;You do what you gotta do.&quot; and I nurse on.
So, the small things that I think working moms need to continue their nursing efforts are:
1) sympathy and praise - It is a hard job to care for children, work and nurse them. The CDC should emphasize that it is proud of women who make the extra effort.
2) education of fathers/men - suppportive fathers, grandfathers, etc. have a huge impact on whether women continue to nurse their children. Education aimed at men on the little things like how not to be embarrassed when your wife/daughter/sister nurses in public or how to encourage and support nursing women would have a huge impact on nursing women. My husband is amazing in this regard.
3) education of the general public - the CDC should remind people that nursing is not the same as nudity and that most states have laws protecting nursing women from prosecution for indecency. This is a huge fear for many nursing women I have met. Also OSHA laws allow women to store their milk in the office fridge without creating a biohazard situation. People just need to know this. Any time there is an odd story in the news about nursing women being thrown off of airplanes or out of restaurants, the CDC should issue a public statement supporting nursing women.
4) resources for nursing moms - a good website with links to both local lactation hotlines at local hospitals as well as groups like La Leche League would be immensely helpful. For unknown reasons, sometimes there is a rivalry between hospital lactation consultants and LLL and a neutral third website from the CDC with links to both would be great for women. Also, there is almost no good resource for information for working moms and breastfeeding. My local LLL group was not helpful in this regard as most moms were not working moms, which is often the case with most parenting groups. Perhaps the CDC could offer an annual webcast on this subject?
Again, thanks for listening!

Lactation specialist should educate nurses and doctors on overcoming difficulties while nursing. A time limit should not be set for newborns to nurse. A baby will eat when it needs to and will not sleep if the baby is hungry. Formula companies should not be aloud to stalk you from the time you are pregnant, in the hospital and after.

 Other Areas Find ways to recognize the economic value of breastfeeding and parenting, for instance by paying a child benefit. I am concerned about the relationship of breastfeeding to economic development, both the economic development of a family (defined as a woman and her child/children plus any other people she has a household and economic relationship with) and the economic development of a nation. Our national economy is changing as more women become “economically active,” that is, go to work for pay outside the home. (Raising children and breastfeeding babies should be recognized and counted as economic activity too!) My concern is that, as a family OR a nation starts to depend on economic activity by women, then this affects women&apos;s ability not only to feed their children optimally but to mother them in ways that require an investment of time—e.g. attachment parenting, stay at home mothering, keeping babies with mothers at work, working part time, etc. I am concerned that it is becoming the norm to put your baby in day care and go back to work, competing with men in a workplace that is designed for men with wives at home. Women who want to make parenting choices such as those I just listed become limited in the jobs they can take. They lose opportunities for promotion, are viewed as “less than” the other women in the job market, and fall behind the “childfree” workers, the men with wives who raise their kids, and the mothers who choose not to breastfeed.

 Use of Banked Human Milk We need to support human milk banks. I am hoping that hospitals would begin to have their own human milk banks. I frequently encounter breastfeeding mothers that would love to have somewhere to donate their milk as well as mothers that would love to be able to find a source of donated mother&apos;s milk. Adoptive parents usually have no choice but to purchase formula. They need to have access to human milk at an affordable cost.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression UPDATE: I recently wrote in stating that I work at a hospital in NM and the room that was made available for breastfeeding mothers was always occupied. The room was being shared with breastfeeding mothers and employees with ADA concerns. I brought it up to many peoples attention including HR and 3 weeks later nothing had been done to address the issue. So in the heat of the moment I wrote a comment stating all of the above with my frustrations. Well the issue has now been address and I was blown away with the result. Not only are universal breastfeeding signs going up in the room. They are installing a hospital grade pump for mothers to use (we provide our own parts). They are also supplying the sanitizing wipes for our pump parts. They are hanging baby pictures on the walls and supplying baby magazines in the room. Talk about a WOW!!!!! I just needed to be a little more patient because everyone was working so hard to resolve the issue. I am so proud of my work and shocked on how they are accommodating the breastfeeding mothers!!!!! Talk about going above and beyond. They really do care. I apologize for my frustrated email I sent about a week ago.

 Research and Surveillance In a review of breastfeeding research, it is clear that there are not many solid definitive US studies on exclusively breastfed dyads breastfeeding for 1-2 years or longer. Results are as varied as &quot;breastfeeding&quot; definitions are varied, so consistent definitions and solid studies need to be done. Various cost analyses also need to be done comparing fully formula feeding and partially or short-term breastfeeding families with the long-term exclusively breastfeeding families, controlling for demographics and even attitudes. When these consistent, reproducible studies are done and best practices for excellent outcomes are gleaned, the US government must take steps to put the best practices into effect. Utilize positive deviance practices and find out how these families of all types of demographic backgrounds are able to persists in successful long-term bf relationships. Research and find these individuals who have overcome barriers and obstacles; find out what it is they know and do&amp;focus on these practices. We need to put money behind solid researchers/research to come up with indisputable results that cannot be ignored and then act upon the results as a unified community.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The United States&apos; standard for maternal health care completely undermines the role of mothering through breastfeeding. Babies need to be with their mothers immediately following birth for skin to skin contact, the initiation of breastfeeding, and for just the reason of common sense. Medical procedures done to infants following birth are often unnecessary and unnecessarily interfere with the mothers connection to her baby.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The cash driven agenda of the companies that produce artificial infant food have compromised the health of our nation&apos;s infants. As with most American commercialism, this has spread into other nations, putting those infants at higher risk due to lack of education on use, water accessibility, and product availability. Our health care system needs to take a stand for what is the natural and normal way of feeding infants and stop formula makers from calling the shots. That means NO formula for distribution in hospitals, no diaper bags with logos, educated health care workers, and the support women need. The formula makers WANT women to &quot;fail&quot; at beastfeeding and our health care system provides the perfect vehicle for women to &quot;fail.&quot;

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The Association of Women&apos;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) supports evidence-based breastfeeding practice. This includes providing women with appropriate and culturally sensitive breastfeeding education and support during the preconception, prenatal and postpartum periods for mothers of both term and preterm newborns. Women who choose to breastfeed should have the availability of lactation specialists or nurses with expertise in breastfeeding support to breastfeeding in the hospital or birthing setting, and upon discharge from the hospital. Since 2000, AWHONN has disseminated and updated evidence-based clinical practice guidelines specifically targeted to breastfeeding support and promotion that encompasses the preconception period through the first year postpartum.
A focus of the next breastfeeding call to action should be on breastfeeding promotion and support needs for mothers of vulnerable and preterm newborns. AWHONN supports breastfeeding as the optimal method of infant nutrition. The benefits of breastfeeding are documented extensively in the literature, and newly identified benefits continue to be reported. There is increasing evidence of the benefits of breast milk for premature infants. It is well documented that provision of breast milk to vulnerable and preterm newborns has not only nutritional benefit, but has therapeutic immunologic support benefits to reduce the risk of diseases common among preterm newborns such as necrotizing enterocolitis. Breast milk can decrease the rate of late-onset sepsis, enhance visual acuity; and enhance performance tests of cogitative development in this population of newborns. Research has also shown that these vulnerable newborns may be physiologically more stable during the act of breastfeeding when compared with newborns fed from a bottle or other source.
Because the evidence points to the benefits of breast milk to decrease infant morbidity and mortality, mothers should be encouraged and supported during this vulnerable preterm period to provide breast milk for their infant if possible. Providing the preterm newborn with mother’s milk can also enhance maternal-infant attachment and provides the mother an opportunity to play an active role in her preterm newborn’s care.
Premature infants are subdivided by gestational age into a category known as late preterm infants, those born between 34 and 36 completed weeks of gestation. These preterm infants often look and act like full-term infants; however, they have many of the same physiologic vulnerabilities as smaller preterm babies. They have immature suck and swallow reflexes and may have altered sleep-wake states, therefore they may have significant challenges to successful initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. These mother-infant dyads may require additional support, and it is important to refer them to a lactation consultant or other health care professional with expertise in breastfeeding support.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support The Association of Women&apos;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) supports breastfeeding as the optimal method of infant nutrition. AWHONN believes that women should be encouraged to breastfeed and receive instruction and support from the entire health care team to successfully initiate and sustain breastfeeding. Discussions with the woman and her significant others concerning breastfeeding should begin during the preconception period and continue through the first year of life or longer.
Nurses and other health care providers who care for mother-infant dyads of all ages should demonstrate minimal competencies for providing accurate information and support. This includes the preconception, prenatal and postpartum periods. Consultation and/or referral to a lactation consultant or other clinical expert should be considered for all mother-infant dyads. Research indicates that the attitudes and level of knowledge of health care providers who support women learning to breastfeed can directly impact the ability of a mother to successfully breastfeed.
AWHONN recognizes that cultural beliefs and values may influence the choice to breastfeed; therefore, health care providers should understand and be prepared to address cultural issues in all aspects of breastfeeding promotion. All women have the right to expect culturally-sensitive breastfeeding support. Breastfeeding has different meanings and levels of acceptance in different cultures; therefore, it is critical that providers explore the specific breastfeeding concerns of the individuals with whom they are working to ensure access to breastfeeding information and education regardless of the population served.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences The Association of Women&apos;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) supports the incorporation of breastfeeding education into the basic educational preparation of all providers of women and infants’ health care. Nursing curriculum should include content related to:
• breast anatomy and the physiology of lactation;
• techniques and methods of breastfeeding;
• infant, maternal, and economic benefits of breastfeeding;
• importance of educating women, families and their support systems about the benefits of breastfeeding; and
• culture as an influence on breastfeeding decision-making and support.
Information on other infant feeding techniques should be presented, including alternatives to breastfeeding such as cup, spoon, syringe and bottle feeding. Specifically, this information should include the indications, special considerations, and potential complications associated with each of these methods, as well as patient teaching and support strategies.
AWHONN produces a number of evidenced-based publications and resources related to breastfeeding. Of note, are: • Breastfeeding Support: Prenatal Care Through the First Year, Second Edition (evidence-based clinical practice guideline)
• Compendium of Postpartum Care, Second Edition (book)
• Breastfeeding Position Statement
• Breastfeeding and Lactation in the Workplace Position Statement

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Recognizing the fact that breastfeeding is the optimal form of infant nutrition, the Association of Women&apos;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) supports legislation and initiatives that promote and protect lactation in the workplace. Breastfeeding has been shown to have a number of economic benefits to employers, including decreased parental absences from work due to infant illness. Studies have shown fewer days lost from work among those who breastfeed compared to those who formula feed their infants.
AWHONN believes that employers should provide lactating women with break time that permits adequate frequency and duration of milk expression. It is critical that women have a safe, clean, private location for breastfeeding or milk expression within the workplace.
AWHONN supports legislation and policies that would facilitate increased breastfeeding rates. Specifically, AWHONN supports:
• Provision of tax credits or other incentives for employers to facilitate lactation in the workplace;
• Enhanced family medical leave policies that provide opportunities for women to have extended maternity leave in order to fully establish breastfeeding;
• Reimbursement by health plans and other payers for breastfeeding services and supplies including the rental or purchase of hospitals grade pumps and certified lactation consultant services.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends Although the highest incidence of breastfeeding is among college-educated women in their 30s with good incomes, some of the greatest increases in breastfeeding rates have occurred among groups of women considered to be least likely to breastfeed. The Women, Infants and Children’s (WIC) nutrition program serves approximately 40% of all infants born in the United States. The WIC program’s promotion of breastfeeding has resulted in significant increases breastfeeding rates among women who use the program between 1997 and 2004.
It is well documented that women are more successful at breastfeeding when they have the support of their significant others. It is important to note that influential significant others may differ based on the population. For example, among some African Americans, the primary source of breastfeeding support is often a friend or grandmother, while among some Hispanic women, the mother or mother-in-law may be most influential in the decision to initiate and continue breastfeeding. Fathers also influence a woman’s infant feeding decision, as do respected elders. Because a woman’s family and friends may have substantial influence on her decision whether to breastfeed, they should be included in educational efforts that promote breastfeeding.
Peer education and counseling influence breastfeeding duration, especially among minority and low-income women. Peer counselors can have a positive effect on breastfeeding when they are trained to provide education and support for women who breastfeed. Ideally, peer counselors should have the same or similar demographic characteristics as the population they serve.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I work in a WIC clinic in SW Ohio and find that many of our WIC moms who stated they intended to bf start out trying in the hospital, but leave the hospital either not breastfeeding at all, partially formula feeding or with nipple shields due to sore nipples. I hear over and over again from these women that they were told that their &quot;milk wasnt in yet&quot; and thus needed to supplement. I also hear alot of moms say that their baby&apos;s weight was an issue and that they were instructed in the hospital to give formula after each breastfeeding. I sometimes wonder if these babies are weighed on different scales at different times and naked, causing discrepencies in weight. One young mother was told to stop bf within 24 hours over wt gain conerns, despite the baby having had 1 wet and one BM during this period.and reporting baby latched on well w/o discomfort/pain. I feel that it should be a requirement for all medical students and nurses who deal in maternity to have actually learned the basics of bf, ie, what a good latch looks like, what indicates adequate intake and the health risks associated with formula use.

 Use of Banked Human Milk When I adopted my daugter, my intention was to breastfeed and formula feed both. However, we were given very short notice (one week!) that we were matched before our daughter was born, and thus didn&apos;t have the time to actually build any type of milk supply. When I called the milk bank in Columbus, I was told that the use of banked human milk was primarily for high risk infants. Although my daughter was full-term, I would have loved to have been able to offer her human milk. I also feel that due to my own medical condition, it would have been difficult to have actually produced my own milk to offer her. In summary, it would be wonderful if adopted infants were also given priority for banked human milk.

 Paid Maternity Leave It&apos;s freaking ridiculous that women usually have to choose between nursing and working. Minimum paid leave should be 6 months. People who have experienced the post-partum period (and labor:) need to have a voice here. This is a very inward and precious rest time in a mother&apos;s life and it benefits everyone if a new or expanding family gets this time to adjust and bond without worrying about losing jobs or falling into poverty because you need to spend time with your new baby. It&apos;s not weird for moms and babies to need each other. It&apos;s essential for survival. A well rested and confident mom is much better suited for &quot;work&quot; than a worried and depressed mom who &quot;had&quot; to go back to work too early. Most women have to work to fed their families these days, and we need to allow for the ebb and flow of family life.

Mom needs support. Pregnant women need a hell of a lot less pressure put on them to bow to the hospitals. Women know how to birth. Men don&apos;t. simple. We need support and expectations to initiate and continue to nurse as long as possible for our situation. We need to remember that a laboring woman is strong, not weak, and she deserves respect. The post-partum woman needs a lot of rest and respect as well. we need to remind people that doctor&apos;s don&apos;t deliver babies. Women birth them. Normal birth needs to be front and center, and emergency birthing situations and attitudes need to be reserved for actual emergencies.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends I started as a Peer Helper with one of the first piloted Peer Helper Programs in Ohio WIC, 5 years ago. I have personally surveyed mothers on their infant feeding decisions both before and after attending an informational, education class about their feeding options. Unfortunately, I did not put the information into offical statistics, but this is what we did. We asked pregnant moms before the class 1. What experience, personally, family or friends, did they have with breastfeeding, 2. How they planned to feed their baby, and 3. What helped them make that decision. It was amazing to see the numbers of mothers, that after listening to a class from a Peer, decided to, or would now consider, breastfeeding. We continued our support as Peers with phone calls just before due dates to help with additional questions, we visited them in the hospital when they delivered, and we continued support through their breastfeeding with phone calls, support groups, and one-on-one visits. We were told many times from mothers, &quot;I couldn&apos;t have done it without your support&quot;. How awesome!
In our society today, unfortunately, we do not have generation after generation whom have breastfed. That leaves a huge gap in support that used to be natural and normal. That&apos;s where Peer support comes in.
I would like to see more dollars put in to providing Breastfeeding Peer services at WIC clinics and hospitals. Peers can be the &quot;filter&quot; for Lactation Consultants. Peers can provide support and basic breastfeeding education, at a lower cost than consultants, thus freeing the consultant to concentrate on more difficult feeding situations.

 Other Areas W.I.C. Program is supportive in breastfeeding where I live. However, the Federal and State W.I.C. Program needs to follow recommendations of the Institute of Medicine - they asked for recommendations - they recommended that only one can of powdered formula be given for the first month of life to all women that delivered a baby. They have not followed the recommendation because the federal govt. and state govt. have not changed or have fear.
I would recommend no formula for the first month of life, and all women breastfeed or purchase formula. This would help move our culture from a formula feeding culture to a breastfeeding culture.
The W.I.C. Program needs to be funded for a peer counseling support system in all states.

The Public Health Department - needs to take a more active role in breastfeeding in the U.S. The Public Health Department seems to say they support breastfeeding, but no follow-up, or changes are made in the Public Health Departments at the state and local level.

The day after, they put a sign that ask the breastfeed mothers to go to the lockers/bathroom area. The law said that I can breastfeed my baby in any public or private place that I am authorized to be. So, this &quot;Bellamorphosis Woman Health Center&quot; and the SJAFB breastfeeding policy is illegal. I am trying to contact a lawyer that could represent me in the federal court and no one wants to take my case. I have been trying to look for help in different woman&apos;s rights organizations and this feminism organizations don&apos;t have breastfeeding in their lists of woman rights. Even the attorneys don&apos;t have clear how this case could be classified, maybe as a violation of my civil rights or as discrimination for being a breastfeed mom. I think that both. More than creating new laws is make them value; working with the attorneys and judges to make them think about this issues as real and important.

 Paid Maternity Leave Increased amount of compensation for mothers who are exclusively breast feeding, or lowered amount allowed, for mothers who are not breast feeding, or who are only partially breast feeding. Lowered health care costs for child and for mother would offset higher paid maternity leave compensation.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care All delivery hospitals in the US should be required to obtain Baby-Friendly Hospital status to be licensed. The BFHI includes 10 steps that have been thoroughly researched that support a woman and her family&apos;s choice to breastfeed. It does not force a woman to breastfeed if she doesn&apos;t want to.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings I am always amazed at how anyone could be offended by a mother and her child breastfeeding in public. This is such a perfect picture of nuturing as God so perfectly designed. A child suckling at the breast of it&apos;s mother is as natural as it gets! What exactly are people offended by? or uncomfortable with? And are these same people who find breast feedingn in public to be improper, obscene, offending, do they also have the same thoughts when they see our youth of today scantilly dressed in public? There is much immorality amidst us, why would anyone consider the natural act of breastfeeding to be anthing less than beautiful and loving, regardless of where it is being done.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care companies should be requred to reimburse IBCLCs for lactation support services.
All physicians providing care to women and children should have an IBCLC on staff or a documented referral IBCLC.
Medicaid nationally should require that states loan hospital-grade pumps to mothers whose baby cannot effectively initiate lactation and transfer milk whether or not mom and baby are seperated.
Medicaid nationally should require that states provide double electric breast pumps to mothers returning to work or school fulltime.
All maternity hospitals should be required to have enough IBCLCs on staff to provide for for 24/7 breastfeeding support.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Skin - to -skin holding (kangaroo care) right after birth should be mandated for babies whether breast or fromula feeding is planned. The human infant requires this to protect against fear and shut down after transitioning from the familiar environment of the womb to the outside world. We have been purpetrating a cruelty on our species by separating moms and babies at birth.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences All health care professions working with women and children should be required to provide at least 18 hours of breastfeeding support education. Nurses or dietitians should not be allowed to work with new mothers and babies unless they have been educated on how to support a mother&apos;s decision to breastfeed her baby.
Medical schools should require lactation eduaction appropriateto the specific specialty.
There should be an understanding of or maybe even a new medical specialty that deals with the breastfeeding dyad - mom and baby. As it is the mom has her doctor and the baby has his doctor and &quot;never the twain shall meet.&quot;
Health professionals and organizations should not utilize pharmeceutical and formula company moneys to sponsor education or conferences. Research articles that provide unbiased education on their products is OK but not marketing freebies and goodies.
Pubclications should clearly indicate that breastfeeding is the NORM not better than or best. In research it should be clearly stated that formula fed babies have lower IQs for instance or that formula feeding is associated with increased risk of developing diabetes. Until our health care professionals make the intellectual and emotional connection that formula is causing these health care problems they will not universally promote and support breastfeeding to the fullest extent.
USDA should ban formula companies from USDA WIC sponsored conferences.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care I would like to suggest that you include some mention of the role in depression in breastfeeding. Here are some of the main points that I suggest the report include.
1) Depressed women are less likely to initiate breastfeeding. Depressed women also wean significantly earlier than non-depressed women. As such, depression is a significant barrier to initiating breastfeeding and to exclusive breastfeeding.
2) Breastfeeding is actually protective of maternal mental health and there are significantly lower rates of depression among breastfeeding women. Breastfeeding specifically protects because it downregulates the stress response, including the HPA axis and inflammatory response system.
3) Breastfeeding women also get more sleep and better quality sleep than women who are formula feeding or combining breast and formula feeding.
4) Breastfeeding also protects infants from the harmful effects of maternal depression because depressed breastfeeding women cannot disengage from their babies. They look at, touch and stroke their babies more than depressed women who are bottle feeding.
5) Almost all treatments for depression are compatible with breastfeeding. Only one class of medications, MAO Inhibiters, cannot be used by breastfeeding women. But their use is rare in the U.S. All other treatments are compatible.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) The training of staff from complementary programs to deliver breastfeeding education and support is a very interesting concept, especially when the complementary programs are already conducting home visits. I am not aware of research conducted in the US which evaluates this. However, one study from Pakistan describes improvements in breastfeeding outcomes when community health workers, who were already conducting home visits, started to educate women about breastfeeding as well (Omer K et al, Evidence-based training of frontline health workers for door-to-door health promotion: A pilot randomized controlled cluster trial with lady health workers in Sindh Province, Pakistan. Patient Education and Counseling. 2008; 72:178-185).
The study has some limitations, but the concept make be useful. Using existing community support programs as a supplementary vehicle to deliver breastfeeding education may be effective in the US. We need to scientifically evaluate this.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care 1. FDA should regulate infant formula as a medicine, not a food, because of increased rates of illness from even its proper use. 2. Continue the mPINC surveys on a semi-annual basis; add more questions on drug use in labor, elective inductions, elective Cesarean; publicize results more widely. Convene state-wide or regional meetings of hospital administrators&amp;CEOs to discuss results and implications. 3. Include Baby-Friendly practices in Medicaid hospital accreditation programs. 4. Require all federal agencies that collect data on infant and child mortality, including SIDS and SUDI, to use collect data on birth practices (including instruments, surgery, and anesthesia) and infant feeding methods for all children under 12 months. 5. Require states that apply for Title V MCH Block Grant funds establish BF goals as a one of their high priority goals and report on progress toward those goals. Require states that receive TitleV funds to identify a state-level breastfeeding coordinator within the MCH division with sufficient time and resources to direct programs to improve the state’s performance on national BF goals; qualifications for these positions to include IBCLC certification. These positions should collaborate with USDA WIC breastfeeding programs in a systematic, supportive fashion.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support 1. Facilitate formation and expansion of early postpartum follow-up services offered by public health clinics and agencies. 2. Include breastfeeding support in all other programs that put health workers (of any related field) in contact with pregnant women or new mothers. 3. Medicaid and all health insurance plans should include adequate coverage for “lactation care and services” provided by qualified providers.

 Health Professional Education, Publications, and Conferences 1. As a condition of receiving federal funding from any source, all university medical, nursing, and/or dietetic schools must require a minimum of 20 hours of breastfeeding education that meets the objectives of Step 2 of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. Provide funding for development of curricula, texts, and on-line programs to meet this requirement. Rationale: if our national health goal is for 75% of mothers to initiate breastfeeding, then 75% of the “infant feeding” curriculum should focus on “how” and “why” of breastfeeding in all health care provider schools. 2. Recommend that health professional agencies expand Conflict-of-interest guidelines to include all products within the scope of the International Code.

Include “the ethics of infant feeding” (including formula-company unethical tactics) in academic marketing, legal, and related degree programs. 3. Recommend (encourage, fund, require) that all MCH programs at the federal and state level include individuals or representatives of organizations with breastfeeding expertise on all policy committees, advisory groups, and similar bodies. For example, a state or local Safe Sleep committee must officially and formally include representation from the BF community because &gt;70% of the babies in that state/community are being breastfed.

We must be the ones to: make BF the norm again in our culture, work to desexualize the human breast, to change legislation to protect new families and nursing mothers in regard to time off work to establish BF, provide reimbursement for BF support services, mandate education of all health care professionals in BF, make all hospitals baby-friendly hospitals. Money talks, and since the insurance companies are all about the bottom line, it seems interesting that with all of the scientific proof of cost savings in terms of less infant morbidity, and health benefits for mother too, that they have not jumped to promote BF...? Some changes take a generation to affect - we need to get the ball rolling NOW! Bless all of you out there working to make this happen.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Hospital practices will change when National Breastfeeding Assessment Goals from The Joint Commission (JCAHO) are adopted to outline breastfeeding care during hospital stays.
JCAHO drives the impetus for practice changes within the hospital system. When new initiatives for patient care such as patient safety are created, administration asks practitioners to reexamine protocols and create new policy and education of staff.
When the US Department of HHS works together with JCAHO employees to develop national breastfeeding assessment and care recommendations we will get somewhere in changing hospital-based practices.

 Use of Banked Human Milk It is past time for the WIC program to reimburse for the use of banked human milk. Banked human milk is at least as safe and effective (and I certainly believe more safe and effective)as infant formula. USDA and FDA were asked over 15 years ago to add banked human milk to the allowable foods list. Nothing has been done.
Banked human milk should be available and offered to all newborns whose moms die in childbirth or soon after.
Research using banked human milk to treat intestinal diseases such as colitis should start right away.
Banked human milk should be offered to adults with various digestive ailments.
Nationally, WIC should encourage moms to donate to milk banks.
We need more milk banks to cover the hopefully increased demand.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Having to return to work or school is the #1 reason moms in the US give for stopping breastfeeding. Employers and schools should be required to provide the time and a clean safe place (not the bathroom)for moms to express their milk in a manner that sustains her milk supply. Co-workers should be educated on the health and social benefits of supporting the breastfeeding employee.
Ideally employers should allow moms and babies to come to work together, 2nd best is an onsite creche where mom can nurse as needed, 3rd best is allowing the baby to be brought to mom for nursing, 4th is time and place for pumping.
There should be access to a lactation consultant to educate employees how to sustain their milk supply when they return to work and to provide consultation if breastfeeding problems and conditions occur after returning to work.

 Paid Maternity Leave The United States is one of only 4 other nations in the world that do not provide paid maternity leave of some sort. We are the only so called &quot;advanced&quot; nation that does not. We should be ashamed of ourselves. This country talks a good game about supporting &quot;family&quot; values but the only value it seems we support is the monetary bottom line.
New moms and babies need time together to bond whether breastfeeding or formula feeding. Breastfeeding requires at least 3-4 weeks to be established. The AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months. If we had paid maternity leave for at least 6 months we would have much higher breastfeeding initiation and duration.
As for the bottom line, our society would reap the monetary benefits of less health care costs for both mom and baby, less psycholigical problems through deeper bonding, less pollution for the use of artificially produced baby food,less governement spending on formula in the WIC program.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media Women&apos;s breasts should not be exploited for prurient interests. However, the breast should not be obsessively hidden either, i.e. the childish uproar over a glimpse of Janet Jackson&apos;s nipple during the Superbowl.
If we want our culture to be a breastfeeding friendly one, we need to see women breastfeeding in the media. We need to show that breastfeeding is the normal way to feed an baby. In Britain there is an innovative ad campaign where they identified several young women who were breastfeeding their babies and made them up as nicely as models and made billboards that were placed around town. The women were very proud and they got a lot of positive feedback from friends, family and the public.
I think that maybe Twitter could be used to send out breastfeeding supportive messages. I think Facebook could be a good medium IF they can be made to see that BF photos are not pornography.
I&apos;d like to mention here that formula advertising to the public has to stop or have qualifications attached. For instance, whenever there is a formula ad there should be immediately following it an ad for breastfeeding. All formula ads should have a comment that breastfeeding is the norm for humans and provides for normal human growth. If this is a TV or radio ad this statement should be audible and if print then in large print.

 Support for Breastfeeding in Public Settings There should be a federal law guaranteeing a woman the right to breastfeed in public wherever she and her baby have the right to be. Most states have this type of law but not all. Also, there should be some consequences if a place of public accomodation breaks this law. The law should not include any statement about &quot;being discrete.&quot; That is arbitraty and in some instances impossible if a baby is uncooperative.
The law should be widely publicized so that the public is aware of the rights of mothers to breastfeeding in public.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends USDA should fully fund the WIC breastfeeding peer counselor program. While this program is supposedly a core service of the WIC program there are not enough funds to allow all states to implement this service fully. WIC should spend as much money on breastfeeding support as it does providing free formula.
Additionally, research is need to identify the ideal number of peers and peer hours for increasing BF initiation and duration. This may be different with different ethnic groups. Research is also need on the WIC BF coodinator position - what is the ideal number of hours per project participation? What kind of education should be mandated for this position? What duties are best for breastfeeding promotion and support?

 Research and Surveillance Please continue the hospital report card data review that CDC started this year. It is imperative if we are to increase support for breastfeeding at birth.
We should include the question &quot;how fed as an infant&quot; on all physician health history forms. That way we might be able to gather data on millions to determine connections between heath and infant feeding.
All birth certificates should have type of feeding when leaving the hsopital and if it was Exclusive Breastfeeding, Exclusive formula feeding or mixed breast and formula feeding.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) Child care providers should adopt the Ten Steps to a Breastfeeding Friendly Child Care Center developed by the Wisconsin state health department.
Physicians, hospitals, other health care providers should adopt the WHO growth grids which are based on the growth of healthy exclusively breastfed babies from around the world, including the US. If breastfeeding is the norm then the exclusively BF baby&apos;s growth should be the standard used to measure development. This would improve the acceptance of breastfeeding as the cultural norm for all families, health care providers and the general public.

 Research and Surveillance As recently seen in the Infant Feeding Practices Survey II, the majority of women pump their milk at some time in their lactation process. The NIS questions allow for infants to be fed breast milk or be “breastfed.” The NIS questions do not distinguish how this milk is fed. There potentially could be great differences in outcomes for infants fed pumped milk versus those fed at the breast. The implications for pumping for mothers are not known at this time either. Mother who pump may have a great deal of milk stored in the freezers and stop lactating, yet continue to feed their infants pumped milk for weeks to months until their supply is gone. Researchers can no longer classify “breastfeeding” practices of mothers based on the child’s consumption of breast milk.
We recommend that future research studies begin to ask questions which better clarify the “breast milk feeding” practices of women and children in the US. Only after these behaviors are more appropriately defined can outcomes be properly assessed. Our suggestions for research questions in which “breast milk feeding” data are collected are as follows:
On what postpartum day did you first feed your child directly at the breast? ______________
On what postpartum day did you first begin to pump or express your milk? ______________
How many days old was your child when he/she was first fed directly at your breast? ___________
How many days old was your child when he/she was first fed any of your expressed or pumped breast milk? ______________
On what postpartum day did you stop feeding your child at the breast? ______________
On what postpartum day did you stop expressing or pumping milk from your breasts? _________
How many days old was your child when he/she stopped feeding directly at your breast? ____________
How many days old was your child when he/she stopped being fed any of your expressed or pumped breast milk? _______________ (
How many days old was your child when (he/she) was first fed formula? ______________
How many days old was your child when (he/she) was first fed anything other than breast milk or formula (for example: juice, cow’s milk, sugar water, plain water, or baby food?) _____________
On what postpartum day did you stop making enough milk to feed your child breast milk either at the breast or expressed/pumped milk? ___________________

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Guidelines need to be in place for formula usage in the hospital.If a mother indicates prior to delivery that she wishes to formula feed she should sign a consent form that she has been made aware of the risks associated with formula usage- maybe then she might change her mind! Formula needs to be regulated as any other medication. I have heard far too many stories from mothers experiencing breastfeeding problems postdischarge due to introduction of bottles of formula in the hospital. If a baby truly needs supplemented, donor milk should be made available and fed to baby using a spoon, cup, syringe- rather than bottle. Discharge bags containing formula should be banned at all hospitals. Hospitals never should have allowed this in the first place- formula companies are marketing their product and they have no business doing so at the hospital. Discharge bags should be breastfeeding friendly. Rather than giving out a lot of items, the bag could have a breastfeeding message on it and inside would be a baby sling which would help promote attachment parenting, and maybe a coupon to purchase a nursing bra. Mothers need to also have a list for breastfeeding help in the community- LLL, WIC, LCs. If a mother leaves the hospital with breastfeeding issues, a follow-up visit needs to be established. The non-English speaking moms especially do not receive the support and follow-up ncecessary. We need LCs of different ethnicities and cultures. All breastfeeding mothers should receive a home visit during the first week, and a follow-up visit if necessary. Lactation clinics could be set up in different areas of the city staffed by several LC&apos;s where mothers could go for breastfeeding problems. All breastfeeding services would be reimbursed through insurance. Or- to consolidate services, All pediatrician and OB/GYN offices would include lactation services. Prenatally, all mothers should be referred to attend a breastfeeding class to better prepare them for breastfeeding, whether it is through the WIC office or local hospital.

Regarding childcare issues, if a mother is a daycare worker she should be permitted to have her baby at that child care setting and be permitted to take her break when her baby is ready to feed. I have spoken to mothers that have been unable to go and nurse their baby at the day care because that baby is in another room, so instead she has to take a break when it is her break time, to pump her milk. Wouldn&apos;t it be easier for her to just go and feed the baby?!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Current evidence demonstrates that hospital practices may account for as much as 40% of the impact on breastfeeding rates. We need to follow up on recently obtained data from the mPINC survey (see www.cdc.gov/mpinc/) with legislative initiatives requiring standard of care breastfeeding management in hospitals. One example would be to require adherence to evidence-based guidelines such as the Ten Steps of the WHO/Unicef Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. This would go a long way towards removing a number of known barriers to breastfeeding: STEP 1 requires a breastfeeding policy which is routinely communicated to all health care professionals. This would provide evidence-based policies and institution-wide adherence to the standards of breastfeeding management for so many institutions which currently have such inconsistent practices. STEP 2 requires that all HCP&apos;s be trained in breastfeeding management. The lack of breastfeeding education in medical and nursing schools and residencies has been well documented and contributes to much interference with successful breastfeeding (e.g. inappropriate use of formula supplements, lack of recognition of inadequate breastfeeding technique, unnecessary interruption of breastfeeding for medications or diagnostic procedures). We need to require medical and nursing schools and residency programs to include evidence-based breastfeeding education. STEP 3 requires education of mothers about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. Despite a general increased awareness about breastfeeding among the public, there is still a lack of understanding among many mothers and their support people, many misconceptions about breastfeeding. Evidence shows that women make their infant feeding decisions early, and US Preventive Services Task Force has demonstrated that prenatal education about breastfeeding increased breastfeeding initiation and duration. STEP 4 requires that breastfeeding be initiated within 1/2 to 1 hour (international vs US) after birth. There is good evidence that early and frequent breastfeeding is associated with improved breastfeeding outcomes, but MPINC demonstrated that allowing breastfeeding postpartum is not yet a common practice in most institutions. STEP 5 requires that mothers be taught about breastfeeding postpartum and that expression of milk be encouraged in cases of maternal-infant separation. US Preventive Task Force has shown that postpartum teaching about breastfeeding increases initiation and duration. STEP 6 requires that formula be used only when medically necessary. MPINC demonstrated that the practice of routine formula supplementation is widespread in many US birthing institutions. Hospitals need to eliminate the acceptance of free formula and stop providing free formula supplements to mothers, a practice which is widespread but has been demonstrated to decrease rates of exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration, especially in susceptible populations such as low socio-economic status mothers. We should seriously consider federal and state legislation to prohibit the distribution of formula in hospital and health care providers&apos; offices. STEP 7 requires rooming-in for all mothers and infants 24/7. Maternal-infant separation is a major factor in breastfeeding problems. Currently, institutions separate mothers and infants for a variety of routine reasons, not just valid medical reasons. Hospital policies should require that mothers and babies stay together unless there is a medical problem requiring their separation. STEP 8 requires breastfeeding on demand. Again, this best practice is not occurring consistently in US hospitals. STEP 9 requires avoidance of artificial nipples and bottles for breastfeeding infants. Evidence shows that alternative feeding methods such as cups are safe and effective for necessary supplementation and don&apos;t interfere with breastfeeding success as much as bottles. Hospital HCP&apos;s should avoid giving unnecessary supplements, but if supplements are needed, they should know how to teach cup feeding. Pacifiers have repeatedly been demonstrated to be associated with decreased breastfeeding duration. Although a causal relationship has not yet been demonstrated, they should not be used routinely while infants are attempting to establish breastfeeding. If they are causal for breastfeeding problems, they should not be used. If they are a symptom of breastfeeding problems, they should also not be used but rather the breastfeeding should be evaluated and corrected. STEP 10 requires the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and referral of mothers to these groups. If all birthing institutions provided proper support for mothers outside of the immediate postpartum setting, it would go a long way to helping alleviate many of the outside cultural and social barriers that account for about 60% of breastfeeding problems (e.g. cultural misconceptions and negative attitudes, lack of support for breastfeeding by family and friends, workplace barriers, etc.)

 Other Areas Here we are again asking health care professionals how to promote,inform and protect breastfeeding. The power of the Infant formula companies was apparent in the campaign launched back in 2003 nationally with the omission of the cancer protection properties of human milk. Not until we stand as a nation only interested in the health of our nation will things change. As a Lactation Professional I am preaching to the choir of other Lactation Professionals. Let our leaders take their share of responsibility in providing outlets to the public to change our culture to protect,promote,inform and support breastfeeding moms and babies.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Provide requirements for hospitals and clinics, especially those receiving federal funding to implement lactation programs - prenatal education - initiation of breastfeeding, and follow up care. Breastfeeding needs to move from a lifestyle decision to a health care issue - and the medical community needs to lead the way

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The availability of breastfeeding support prior to delivery and postpartum is not guaranteed for many women and can be influenced by a number of variables, including health insurance, geography and socioeconomic status. In order to increase breastfeeding rates across the country, consistent with the Healthy People 2010 initiative, it is imperative that breastfeeding education become a standard part of prenatal care. A woman’s prenatal care provider should review the benefits of breastfeeding for mother and baby and provide a detailed list of available resources. Breastfeeding education is an important component of childbirth education; enrollment in childbirth education should be encouraged and made available to all expecting parents. Participation by both partners will open up the conversation about breastfeeding, including the need for support from the mother’s partner and family. Physicians’ input and guidance in this area requires expansion; education and acceptance by, OBs, pediatricians and nurses/nurse practitioners of breastfeeding medicine is a necessity in order to increase breastfeeding rates nationwide. Baby-friendly practices should be observed following delivery, specifically allowing new mothers time to bond with and feed their infants with support and advice available if needed from a certified lactation consultant or healthcare professional with training in breastfeeding practices. The immediate time post-delivery provides an opportunity for additional education by pediatricians evaluating the new baby, the obstetrician and postpartum nurse, all of whom can work with new families to promote breastfeeding success. Hospitals should make every effort to provider lactation consultant services for new mothers. Previous research has indicated that the more breastfeeding supportive maternity practices that are in place in a birth center, the stronger the positive effect on breastfeeding.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Recognizing that mother and baby might not have success at breastfeeding right away, an important part of hospital discharge should include information about post-natal care and lactation consultant resources. In situations where postnatal care is available from a visiting nurse, it is important to require continuing education in breastfeeding education for this group of healthcare providers so they may provide demonstrations and be equipped with the skills to educate mothers facing challenges in the early stages of breastfeeding.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Availability of lactation care following delivery varies by region and may be contingent on health insurance coverage. Many women, however, may not feel confident in their ability to breastfeed immediately following their hospital discharge, limiting the potential for success. Women who struggle with breastfeeding initially and do not have access to professional support may be more likely to discontinue breastfeeding before the baby is six months old. As women navigate the early well-child visits and their own post-natal care, healthcare providers—pediatricians, nurse practitioners, obstetricians and/or midwives—should provide follow up with mothers on breastfeeding progress and provide immediate resources for women facing challenges. In the early stages of breastfeeding, prompt responses are necessary in order to maintain milk supply. If quick resolution is not available, pumping with a hospital grade pump may help keep up supply. It is well known that frequent nursing/milk expression in the days immediately following delivery is a critical factor in establishing a mother’s milk supply. For mothers experiencing challenges in these early days, a hospital-grade pump may be necessary in order to express milk on a regular basis and establish/maintain supply. Insurers can help a great deal with coverage of purchase or rental of one of these pumps for new mothers. Women returning to work after having a baby face many challenges. Continuing to breastfeed can be difficult, particularly for women in retail or shift positions. Women with these careers should access resources early during their maternity leave to help prepare themselves and their employers to allow for continued breastfeeding and pumping on their return to work.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Women everywhere are successfully combining breastfeeding and working. Advance planning, family and workplace support, and a high quality breast pump make it work for working moms. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for at least 6 months. The longer babies are breastfed, the greater the health effects for both mom and baby. Breastfeeding is good for employers, too—reducing parent absence for baby’s illnesses. It can be overwhelming for a new mom to begin work. As a woman is preparing to return to work after maternity leave, flexibility is important. Employers should be informed of a woman’s rights as they apply locally and employers of all sizes should be encouraged to provide female employees with access to a comfortable, private location where they can express milk, if needed. A 2006 International Breastfeeding Journal publication found that mothers who express milk are more likely to breastfeed to 6 months. The appropriate use of expressed breast milk is a means of helping new mothers set and meet a goal for sustaining breastfeeding. Advance planning, including speaking with employers/human resources before returning to work is the first step in sustaining breastfeeding after maternity leave. Women should communicate their needs to their employer, learn about corporate policies, as for a clean, private room in which to pump, and discuss how breaks may fit into their schedule. Finally, purchase or rent a breast pump and secure the appropriate materials for expression and storage. Lastly, many working mothers continue to express milk and breastfeed their babies after returning to work. New mothers should feel encouraged to seek out other working moms for support and strategies for continued success.

 Peer Support and Education of Family Members and Friends Breastfeeding is a family affair and is not exclusive between mother and baby. Support from a partner and family members is important for successful and sustained breastfeeding. Women are encouraged to learn about breastfeeding before the baby is born; whenever possible, partners should take part in this education, too. A partner who is informed about the benefits of breastfeeding will help create a comfortable environment in their homes and assuage some reservations women may feel about nursing in public. A supportive environment and an increased level of comfort with nursing in and outside the home allows the next generation of moms to learn about breastfeeding from their moms and encourages a healthy attitude about nursing, encouraging it as socially acceptable and natural way of feeding a baby. When mothers experience challenges with breastfeeding, health care professionals may suggest working with lactation consultants who can review breastfeeding techniques and help address any problems that arise while nursing. Many hospitals and health centers have lactation consultants on staff, so make sure to ask your obstetrician, pediatrician or primary care provider if you think you need extra support. Finally, remind nursing mothers to get plenty of rest and eat a well-balanced diet to maintain energy.

 Community Support for Breastfeeding in Complementary Programs (e.g., Early Head Start, Home Visitation, Parental Training) Research has shown that there is no better food than breast milk for a baby’s first year of life. Breastfeeding provides many health, nutritional, economical and emotional benefits to mother and baby and it is important for women accessing WIC services to receive encouragement and support to initiate and sustain breastfeeding. A stated goal of the WIC Program is to improve the nutritional status of infants; the benefits women receive through the WIC program as an incentive to start and continue breastfeeding (access to breast pumps, extended access to WIC services) help provide an environment to increase breastfeeding rates, in accordance with the objectives of Healthy People 2010. Programs such as Head Start, which provide comprehensive child development services, should connect with local breastfeeding support organizations. These connections could expand the services provided to families accessing early development programs and enhance education to enrolled families about breastfeeding education.
 2511 Industry Representative
 Research and Surveillance As breastfeeding research continues, we are learning more and more about how the practice benefits both mother and baby. Additional research is important, as many of the benefits may be as yet undiscovered. Further surveillance is important; to support the goal of increasing breastfeeding rates among all women, it’s necessary to communicate both the benefits yielded by research and the information provided by surveillance in effort to encourage more women of all backgrounds to engage in this important practice for their own benefit and the benefit of their babies. A 2007 MMWR published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that further research is needed to understand the variances in breastfeeding rates nationwide and in the postpartum practices among birth centers. Previous has indicated that the more breastfeeding-supportive maternity practices that are in place, the stronger the positive effect on breastfeeding.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support In order to support a mother&apos;s effort to breastfeed, accessibility to breastfeeding services and education should be available to mothers prenatally and immediately postpartum.
Access of care in the area of breastfeeding is critical in the African American community. Information isn&apos;t readily available to this population universally in scope, detail, literacy level, or cultural suitability. Due to the continued lagging breastfeeding rates of African Americans, targeted media campaigns, projects, and materials need to be directed toward this population. This should be coupled with the proper training of medical professionals on the importance and mechanics of breastfeeding followed by culturally sensitive encouragement, care, and support. With this, African American families will have a better chance of reaping the benefits of breastfeeding.
African American families are at greater need for one-on-one support at birth and throughout the first six months postpartum. Often this is not received. Thus, lactation support should be provided to pregnant and new mothers from many access points, beginning with media and public awareness campaigns, followed by prenatal care, in-hospital support, and support from lactation consultants or other breastfeeding educators before, during and after delivery.
Increased breastfeeding education also should be mandatory for all health care professionals and program staff that provide services and support to pregnant and new parents. Although increased education and information is now available to the public at-large, gaps still remain, especially in the African American community. Therefore, a goal should be to make sure that lactation support is available from many access points.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care The danger of &quot;FREE&quot;! Don&apos;t give moms discharge bags with formula!
Also, all too often when pregnant teens enter the hospital for delivery, it is sometimes automatically assumed that the moms will use formula, and formula is given to the babies. This especially occurs with African American mothers. Such profiling should be stopped!

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Educational classes need to be implemented into the prenatal follow-up in the hospitals. These classes should be prescribed by the nurse and/or doctor, followed by reciprocal demonstration to reinforce client understanding. Each class should be signed off by the medical professional for assurance purposes. This would ensure that pregnant mothers receiving prenatal care also receive some breastfeeding education and demonstration prior to delivery.

 Portrayal of Breastfeeding in Traditional Popular Media and New Electronic Media The fact that in this country men (and the general public) are encouraged to view women&apos;s breasts in a purely sexual context leads to public discouragement of breastfeeding in general. More honest portrayals of the breast as the link to the next generation&apos;s best first source of nourishment (without sexual innuendo or sexual overtones or embarrassment) would be a step towards an acceptance of the dual purposes of breasts: attract mate, feed offspring.

 Worksite Lactation Support, Onsite Child Care, and Milk Expression Newborns need the breast for the first year. Only one year of onsite child care per child of employees would allow for the double benefit to the company and the employee of continuity at the worksite and less loss of time due to various glitches in breastfeeding schedules. It would also have the side effect of opening up the community within the workplace to the fact that the next generation is being cared for in the best possible way, with help from the employer. It would also destigmatize breastfeeding and allow for a more humane consideration of the human growth cycle. Babies need the breast, and letting them have it at the workplace keeps everyone happy. If the mom knows the baby is nearby, she will use her worktime more efficiently, not worrying about the baby at home.....
 2532 Health Care Provider
 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care health care workers are not educated well in breast feeding, in particular what is normal in the hours following birth. Routine is to feed your baby every 3 hours. When the new mom is unable to wake baby in the first 8 hours after the initial feeding she is often coherced into supplementing until baby is more awake. Perhaps teaching basics in schools of nursing and medicine would help to make expections of feeding in the 1st 24 hrs after birth more breastfeeding friendly.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support Home follow up in the early postpartum period period for lactation support should be available to lower incomed women. Many of the problems encountered with breastfeeding do not present themselves until after discharge from the hospital.

 Maternal and Infant Care Practices: Prenatal, Hospital, and Post-Delivery Care Almost every hospital I have been to are not breastfeeding friendly. The first solution to anything is shove formula in the baby&apos;s face. Most hospital do not have policies on using donated breast milk. If the mother does not comply, then the nurses will even resort to threats or belittling the mother for wanting to pump or for not wanting to give formula. I think it should be required that nurses and pediatricians especially take breastfeeding and lactation courses.

 Access to Lactation Care and Support I work in an OB/GYN office with 6 Docs. I&apos;m very discouraged that all we have to offer our potential Breastfeeding Mom&apos;s is a &quot;free&quot; formula bag w/free formula in it. I feel like we are setting them up to fail before they even deliver. It is bad enough that there are no publicised Breastfeeding classes here. I do belong to a new coalition in our area&amp;I do the best that I can to encourage breastfeeding in our office, but I feel like we need free samples of breastfeeding promotional items. Like free breast pads,&amp;nipple cream, etc. Coupons toward pads, breastfeeding supplies, freezer bags, nursing bras,&amp;pumps. Do you have any place that I can contact? I feel like I am standing alone in my office. My office Manager is open to the idea, but the clinic won&apos;t pay for anything since the Formula companies give freely.
