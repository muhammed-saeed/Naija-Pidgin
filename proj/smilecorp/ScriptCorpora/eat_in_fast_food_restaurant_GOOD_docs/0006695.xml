 Organic Restaurants and the Organic Food Advantage 

 Organic restaurants are a new trend in the eating habits of health conscious Americans who are into organic eating and vegan dieting. Organic food advantages have been known for some time, but now market savvy restaurant owners are offering organic ingredients and organic cooking not just as a healthy alternative, but as fine cuisine. It&apos;s official...organic is cool! 

 




 What is organic food? 


The label, organic is used to refer to crops grown in soil without the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. When referring to things of animal origin like meat, milk, and eggs, it means that the animals graze on grass and eat natural rather than commercial feed, and are not given antibiotics, growth hormones or other artificial substances.

This ensures that harmful chemicals do not find their way into the food produced by the animals. As more and more is known about the harmful effects of the chemicals in our food supply, organic food advantages become evident!

 

Organic is more labor intensive than chemical farming; therefore organic ingredients tend to be more expensive on average. The health conscious consumer therefore must weight the added cost against the health benefits of organic cooking.

 Organic Restaurants 


Restaurants must stay abreast of current trends in consumer preferences if they are to survive, and so have begun to embrace the health conscious consumer by emphasizing healthier meals in general, and organic cooking in particular.

It starts with such things as grass fed beef, organically produced eggs, and organically grown produce, and extends to the manner in which the food is prepared as well. Frying is out; steaming, baking, and sautéing are in.

 



The offerings range from having some items on the menu prepared with organic ingredients, to organic restaurants where everything served conforms to the concept of organic food prepared in the most healthful way. They often include foods for those into vegan dieting as well!



Like organic farming, the up front expense of preparing food this way is reflected in the price, but for the health conscious person, it is a price well worth the known organic food advantages.



In some cases individuals may have sensitivities to chemicals used in commercial farming, and so organic eating provides an alternative they can enjoy without being negatively affected.


 Organic Fast Food 


At first this may seem like a strange concept. After all fast food is synonymous with hastily prepared, processed food that is anything but healthy. However this idea is catching on in the restaurant industry, as the criticism of fast food is growing.

The public now wants healthy as well as convenient meals, and once again the industry must change and adapt to meet consumer demand! Organic cooking emphasizes quality rather than speed, but ways will be found to combine organic ingredients with ease of preparation.

In the case of organic fast food restaurants, only part of the menu is prepared this way, but as more customers express an awareness of organic food advantages, it is likely that more of the menu offerings will be organic vs non-organic.

 


 Where To Find Organic Restaurants 


Restaurants that serve organic food are still few and far between. This is an emerging trend, but still not a situation where you will find one on every corner! There are listings online that reflect a growing number of restaurants that feature organic cooking with real organic ingredients!
