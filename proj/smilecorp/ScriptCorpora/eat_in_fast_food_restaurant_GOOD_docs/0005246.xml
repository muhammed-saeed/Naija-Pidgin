Why Buy an Existing Restaurant?
 
 Nov 28, 2007 0 790 
 
If you are looking to become a restaurant owner, you will no doubt spend a lot of waking hours contemplating the mysteries of how to buy a restaurant. You can rest assured there are a lot of great opportunities these days to buy a restaurant. However, with franchises, start-ups, and existing restaurants to choose from, it can be a bit overwhelming to say the least. After reviewing all the possibilities, you may have some tough choices to make. There are going to be challenges with any new business venture, and buying a restaurant will tax all of your business skills. The two most pressing concerns will be growing your restaurant and enticing people to continue to eat there. Your best chances of success may be realized if you buy an existing restaurant business or franchise that is up for resale.

If you decide to buy an existing restaurant business, one of the benefits you will immediately realize is the privilege of examining its historical performance. This will allow you to make some very important business decisions. Your strengths can be of great use even if the restaurant was not profitable in the past, and your greatest hope can be to evolve a winning operation.

 
Existing Restaurants Are Easier to Investigate
 

You should always do a thorough investigation of any piece of real estate—and especially if you plan to buy a restaurant. This will require taking an up close and personal look at its past activities, current operations, nearby competition, and its future business potential. Restaurant traffic speaks volumes about what you can expect in the future. It is also important to monitor health trends and how they fit into the current status of the restaurant as well as your ownership goals.

 
An Infrastructure Already In Place
 

An infrastructure can best be described as the location, equipment, employees, operating systems, and existing supplies. This removes the challenges of starting out at ground zero when buying a restaurant, and will allow you to focus on building the business—which is where your attention should be. A solid infrastructure already in place also allows you to implement new changes more rapidly. With an existing restaurant, there is quicker opening time versus the time needed if it were a new development. The existing customer base of an existing restaurant can carry the business until you are firmly established, and once firmly established, you can then work on bringing in new customers. 
 
The Benefit of Pricing Differences
 

There may be the perception that to buy an existing restaurant business, it will cost more. This is not usually the case. The odds are actually in your favor of saving money in the long run when buying a restaurant where all the amenities are firmly in place. Even if purchasing the restaurant requires a premium down payment—you at least know up front what you are getting. Usually with a new franchise, there are demographic studies done on drive by traffic, demographics, and potential customer bases. These are all studies that try to determine the restaurant&apos;s potential for success. In reality, this is a near impossible task. It is also good to note that a new location can take up to a year or more to build. All of these challenges are avoided for the most part when buying a resale location.

 
Negotiating Flexibility
 

It is not hard to understand why buying a new restaurant will give you a greater margin to negotiate. Owners are usually selling for a specific reason, and if the price is right, chances are you will have few obstacles standing in your way. Remember, everything from the purchase price to the financing package can be negotiable when buying a restaurant.

 
Seek the Help Professionals
 

Regardless of the size of the restaurant business, you should consider using the services of both an accountant and lawyer. The first mistake is to think that with a small restaurant business, you can forego the support of professionals. Accountants and lawyers can be a great defense mechanism in ensuring that you are well aware of any risks involved. Remember though, that the role of the lawyer in purchasing a new restaurant is simply to write the legal terms of what you and the seller agreed upon. Ask the right questions if you plan to buy a restaurant that is for resale. Your goal is to find professionals that will assist—and not simply take your money for drawing up the contracts.
