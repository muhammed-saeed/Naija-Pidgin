Our rates are extremely low beating most of the competition because our processors are direct. Charges come through and deposit in your bank in an efficient manor without all the extra fees.

ATM leasing is becoming more popular with all high risks of fraudulent activity going on in society. ATM’s, which are insured with your business’s insurance, allow you to earn profit off of transactions done within your store’s ATM.

 Review for Master Management Group LLC Dec 02, 2011 1 star 1 2 3 4 5 Master Management Group - #1 SCAM ARTISTS AROUND!! 
Along with everyone before me, I was scammed by this company going under the name of Home Business Capital, Direct Connect Communications, OMNI-DOBA, Northstar Advertising Solutions and now Network Media and Global Web Solutions and 435 Funding.

I was first approached by a Ryan Richardson in February, 2011, whom represented Home Business Capital. Man... could he give a great sales pitch!! Passed me on to Rebecca Taylor in customer support who, again, gave a tremendously good sales pitch including all the bells and whistles - no need to worry - guaranteed to make your initial investment back within 1 year OR I will personally help you make sales to get there!! HAH!! I got suckered into purchasing 5000 leads for $2.00/lead! Nothing has ever happened with these leads, can&apos;t get a hold of anyone to find out what is happening with my campaign. I tried to get my money back but its a dead-end. The way they word their contract, they actually don&apos;t promise anything!!

In June, 2011, I receive a call from a guy named Jo Kenyon who stated he was from Network Media (aka Direct Connect Communications) and was hired by Home Business Capital to handle some 25 contracts (mine included) of theirs. Jo was a great talker as well!! He told me that HBC was in serious trouble and the company that they had hired to conduct all the cold-calling on my 5000 leads went bankrupt and left them holding the bag and that they were close to going bankrupt as welll!

Jo proceeded to tell me that he was being paid boo-coo bucks by HBC to&quot;Take Care of these People&quot;and help their businesses get at least their initial investment back. He said his program was backed by US Grants and that he could get me these grants to provide me with a $40,000 Google campaign that included

1. A true, bonafide website domain name. Nothing like what I got from HBC. This one, I could actually choose a domain name and be able to sell anything I wanted on this site! It would also include all the customer support to do so as well as 120,000 guaranteed hits to my site within 6 months time. 4 Google supplied ads would be on my site in which people could hit those ads and I would make anything from $.02 to $1.00/hit, but make sure YOU don&apos;t hit them (Google will find out and cancel your campaign!) After the 6 months was up, I could turn around and sell my domain name for $40,000! My campaign would cost me $6,694! I told him absolutely NOT!

Jo then put me on hold and came back stating that his boss gave the OK to drop my fee to $4,694. I again, said NO and he responded that if I walked away from this campaign I would lose my investment with HBC and never see a dime. Well, I didn&apos;t want that to happen so I signed up. Do you see SUCKER written across my forehead??

Now its December. I have not received ANYTHING from this campaign! They have supplied me with two websites - the merchant services site and now an online shopping mall which I was to make money every time someone clicked on one of the 4 ads sponsored by Google AND make money every time someone goes through my site to shop using the links provided - Amazon.com is one of them. I have friends/family going on my site all the time and clicking those ads.

When I talk to William Roberts at Network Media about my frustrations he just states that Google won&apos;t send a check for anything under a certain amount(?) and that it takes 2 months for Google to actually send out a commission check. Its now been almost 6 months and still NOTHING!! I seriously doubt I will ever see a commission check from these people!!

I have filed disputes with all the credit cards that were involved with both of these scams and only one has followed through for me. The other two state that there is nothing they can do for me. So I started an investigation of my own:

I first contacted Direct Connect (phone # on my credit card statement) back in October, 2011. I talk with a Tom who referred me to a William Roberts who works with Home Business Capital and can be reached at 877-858-3670 and he should be able to help me with my charges. William Roberts is reached through the same number as my so-called bail-out company, Network Media!!!

I called the number and got a gal, Kerisha, who I have talked to numerous times. She gets me to William Roberts. I tell him where I got his phone number and name and that I was directed to contact him about charges on my credit card. He said that he had NEVER HEARD OF DIRECT CONNECT. I must be mistaken(?) I told him that Tom gave me this number. Again, a TOTAL DENIAL of dealing with this company!! I actually BLEW UP! We were both yelling/screaming at each other for over 20 minutes! He denying everything to do with Home Business Capital, that he was with Network Media, the campaign that his company started up for me had nothing to do with MMG or HBC and that he couldn&apos;t vouch for HBC&apos;s program BUT his was totally legitimate!

Well, to make a long story short, this was when he offered me a second domain name for an online shopping mall. Still haven&apos;t received a penny!

Just a few days ago I got a phone call from a Nichole from Network Media. She stated that she had received two disputes on their campaign with me from my credit card companies. She wanted me to get my credit cards and go online with her so that we could get this straightened out with the banks. I told her I was busy and to call me tomorrow.

The next morning, promptly at 9:00 I get the call. I told Nicole that I wasn&apos;t going to remove these disputes UNTIL I do more research and make sure that they are not a part of the MMG/HBC scam. That was when she put me on hold and I got William Roberts! I reminded him of the previous call I had with him and that I still haven&apos;t received any money from the campaigns. He told me that if I follow through with the disputes, my campaign would be dead in the water and any and ALL commissions will be terminated. I asked him what that amount was, and he stated that he didn&apos;t know. The only way to find out was to drop the dispute(s) and wait for the check to come. YEAH RIGHT! So, I told him that I needed the day to do more investigating and I would get back with him!

I promptly contacted all three of my credit cards companies involved with this scam. I asked them for EVERYTHING they have on the transactions - OMNI-DOBA and Direct Connect (for MMG/HBC) and Precision for Network Media. They couldn&apos;t find anything legitimate for OMNI-DOBA or Precision.

So, I contacted Direct Connect once again. Talked to Tom again and asked him for any phone number(s) he had for MMG and HBC. He again gave me William Roberts and his 877 number. I then told him that I had already spoken with this William Roberts and that he denied any relationship with Direct Connect, HBC and MMG! Tom said he was sending a skype to William as we were speaking and will call me back as soon as he hears anything back.

An hour or so later, I get a call from Tom. He states that he talked with William Roberts and told him to&quot;FIX THE PROBLEM&quot;. That now, he would be handling any leads that come on to my site personally and that William will be contacting me TODAY to set me up with another campaign or anything that will help me!

Never received a call back from William Roberts! NO SURPRISE THERE!

Regarding OMNI-DOBA - I have had absolutely zero luck finding anything out about this credit card processing center! Now it has sparked interest with one of my credit card companies who is now re-opening the dispute. Will know in a few days what their decision is.

Since then, I have taken many days to track down everything I can on Master Management Group and its affiliates and now I am in a HUGE entangled&quot;web&quot;with all of the above mentioned names!

1. Every single name mentioned used the SAME phone number! 877-858-3670 (that is if you can get to this point of finding it!!) Most of the websites are totally bogus - none of the provided phone numbers even work (for example: 866-931-4168 here on this site, just rings and rings and RINGS!)

2. I contacted support@mastermanagementgroup.com and got a person by the name of Tom asking for help with my so-called website www.mastermanagementgroup.com/affiliate#. He promptly told me that the email support I contacted is just for referral and leads only AND that William will be contacting me shortly to help with my questions!

3. I noticed on the bottom of his response the telephone numbers listed (same as on this page) and asked why the numbers aren&apos;t working? Tom promptly answered, AND I QUOTE:&quot;From what I understand they have disconnected those numbers. I used to answer the 866-931-4165 number for leads and affiliate support. But, we have discontinued doing that. I apologize.

4. I responded - How am I supposed to get support and who is handling my campaign and making all the cold calls on the 5000 leads I purchased? Tom: I QUOTE AGAIN: William will have to answer that for you. I will be attempting to close any leads brought forth on your website. They have a team of cold-callers and mass emailers from what I understand? Thanks!&quot;Yes - he used a question mark after his statement!!!

It has been 2 full days since I got this reply and I still haven&apos;t heard from this so-called William! I doubt I ever will!!

If you or a family member are ever contacted by any of these companies - RUN!!! I will continue to update as time goes on! I want to help any of you who have been taken by these people!

 Review for Master Management Group LLC May 01, 2011 1 star 1 2 3 4 5 Dont Fall for it 
I had been thinking about a home business, and this guy calls and said that he got my name because I contacted one of their Home Based Businesses. I thought it might have been a web-site or something I checked out. After listening to this rude man
tell me when I asked questions that I wasn&apos;t listening to him. I listened some more...really stupid. I know better but in the end
I gave them my credit card. Now I have checked them out with the BBB. It&apos;s a start up company from 6/2010 and has numerous names...Big Action Media, Master Management Group, Home Business Capital. It&apos;s a scam!!! Of Course, it sounded to good to be true, and I certainly know better. He caught me at a bad moment. He gave me the same 5% credit card deal as the first review. Now I am calling for a refund and closing out my credit card. Just in case they go further, i

 Review for Master Management Group LLC Mar 22, 2011 1 star 1 2 3 4 5 
Called saying I signed up for them to contact me. Not true. The caller tells me about this M/C Visa terminal company. I asked questions she couldn&apos;t answer. Another got on and as he started his nonsense I was on BBB to look up the company. I asked him the address and he had to look it up. I told him that was a little scary. He then tries to answer my questions that we very specific and well over his head as I have had a number of businesses and knew what the terminal companies are all about. He became flustered and said&quot;Let me put Earl Hobbs on the phone he can answer all your questions.&quot;A man came on the line and said&quot;Hi this is Ron Hobbs.&quot;These guys not only don&apos;t know the product they are trying to push, they don&apos;t know their address or their associates names are. Pathetic at best. He got very frustrated because he kept trying to explain the process of which I, unlike him, understood and he tried to tell me there are businesses paying 5+ % for credit card fees.And I would be getting 21/2% of every transaction. I told him there is no one in business paying anywhere near 5%. He assured me there are&quot;stupid&quot;business owners that truly pay fees this high. I said so you want me to scam companies into believing 5% was the going rate. I told him he was the stupid business and a complete scam. He said he decided I would not work out for his company. I agreed, I told him I really wasn&apos;t good at lying and scamming. These guys are a joke I hope they get caught before they scam someone else.

 Review for Master Management Group LLC Feb 01, 2011 1 star 1 2 3 4 5 Master Managment Group ARE SCAM ARTISTS and commit FRAUD 
This company makes me so mad i want to take a baseball bat out.

My mom came over to my house to get me signed up for this bogus company and i looked online and of course no reviews. Come to find out they have changed their names from Direct connect communications which I then looked up and found out they were totally Frauding people out of their money. They were even telling these nice ladies to not tell their husbands what they were doing and that they would take their money and double it before their husbands would even find out! I am so angy about this. I told my mom to try to get a refund after all they had her pay 500 dollars to start and then extorted 5,000 dollars more out of her for these bogus leads that they never gave to her and I am sure they don&apos;t intend to do anything with themselves.

Credit card processing is a legitimate business but don&apos;t do it through This company I promise you will loose your money and chances are they will fraud you out of everything else you own.

When my mom tried to get her money back they told her they already used the contacts that she paid for. Yeah RIGHT! Its only been a few days!

I will work as hard as I can to make sure these guys to go prison!
