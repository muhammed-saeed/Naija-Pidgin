 Beverage Prices Rising Sharply Prior to Lunar New Year 
 Source : The Epoch Times 
 
 A new wave of surging domestic food prices is hitting China prior to the Lunar New Year. Soaring prices have sparked consumers’discontent while authorities attributed them to last year’s price increases in agricultural products and spiraling labor costs. 
 The Beverage Industry Association pointed out that over 60 percent of beverages consumed in China are made from agricultural products. Compared to a year earlier, the agricultural products used by beverages have increased by more than 50 percent and the beverage packaging material cost has also seen a 20 percent increase. 
 From carbonated Coca-Cola, to Master Kong’s tea, to Queer juice, to Wahaha Milk products, the beverage industry has set off a round of price increases. Juices have risen 10 percent while carbonated drinks by five percent. 
 Master Kong confirmed that the company had recently raised its beverage and bottled water price by 50 to 100 cents per case. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are likely to raise their products price by 10 percent. 
 According to a Taizhou Business Daily report, the carbonated drinks price has been raised in the supermarkets during the New Year. Coke and Pepsi cost 20 more cents per unit. Wahaha milk drink price has been raised from 4 to 4.5 yuan ($0.61 to $0.68) per bottle at a snack shop within the Taizhou Economic Development District in Zhejiang Province. 
 The beverage industry price surge is again caused by the increase in the cost of production. The substantial price rise in raw materials such as apples and oranges, combined with the price increase of sugar and the rising cost of labor and transportation and packaging, drove up the beverage prices. Although the beverage products’promotion hasn’t been reduced, it is greatly scaled down.

 Moutai to Ditch Beer Subsidiary, CR Snow Likely to Take over 
 Source : 21 Century Business Herald 
 
 January 26, Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd. is planning to offload its beer assets, the Moutai Beer brand, potentially to CR Snow Breweries Co. Ltd, the National Business Daily reported Wednesday. 
 The paper cited a source familiar with the situation as saying that Moutai Beer and CR Snow Breweries are in talks over the acquisition. But neither side had commented on the matter so far. 
 Moutai Beer was launched ten years ago with the aim to tap into the high-end beer market in China. 
 A bottle of Moutai Beer could reach as much as RMB 58, the paper said. It is currently sold in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan and Fujian provinces, as well as outbound markets in Hong Kong and the European Union, the report said. 
 But sales of the beer brand remained lackluster over the years, with total sales volume hovering between 50,000-55,000 tons in 2010, the paper cited industry analysts’estimates as saying. 
 “Moutai Beer has had its prime at the beginning, as it has been able to benefit from its parent, the liquor producer’s branding; but as competition in the domestic beer market warmed up, Moutai Beer sales failed to keep up its previous momentum and started to shrink,”said Li Baojun, president of private data house Societ Insight&amp;Decision Co. Ltd. 
 Li added that the deteriorating sales of Moutai Beer was due to a lack of control over the end-user sales, without which brands could hardly survive, even in the case of top brands. 
 “Another problem with Moutai Beer is transportation,”noted another industry analyst, who said that the beer brand’s only plant is located in Zunyi, Guizhou, quite some distance from the high-end beer markets in first-tier cities like Shanghai and Beijing. 
 Almost at the same time, parent company Kweichow Moutai was reported to be planning an investment of RMB 600 million to expand production capacity of Moutai Wangzi by 2,000 tons, an attempt expected to generate RMB 406 million in annual sales revenue upon completion of the expansion.

 Tetra Pak to release new packaging 
 Source : Global Times By Li Qiaoyi 
 
 Global manufacturer of food-packaging containers, Tetra Pak International, plans to utilize its advanced technologies to tailor make containers specifically for the Chinese market, a senior company official said over the weekend. 
 These advances are important to domestic beverage makers and the dairy industry as a whole, as they are undergoing quick expansion in both their product line-ups and brands. 
 We have several types of new food packaging containers in the pipeline, Michel Saboune, director of Front End Innovation and Design at Tetra Pak&apos;s packaging technology department in Sweden, told reporters in Beijing over the weekend. 
 The new designs would take into account specific demand from China&apos;s diverse markets, as Tetra Pak puts &quot;a lot of focus on the Chinese market,&quot; Saboune said, without revealing details of the new packaging. 
 Currently, Tetra Brik, Tetra Prisma and Tetra Fino are several most popular aseptic packages in the Chinese market. Tetra Pak introduced aseptic beverage containers in the late 1950&apos;s and now manufactures and markets food packaging containers, filling systems, and distribution equipment for industrial customers in more than 170 countries. 
 Aseptic technology is used to keep food safe and fresh, while also helping it to retain its original flavor for up to 12 months, without refrigeration or preservatives. 
 Most non-refrigerated juices and milk products use packages similar to Tetra Pak&apos;s aseptic technology. Tetra Pak&apos;s designed production capacity will total 60 billion cartons by 2012 when its second production line at Hohhot, Inner Mongolia converting plant announced in September is opened, the firm said in a statement. Currently, Tetra Pak has four plants in China, including the Hohhot plant, plus a technology center opened in Shanghai in April. 
 New heavy investment plans are not expected in the near future, according to Yang Lei, spokesperson for the firm. 
 Tetra Pak dominates the field of aseptic packaging, with a 79.7 percent market share globally in terms of sales in 2009. In the Chinese market, it held a 70.2 percent share in 2009, followed by a 9.6 percent share held by its smaller Chinese rival - Greatview Aseptic Packaging Co, according to research firm Frost&amp;Sullivan. 
 But despite Tetra Pak&apos;s strong market position, rising competition from its rivals remains a concern, as they too are keen on grabbing a larger slice of the country&apos;s growing aseptic carton packaging market. 
 International rivals including the Switzerland-based SIG Combibloc Group also pose a big challenge, as do some local companies. 
 Beijing-based Greatview Aseptic Packaging, formerly Tralin Pak, floated an initial public offering in December on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the first domestic brand in the field going listed, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley being its underwriters. 
 The firm has two plants in China and a third slated to be built in Germany by 2013. Posted by InfoseekChina at 12:55 PM No comments: Labels: China Dairy , China Juice , China Packaging 
 McDonald&apos;s No Match for KFC in China as Colonel Rules Fast Food 
 Source : Bloomberg News By William Mellor 
 
 On the edge of Tiananmen Square, just across the street from Mao Zedong’s tomb, He Yingying munches on a piece of chicken and gazes at the benign-looking figure beaming down at her. 
 “We love him,”she says, bursting into an impish smile. 
 The 21-year-old student from Beijing’s Capital University of Economics and Business isn’t referring to Mao, whose iconic official portrait dominates the square. She’s talking about a long-dead, white-bearded Kentucky colonel on the logo of the KFC restaurant where she’s feasting on her favorite fast food, Bloomberg Markets reports in its March issue. 
 In its home market, the U.S., KFC is struggling, an also- ran to McDonald’s Corp., the world’s biggest restaurant company, and feuding with some of its own franchisees over how to halt declining profits. 
 In China, KFC has achieved such dominance over McDonald’s and local rivals that Colonel Harland Sanders’s image is a far more common sight in many Chinese cities than that of Mao. That accomplishment is striking in a country where foreign companies often stumbled and ran into roadblocks in the past. 
 The secret to the success of KFC’s parent company, Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum! Brands Inc., can be traced to its use of local ingredients -- both in its management team and on its menus. In the 24 years it has been operating in China, Yum has hired Chinese managers to build partnerships with local companies in its expansion drive and used their expertise to offer an array of regional dishes that appeal to domestic tastes. 
 Local Flavors 
 Today, KFC customers can purchase a bowl of congee, a rice porridge that can feature pork, pickles, mushrooms and preserved egg, as well as buy a bucket of its famous fried chicken. In 2010, Yum expected to make 36 percent of an estimated $2 billion operating profit from 3,700 restaurants in China -- eclipsing for the first time its total earnings from the 19,000 Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC, Long John Silver’s and A&amp;W restaurants it owns in America. Yum announced on Jan. 18 that it will sell its Long John Silver’s and A&amp;W chains in part to focus on China. 
 In the third quarter, Yum’s China profits soared 23 percent compared with a 2 percent decline in the U.S. Yum said in December it expected its U.S. business to return to profit over the whole of 2010. The company will announce fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. 
 In a country that Western companies ranging from Dunkin’Brands Inc. to EBay Inc. have struggled to penetrate, Yum has been opening one new restaurant every 18 hours. It now has a 40 percent market share among fast-food chains compared with 16 percent for McDonald’s, according to Euromonitor International, a London-based market research firm. 
 Regional Reach 
 Starting with one restaurant in 1987, Yum now operates 3,200 KFCs and 500 Pizza Huts in 650 Chinese cities --stretching from the tropical southern island of Hainan to the North Korean border and the desert oases of the ancient Silk Road. KFC’s target: to lift that number fivefold to 20,000. 
 “Yum has become the most successful foreign company in China,”says James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and author of One Billion Customers: Lessons From the Front Lines of Doing Business in China (Free Press, 2005).“They got in early, they adapted the product, they expanded aggressively and they gave their Chinese managers real decision-making power.” 
 China Dependent 
 Yum’s Chinese success story also brings risks. Bearish investors such as hedge-fund managers Hugh Hendry and Jim Chanos are predicting that the world’s second-biggest economy, which has surged an average of 10 percent a year for more than three decades, could slow to a halt if asset bubbles burst and rising labor and food costs bite businesses. 
 Within four years, Yum will be dependent on China for more than half of its global revenue and profit margin, according to Warren Liu, a former Yum vice president who’s now China chairman of Investindustrial Advisors Co., a $2.7 billion European private-equity firm. 
 “I worry about too much reliance on a single market no matter how financially attractive that market is,”says Liu, who wrote the unauthorized KFC in China: Secret Recipe for Success (Wiley, 2008).”If Yum’s China business went south, it would kill the stock,”McGregor says. 
 David Novak, Yum’s Louisville-based chairman and chief executive officer, says that’s not going to happen. He cites estimates from Morgan Stanley and Euromonitor that China’s economy will triple in size over the next decade, lifting another 200 million Chinese into the fast-food-consuming class. 
 “China is the best restaurant opportunity in the 21st century,”Novak, 58, says in an e-mail. 
 Doubling Down 
 Novak has doubled down on China. In 2004, he launched a new chain, East Dawning, which serves only Chinese fast food. Then, in 2009, he acquired a 27 percent stake in Little Sheep Group Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed company that operates 480 restaurants specializing in Mongolian hot pot dishes. 
 Investors are betting that Novak is right. In 2010, Yum shares jumped 40 percent on the New York Stock Exchange compared with a 23 percent rise in McDonald’s shares and a 13 percent increase in the Standard&amp;Poor’s 500 Index. Earnings in the third quarter rose 6.9 percent to $357 million thanks to the surge in China profits. Since Yum Brands was spun off from PepsiCo Inc. in 1997, the stock has risen more than sixfold, compared with the 37 percent rise in the S&amp;P 500 to Jan. 25. 
 ”If you want an easy way to get a piece of the China consumer story, Yum is a good stock to buy into,”says Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group . 
 Margins Squeezed 
 Yet Liu Yang, chairman and chief investment officer of the Chinese unit of London-based Atlantis Investment Management Ltd., says she wouldn’t buy the stock because higher regional minimum wages have pushed up labor costs by as much as 21 percent in major cities and food inflation that hit 9.6 percent in December will increase the price of raw materials. 
 “Yum used to be a good China consumer play, but they will face a squeeze on their margins,”says Hong Kong based Liu, who helps manage $4 billion. 
 Yum executives said at an investor conference in New York in December that the growing importance of the China business could lead to more volatility in the bottom line. 
 “We want to become less China dependent,”Novak told investors.”I don’t know if there’s another China, but I think India, Russia -- you combine a few of these opportunities, and you’ll create another China over time.” 
 Yum’s success in China has resulted in large part from its ability to create a menu that combines its traditional finger- lickin’Western fast food with chopstick-lickin’dishes that appeal to Chinese tastes. 
 Dragon Twister 
 While McDonald’s restaurants in China mostly sell the same U.S.-style burgers, KFC’s menu features dishes that would be un- recognizable to its patrons in the U.S. Alongside the Colonel’s”secret recipe”fried chicken, Chinese KFCs also offer options such as the Dragon Twister, a chicken wrap in a Peking duck-type sauce, and spicy tofu chicken rice based on the cuisine of Sichuan province, home of China’s hottest dishes. 
 Pizza Huts in China bear even less resemblance to their Western counterparts. While a KFC in the People’s Republic still looks like a Western-style fast-food restaurant, Chinese Pizza Huts are marketed as sophisticated venues for the legion of increasingly affluent and status-conscious Chinese. Seated in comfortably cushioned booths, customers can choose from a 106- item menu that includes wine and Chinese-influenced dishes such as scallop croquettes with crushed seaweed and even French- inspired escargot. 
 Circumcision Parties 
 Yum’s cultural flexibility doesn’t end with the localized menu. While fast-food restaurants in the West often host kids’birthday parties, KFCs in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang autonomous region that’s home to the Muslim Uyghur people, advertise parties for the families of boys who have just undergone the religious ritual of circumcision. 
 “KFC is certainly doing better than McDonald’s at becoming more Chinese,”says Su Yi, 28, a lawyer, as he pauses between spoonfuls of mushroom, bacon and rice one recent lunchtime in a packed KFC opposite Beijing’s Jishuitan subway station.“I have lunch at KFC twice a week because there’s always one close by. And when I’m out on a date and want to impress a girl, I take her to Pizza Hut.” 
 China’s embrace of Yum’s brands -- and vice versa -- is most apparent in the center of Beijing, where Colonel Sanders meets Chairman Mao in Tiananmen Square. On the ground level of the three-story KFC, an elaborate mural of the Great Wall greets diners. 
 ‘Fast-Food Culture’ 
 On the second floor, the decor is meant to resemble a hutong -- the traditional Beijing neighborhoods that are disappearing to make way for high-rise office and apartment blocks. The third floor doubles as a gallery for local photographers and painters. A plaque at the entrance describes it as“an exchange channel between KFC fast-food culture and Chinese folk culture.” 
 KFC was founded by entrepreneur Harland Sanders, a former farmhand and streetcar conductor, in 1952. His handwritten recipe for the chain’s fried-chicken batter remains under lock and key in Louisville. The colonel -- an honorary title bestowed by the state of Kentucky -- sold out for $2 million in 1964 to private investors who took the company public four years later, though Sanders continued to be the main spokesman for the chain. 
 Losing‘Fried’ 
 In 1986, Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., as it was then known, was acquired by PepsiCo, which changed the restaurant unit’s name to KFC in 1991 as health-conscious Americans began shunning fried food. 
 In 1997, PepsiCo spun off KFC and its other fast-food businesses into a new company called Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. The company changed its name to Yum! Brands in 2002. 
 KFC’s push into Asia faltered at first. In 1973, the company opened 11 restaurants in the then British colony of Hong Kong but closed them within two years because it couldn’t win over local consumers. A decade later, it returned to Hong Kong and entered Taiwan, where an early joint venture with Japanese partners also ran into trouble. 
 “KFC’s early failure in Hong Kong and Taiwan served as valuable and inexpensive lessons in preparation for its entry into China,”author Liu says. When KFC arrived in 1987 beside Tiananmen Square, China’s population was looking to the West with anticipation, Liu says. 
 Local Management 
 “The first KFC restaurant opened to the warmest embrace imaginable,”Liu writes in his book on KFC. The company had also chosen the right joint-venture partners -- Beijing Corp. of Animal Production, Processing, Industry&amp;Commerce and Beijing Travel&amp;Tourism Corp. -- that were both state-owned, providing the guanxi, or connections, that were essential when setting up a business in China back then. 
 An even more important decision was to entrust management of the China business to ethnic Chinese from Taiwan, Liu says. 
 While other foreign companies entering China recruited American or Southeast Asian-born Chinese managers, Yum hired Chinese from Taiwan, who speak the same Mandarin Chinese as mainlanders and understand their culture better, he says. 
 Those employees were key in helping open up supply lines to allow Yum to reach Chinese locations out of the reach of rival food companies run by overseas managers. The leader of what Taiwan-born Liu describes in his book as the“Taiwan Gang”is Sam Su, 58, chairman of the China business, who in 2008 was promoted to vice chairman of the main board in Louisville and who earned $6.7 million in 2009 -- second only to the $13.1 million earned by CEO Novak. 
 “Sam is a legend in China business,”says McGregor, the former chamber of commerce chairman. Su wasn’t available for comment for this article. 
 U.S. Struggles 
 Yum’s performance in China contrasts with its struggles in the U.S., where revenue declined in 2008 and 2009. 
 Even a promotion involving Oprah Winfrey backfired. In May 2009, Winfrey’s television show offered free meals with online coupons. The result sparked such a rush that KFC stopped redeeming the coupons two days into the scheduled two-week promotion, prompting consumers to sue Yum. KFC President Roger Eaton was forced to apologize for the fiasco. 
 After the free-meal giveaway, grilled-chicken sales continued to slide, the dissident franchisees claim. In 2010, some of Yum’s franchisees sued the company in an attempt to prevent it from promoting the healthier grilled chicken ahead of the more popular fried product, saying it was damaging the brand. Both the customer and franchisee lawsuits are continuing in the U.S. 
 New Competitors 
 It isn’t all roses in China either. Western companies making everything from fast food to autos are being challenged by lower-cost local upstarts. In fast food, Yum is also facing increased competition from Asian chains such as Dicos, a unit of closely held Ting Hsin International Group; Yoshinoya, owned by Tokyo-based Yoshinoya Holdings Co.; and Yonghe King and Hongzhuangyuan, both owned by Manila-based Jollibee Foods Corp., a company that already outsells McDonald’s and Yum in the Philippines. 
 McDonald’s is also mounting a belated challenge. It aims to almost double its 1,100 China stores by 2013, China CEO Kenneth Chan said in an interview in December. 
 For now, though, China’s love affair with Yum’s brands continues. In the KFC overlooking Mao’s tomb, student He Yingying swallows her last morsel of chicken, pronounces it“hao chi,”or delicious, and takes another glance at the colonel’s portrait. 
 “Did he really only sell the business for $2 million?”she asks incredulously.“He must have regretted it later.” 
 Sanders died in 1980, never imagining that his Southern specialties would one day lure millions of Chinese customers, thanks to KFC’s not-so-secret recipe of local business knowledge, Western glamour and spicy regional fare.

 Chinese consumers develops a taste for French wine 
 Source : Beverage Daily By Guy Montague-Jones 
 
 Chinese consumers have developed a taste for French wines in recent years but there are threats ahead that could put the trend in jeopardy. 
 The Chinese wine market has boomed in recent years and shows little sign of slowing down. Statistics from the International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR) put the size of the market at 93 million 9 litre cases in 2009 and it is estimated that the figure passed the 100 million mark in 2010. 
 Imported wine, which currently makes up about 10 per cent of the market, is growing especially fast. Growth has been 46 per cent CAGR over the last 10 years and 72 per cent in the past five years. 
 There is little doubt that the Chinese are drinking more wine, but what type of wine are they drinking? 
 Chinese wine preferences 
 According to José Luis Hermoso, senior analyst at IWSR, their preferences can be summarized in descending order of importance as:“Red wine, then French, then Bordeaux, then Chateau like label” 
 And as for the preferred character of the wine, Hermoso said the Chinese go for easy-to-drink fruity wines without too much of a woody taste. 
 So far France has been a key beneficiary of the Chinese thirst for wine. 
 Hermoso said:“No doubt the image of France as wine’s birth place and the sophistication of France in the Chinese consumer minds (thanks partly to other luxury brands from Cognac to cosmetics or fashion that have been present in the country for years) gives a large advantage to French wines compared to other countries.” 
 Rabobank confirmed that China is fast on its way to becoming a very important market for French wine. With growth of 60 per cent by volume and 100 per cent by value last year, Rabobank analyst Stephen Rannekleiv told BeverageDaily.com that China is becoming the biggest volume market for Bordeaux wine outside of Europe. 
 And even if it is lower value Bordeaux that usually goes to mainland China, Rannekleiv said prices are still better than those paid in Germany, which is the biggest volume market for Bordeaux. 
 Potential threats 
 But the dominance of the French brand is not totally assured. Fraud and low quality products threaten to upset the association of France with high quality. 
 “There are threats ahead: fake bottles, low quality wines shipped to China as French wines and sold at ridiculously high prices could damage the industry in the medium long term,”warned Hermoso. 
 Rannekleiv said many wine producing nations are using emerging markets like China as places to unload excess supply. He warned that such a strategy could be counter productive in the long run. Posted by InfoseekChina at 12:43 PM No comments: Labels: China Wine 
 Toasting the tofu with fine wines as West courts East

 French vineyard Chateaux Margaux seeks to marry wines with a variety of Chinese cuisines 
 BEIJING - A world-renowned French winery is encouraging diners to sample its products during Chinese feasts this Spring Festival rather than imbibing traditional drinks. 
 Bordeaux-based Chateau Margaux sought to match different Chinese cuisines with its range of quality wines. 
 In December, the vineyard hosted three feasts in Beijing and Shanghai in honor of Asian gourmets, celebrities, prominent business figures, leading academics and senior officials to taste and share their views on the results of its efforts. 
 &quot;The Chinese have been used to washing down Chinese cuisine with beer and Cognac from the West. Why not try high-quality French wine?&quot; said Zhuang Buzhong, a Singaporean gourmet. &quot;You can try it, accept it then enjoy it.&quot; 
 Paul Pontallier, general manager and chief wine maker with Chateau Margaux, added: &quot;I hope the Chinese can get to know our high-quality wines with their own food, through their experiences combining Chinese cuisine and French wines. 
 &quot;We are not pretending to sell more wines here. It&apos;s all about our long-term commitment to marry the Chinese cuisine icon with French wine, and our long-term understanding on how Chinese culture marries French culture.&quot; 
 Pontallier said Chateau Margaux has already invited two chefs to try innovative matches of vegetable dishes with wines for vegetarians at its headquarters. 
 &quot;We are confident our global experience can help us bring wine with Chinese dishes to a superior level and add Chinese cuisine with wines into the global diet culture,&quot; said Thibault Pontallier, son of the general manager and the ambassador for Chateau Margaux in Asia. 
 Pontallier junior made China his focus after taking up his position developing the brand across Asia. 
 Over the past year, he has traveled around China to taste different styles of cooking in order to understand the complex Chinese diet, as well as seeking many times to find the perfect match between Chinese cuisines and Chateau Margaux wines. 
 &quot;We found it&apos;s not difficult to match Chinese dishes with wines because, like Chinese cuisine, French diet varies from lighter, simple dishes to more complicated offerings,&quot; said Pontallier junior. &quot;And some Chinese food and sauces go very well with the tannin in our wines, making the flavor more subtle and tasty.&quot; 
 Chateau Margaux has found perfect matches between Chinese tofu and its fresh, dry white Pavillon Blanc 2009, Peking roast duck and Pavillon Rouge 2003, and sea cucumber with Chateau Margaux 1989. 
 &quot;Now we are entering the stage of bringing together people who can appreciate it and exchange views to help us find a perfect diet list of Chinese cuisine with wine,&quot; said Pontallier junior. 
 &quot;In a country with an extensive and profound tea culture, we are confident the local people can also respect wines, another fantastic drink in the world.&quot; 
 After experimenting with Shandong and Shanghai cuisine, Chateau Margaux will now try more food and wine matches with more Chinese cooking styles, said Pontallier junior. 
 &quot;We just want to bring wine culture to the Chinese through their own experiences, not to teach,&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s not all for business because we are worried whether we can provide enough wine for the Chinese market after people here get to know our brand and high-quality wines.&quot; 
 To further showcase its long-term commitment to China, Chateau Margaux, together with the China Great Wall Society, launched the 2010 Great Wall Protection Project in July last year, offering help in securing the future of China&apos;s most precious treasure. 
 &quot;Chateau Margaux cellars and estate premises were classified as historical monuments in 1946. We are therefore dedicated to the preservation of historical monuments and we are pleased to be able to extend our philosophy all the way to China and to such an exceptional historical marvel of architecture,&quot; said Pontallier junior. 
 A group of more than 30 volunteers, Great Wall experts and media traveled along the Great Wall from east to west, covering 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. During the 9,500-kilometer journey, the group examined the current condition of the Great Wall in more than 20 sections and fortresses and successively held 15 themed activities. 
 The project results helped to educate and promote awareness among the public about the importance of the preservation of the Great Wall of China. 
 Famed since the 12th century as one of the four best French Bordeaux vineyards, Chateau Margaux successively won the favor of the former American President Thomas Jefferson, the French Emperor Napoleon III and, more recently, China&apos;s President Hu Jintao, it being the only winery the latter visited during his stay in France in 2001. 
 Chateau Margaux currently produces three rare &quot;treasures&quot;: Chateau Margaux, Pavillon Rouge and Pavillon Blanc. 
 The average annual production of the Grand vin, Chateau Margaux, is 150,000 bottles, while the second wine, Pavillon Rouge du Chateau Margaux, has an average production of 200,000 bottles. The dry white Pavillon Blanc du Chateau Margaux has a production of around 35,000 bottles. 
 A bottle of Chateau Margaux 1787 holds the record as the most expensive bottle of wine. It was valued at $500,000 by its owner but was accidentally broken by a waiter in 1989. Insurers paid $225,000, a sum worth about $390,000 at today&apos;s prices, according to the WhatItCo$t$ website. Posted by InfoseekChina at 12:30 PM No comments: Labels: China Wine 
 Grape wall of China cracks 
 Source : The Sydney Morning Herald By Sarah Whyte and John Garnaut 
 
 HIT HARD by a grape glut and higher dollar, Australia&apos;s wine industry is looking to a new saviour - stylish young professionals in China with a taste for our finest shiraz. 
 Australian wine exports to China grew by 36 per cent last year, overtaking the growth of the British, US and Canadian wine markets, new figures show. 
 Shiraz was by far the most popular drop for the Chinese, comprising almost half of the sales, followed by cabernet sauvignon and merlot, according to a December report by Wine Australia. 
 The scale of the opportunity in China is unlike any other market encountered before, Wine Australia&apos;s Asian director Lucy Anderson said. 
 &apos;&apos;If Australia&apos;s [wine] share continues to grow at this rate we can expect a growth opportunity in China of around half a million cases during 2011,&apos;&apos; she said. 
 Ms Anderson puts the popularity down to better access to wine in urban China, a trend towards drinking wine over local spirits and a population that has higher disposable incomes. Wine bars have cropped up in Beijing, as well as restaurants with expansive wine lists. 
 Nancy Wang, manager at Australian-owned Capital M restaurant in Beijing, said the new generation in China was getting a rudimentary wine knowledge, and favoured Australian wines as they were easier to quaff. 
 &apos;&apos;They know old-world wine is harder to drink; new-world wine like Australian wine is fruitier, drinkable wine and that&apos;s what they like,&apos;&apos; Ms Wang said. &apos;&apos;They don&apos;t really know the brands, they only know the grape and maybe the vintage. They tend to like something full-bodied like cabernet sauvignon.&apos;&apos; 
 Wine drinking is a mark of status for young urban Chinese, like driving a new sports car, said Dr Jenny Chio from the Centre for Social and Cultural Change in China Investment at the University of Technology Sydney. &apos;&apos;Drinking red wine is considered cosmopolitian in urban China,&apos;&apos; Dr Chio said. &apos;&apos;This is part and parcel of the rapid increase of personal spending.&apos;&apos; 
 One of the most visible Australian brands in China is Penfolds. A spokesman said their red label premium wine was doing particularly well. &apos;&apos;There is a huge push for the finer things in life in China at the moment, and strong premium red wines fits into this luxury goods market,&apos;&apos; the spokesman said. &apos;&apos;Of the 35 million cases Penfolds export a year, 1 million of those are to China.&apos;&apos; 
 Two smaller South Australian wine makers, Bird in Hand and Shingleback, said China had huge potential in the premium wine market. 
 &apos;&apos;We are expecting major growth in that market, more than double in sales a year,&apos;&apos; Bird in Hand global sales director Justin Nugent said. 
 Younger Chinese professionals concerned with their image and future direction were embracing premium wine, ranging from $30-$70, with enthusiasm, Mr Nugent said. &apos;&apos;There is a change in cultural preferences with the interest in wine and good food.&apos;&apos; 
 Shingleback general manager Carey Weston said there was strong demand for red wine ranging from $25-$35 a bottle. &apos;&apos;Our exports have grown in China by 50 per cent in the last four years,&apos;&apos; Mr Weston said. 
 Wine Australia says China wine sales in 2010 were about 2.7 million cases in a total market of 160 million cases. China is the fourth-largest market, but still only a third of the value of exports to Britain. The country of the fastest-growing economy in the world is expected to increase its annual consumption by 20 per cent to 126.4 million cases by 2014.

 New Pepsi campaign puts Pepsi Cola and Lays together 
 Source : Campaign China By Jin Bo 
 
CHINA - For the first time, Pepsi China has united two of its brands - Pepsi Cola and Lays - with the launch of two related TVCs.

The TVCs, produced by BBDO, are part of the brands&apos; latest campaign for the Chinese New Year.

The core idea behind the campaign, which runs across TVC, packaging and out-of-home, is a lion dance - an iconic Chinese ritual for the Chinese New Year celebration.

The TVCs, launched as trailers for a Pepsi mini movie, have different storylines and were shot by different directors, but at the same location. Both feature A-list pop idols, including Lee Hom Wong and Angela Cheung in the Lays&apos; part, and Huang Xiaoming and Ethan Ruan in the Pepsi Cola&apos;s part.

Another pop star, Angelababy, stars in both ads. The ads are also creatively linked to blockbuster happy-new-year movie Super Happiness, also starring Angelababy. Posted by InfoseekChina at 12:22 PM No comments: Labels: China Marketing , Pepsi China

 Tsingtao planning to hire China auditor in HK 
 Source : By Peter Brieger (AFP) 
 
 HONG KONG—Plans by brewer Tsingtao that could see it become the first Hong Kong-listed Chinese company to ditch its foreign auditor have stoked fresh concerns over the validity of mainland firms&apos; balance sheets. 
 Tsingtao will ask shareholders next month to vote on a proposal that would let a Chinese accountant sign off on its books, after Hong Kong&apos;s bourse relaxed rules requiring the job be done by firms outside the mainland. 
 Worries about the accuracy of its firms&apos; books have long dogged China and the controversial changes in Hong Kong have also raised questions about how much power the city&apos;s watchdog will have over mainland auditors. 
 In a move expected to be followed by other Hong Kong-listed mainland firms, the brewer said it reached a deal with PricewaterhouseCoopers to hire the accounting giant&apos;s local affiliate to &quot;improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of disclosure&quot;. 
 The concerns are made even more real as mainland companies account for 42 percent of those listed in Hong Kong. 
 The bourse defended the new rules, saying Chinese standards mirrored international rules and other exchanges, including New York and London, have already recognised China&apos;s accounting regime. 
 But observers warn that the changes will further erode Hong Kong&apos;s power to punish auditing firms that are either incompetent or complicit in approving suspect financial statements. 
 &quot;There is a concern because nobody knows who these mainland auditing firms are -- they haven&apos;t established a reputation in the market,&quot; said Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. 
 &quot;There is no particular reason to think the (PwC affiliate) won&apos;t do a good job, but I think investors will wonder because these firms are not well known.&quot; 
 Allen added that the fact China&apos;s financial system is still young should raise questions about its accounting standards. 
 &quot;How long has China had a functioning financial system? Not that long,&quot; he said. &quot;So how in the world could they have developed a system that lives up to the international system?&quot; 
 The changes would also force the city&apos;s market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), to rely on Chinese authorities to take action against mainland accounting firms suspected of wrongdoing. 
 Previously, the SFC could take action against a Hong Kong-based auditor for a mainland company listed in the city. 
 &quot;The regulatory authority will rest in China,&quot; Allen said. 
 &quot;If something goes wrong, the Hong Kong regulator has no real power to take action.&quot; 
 It has always been tough for city authorities to punish executives of a Hong Kong-listed mainland firm, but &quot;at least you could take action against the auditor&quot;, he added. 
 However, prominent shareholder activist David Webb said the changes would likely mean little as international accounting firms already rely heavily on their local offices to prepare mainland clients&apos; financial statements. 
 Hong Kong&apos;s self-regulated accounting sector is also relatively lax itself, Webb said, noting that current rules restrict investors&apos; ability to sue Chinese firms&apos; auditors even if they&apos;re based outside the mainland. 
 &quot;I don&apos;t think it could be much worse with mainland auditors,&quot; he added. 
 One Hong Kong accountant familiar with the new rules said Chinese regulators would keep a close eye on local accounting firms -- and approve only a select group to do this audit work. 
 &quot;I don&apos;t think they&apos;re going to let just any firm do this work&quot; he said. 
 &quot;They don&apos;t want a huge embarrassment on their hands.&quot; Posted by InfoseekChina at 11:03 AM No comments: Labels: China Beer , Tsingtao Brewery Co. 
 China growing a powerful thirst for wine drinking 
 Source : By Edward Mills (China Daily) 
 
 Wine has not often been something associated with China in the recent past. While Chinese spirits, like baijiu, are incredibly popular, grape wine had traditionally not held much interest among Chinese people. During the last few years, however, there has been increasing curiosity surrounding wine and the market itself has significantly taken off as a result. 
 Since favorable tax conditions were enacted in Hong Kong two years ago, the region has become the hub of the fine-wine world. Sotheby&apos;s auction house made 60 percent of its total worldwide sales this year in the region, with their total 2010 wine sales through Hong Kong reaching $52.6 million. 
 It&apos;s not just fine wine that&apos;s enjoying significant growth in the Chinese market, with the affluent keen to supplement their new wine cellars with affordable varieties. Asia&apos;s wine consumption is predicted to rise by 25 percent across the next five years, with China playing a big part in those figures. 
 Even on the mainland, the wine revolution is well underway. It&apos;s noticeable in Beijing on a personal level, where good establishments serving these beverages were few and far between but, these days, affordable wine-bars are springing up everywhere, especially in the Central Business District and surrounding area. 
 Less than a decade ago, it could be a challenge to find affordable wine that wasn&apos;t a Cabernet Sauvignon produced on the mainland. These days, it&apos;s possible to discover more exciting grapes, like Viognier and Zinfandel, and from all areas, even outside the bigger cites like Beijing and Shanghai. 
 The interest in international wine is obvious, but what about domestic production, is it possible for Chinese wines to take their place among the great wines of the world? It seems that domestic producers still have a long way to go to achieve that. 
 The regulation of the wine market in China in the past has been criticized for lacking quality control and it seems that the problem has yet to be fully rectified. A number of wine producers can be found in every supermarket, especially the big ones, but all too often grape-related beverages suffer from a greater emphasis on marketing than production, perhaps due to wine being viewed more as a status symbol than something to enjoy. 
 China is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world by pure volume, but the focus for many needs to be shifting away from quantity to quality and to produce wines of international standard. 
 That said, some of the country&apos;s own vineyards are beginning to shine. Once having a reputation of being mediocre compared with global wine, especially its European contemporaries, local winemakers are beginning to pass out products that the global market is showing interest in. 
 The big winemakers have won many international awards for their high-end products. Relatively new players, like Grace Vineyard of Shanxi, have also been attracting a lot of justifiable attention, both in China and abroad, with these winemakers&apos; entry-level wines competing at a similar price and drinkability to their imported counterparts. 
 According to Berry Bros&amp;Rudd&apos;s Future of Wine report, China&apos;s wine quality will &quot;rival the best of Bordeaux&quot;. The London-based wine merchants suggests that: &quot;It is entirely conceivable that, in such a vast country, there will be pockets of land with a terroir and micro-climate well suited to the production of top quality wines.&quot; 
 They aren&apos;t the only ones suggesting that the region&apos;s local quality wine has the potential to grow fast. 
 &quot;China, as the world&apos;s fastest-growing economy, has huge market potential in the wine industry and it will become the world&apos;s most important wine producer as well as consumer in the near future,&quot; according to the president of the International Organization of Vine and Wine. 
 Confucius is often said to have stated: &quot;There is no one who does not eat and drink, but there are few who can really know flavor.&quot; Perhaps this could be the situation regarding wine in China today, but in the future, this will change and the wine world is welcoming it.

 Remy Cointreau in China 
 Source: just-drinks.com 
 
 This week there were two noteworthy stories from Just-Drinks regarding Remy Cointreau in China. The first, &quot; Cointreau toasts China&apos;s Cognac Thirst in Q3 &quot; and second a comment by Chris Mercer, &quot; Remy Cointreau: What if China Overheats ?&quot; 
 Cointreau toasts China&apos;s Cognac Thirst in Q3 
 
 Cognac drives 18% sales rise Group thrives on Chinese thirst Expects tougher Q4 

Remy Cointreau has reported a strong sales increase in its fiscal third quarter as Chinese consumers continued to demand premium Cognac. Net sales for the three months to the end of December increased by 17.5% to EUR266.7m (US$358.5m), Remy Cointreau said today (20 January). Cognac sales rose by 26% on the same quarter of the previous year, to EUR128.1m.

The French group said that Remy Martin &quot;continued to develop strongly in Asia&quot; during the quarter. The Cognac brand&apos;s sales increased by 19% excluding currency gains, with momentum also returning to travel retail and the US.

China&apos;s thirst for high-end Cognac has put the company on a good trajectory for its fiscal year. &quot;The group forecasts good growth in turnover and financial results for the 2010/11 financial year,&quot; said Remy. However, sales are set to slow in the fourth quarter due to the earlier timing of Chinese New Year, the group added. Its share price fell by 3% in early trading.

The group&apos;s Champagne business, which is set to be sold off, increased sales by 11% in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Remy&apos;s spirits and liqueurs division continued to be hampered by sales declines for Metaxa in Greece.

For the first nine months of the year, Remy reported sales up by 18% on the previous year, to EUR694.8m. Currency gains accounted for 7% of the increase.

 Comment- Remy Cointreau: What if China overheats 

Remy Cointreau has reaped the rewards of China&apos;s galloping thirst for pricey Cognac and the group&apos;s fortunes now appear inextricably linked to those of the Asian powerhouse.
 Is it always best to hedge your bets? Remy Cointreau, presumably, would answer a definitive &apos;no&apos; after seeing Remy Martin sales continue apace in its fiscal third quarter. Chinese consumers lapped up stocks ahead of Chinese New Year to help Remy forget about the nightmare that has unfolded for its business in Greece during the past 12 months. 
Cognac will command a much bigger slice of Remy&apos;s time in 2011 if the company succeeds in selling its Champagne business, as it appears determined to do. Only a spirits and liqueurs portfolio, dominated by the elderly Cointreau and the promising-but-small Mount Gay rum, will remain alongside Remy Martin. 
As long as China performs, then, Remy Cointreau will perform. In a small way, this was highlighted today when the company&apos;s share price slipped by 5% on the Paris stock exchange after it warned that sales in China would slow in the fourth quarter. 
 China&apos;s economic performance could provide a more serious headache for the company in the months ahead, however. The country&apos;s economy increased by 10% in 2010, the biggest rise since the onset of the global financial crisis. That sort of increase in the US would make President Obama weep tears of joy. But, there is a problem. 
 China&apos;s figures have fuelled fears that its economy is in danger of over-heating, with consumer price inflation a particular cause for concern. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs issued a short-term alert on both China and India. &quot;Asia is not in the sweet part of the cycle,&quot; Goldman&apos;s chief strategist for Asia-Pacific, Tim Moe, was quoted as saying. &quot;The longer-term picture of Asia outperforming the US is taking a breather.&quot; 
 Observers in recession-hit western nations will no doubt note the absurdity of China attempting to slow its economy down. Yet, many believe that is what needs to happen. &quot;In 2011, we need to take the task of controlling prices very seriously,&quot; the commissioner of China&apos;s National Bureau of Statistics, Ma Jiantang, was quoted as telling journalists in the country this week. 
 Also this week, French bank Societe Generale said in a note: &quot;If things go well, the authorities will bring things under control. If they don’t, the economy continues to overheat, inflation rises further/faster and the economy suffers a hard landing in late 2011/early 2012.&quot; 
 There is every reason to believe that China will find a way through the swamp. That said, emerging markets are notoriously bumpy terrain. Remy Cointreau&apos;s reliance on just one nation - albeit the biggest of the BRICs - remains a gamble.

 Colonel Sanders: China&apos;s favorite import 
 Source : CNN Money By Paul R. La Monica 
 
 NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Colonel Sanders is an iconic American brand image. The K in KFC is for Kentucky after all. So it may come as a surprise that KFC&apos;s parent company actually generates more sales from China than the United States. 
 Yum! Brands, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, has been a phenomenal success in China. 
 With China&apos;s president Hu Jintao in America this week to meet with President Obama, as well as a bevy of U.S. business leaders, there is more attention on the world&apos;s most populous nation than there has been in quite some time. 
 And Yum may be a model for other large multinational U.S. firms that are attracted to the vast growth potential in China. 
 Yum&apos;s China sales hit $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2010, up 20% from the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, Yum&apos;s sales in the U.S. totaled $970 million, down 8% from the third quarter of 2009. There is no denying that China is now the biggest reason to consider investing in Yum&apos;s stock. 
 &quot;China and other international markets are going to continue to drive Yum&apos;s sales and profits, not the U.S.,&quot; said John Fox, manager of the FAM Value Fund in Cobleskill, N.Y. 
 Clearly, China is a market that the U.S. can&apos;t ignore even though there are a myriad of political, cultural and geographical challenges. 
 How has the company been able to do it? In an e-mailed response to my questions, Yum cited its &quot;first mover advantage&quot; as a key reason for its success. The company entered China in 1987 with KFC and introduced Pizza Hut in 1990. 
 Fox added that Yum wisely didn&apos;t try to transplant the exact look and feel of its U.S. restaurants to China. 
 &quot;Their restaurants are different in China. They are more like casual dining and upscale than fast food. They&apos;ve made the menu acceptable to locals,&quot; he said. 
 Yum pointed out, for example, that KFC restaurants in China also feature seafood and beef while Pizza Hut serves rice dishes. The company also has a 27% stake in Mongolian-style hot pot chain Little Sheep. 
 But what&apos;s most remarkable about the company&apos;s growth in China is that it is almost entirely due to KFC. 
 Yum had 3,664 restaurants in China as of the end of the third quarter. More than 3,000 of them (83%) were KFC stores while the remainder were Pizza Huts. Yum did open some Taco Bells in China in 2003 but they were closed by 2008. 
 Why China matters 
 The company didn&apos;t indicate if it planned to reintroduce Taco Bell in China, only saying that it intended to make Taco Bell its third global brand and noting that there were new restaurants opened in India and South Korea. 
 Even if Yum doesn&apos;t try to bring chalupas back to China, it would appear that it has a long way to go before it saturates the Chinese landscape with Pizza Huts. In Yum&apos;s other international markets, Pizza Hut makes up more than a third of the company&apos;s total stores. 
 Yum has signaled that more growth in China is on the menu. The company announced Tuesday that it planned to sell two smaller underperforming chains it owns -- seafood restaurant Long John Silver&apos;s and A&amp;W Restaurants, a burger joint featuring Dr Pepper Snapple Group-owned A&amp;W root beer. 
 In a statement about the sale, Yum said that it is &quot;sharpening its long-term growth focus on building leading brands in every significant category in China.&quot; 
 The company added that it expects profits from China and other international markets to reach 75% of total earnings by 2015, up from about 65% in the first nine months of 2010. 
 That would be an astonishing feat. Yum rival McDonald&apos;s currently generates 56% of its profits from overseas markets. 
 And China is still such a negligible part of Mickey D&apos;s total sales that it gets lumped into the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa category for reporting purposes. 
 But McDonald&apos;s is also recognizing China&apos;s allure. The company made waves last year by becoming the first U.S. firm to sell yuan bonds in Hong Kong. That move was later followed by construction equipment giant Caterpillar. 
 Yum would not say if the company planned any debt sales of its own in China. 
 Still, is it possible that Yum, by focusing on China so heavily, could wind up being overexposed to that market -- especially if trade and currency tensions boil over between the U.S. and China? 
 That seems like a stretch. Peter Wood, a co-manager for the Chase Growth Fund in Charlottesville, Va., which owns the stock, said that it&apos;s highly unlikely there would be a consumer or government backlash to Yum. 
 &quot;I really don&apos;t think there would be an impact from whatever happens between China and the U.S. regarding the yuan,&quot; Wood said. &quot;Yum has done such a great job of becoming part of Chinese consumers&apos; daily lives.&quot; Posted by InfoseekChina at 10:45 AM No comments: Labels: China Restaurants , China Retail , McDonald&apos;s China , Yum China 
 McDonald&apos;s eyes growing presence in local market 
 Source : By Wang Ying (China Daily) 
 
 SHANGHAI - A contemporary addition has joined Shanghai&apos;s traditional breakfast foods staples - McDonald&apos;s meals. 
 Since the corporation entered the Shanghai market in 1994, the popularity of the Egg McMuffin and its ilk is catching up to the city&apos;s longstanding morning meal favorites - dabing (Chinese pancakes), youtiao (deep-fried dough sticks), cifantuan (steamed sticky rice balls) and soymilk. And while this trend shows no sign of naturally slowing down, the multinational chain plans to step up efforts to accelerate it. 
 The fast food giant, headquartered in a suburb of Chicago - the city that hosts President Hu Jintao on Thursday - is trying to expand its China presence and adapt to the emerging power&apos;s ever-changing business environment. 
 &quot;People in urban cities need a lot of convenience,&quot; McDonald&apos;s China CEO Kenneth Chan said. 
 &quot;And everything has to be moderate in terms of how they spend their money, as everything is much more expensive in first-tier and second-tier cities.&quot; 
 McDonald&apos;s business model has been designed to meet such demand, Chan said. 
 &quot;We are located conveniently, open 24 hours with 24-hour delivery, and our breakfast starts at 5 am. Every day, we provide good value. And at the same time, we give our customers a break in a busy city life.&quot; 
 China, along with Australia and Japan, is one of the three biggest contributors to the company&apos;s business in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions. Having weathered SARS and the global recession, McDonald&apos;s has maintained double-digit annual growth nationwide, Chan said. 
 As the global foodservice leader, McDonald&apos;s plans to increase its investment in the country by 40 percent in 2011. It will open new restaurants, redesign old stores and introduce more convenient services, Chan said. 
 Between 175 and 200 new restaurants are projected to open across China in 2011. 
 McDonald&apos;s will operate 2,000 restaurants in the country by 2013, Chan said. 
 &quot;It took 19 years to open 1,000 restaurants, and we are going to double that to 2,000,&quot; Chan said. 
 The chain currently operates about 1,300 stores in 150 cities across China, and its capital investment in the country has reached 7 billion yuan ($1.06 billion). 
 About 99 percent of McDonald&apos;s China&apos;s employees are Chinese, and the company is actively developing local talent to cultivate executives, Chan said. 
 In 2010, McDonald&apos;s spent 150 million yuan to open a Hamburger University in Shanghai. The school provides restaurant training for managers and executive classes to train future leaders. 
 In less than a year, Shanghai&apos;s Hamburger University has trained about 1,000 people, and at least 5,000 more graduates are expected in the next five years. 
 &quot;If you want sustainable business you have to get local people to run the business,&quot; Chan said. 
 &quot;They know how to navigate in the business environment here, and they know the business status quo much better than somebody sitting in Chicago. We are getting close, and I am an Asian here.&quot; 
 Chan himself is also a beneficiary of McDonald&apos;s training. He joined the company as an assistant marketing manager in his native Singapore in 1993. 
 &quot;At that time, I would not have imagined that one day I will be the managing director in Singapore,&quot; he said. 
 He came to the Chinese mainland in early 2009. 
 In addition to its retail business, McDonald&apos;s also has vast property investments. 
 Chan said the company is looking for more suitable locations, &quot;especially those locations where we are able to put our drive-thru restaurants&quot;, Chan said. Posted by InfoseekChina at 10:41 AM No comments: Labels: China Restaurants , China Retail , McDonald&apos;s China

 January 20, Bright Food (Group) Co. Ltd, one of China’s largest food conglomerates, has unveiled its strategic development strategies for 2011, saying that a huge part of its sales growth this year would rely on acquired assets, the official China Securities Journal reported on Thursday. 
 The company, which made the announcement at a press conference in Shanghai on Wednesday, also said it planned to integrate its sugar assets before launching an overseas initial public offering. 
 Starting in 2011, the group plans to integrate Yingmao Sugar Industry Co. Ltd.—a Yunnan-based sugar producer acquired by Bright Food in August 2009—with its own sugar unit, Dongfang Xiandao (DFXD) Sugar&amp;Wine Co. Ltd., the paper said. 
 Yingmao Sugar had planned to list in Hong Kong before Bright Food came forward with its RMB 800 million takeover offer. 
 Citing unsourced statistics, the paper said Bright Food’s sugar sales volume would exceed 2.1 million tons in 2010, which would help the company post record-high sales revenue of RMB 10 billion. 
 The group also earned a 40% return on its investment in Yingmao Sugar in 2010, the report said. 
 Bright Food pointed out that it would accelerate development in central and western China by raising production capacity and perfecting its sales network, the report said. 
 The Shanghai-based food giant currently has four listed units, including Bright Dairy&amp;Food Co. Ltd. (600597.SH) and Shanghai Jinfeng Wine Co. Ltd. (600616.SH). 
 Bright Food is looking at acquisition opportunities in a wide array of sectors from dairy to liquor, group vice president Ge Junjie said. 
 “Bright Food hopes to enter the rice wine sector, a type of traditional Chinese liquor, through acquisitions,”a company insider told the China Securities Journal. The company would also look to acquire liquor and grape wine firms, the insider said. 
 Bright Food is currently looking for grape wine assets in Australia, the insider added. 
 Last year, Shanghai-based Bright Food and its subsidiaries stepped up their pursuit of acquisition targets 
 Despite losing out on sugar refiner Australian CSR Ltd. to Singaporean food company Wilmar International Ltd. (SIN: F34), the group’s dairy unit succeeded in acquiring New Zealand milk processor Synlait Milk Ltd, paving the way for its entry into the high-end baby milk powder market. 
 Production of baby milk powder aimed at the Chinese market will start later this year, Bright Food said. 
 The group is still in talks to buy British snacks maker United Biscuits (Holdings) Ltd., which is owned by U.S. private equity company Blackstone Group LP (NYSE: BX) and French buy-out firm PAI Partners SAS. 
 Bright Food’s sales revenue from primary businesses jumped 22% year-on-year in 2010 to RMB 61.8 billion; net profit rose 45% from a year earlier to RMB 3.2 billion. 
 Bright Food said it expected sales revenues from its core businesses to reach RMB 75 billion in 2011 and RMB 90 billion in 2012. Posted by InfoseekChina at 10:37 AM No comments: Labels: China Acquisitions Mergers , China Dairy , China Spirits , China Wine 
 CR Vanguard&apos;s Sales In 2010 Reached CNY71.8 Billion 
 Source : China Retail News 
 
 China Resources Vanguard, the retail subsidiary of China Resources (Holdings) Company, has announced that in 2010, the company opened over 450 new stores and realized sales of CNY71.8 billion. 
 Vanguard&apos;s newly-opened stores reportedly include about 60 large supermarkets; nine high-end supermarkets under the brands of Ole&apos; and Blt; one Fun2 shopping mall; and 70 CR Care stores. 
 Vanguard revealed that in 2011, it plans to open over 400 new outlets, including 70 to 80 large supermarkets and ten high-end supermarkets. It will complete its debuts in cities, including Guangzhou, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Jinan. It will also introduce its Vivo+ and Pacific Coffee brands into the Chinese mainland market. 
 Vanguard said that during the year 2010, its high-end supermarket brand Ole&apos; entered Shanghai, Hangzhou and Ningbo for the first time. Its development layout was expanded with new marketplaces like Hubei, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia, in addition to newly signed projects in Shanxi and Heilongjiang. 
 By the end of 2010, Vanguard has reportedly opened stores in 27 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions in China.

 RT-Mart, Auchan Likely to List Combined China Assets by end of H1 
 Source : 21 Century Business Herald 
 
 January 17, The Hong Kong initial public offering of the combined mainland stores of Taiwanese supermarket chain RT-Mart and France’s second-largest food retailer Groupe Auchan SA is close to taking place, China Business News reported Monday, citing an insider familiar with the matter. 
 According to the insider, around five underwriters have approached RT-Mart and Auchan about the listing, including UBS AG (NYSE:UBS) and HSBC Holdings Plc. (LON:HSBA), both of which are potential candidates, the paper said. 
 “The two supermarket chains will start combining their balance sheets after the Spring Festival celebration,”the insider was quoted as saying. 
 China’s annual Spring Festival will fall on Feb. 3 this year; celebrations including family gatherings will last for a whole week. 
 Chinese media reports in June last year said the IPO would take place as early as the first quarter of 2011, and was expected to raise $600 million-$800 million. International media reports last week put that figure at around $1 billion, citing people familiar with the situation. 
 The IPO has been delayed due to a series of uncertainties, mostly involving problems with stake holdings, the report said. 
 RT-Mart’s parent group Taiwan Ruentex Group, run by one of Taiwan’s richest men, Samuel Yin, expanded into mainland China in 1997 by forming a Hong Kong-based joint venture with Auchan. 
 Ruentex had a 67% stake in the JV. But the investment group sold two thirds of its equity in RT-Mart to Auchan before the JV was established, leading to a cross-holding of stakes. 
 The combined assets will be placed in Sun Holdings Greater China Ltd., which will be listed before the end of June, RT-Mart sources were quoted as saying. 
 RT-Mart posted 2010 sales revenue of RMB 50.6 billion, up 25% year-on-year; Auchan recorded sales revenue of RMB 10 billion in mainland China last year, the report said. 
 By early August, RT-Mart was operating more than 130 stores in the mainland, compared with Auchan’s 42. 
 RT-Mart has opened 10 new stores in the first half of January, including two that were inaugurated on Monday. The supermarket chain hopes to speed up its mainland-based expansion this year; it opened 22 mainland stores last year.

 Carrefour China Tangled up in another Pricing Dispute with Suppliers 
 Source : 21 Century Business Herald 
 
 January 19, A dispute has broken out between French retail giant Carrefour SA (EPA:CA) and China’s largest food group COFCO Ltd. over the annual purchasing negotiations for the Chinese company’s Fortune edible oil brand. 
 “Carrefour is pushing us overboard when it comes to price negotiations; although our cooperation goes on, the Fortune brand is obviously being put in a dilemma and we don’t know if the cooperation will somehow be suspended,”said Sun Chenliang, deputy sales manager of COFCO’s edible oil and rice sectors. 
 Sun said Carrefour had been driving for a hard bargain with the brand, from deduction points to point of sale issues. 
 Chen Bo, a spokesman for Carrefour China, rejected Sun’s comments, saying that no official statement had been made by any COFCO spokesperson. 
 Sun declined to make any further comments on the issue. 
 Carrefour China is no stranger to talk of price disputes with suppliers. 
 In December, local food and beverages maker Tianyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp. (0322.HK) halted supplies of its Master Kong instant noodles to Carrefour’s mainland stores due to disputes over the failed renewal of an annual purchasing contract. 
 “Carrefour is making the life of its suppliers harder and harder as it keeps adding different charges, and some have been driven to the verge of losing money,”a North China-based long-term Carrefour supplier told the 21st Century Business Herald. 
 According to the supplier, Carrefour now charges 21% from deduction points, compared with 15% in 2009. 
 “What’s worse is that suppliers will have to ask for the prices of their products to be raised to offset pressure from the assorted charges demanded by supermarkets,”said Yao Wenhua, a representative of a Beijing-based distributors’alliance. 
 The ever-intense relations between Carrefour and its distributors are also making the situation more complicated for the retailer, which is facing growing competition from rivals RT-Mart from Taiwan and the world’s No.1 retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
 According to statistics from China Chain Stores&amp;Franchise Association, RT-Mart surpassed Carrefour in mainland sales revenue in 2009, recording sales of RMB 40.4 billion compared to Carrefour’s RMB 36.6 billion. 
 Wal-Mart is close to completing the integration of the China assets of Trust-Mart, which will give the retailer combined annual sales of more than RMB 50 billion. 
 The U.S. retailer began rolling out its operations to China’s emerging lower-tier cities in 2007; it had 187 stores in 99 cities at the end of June, 2010. 
 Carrefour, which acquired 51% of supermarket operator Hebei Baolongcang Group Co. Ltd. in July, has around 182 China-based stores. 
 The French retailer is also struggling in other foreign markets. It has shut down or sold off stores in South Korea, Russia, Portugal, Italy and the UK since 2009.
