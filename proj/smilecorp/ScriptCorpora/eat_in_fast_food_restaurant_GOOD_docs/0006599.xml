 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:34:15 PM Lately, it seems that there is a man on every corner of my city holding a&quot;will work for food&quot;sign. Today I saw a man sitting on a bus stop bench with a sign propped up against his body that read&quot;I&apos;m SO hungry. Please give me food&quot;

I always have two thoughts...my first thought it always,&quot;How heartbreaking, I should give him some food.&quot;...mingled with&quot;Whatsoever you do to the least of my people, so shall be done unto you.&quot;

My second thought is always,&quot;You are an able bodied man. Get a job and quit running the quick scam.&quot;

What do you think when you see them? Are you as conflicted as I am?

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:39:16 PM Like the parking in reserved parking spots debate. You don&apos;t know what is really going on, just under the surface. And in some areas, there are NO jobs. I&apos;d prefer to error on the side of angels. If they truly are needy, my little bit might help, if they spent it on drugs ... well that&apos;s on them.


I don&apos;t often have cash on me, but I have given when I do have cash.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:39:25 PM I&apos;m not conflicted at all. It&apos;s their job. They generally want money, not food.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:41:28 PM In my lifetime, I have stopped and given these types of people money (a few dollars) a few times. However, I, like you, have my doubts. I mostly get angry when they are holding that sign and smoking cigarettes like there is no tomorrow. I realize that smoking is an addiction and most people can&apos;t just quit. But I have to wonder if I were starving if I would rather eat or smoke.

BUT...my brother is a home builder. He often has jobs that need cleaning up (new construction, remodels, etc.). He has stopped and offered these guys cash to go with him and clean up, but most refuse.

It is a sad situation for sure.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:47:33 PM If they are receiving money or food, instead of work, I won&apos;t give to them. They are reinforced by what what people give them. If they received work, they most likely won&apos;t be on the street corner.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:50:40 PM I question that, if they are truly hungry, why don&apos;t they go to the mission, food closet, church food program, or other places in my community that give out free food. There are also government assistance programs of all kinds. I understand it&apos;s terribly hard to live on that money alone and perhaps they exhausted that money already for the month, but again, why not accept the free food our community offers?

Please don&apos;t interpret this to mean I don&apos;t give them money. These are just the questions I ask myself. In my experience, many don&apos;t want work or food.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:52:32 PM I never give them money. My DH has offered to have them do some work for food and they&apos;ve refused. One person actually told him that he made more money begging on the streets than getting a job.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:53:09 PM I have frequently given them food, but not cash. All but one has been very gracious. The one who was not, cursed me out, so I assume he never really wanted food. 

There is a homeless guy who is always in the subway station near DS&apos;s college. The first time we visited him and this guy yelled our, calling DS by name, I was a little bit freaked out. DS said he occasionally gives him a dollar or some change when he sees him. DH gave him a lecture about how the guy is probably spending it on alcohol. DS shrugged and said,&quot;He lives in a subway station. I don&apos;t begrudge him the beer&quot;.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:55:23 PM Honestly, I believe most choose to stand on a street corner/intersections vs looking for legitimate work.

One of the local news stations did an undercover report on the intersection people which was interesting.

A few weeks ago we went to a Colts game and saw people w/signs everywhere! There was one man sitting, holding a sign that read&quot;I need beer money&quot;. That&apos;s the one man whom I thought&quot;well, at least he&apos;s honest&quot;.

If I felt like I should buy someone a meal it would be done w/o hesitation but it&apos;s highly unlikely I&apos;m going to give them $$ though.

There are a myriad of ways that one can help those who are legitimately in need.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:58:50 PM I talked to my pastor about this during a small group meeting and he mentioned that he kept a bunch of McDonald&apos;s gift certificates in his car to hand out when he came across someone like that. At least it would give the person and his family a meal. (The corner where these people hang out is next to a McDonald&apos;s). He then told of a friend of his who always passed a panhandler on his way to work. This guy was staked out in front of a corner party store and he always thought this guy would get liquor if he was given money. So one day he asked the guy what he wanted, that he would go inside and get it for him. The panhandler said he wanted candy. Didn&apos;t matter what kind. So this guy goes inside and buys enough candy bars to fill a grocery sack and hands it over to the panhandler. You would have thought he gave him gold.

I guess the moral of that story is that things are not really what they seem and we just have to trust that what we are doing is the right thing.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 4:59:24 PM It is really hard to know what to do. Usually I have a&quot;feeling.&quot;Something comes over me that makes me want to give, other times I&apos;ve got nothing.

There was this guy on the off ramp where I worked in San Diego, he was there everyday for about a year. I never had that&quot;feeling&quot;for him, so I never gave him anything. One day my friend and I were being all healthy and decided to take a walk on our lunch hour. We passed by where he stands in the mornings, and there must have been about 50.00 to 60.00 worth of change on the ground! It&apos;s like coin wasn&apos;t good enough for him. Made me feel glad I never gave him anything.

My dd has a spot in her heart for the people that have dogs. She always wants me to give them money, so they will buy food for the dog. I told her that I doubt many of them are buying dog food with the money, so she insisted that we have baggies of dog food in the car to give to them when we pass them by. Now that she&apos;s driving, I need to remind her to put the baggies in her car. 

If I have food in my car, and their signs say&quot;hungry&quot;I&apos;ll give them food. One Thanksgiving I had to work an over night shift from 6:00 pm Wednesday until 2:00pm Thursday. I had taken snacks with me for the long night. On the way home, there was a man on the side of the off-ramp with a&quot;hungry&quot;sign. He got what I had, which was Fig Newtons an apple and a banana. All I can hope is that he ate it and didn&apos;t throw it on the ground. Not much else you can do.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:01:07 PM I guess I may be naive but my opinion is always that I have compassion for that person. I don&apos;t tend to think,&quot;Oh, they&apos;re going to spend it on drugs.&quot;My heart goes out to them. Maybe the person is taking me for a ride but if I have a few bucks with me, I&apos;ll give it to him/her. A lot of times I don&apos;t have cash and the best I can offer is a prayer in my head as I pass. I figure neither of these reactions puts me out.

If the person is within close walking distance of a fast food restaurant, my dh stops the car and tells them to meet him at the restaurant. If they show up, he buys them a meal. More often than not, the person will meet him. He has done this numerous times and no one has been ungrateful.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:15:55 PM It&apos;s really hit-and-miss. I&apos;ve had some that are super grateful when I give them food and a couple who have literally thrown the food back in my face. (Fresh food, not leftovers.) In a smallish city you kind of get to know the local ones, and they&apos;re usually mentally ill or dual-diagnosis (drugs + mentally ill). Supposedly this dates back to when Reagan was governor of California and the mental hospitals were shut down but the local help centers didn&apos;t come through like they were supposed to. At least that&apos;s what I&apos;ve always been told.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:20:07 PM In the previous area we lived in there was a man on a corner who did that. A man in our church spoke to him and the guy with the sign said some days he pulled in 1000$ a day!
People would just give him 20$ bills!

We were told to give them food not money as most of them would just head on over to the liquor store and spend it.


We were also told to look at their shoes! It was a indicator of how well they are doing. lol

Oh, now that I think of it when my sister lived in San Fran. She said she knew people who would borrow friends babies! They got more money pan handling when they had a child with them!

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:20:41 PM I&apos;m part of a campaign to show that there are better solutions than panhandling in our community, so I don&apos;t feel right about giving cash away to people with signs. That being said, most of the people who are holding up signs don&apos;t want to enter into&quot;the system&quot;for help. I feel bad and sometimes guilty for not helping a little bit, but panhandling doesn&apos;t help create a meaningful change in someone&apos;s life.

This is how I feel. Plus the weather around here is pretty extreme and to spend a day sitting out in our winters is rough. We don&apos;t see that many people like this around here but when I do, I almost always give them money. I&apos;ve been very fortunate in my life so I like to pay it forward if I can. If it was a scam, so be it. I feel good when I help.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:24:41 PM Well, a coworker and I were out one day and saw one of our regulars sitting on the corner with one of those signs, begging for money and we were both in shock! This lady is constantly telling us about all the vacations she has and will be taking, baseball games she goes to, etc...and just before that she had been in and dropped $60 on makeup! So no, I think most of them just see that as an easy way to make more money than they would putting in a day&apos;s work. I mean, if you can take the time to sit out there all day....

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:24:44 PM I never roll down my car window to give money to anyone. One, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s safe. Two, when I was younger and more naive, I bought food a couple of times for people on corners, and one guy (with a&quot;hungry - please help&quot;sign) turned it down and said he&apos;d really rather have money. I&apos;ve also seen the exposes about people who prefer to work a corner rather than getting a real job, and I won&apos;t support that lifestyle.

I give plenty of money to local and national charities that help the homeless, and consider my responsibility taken care of where those people are concerned. If they&apos;re truly hungry, there are numerous places here in town where they can get a meal. If they&apos;re just looking for a money handout so they can buy beer or drugs (or whatever else), then I&apos;m not interested in helping with that. 

 
 Never tell anyone your problems. 20% don&apos;t care, and the other 80% are glad you have them.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:28:35 PM I agree about giving to those in need but I&apos;ve learned the hard way not to give to people like that. My sis and I went to a drive thru and got take out - I just got a drink since I had eaten earlier. She got a combo meal.

At a red light, a man came up and told her he was sooooo hungry, could she spare a little money for food. She said she didn&apos;t have any cash (which was true) but she would give him her food she just bought and hadn&apos;t even touched. He seemed so grateful (thank you, God bless you, etc. etc.) My sis kept the drink because she had already had some of it.

As we drove away, she looked in her side mirror and saw him just throw the bag in the trash. She was more hurt than angry - she hadn&apos;t eaten all day and was hungry - spent her hard earned money on lunch and gave her meal to a stranger out of the kindness of her heart and he didn&apos;t even bother opening the bag - he just tossed it away - he didn&apos;t want food - he wanted MONEY.

I wanted her to turn around so I could tell the guy off but we were on a busy one way street and couldn&apos;t.

A similar thing happened to a co-worker at lunch - she was going to give a&quot;homeless&quot;man her lunch and he said&quot;I don&apos;t want your GD food you b*tch - I asked you for some money&quot;- she was trying to be nice and he was a jerk because she offered him food instead of money.

I spoke to my pastor about this and he said to give to charities who help homeless - don&apos;t give to them directly, they will most likely use it on drugs or alcohol.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:28:49 PM Yesterday I saw something new...the guy in the car in front of me gave the panhandler a pack of cigarettes. I found that interesting.

I&apos;m always one step away from having my home foreclosed on, so I never give money (because I need all I can get). But if I knew for sure these men were really in need, I would absolutely give them money.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:31:54 PM I never give them money. I once tried to give food to one, but it was rejected because it wasn&apos;t vegetarian. So I&apos;m cynical.

However, no matter whether I believe they want food or not, I remember that no matter the story, I&apos;d rather have my life than theirs, so I try to be compassionate.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:35:35 PM My heart swells, my eyes tear up, and I am wracked with guilt and sadness for these people. But I generally never give them money.

I have been overwhelmingly compelled (that&quot;feeling&quot;someone else here mentioned) to purchase a meal for someone every now and then.

I have seen in the entrance of a shopping center nearby, a guy who is at the entrance median everyday, went there with my DH and told him that that man was there everyday. He drove me over to where the wife was parked waiting for him. In a car that was either a Mercedes or a Lexus. She was sitting there reading a book. They were not doing to bad for themselves.

Here they all have to have panhandling licenses, that come with a fee from the city, and if they do not, then I believe that they are either arrested or fined.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 5:38:37 PM I have really mixed feelings. The really aggressive panhandlers get NOTHING from me. It&apos;s more like harassment than panhandling.

My DS has always had a big heart. When a guy approached us and asked us for money for food, DS was upset that we said no. So I took DS over with some food from our picnic (sandwiches, oranges, grapes, chips, etc). The guy cussed DS out, threw the food back at him and told him he only wanted cash. DS was devastated but I think it was a good lesson for him. Not everyone is what they appear to be.

If I get an honest vibe from someone, I&apos;ll offer to buy them food instead. The last guy I encountered was outside of KFC. I honestly didn&apos;t have any cash on me, so I offered to buy him a meal instead. He graciously accepted. I only wish I&apos;d have bought him more. I&apos;m sure it was the only meal he had had that day and he was SO darned grateful.

Some people are scammers. But others are someone just down on their luck. I will never turn down someone who wants food. I&apos;d rather help a scammer with food (not cash) than turn away someone truly hungry.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 6:02:26 PM I have very mixed feelings. VERY mixed.

One day a guy at an intersection tugged at my heartstrings for some reason. He just looked so down and sad...I drove to a McD&apos;s a block or so away and bought $10 worth of gift certificates and drove back to give them to him. He was gone. Still feeling so sorry for him, I went looking for him, as it&apos;s a busy area. I thought he couldn&apos;t have gotten far. Well, I did see him, walking out of a liquor store carrying a bag into a hotel across the street.

Ever since, I admit I &apos;ve been very cynical.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 6:09:39 PM I never feel badly for those beggars. Its always the *same* person on the *same* corner and I&apos;ve seen them doing their panhandling for the 4 years I&apos;ve lived here. I don&apos;t think they care to help themselves and don&apos;t want food - they want money for drugs or alcohol. Its all a big scam because most people feel bad, get all weepy and their heart hurts for theses&quot;poor people&quot;.

The truth is, most of them are there because it&apos;s an easy way for them to make a lot of money. A local news station did a big expose of sorts on the local beggars a year ago and it was astonishing how much money they rake in on a daily basis.

I say, get a J-O-B and stop begging. I am not willing to hand over the money DH and I work HARD for every darn day to a lazy person standing on the corner.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 6:15:36 PM I have mixed feelings too, Sometimes I will give a couple of dollars, but never more than 5. Its not going to break me, but we do give money to the homeless through church.

The one thin that annoys me though, is asking for money when I&apos;m in a parking lot and this happens at M&apos;s. Or when we were at Lowes and a lady w/ kids came up and gave us a sob story, we told her to call the local help line (this is what my church encourages us to do), and then I see her a week later in another parking lot !!!

Can&apos;t imagine though, just dropping a $20 off.

How am I supposed to know if they wont grab my purse or something. And the work for food thing. My husband almost brought home one of those people! He was going to have him rake our lawn.
I was like&quot;ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND&quot;A complete stranger that could be some psycho and kill us and rob us. Sorry, but I give to the church charities and others. I dont open my window to strangers, thats just crazy.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 6:51:47 PM When I lived in Chicago, I worked at a restaurant. It was like a 5 or 6 block walk to my apartment. Every night a group of people would gather on the stairs to an abandoned church and ask for food. I went out and bought styrofoam containers and each night when I worked closing, I would take all the soup and mini loaves of french bread that we&apos;d throw away at the end of the night and hand them out. These people were homeless and very happy for the soup. They started to know when my shifts were and would wait for me to bring them soup and bread. I was glad I could help them with food that was just going to go in the garbage.

I also volunteer at the food bank every other Saturday morning. While we see some pretty destitute people, there are others who show up in nice cars. I&apos;m not quite sure what to make of it.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 6:59:01 PM I feel heart broken and I do want to help. I can, so I do.

I keep several $10 fast food gift cards in my purse and I also keep food in my car. I have given out money before, but I don&apos;t anymore. I would rather give them the gift cards or food. If they don&apos;t want or use it *I* tried and it&apos;s no longer my worry.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 7:11:03 PM They are on every on and off ramp to the freeway here. I have had them knock on my car window when I didn&apos;t look at their sign (that one really freaked me out) and there is on corner where the guy has an electric guitar hooked up... and a sign bragging about how long he&apos;s been playing on that corner. I feel bad but I can&apos;t give out money on every corner, every day, all year long or I&apos;d have to start begging for money myself.

If I sound like a Grinch, I do donate quite a nice amount to the local food bank every year.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 7:13:22 PM First and foremost, I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s a safe practice to give money, and heck, I&apos;m not even sure I&apos;d give food.

Some of these people are desperate, mentally ill, strung out on drugs. It&apos;s not really an interaction I&apos;d like to encourage.

If people REALLY need help, there are avenues for them to take.

Now before you tell me what a heartless bitch I am, let me share something that I did do and felt good about doing.

Several years ago, I was in line at Kroger with a woman and infant in front of me checking out. Towards the end of her transaction, she started paying close attention to the total and was telling the cashier to wait. She then proceeded to have to choose what to put back because she didn&apos;t have the money. She wasn&apos;t choosing between sodas, ribeye steaks, or bags of snacks. She was choosing between fresh fruit, baby formula, diapers...stuff she clearly NEEDED.

I don&apos;t remember what she chose to give back to the cashier to put back (it&apos;s been several years) but as soon as I got to the cashier, I told her to quickly ring it up and have the bagboy run it out to her as she loaded her car.

I help people often...at my own discretion. I often donate to the local food pantries and the local men&apos;s drug rehab house. I donate during VBS week when the church collects.

I choose not to donate to someone panhandling on the street or side of the road.

 Posted: 9/17/2010 7:57:15 PM I used to be a project manager for a big construction company. I was out to lunch with my boss several times and we would see people on the corners around the jobsite with those&quot;will work for food&quot;signs. He would give them his business card because we were DYING for laborers at the time. Not one of them ever bothered to come by. We would have hired them on the spot and we were paying about twice minimum wage.
