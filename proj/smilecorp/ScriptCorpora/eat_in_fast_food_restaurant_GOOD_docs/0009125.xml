I&apos;m fairly new to the site and was reading through a lot of posts trying to get any helpful info. I came across posts on the cookbook but cant seem to find the name of it. Can someone give me that info or email me the cookbook if possible to tct7@hotmail.com.

Heres my story:
I&apos;m on my second round of hcg. The first time I did it right before I got married back in may/09. I cheated terribly with all the showers, tastings, luncheons, etc...but I was able to get down low enough to fit into my wedding dress..YIpppeeeee. Now I&apos;m on my second round and am on vlcd #10 and have lost 16 pounds. I saw that some people on here were drinking crystal light so I tried some yesterday (boy was it way better than water) but I didn&apos;t lose any weight this AM. Sooooo no more crystal light for me. I really getting tired of the same old food and was looking into purchasing a cookbook. I wanted to check with you guys first to see what was the best. If anyone has any advice please feel free to share. Thanks a bunch. hmhuntr August 21st, 2009, 07:07 PM i&apos;ll email it to you now. Good Luck hmhuntr August 22nd, 2009, 09:18 AM Halleluja! After 2 steak days I finally made it back to where I am supposed to be. Tonight hubby and I are supposed to go out to eat to celebrate his birthday. We actually have the night all to ourselves...how exciting! So I&apos;ve been looking at menus online trying to figure out the best place to go and what to get. I really don&apos;t want to screw up and have to spend another 2 days with steak again:o

Mo- What is Taco Bueno? Is it like Taco Bell? TCT August 22nd, 2009, 12:03 PM Huntr---Thanks soooo much for the cookbook..

Ok so I tried two recipes from the cookbook yesterday (chilli and chicken soup) which were both delicious, but this am my weight actually went up a pound. I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;m doing wrong but yesterday AM my weight didn&apos;t change and this AM it went up 1 pound so I&apos;m really getting discouraged. I havent gone to the bathroom in 2days so I&apos;m praying thats the cause of the problem. justkarib August 22nd, 2009, 05:14 PM Hello everyone. I have been reading this thread for 1.5 weeks...no joke. I started right before I went to Germany on the 10th of this month and read it while I was there when I had down time. I originally started at the newest page but saw someone post that everything that is needed is back on pages 3 and 4. So I took that as a hint to go back and read the whole thing. Daunting task to say the least but I&apos;m done and I feel a bit wiser to say the least.

I&apos;m really interested in trying this. I haven&apos;t bought anything as I wanted to read the whole thread to begin with. And I&apos;m wondering if anyone can answer a few questions I have.

I&apos;m taking phen right now and eat maybe 500 cals a day on it because I&apos;m just not hungry and when I force myself to eat I feel sick. So I just wait to eat until I notice I&apos;ve got the shakes. So anyway, I&apos;m wondering why this diet is soo strict and you can&apos;t eat 500 cals and still lose weight no matter if it consists of sugar or carbs? I keep thinking 500 cal is 500 cal ya know?

The next question is if it would be okay to take HCG just to get rid of the stubborn areas of fat that I can&apos;t seem to lose no matter what (gut, thighs, arms) and not do the strict protocol? I mean if I eat how I am right now using phen and do the HCG, it seems like I should at least lose that fat and inches even if I stay the same weight. And then after doing say 28 days of that, just get off of it and keep doing the phen to drop weight again??

I don&apos;t even know if any of that makes sense at all.

Congrats to everyone who has done this so far and lost weight. hmhuntr August 23rd, 2009, 11:02 PM Taz- Sorry to hear that it&apos;s taking so long for your order to arrive. It sounds like it&apos;s all the same no matter who you order from. I&apos;m not a big fan of needles but I usually don&apos;t look and exhale as I give it to myself and it&apos;s over before I know it. The first was the worst but I think it was because I was nervous.

just- From my experience so far, any deviation from the protocol cause me to gain so I&apos;m not sure if you could get the results or not without following the plan? It would be awsome if you can.

TCT- Hubby figured out that he is sensitive to tomatoes and even though they are on the acceptable list he would show a gain the next morning if he ate them. So it could be that or the fact that you haven&apos;t been to the bathroom yet....Just hang in there. You&apos;ll see a differnce soon.

I did very well going out with hubby and this morning I was still within my range. I made the mistake this evening and just took a peek at the scale and it said I was up 6lb from my target and I am pretty nervous. Just hoping it&apos;s excess water and will be gone in the morning. I could use a bathroom stop myself. I&apos;ve got another glass of water to push down and then off to bed. (also only got 3 hours sleep last night) Hope everyone had a great weekend. I&apos;ll try to put up a pic of us from our little date night, we&apos;re such goobers!:Dhttp://i470.photobucket.com/albums/rr68/hmhuntr12/Datenight010.jpg Ignore the fact that he had his hand on my butt (he thought he was being cute:) ) hmhuntr August 23rd, 2009, 11:07 PM I just realized that several people are in school or just starting back. Who&apos;s going right now?

I start tomorrow. I just graduated about 16 months ago but want to get into the bridge program for my Master&apos;s so I needed 2 prereq&apos;s. I am happy (I think) to report that I will be sitting in Statistics in the morning! What a way to start a Monday huh? Hubby goes back Tues, the big 2 kiddos on Wed. and Gabby on Sept 1st. That will make all 5 of us in school! I must be insane!

Somebody out there let me know that you understand and share the insanity!:o beckaboo August 24th, 2009, 05:03 PM hey ladies...im in limbo about the HCG protocol...but i have been researchin and im really at a point that i want to try it...i just hav a few ??s.
1st--im not into needles...so has anyone had any success with the sublingual? from wut i understand, its the same more or less....
2nd..so basically....you gorge for 2days..then for 3days after its 500 cals....after that...its very low carb. is that how it goes??
3rd...do u just gain weight when you over eat on carbs??
4th...i looked on d r u g d e l i v e r y . c o m and i see all these different hcg injections and sublinguals...but i dont kno which one to get...i want the whole kit...i need a lil help with this one.

thanks, for helpin ladies!! TTATWORK August 24th, 2009, 06:02 PM Just have time for q quickie -- question that is! What is the reason we don&apos;t take the injections during our periods? Do you stop taking them then? Or do you just inject yourself as usual?
TIA! NCGreenEyes August 24th, 2009, 11:14 PM Hi ladies! Sorry I&apos;ve been MIA for a little bit. Things have been busy and stressful...but I&apos;m trying to take it day by day. I have been hovering between 192 and 190.5 for the past week....I finally did a steak day today, so I&apos;m hoping that will help kill the stall!! It&apos;s so frustrating since 190 is my short term goal!! So guess we&apos;ll see.

Anyway...hope everyone is doing well - it looks like a lot of people are MIA...maybe end of summer vacations? Hope everyone comes back to posting soon! :) Oh, and I wonder what happened to ASU? texasbeauty1982 August 25th, 2009, 09:53 AM HM- Taco Bueno is the BOMB!! lol Its NOTHING like Taco Bell to me :) Taco Bell TASTES like fast food and even though Taco Bueno is a fast food restaurant, it doesnt taste like it :) its soooo yummy..yet another weakness of mine as to why I cant lose weight lmao And I am also back in school...I started yesterday and although this is my 4th semester, I still have this semester and Spring before I can finish my Associates...I am majoring in Accounting and I am taking my first Accounting class right now and I LOVE my teacher...hopefully, I can do good in this class, otherwise I might be choosing another career!! :( green_eyes-smiles August 25th, 2009, 11:28 AM Just have time for q quickie -- question that is! What is the reason we don&apos;t take the injections during our periods? Do you stop taking them then? Or do you just inject yourself as usual?
TIA!
I am taking the shots during my period and have had no side effects with them at all. Not heavier, no cramps, nothing. It&apos;s up to you if you want to continue. Some people have said they have bad effects during TOM, it&apos;s pretty much up to you. I chose to do a 40 day round, which I started at the end of a period and will end about 8 days after my last one (which is in about 8 days). This is my first experience/round with HCG. I am not currently taking phen but plan to start soon. I thought I&apos;d try something different first.

Just thought I could give you my experience.

I&apos;ve been around a while, was on the forum in 06/07 but lost my login info and just resigned up last June (lost 70lbs, got prego again, gained back all and then some so I&apos;m back). Good luck! NCGreenEyes August 25th, 2009, 03:28 PM Hi ladies!! So YAY for steak days and getting over a stall! I LOVE THEM!!! :D I am officially 189.8 - so I surpassed my short term goal!!! I am soooo excited!! Now I have to focus on my long term goal. I changed my weight ticker - and it&apos;s a little daunting, but I have come this far so I know I can keep going.

Hope all of you ladies are doing well - check back in! :) ASU89 August 25th, 2009, 04:02 PM NC, I&apos;m still here. Oh my gosh you are doing SO WELL!!!!! I was so excited when I was finally in the 180s! I bet you&apos;re overjoyed as well. I just started school so I have been so busy moving in to my apartment and getting situated with everything. I check up on here almost everyday to see how everyone is doing. Some people are just really bugging me on here... So I&apos;d rather not say anything than to start something. :) I am juggling back and fourth between 139-143. That&apos;s because everyone just got back to campus this past weekend and we&apos;ve just been partying. So alcohol + munchie food = scale going up. :) I&apos;m back on track now... Hope everyone is doing well. huerita August 25th, 2009, 08:44 PM Hi Beckaboo,

You have the details of the protocol a bit wrong. Yes you gorge (pig out) for the first 2 days you take the injections, but next is where you may be misunderstanding. From injection day 3 on, it&apos;s the 500 cal. diet. (VLCD). You stay on that including the 3 days after the injections end. Next is p3 where it is sort of a maintenance round, no more than up or down 2 lbs from your ending weight for p2. In this phase, still no carbs, starch, sugars. You can eat what you like pretty much as long as you avoid them and best to still only use the types of meat allowed when you eat meat. 1 other thing that I read is that you should eat 6 times a day on p3. Not stuffing yourself, just eating throughout the day to satisfy yourself.

As for the sublingual instead of the injections, I&apos;m not sure they would work as well. I tried to find testimonials on that a while back and all I could find is a clinic that does it and they were real expensive. I don&apos;t know if they stick to the protocol. I don&apos;t mind the injections. I only feel the little pinpoint ting when i first push the needle on my skin. But sometimes I don&apos;t even feel that. When you&apos;re injecting, you feel no pain at all, unless you totally are injecting on a nerve I guess.

Also regarding wanting the whole kit: The kit does not include HCG. You purchase that separately. You can buy the supplies in kit form from HCG fat loss . com or separately from several places to keep costs down.

I hope this helps a bit.

huerita huerita August 25th, 2009, 09:37 PM Okay, my turn for some questions!

1. Anyone here have the recipe book? I would love to have a copy. My email is shannonlopez1@gmail.com

2. Next, where can I get those miracle noodles? We would really like a little variety.

3. Melba toast or crackers. Haven&apos;t found them anywhere. Not even WalMart!!

4. Best place online(most affordable with best flavors) to purchase Stevia ?

5. I read something about someone drinking crystal light. Is that okay? What about flavored water like Propel or the carbonated ones that have 0 sugars, fats, carbs, calories? Are they okay? (oh boy I miss my diet coke!)

6. Any other hints, tips tricks for flavorful allowed foods!

Thanks Everyone!

huerita Oshun August 26th, 2009, 12:22 AM Congrats NCGreeneyes! That is so exciting!


I am still struggling with these 6 pounds to get to 199. I want 199! NOW! I had severley restricted my calories for a few days and still no change. I think I may do a steak day. Oshun August 26th, 2009, 12:24 AM Study Confirms: Your Hidden Food Allergies Are Making You Fat

Medical researchers from Dubai reported in the April &apos;09 edition of the Middle East Journal of Family Medicine (The Effect of The ALCAT Test Diet Therapy for Food Sensitivity in Patient&apos;s With Obesity) that patients unable to achieve goal weight loss by calorie restriction alone were significantly aided in their attempts when they avoided foods that had been shown by a unique lab test to excite their immune response. The authors, led by Dr. M. Akmal of the Dubai Specialized Medical Centre, pointed out that hidden food allergies, or food sensitivities, are unique to each individual and can cause inflammatory diseases, and an inability to lose weight. Food sensitivities often provoke delayed and chronic symptoms, like IBS, migraine and arthritis, that are not as obvious as the dramatic and immediate onset of&quot;true&quot;food allergies, such as peanut anaphylaxis, but, over the long term, can be just as devastating and are more difficult to detect.

In the course of the 12 week study, the 27 refractory weight loss patients underwent a single treatment: avoidance of foods that were shown to be immune reactive according to blood testing through a system known as the ALCAT test. The study participants showed an average weight loss of approximately 37 pounds plus an average drop of six points of BMI (body mass index) and an average decrease of 30% of body fat.

Dr. Fred Pescatore, former Medical Director of the famed Atkins Center and a pioneer in the study of the hormonal and immune system effects of foods, reviewed the findings and said,&quot;I&apos;m not surprised by these results, dramatic as they may appear. I&apos;ve used the ALCAT test with my difficult patients time and time again, and it always works.&quot;

Other studies based on the elimination of food sensitivities had previously been reported. In a Baylor Medical College study 98% of subjects also displayed significant improved body composition and/or scale weight following an ALCAT test-based food elimination diet within four weeks. A matched control group that followed calorie restriction alone actually became fatter.

&quot;When I first began to lecture to health professionals about how avoidance of food sensitivities helped the weight loss process, people looked at me like I had two heads,&quot;says Roger Deutsch, co-author of the book, Your Hidden Food Allergies are Making You Fat.&quot;Now we know that chronic inflammation, caused primarily by exposure to incompatible foods, is at the root of metabolic problems like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. The immune system chemicals block insulin receptors; so, guess what happens to the sugars we eat? - they get stored as fat. Cut the inflammation, cut the fat storage.&quot;

Along with avoidance of food sensitivities, Deutsch and other experts also recommend paying attention to the quality of food eaten, getting adequate rest, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle.

1. Anyone here have the recipe book? I would love to have a copy. My email is shannonlopez1@gmail.com

2. Next, where can I get those miracle noodles? We would really like a little variety.

Konjac or Shitake? There is a website for the Konjac...


3. Melba toast or crackers. Haven&apos;t found them anywhere. Not even WalMart!!

Wal Mart usually has them, but I couldn&apos;t eat them bc they make me hungrier and they made it hard for me to lose.


4. Best place online(most affordable with best flavors) to purchase Stevia ?


Try vitacost or i herb.

5. I read something about someone drinking crystal light. Is that okay? What about flavored water like Propel or the carbonated ones that have 0 sugars, fats, carbs, calories? Are they okay? (oh boy I miss my diet coke!)

I have not minded not having the melba toast/crackers because is seemed a number of people have not had as good of results when eating them. I think I just want a little more variety to the diet, something a little more crunchy!

Also, the miracle noodles. I&apos;ll google for the website for the noodles. I think I&apos;ve been to vitacost but not iherb for the stevia. I&apos;ll look at both of them cuz I really need to flavor the water sometimes.

I really like this diet. I haven&apos;t been hungry at all. I get temptations when I smell something cooking but I stop and think about whether or not I&apos;m hungry and realize that it&apos;s just old habits of smelling, wanting and eating. I leave the area and chug the water to substitute putting wrong foods in my mouth! SheilaK August 26th, 2009, 01:13 PM Hello!
Where is everyone?? I know, I have been gone too. I have lurked and tried to keep up with everything but just haven&apos;t had the time to be on here. Well, for a little update. I took my last shot this morning so am on my last several days of VLCD. I am sooo readyy to move onto more food selection that it isn&apos;t even funny. With my weigh in this morning I am down 25 pounds which I am very happy with but haven&apos;t lost much in the last 3 days. I am going to do a steak day today and see if it gets me anywhere. I figure whatever I lose will just be that much less that i have to lose the next round. How many of you do the shorter rounds? I think that is what I will do the next time. This one just seemed really long although it worked really well. I am worried about P3 though, I want so many different things that i know i am not supposed to have in the first 3 weeks but i know i will break down and have some anyway! Does anyone have sample food plans or ideas that they have done for P3? Well, need to get back to work. Good luck everyone and hope to see a few more of you back on here, we miss you! NCGreenEyes August 26th, 2009, 03:51 PM Hi all! So I am down .8 lbs this morning, so I&apos;m okay with that. I was hoping for a little more but I am not going to push my luck - it&apos;s still a pretty good loss!

Note: I took pictures today since I have surpassed my short-term goal. I&apos;ve lost right around 30 lbs since the last time I took photos. For those of you who want to see as inspiration that this DOES work, or feel like pointing out differences (it&apos;s sometimes hard for me to tell since I see myself every day) then go check them out. The link and password to view them is in my signature.

ASU - Good to see you are still around...just ignore people who bug you :) I do feel so overjoyed that I&apos;m in the 180&apos;s - it&apos;s still hard for me to believe though! I think I still have the same mind frame that I did when I was in the 250&apos;s...it&apos;s hard to get rid of that view of myself, but I guess that comes in time. Good luck with school and getting settled into your apartment, and I know how that is when school first starts back. Nothing wrong with enjoying it and then getting back on track!

Oshun - Thanks! You will lose those 6 lbs! Trust me my body made me fight to get under 200, then it made me fight to meet my short-term goal, but I did get there! Steak days are great :)

huerita - I use the melba toast, but only in recipes that it calls for. I don&apos;t eat them just as a snack or I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to stop. I don&apos;t know where you live but if you have a Food Lion, that&apos;s where I get mine. Otherwise I&apos;m sure Wal-Mart should have them...I know at FL they are down the cracker/snack isle, but in a different section for&quot;organic&quot;snacks. So either type of isle is where I would think they&apos;d be at Wal-Mart.

Sheila - That&apos;s great that you are down 25 lbs! That&apos;s a really good loss :) I can&apos;t tell you what to do about the rounds since I do mine differently because of going through a doctor, but I think if I had a choice I&apos;d do the shorter rounds. Also, for P3 - I wish I could tell you that I behaved well when I did it, but I ate whatever I wanted! Best advice for if you do that - PORTION CONTROL! If I knew I was going to eat really badly for dinner, I&apos;d make sure I ate something light and healthy for lunch. And do cardio! I managed to not gain weight during P3...so I guess what I did worked for me. Just start carefully until you know what your body will do.

Hope everyone else is doing well!! Stay tough ladies! huerita August 26th, 2009, 03:53 PM SheliaK, congrats on the 25 lbs! so exciting. You should actually do the apple diet today instead of the steak. The steak day is for when you are not on the shots, and I believe it has to be at least a week. Instead, the 6 apples between lunch today and tomorrow break the plateau. 6 is the maximum to eat, plus only water when you are thirsty. They should be large apples, but you don&apos;t have to eat all 6 of them. Then, you should see a difference in the scale in the morning.

Good luck, keep it up! aracely2027 August 26th, 2009, 03:53 PM Asu
its good to have you back!!!
Don&apos;t worry about those other people they are just jealous of your success, and of course that you look good..:)
I hope that you continue having success and to be able to give us advices still. Well you look great and keep it up..


Ok I already placed my order on the 20th with adc and still haven&apos;t received anything yet not even a tracking number. I did called them and they said they will send me one next business day, so hopefully by tomorrow i&apos;ll know something.

Many people here on the forum are afraid of needles, me too:(. I started using b12 shot and giving the shots myself i just couldn&apos;t stand the long needles, so i grab an ice cube put it on my thigh until it was numb, then i would clean it with the alcohol wipe, and blow it until dry, and booom, i couldn&apos;t feel the shot, maybe some of you ladies that are afraid should give this a try it doesn&apos;t hurt at all. huerita August 26th, 2009, 03:58 PM Thanks NC. I&apos;m in Perris, CA and I&apos;ve gone to several Walmarts around here as well as Food4Less, probably like Food Lion. They haven&apos;t had them. But, you know, I&apos;m doing just fine without them. I would use them if I needed in a recipe. (and if someone has that recipe book, I&apos;d love a copy!) shannonlopez1@gmail.com

Is this weird? I am on day 10 and haven&apos;t had a bm for the last 3 days. It might even be 4! I pee, but no bm! And my weight is the same the last 2 days. I&apos;ll break that plateau tomorrow if still no change, but I don&apos;t know what to do to be able to, you know!! huerita August 26th, 2009, 05:43 PM Tazgirl, you need to gorge because the HCG needs fresh fat stores to pull from when you start. After that, it goes for the existing fat cells. But if you don&apos;t gorge, you wont have the same success as if you had done it. You&apos;re doing great now and you&apos;re doing things right. But, with the HCG, you have to do it the way the protocol states. The dr. tested it for 50 years and if it was okay for some to not gorge in certain circumstances, it would be in there.

I know it&apos;s hard, but when you gorge, maybe don&apos;t stuff yourself, just make most of what you eat is high fat, but stay away from carbs, starches and sugars as much as possible. I gained 3 on my 2 gorge days, but in 1 week I lost 12 lbs! The day after the gorge, I lost all plus 1 more lb.

Hang in there and congrats on your great weight loss so far! hmhuntr August 26th, 2009, 09:34 PM My email just said that my order is now in customs so hopefully it won&apos;t be held up. We would like to gorge next weekend while his brother is in town for a visit. I will be honest...P3 is ALOT harder than I thought it would be. I just can&apos;t turn my brain off of some of the stuff I want! I have noticed if I do you a little above the 2.1lb it takes me two days to get back under. I must be super sensitive to a few of the things that are ok&apos;d in the book I guess.

ASU- The partying the first week on campus is always crazy but when else can you really go out and have that much fun ya know???;) I wish I lived closer to school so that I could take advantage of some of the things they&apos;ve got going on this week. but that and driving 50 minutes home doesn&apos;t mix very well

NC- yeah! You&apos;re still going down and YES you can really tell a difference in your photos!:D:D:D

Taz- you have to gorge or it will be pure h e l l on you if you don&apos;t!

Huerita:

5. I read something about someone drinking crystal light. Is that okay? What about flavored water like Propel or the carbonated ones that have 0 sugars, fats, carbs, calories? Are they okay? (oh boy I miss my diet coke!)

I use Propel (10 calories) or Lipton tea on the go (0 calories). My favorite Propel is berry and Lipton tea is Cherry Blossom.

Hope this helps! NCGreenEyes August 26th, 2009, 11:29 PM hmhuntr - Yes, P3 is hard!! Why do you think I just gave in and ate what I was wanting in a smaller portion? Lol. Hang in there! And thanks - I can tell a difference in some of the pictures, but others not so much...guess I&apos;m still just too critical of myself.

huertia - Keep in mind that you should watch calories and you are not supposed to have sugar as far as drinks. Wal-Mart sells their brand of the little packets you can mix into water, and the Pink Lemonade and Orange are both sugar, salt, and calorie free. I still try to stick with only one a day, but it has not hindered me. I have once in awhile used packets that are sugar free and only 5 calories and I see to do okay with that, but I don&apos;t make a habit of that. You can also drink iced tea, as long as you sweeten it with stevia.

Where are all of our other missing ladies?? There are sooo many&quot;regulars&quot;that are MIA - come back! hmhuntr August 26th, 2009, 11:34 PM Have any of you ladies noticed your measurements still going down while on P3? I know our body is shifting but I wasn&apos;t sure? Wouldn&apos;t that be nice! I&apos;m checking my measurements on Sunday which is about 2 weeks into P3 just to see. Give me some hope ladies!!!:D TTATWORK August 27th, 2009, 09:57 AM Good morning ladies!! Please help, don&apos;t know if I need a spanking or a hug! I gained 3 pounds overnight :(! OK, here are some possible reasons:

1) I did not eat anything until dinner last night, which consisted of 2 cups of salad mix, about 1/4 cup of salsa, 200 grams of 96% lean ground beef seasoned with one packet of taco seasoning, and a dressing made of rice wine vinegar and MCT oil. -- could that be it?

2) Realized this morning that I had not had a BM in a day or two, I think two days

3) I could be starting my period, doing a bit of spotting. I&apos;ve been reading that HCG causes some women to start early and really messes w/ your periods.

So, all the makings of the perfect storm, eh? Do you think it could be a combination of all things? And did I blow it too much on the dinner last night? Just need some reassurance.

TIA huerita August 27th, 2009, 12:24 PM Thanks TitsMcGee and NC. I&apos;m gonna get some propel and I don&apos;t remember if I&apos;ve tried the lipton on the go. But you know the crystal light and the walmart version (which I have one little container left from couple months ago), that tastes good but I get migraines like crazy with it.

TTATWORK - ME TOO!!! No BM, what&apos;s with that? I get a little feeling like I have to go, you know, kindof in the stomach, I take a seat, but nothing. I can not take a dump. I don&apos;t even **** anymore!!

NC- I&apos;ve been wondering where all the regulars are also. I&apos;ve been following this for months and all of a sudden they are gone. Could be school and work filling up the schedules right now.

huerita Oshun August 27th, 2009, 12:29 PM Hello!
Where is everyone?? I know, I have been gone too. I have lurked and tried to keep up with everything but just haven&apos;t had the time to be on here. Well, for a little update. I took my last shot this morning so am on my last several days of VLCD. I am sooo readyy to move onto more food selection that it isn&apos;t even funny. With my weigh in this morning I am down 25 pounds which I am very happy with but haven&apos;t lost much in the last 3 days. I am going to do a steak day today and see if it gets me anywhere. I figure whatever I lose will just be that much less that i have to lose the next round. How many of you do the shorter rounds? I think that is what I will do the next time. This one just seemed really long although it worked really well. I am worried about P3 though, I want so many different things that i know i am not supposed to have in the first 3 weeks but i know i will break down and have some anyway! Does anyone have sample food plans or ideas that they have done for P3? Well, need to get back to work. Good luck everyone and hope to see a few more of you back on here, we miss you!



Hey Shelia!

Congrats on the 25! On P3 you can have a lot - you can have all the fat you want- just go easy on the carbs and sugar. You can also have a greater variety of vegetables and fruits. So you will have options. Oshun August 27th, 2009, 12:30 PM Thanks Oshun.

I have not minded not having the melba toast/crackers because is seemed a number of people have not had as good of results when eating them. I think I just want a little more variety to the diet, something a little more crunchy!

Also, the miracle noodles. I&apos;ll google for the website for the noodles. I think I&apos;ve been to vitacost but not iherb for the stevia. I&apos;ll look at both of them cuz I really need to flavor the water sometimes.

I really like this diet. I haven&apos;t been hungry at all. I get temptations when I smell something cooking but I stop and think about whether or not I&apos;m hungry and realize that it&apos;s just old habits of smelling, wanting and eating. I leave the area and chug the water to substitute putting wrong foods in my mouth!

You are welcome! Oshun August 27th, 2009, 12:35 PM Hi all! So I am down .8 lbs this morning, so I&apos;m okay with that. I was hoping for a little more but I am not going to push my luck - it&apos;s still a pretty good loss!

Note: I took pictures today since I have surpassed my short-term goal. I&apos;ve lost right around 30 lbs since the last time I took photos. For those of you who want to see as inspiration that this DOES work, or feel like pointing out differences (it&apos;s sometimes hard for me to tell since I see myself every day) then go check them out. The link and password to view them is in my signature.

ASU - Good to see you are still around...just ignore people who bug you :) I do feel so overjoyed that I&apos;m in the 180&apos;s - it&apos;s still hard for me to believe though! I think I still have the same mind frame that I did when I was in the 250&apos;s...it&apos;s hard to get rid of that view of myself, but I guess that comes in time. Good luck with school and getting settled into your apartment, and I know how that is when school first starts back. Nothing wrong with enjoying it and then getting back on track!

Oshun - Thanks! You will lose those 6 lbs! Trust me my body made me fight to get under 200, then it made me fight to meet my short-term goal, but I did get there! Steak days are great :)

huerita - I use the melba toast, but only in recipes that it calls for. I don&apos;t eat them just as a snack or I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to stop. I don&apos;t know where you live but if you have a Food Lion, that&apos;s where I get mine. Otherwise I&apos;m sure Wal-Mart should have them...I know at FL they are down the cracker/snack isle, but in a different section for&quot;organic&quot;snacks. So either type of isle is where I would think they&apos;d be at Wal-Mart.

Sheila - That&apos;s great that you are down 25 lbs! That&apos;s a really good loss :) I can&apos;t tell you what to do about the rounds since I do mine differently because of going through a doctor, but I think if I had a choice I&apos;d do the shorter rounds. Also, for P3 - I wish I could tell you that I behaved well when I did it, but I ate whatever I wanted! Best advice for if you do that - PORTION CONTROL! If I knew I was going to eat really badly for dinner, I&apos;d make sure I ate something light and healthy for lunch. And do cardio! I managed to not gain weight during P3...so I guess what I did worked for me. Just start carefully until you know what your body will do.

Hope everyone else is doing well!! Stay tough ladies!



Thanks for the encouragement! I am getting there slowly. Round one was so fast though! LOL Oshun August 27th, 2009, 12:41 PM In the beginning I had issues with BM too. I wouldn&apos;t go for many days and I would get concerned.

Now I am having the opposite problem.

If I drink a cup full of coffee on an empty stomach - I have to go and it is oily. The same thing happens when I have a steak day- even though I am not using oil. My stomach will start loudly growling and it is not pretty. :)

I don&apos;t know what causes the nonBM or what causes it to be loose - as in my case.



I will say TTATWORK - your TOM could definitely be affecting your loss. Also if you are on P2 and ate things not on the protocol then you are at a stall. During my TOM the scale barely changed. Oshun August 27th, 2009, 12:48 PM I have 3 more shots before I end round 2 and need to lose three more pounds.

I am at 201 my waist is down to 36&quot;my hips are still 47&quot;and i just want my BMI below 30 so I will technically be out of the obese category.


I did go and try on my smaller clothes and I was shocked that they did fit. Now I have to find all of them. They are a perfect fit too. More like figure hugging without seeing rolls - I have actually lost many of the bra rolls on my back. huerita August 27th, 2009, 01:56 PM In the beginning I had issues with BM too. I wouldn&apos;t go for many days and I would get concerned.

Thanks so much for saying this. The only thing I could figure is that all the water is liquifying the food we eat and that&apos;s how it is getting flushed out. Or it is broken down so much because of the vegetables and fruit having high water content, and flushing out with the water.

I&apos;m not sure if I will look forward to loose stools though. I&apos;ll be afraid to ****!:D huerita August 27th, 2009, 01:57 PM I&apos;m not sure if I will look forward to loose stools though. I&apos;ll be afraid to ****!:D

Okay, since when is f.a.r.t a banned word!! hmhuntr August 27th, 2009, 09:53 PM TT- I&apos;m living proof that you can&apos;t blow it too much because I thought I did two times. I did go up but I also came back down. Just by looking at your meal this is just my thoughts (I am by NO means an expert in this though!:o)
1. We are only supposed to have 100 grams per meal, not 200.
2. Some people are sensitive to tomatoes and lettuce and that makes them gain a
little.
3.Taco seasoning is loaded with salt and usually has hidden sugars and starches.
4. Rice wine vinegar- Got no clue about this one. I just know it specifies apple cider
vinegar.
Any ONE of these things may have been the culprit. For me I realized right away that if I strayed from what the book said was allowed I would shoot up 2-3 lbs instantly. I guess I am a little more sensitive to carbs and what not. Just start the next day fresh and with the approved foods and it should come right back off. As far as the BM thing....let me know if you get any words of wisdom because I&apos;ve tried everything and a laxative is pretty much the only thing that works. :o

Taz- we are looking to gorge next weekend. We will have done P3 for 3 weeks. I know that book says 6 weeks but I don&apos;t want to wait that long. (I&apos;m impatient too!;)) but mostly it&apos;s a timing issue because of a trip we have to take in October. Need to be off of the round before we go. Our first was only 28 days and this one will be too. I just don&apos;t think we could hang on for a full 40. It seems like I remember others talking about starting earlier as well. I think I&apos;m going to search it to refresh myself. Sorry to hear that your HCG isn&apos;t in yet. I will say though that last time I ordered with ADC, when I would check the tracking it kept saying in customs and it showed up on my doorstep. Who knows??? I&apos;ll think speedy delievery thoughts for you.:)

Oshun- with 3 shots left I think you can lose the three pounds! If you consider that you will still do VLCD a few more days afterwards...you should have it in the bag! Don&apos;t you just love being able to&quot;shop&quot;in your closet for clothes. If you&apos;re anything like me, I hadn&apos;t been able to wear things for so long that they were new to me! Shopping for free babeeeee!:D Sorry to hear about the coffee....that must be some strong stuff LOL! SheilaK August 28th, 2009, 12:09 AM Oshun-Thanks for the words of encouragement! You are doing great too, how many rounds have you done?

hmhunter-wow, you are a brave soul, I can&apos;t wait to be off P2 for a while. I am so looking forward to having a salad with ranch dressing!!! I am also worried about staying in control of the weight gain but will just have to see how it goes. I am thinking that I will do a shorter round the next time too. How many lbs. have you typically lost on yours?

Huerrita- Thanks for the advice, its nice to have the help!! It just seems like there is sooo much to remember.

Greeneyes- you have come a long ways!! Congratulations

Well, I was pleased to have dropped 2 lbs. yesterday after dinging around with the same lb. for almost a week. I was starting to think it was just time to be done. I took my last shot yesterday a.m. so have a couple of days to go but am definitely looking forward to P3. I will be taking my measurements then and will let you know the totals!! I don&apos;t really have any specific goals other than I need to be slimmed down before my twin sister comes home for Christmas. I refuse to be a size 20 and have to stand next to her size 8-9 body one more time!! When we were younger no one could tell us apart and for the last couple of years people would just look at me with surprise on their faces when they found out we were twins and I would be just mortified! She was heavy for a while too but she lost a bunch of weight when she got divorced, she was down to a size 6 for a while and of course I never could manage to get that small. I don&apos;t care if I get that small now either I just don&apos;t want to feel so huge when I am around her. I just want to look&quot;normal&quot;and wear&quot;normal&quot;sizes. I am only 5&apos;2&quot;so 230 pounds wasn&apos;t very attractive!! Well, anyway, now that I have bored you to tears I will submit this and go to bed.

I do want to say a huge&quot;Thank You&quot;to everyone on here, you have really helped me get through this!:D:D anadingding August 28th, 2009, 02:18 PM hi girls im still here struggling as always! I cant seem to go down im in between 187 to 185 no less! im not doing the protocol just watching what i eat and occasionally exercising but its like there is no motivation in me. I dont know how I managed to lose weight before. I know it is possible, but I cant seem to find that one thing that is going o make me get motivated. :( Right now Im 187 i start school on monday so my goals were no met. I have no job yet and thats really stressing me out.

NGreen-- Your awesome girl. Were at the same weight except I&apos;ve been here for a good 3 months lol! Keep up the good work! You need to post more after pics now!

Tex-- How are you doing on your new meds? Are they working better than just the phen alone?

ASU-- isnt college fun! LOL dont party too much! LOL Im glad your still here. huerita August 28th, 2009, 03:25 PM Taz- we are looking to gorge next weekend. We will have done P3 for 3 weeks.

You know what, my daughter and I are only doing the 23-28 day rounds and then taking the mandatory 3 weeks off. I use 175 cc and she uses 200 cc. I think that you become immune to it faster the more you take. But since we&apos;re only doing the shorter ones, with about the same amount of time for P3, we should be okay. (We&apos;ll do the shots till we run out.) I&apos;m just so anxious. I figure, if I keep losing the same way as right now, I should be pretty darn close to 200!! I can&apos;t tell you how long it has been since I&apos;ve seen that!

You gals all inspire me soooo much. I love seeing everyone lose weight. It just gives so much hope and motivation to keep on track. NCGreenEyes August 28th, 2009, 04:14 PM hi girls im still here struggling as always!

I hate hovering around the same weight - it&apos;s awful isn&apos;t it?? I didn&apos;t do it as long as you but for about a week and a half I was stuck at like 191...it was so annoying! Hang in there and try not to stress yourself out too much about dieting - with school and the job sitch you have enough on your plate. Good luck with both of those, then work on the diet! :) And thanks, I actually did add some new after pics to the album. The link and password for it is in my signature, so feel free to check it out!

Oh and thanks Sheila - it sounds like you are doing well, so just hang in there and I&apos;m sure that you can get to a size that you are happy at!

Hope everyone else is doing well! hizboo August 28th, 2009, 08:42 PM Hey Ladies? How have y&apos;all been??

I haven&apos;t been on here in a looooong time! Looks like everyone is doing/looking AMAZING!! I had a hectic summer to say the least which left me with no time to get on or begin my second round. It&apos;s been vacation, family sicknesses, emergencies, etc. Things are starting to settle down and I hope it stays that way for a while.

I did miss you guys a lot. I don&apos;t think I have lost any weight on my own-that has been a challenge. I haven&apos;t done my second round yet but love the fact that I eat what I want and go right back down to my last weight in - 180 something. I think I am at 181 now. Also my doctor said I am no longer Diabetic!!! So I plan to start my second round towards the end of next month hopefully. Have a great weekend! NCGreenEyes August 28th, 2009, 11:01 PM hizbo - Long time no see! Congrats on keeping your weight steady while being off the diet for awhile! That&apos;s awesome. I&apos;ve almost caught up to you though :) And that&apos;s great that you are not diabetic anymore - that must make you feel so great! You can tell in your pictures how much weight you&apos;ve lost! I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll do well when you start back.

Taz - I don&apos;t eat organic meats or veggies...the only organic things I think I have are some of the spices or something because of a lower salt count (or they just aren&apos;t made as&quot;non-organic&quot;). But I&apos;ve done really well...I think the majority of people on here don&apos;t eat organic meats or veggies. Don&apos;t stress. hmhuntr August 28th, 2009, 11:40 PM Hey Ladies- I have had the worst case of munchies today. Pork rinds have been my friend even though I don&apos;t care that much for them. The BBQ ones aren&apos;t too bad I just have to be sure and chug the water. I just had a little white chocolate sugar free-fat free pudding with a squirt of whip cream. (supposedly all legal) trying to kill off the sweet tooth now! After sitting and figuring out my cycle which messed itself up, I will probably start right about the time I start the injections. I took them through my period last time and didn&apos;t have any problems so i guess I&apos;ll bite the bullet and do it all at the same time. Let&apos;s keep our fingers crossed that I&apos;m that lucky again.

Ana- I know you wanted to be lower with school starting but at least you didn&apos;t go back up like crazy ya know! That&apos;s something to be proud of!
Hizboo- I read alot of your posts when I was trying to decided on doing this thing. Glad to see you back and to hear that part about staying at your new set weight!! Yeah to no longer being a Diabetic! That&apos;s Fabulous!!! I hope that&apos;s what my hubby hears when we&apos;re finished:D
Shiela- I&apos;ve only done one round so far but I was really surprised at how I did. I wasn&apos;t sure since I was starting at a lower weight if I would see much of a loss. (Lost rest with Phen) but I ended up losing 12 which would have been more if I hadn&apos;t messed up and cheated, plus I hit 2 plateaus because of what I think were pre set weights. But the inches lost REALLY had me jumping for joy! Even while on P3 I have lost a few more inches from the rearranging I guess.
Taz- I don&apos;t know about starting so high. Everything I read says that the higher the dose the faster your body builds up immunity. My hubby was 320 when he started with me and we both did 175i.u. He didn&apos;t have ANY trouble with hunger AT ALL! I say start on the low end and if it&apos;s not curbing the hunger, THEN up your dose a little. Why waste it if you don&apos;t have to. As far as food, we do not eat organic. Sometimes I may pick up an organic meat but only if it&apos;s in the clearance section ya know! I&apos;m cheap!;) I have picked up a few organic spices just for the lower salt and sugar content but then again...when they&apos;re cheap. Take a breath and relax girl! You&apos;re going to burn 10 pounds just by stressin out!:D corkaiasja09 August 29th, 2009, 07:42 PM hi everbody.... i&apos;ve been reading these boards for quite a while but never had the courage to post anything. What gave me the courage today u ask??? Well after alot of thought and not being able to get a phen **, I decided to take the advice of a friend (who has lost alot of weight) and try the HCG. So I ordered and it should be here any day now, but i still have unanswered questions. The first thing I need to know is after you start losing all this weight with minimal exercise, does your skin begin to sag?? I think having saggy skin will be just as bad as being phat to me. i got aMILLION questions but i cant think of any more right now. oh yeah, are you guys using phen and hcg at the same time??? does that make u lose weight faster or does it just help with the hunger??? i also wanted to know where did the weight start coming off of you first??? i have three kids and my tummy is huge!!! i was just wondering what i could expect from my first round of hcg??? i really excited and nervous at the same time.. any feedback would be great. thanks!!!:) Suzy-Q August 29th, 2009, 08:08 PM Newbie, here. Where are you all getting this HCG? I&apos;ve looked online, and all I can find is a place in California, that costs several thousand dollars! I&apos;ve been on Phen (37.5) since Aug. 19th, and notice my clothes are a little looser, but I don&apos;t own a scale (I refuse to buy one), so I don&apos;t know how much I&apos;ve lost. Also, I&apos;m still REALLY hungry! Arg! :(

Please send me a PM with the HCG info, if it&apos;s not allowed on the forum. Suzy-Q August 29th, 2009, 10:51 PM Thank you! Oshun August 30th, 2009, 01:19 PM Congrats Shelia on no longer being diabetic! corkaiasja09 August 30th, 2009, 06:36 PM hey tazgirl! it will be nice to have a buddy on these boards. those gorge days seem like they are really tuff, especially if you&apos;ve already been dedicated to eating right. i dont think 1.2 pounds is alot to gain during&quot;the gorge&quot;i guess we&apos;ll see if the binge paid off in the next few days.. i was wondering about how u could tell if youre getting the real deal from these websites and a pregnancy test is a great idea!!! i woulda never even thought about that (go figure!) good luck on the next few days!! let me know if ur really hungry or if it changes ur mood or anything like that. i want to know what to expect.... i plan to gorge on Saturday and Sunday next week so i can be totally lazy as well. i just hope i have the meds by then hmhuntr August 31st, 2009, 12:26 AM It sems like the P3 part is getting easier. I feel like I have eaten more in the last week than I ever did on a&quot;normal&quot;basis. Even hubby said that he can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve stayed within my two pounds because it seems like I am always eating. Peanut butter has become my new best friend. I had probably eaten 2 things with PB on them in three years but now....whoa! I snack on it all through the day, it&apos;s crazy. Maybe I&apos;m stock piling protein IDK. We went to Ryans after church today and I shocked myself. I didn&apos;t have any trouble what so ever staying within the guidelines...yeah me! Guess the truth will show itself on the scale in the morning huh? My stepmom told me at church today that I looked kinda boney in my upper body. I replied: Thanks, that&apos;s the nicest thing anyone has said to me all day!:D LOL

Taz- how did your 2nd gorge day go? I am already making a mental list of all of the things I want to eat this weekend..I can&apos;t wait!
Oshun- Did you make it to your goal? I was thinking about you today!:) Munchie August 31st, 2009, 05:21 AM Hello everyone,

I swear this forum is a god-send!!! It&apos;s been a while since I had been on the site and reading this tread has reminded me while I loved it so much :D
I am really fascinated with this HCG discussion. It has breathed new life into my diet motivations&amp;strategies. I have been on Phen 37.5 for almost 2 years now. It worked great for a long time and I was able to lose close 40 lbs on it. However, I think its effects seemed to have worn off a bit. On top of that, I must admit that my motivation has also not been what it used to. I am really feeling desperate as I would like to lose another 30lbs. I eat healthy as much as possible&amp;exercise has now become part of my routine.
My big problem is I travel constantly for work, not only in the US but all over the world. If I am lucky, I get to spend 7 days at home in a given month. I am planning on getting the HCG online&amp;doing the injections myself. However, I have two concerns:
1. How conservable are the supplies if I have to take them on a plane across the world?
2. How strictly do I need to follow the diet for it to be effective, given the fact that I live in hotels&amp;do not have access to a kitchen to prepare my own meals.
Any advice you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your support&amp;motivation. I love reading how everyone&apos;s success stories. You all have inspired me tremendously. TheToyMaker August 31st, 2009, 08:33 AM Morning! I just finished catching up on all the posts -- I haven&apos;t been on in days. Wednesday will be the end of the second week of P3. I&apos;m going to try to do P3 for 4 weeks before starting another round. I&apos;m pretty much staying in the 2 pound range and it is getting easier. I&apos;m going to do a steak day today to see if I can get rid of some weight. I did have a run-in with some brownies but other than that I&apos;ve pretty much be low-carbing. I&apos;m so carb-intolerant that if I eat very many carbs I always gain.

Hmhuntr, you asked about school several pages back. I&apos;m taking 2 classes this time: Microsoft Server Administration and IT Security. I have two bachelor degrees already; one in biology with a minor in English and the second one is Computer Science with a double-major in Business Administration. I&apos;ve always made my living in the IT industry. I&apos;m taking classes because I&apos;d really like to pick up some technical certifications. Plus, I just like being a student! It&apos;s weird that you would ask about measurements because I was looking at my waist in the mirror this morning, thinking it looked smaller. I didn&apos;t have time to measure but it sure looked like it had gotten smaller. You seem to do well with your shorter (less than 40 days) intervals on P2. I&apos;m thinking I might do that this time because I can stay focused for 23 days; the 40 is harder to do.

Welcome to all you new folks and to all the&quot;seasoned&quot;folks -- Carry on!

Have a great Monday! hmhuntr August 31st, 2009, 09:25 AM Toy- I hear you about liking being a student. Ire ally enjoyed myself when I went back to school this last time and as soon as I was finished I really missed it. Guess that&apos;s why I picked up these two classes even though it adds to my insanity level! Maybe I&apos;ll have to hit you up for some tutoring if my Statistics class starts giving me h e l l ;)
Taz-I thought we agreed that you were going to stop stressin!;) j/k Quick numbers for you from Prinster&apos;s book:Lettuce, Spinach, asperagus, cucumbers, chard, celery, and cabbage, 2 Cups. Tomatoes, onions, greens, 1cup. As far as the cherry tomatoes I would say estimate enough of them to make one decent size tomato. To be honest I didn&apos;t measure my veggies that closely. As far as meat: shrimp,crab,lobster,halibut,sole,flounder,sea bass, chicken,veal,buffalo,beef. 100 grams. Stawberries are 6-8 berries depending on the size.

Somehow I managed to weigh in under the required two pounds even with eating out and the stuff I shoveled in around the house. Hope this isn&apos;t lulling me into a false sense of security!:o My HCG is in the next town over as of yesterday so it may be here today. My Bac water arrived last week. Guess I had better make sure I still have a mixing vial. I&apos;m ready to go again simply because if I am sticking to the food guidelines I&apos;d like to see the scale go down ya know???Not just stay the same:D
Have a great Monday y&apos;all SheilaK August 31st, 2009, 10:15 AM Hello everyone!
Well, I evidently don&apos;t do very well on P3!! I started it on Saturday and also went out of town. Didn&apos;t get to drink enough water and ate out for my meals. I thought I was pretty careful except for some tortilla chips at the mexican restaraunt but didnt get home till late yesterday and this morning had gained 4 lbs!!! Uh oh not good. I am retaining fluid and also have not had a BM since probably Friday. Now I didn&apos;t even have that problem during P2 so what should I do? I walked at least 2 miles yesterday and cleaned house like a madwoman when I got home yesterday. I am doing a steak day today but am not very happy. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

hmhunter - what do you eat for a day? examples please?
toy - you should check your measurements, it always puts me in a good mood to see inches disappear!
taz - i think you would have to really overdo it with veggies and fruits to mess up, i never measured any of them just ate my protein and then filled in with the fruits and veggies until i was full or didn&apos;t want anymore. You will get the hang of it pretty quickly!
oshun- how are you doing??? I think i like P2 better than P3! Weird huh? I guess I am just so used to being restricted! Oshun August 31st, 2009, 10:38 AM It sems like the P3 part is getting easier. I feel like I have eaten more in the last week than I ever did on a&quot;normal&quot;basis. Even hubby said that he can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve stayed within my two pounds because it seems like I am always eating. Peanut butter has become my new best friend. I had probably eaten 2 things with PB on them in three years but now....whoa! I snack on it all through the day, it&apos;s crazy. Maybe I&apos;m stock piling protein IDK. We went to Ryans after church today and I shocked myself. I didn&apos;t have any trouble what so ever staying within the guidelines...yeah me! Guess the truth will show itself on the scale in the morning huh? My stepmom told me at church today that I looked kinda boney in my upper body. I replied: Thanks, that&apos;s the nicest thing anyone has said to me all day!:D LOL

Taz- how did your 2nd gorge day go? I am already making a mental list of all of the things I want to eat this weekend..I can&apos;t wait!
Oshun- Did you make it to your goal? I was thinking about you today!:)


Thank you Hmhuntr! That is so sweet. I took my last shot yesterday and today I am 200 pounds. huerita August 31st, 2009, 10:40 AM Taz - so, how was your first day on VLCD? Were you hungry? I think you will be able to stay with the 175-200 cc and be fine. My daughter does about 200cc and I do about 175 cc. It&apos;s never exact cuz it&apos;s hard to see the right line when you pull back the syringe, but it&apos;s right around there.

We haven&apos;t been hungry at all. We are starting our 3rd week of P2 and she has lost 17 lbs and I have lost 16 lbs. The only cheating we&apos;ve done is munched on a little more meat. It&apos;s not because of being hungry, it&apos;s just that we have a bunch of boys in our family who are naturally thin and everything they cook or bring in just starts smelling up the whole house. So, a little nibbling on a piece of meat or a bite of cucumber or cabbage is how we cheat. I start chugging the water and running around spraying air freshner. Especially when they cook popcorn!

So, we haven&apos;t been hungry at all and I hope that&apos;s your experience. Oshun August 31st, 2009, 10:41 AM Hello everyone,

I swear this forum is a god-send!!! It&apos;s been a while since I had been on the site and reading this tread has reminded me while I loved it so much :D
I am really fascinated with this HCG discussion. It has breathed new life into my diet motivations&amp;strategies. I have been on Phen 37.5 for almost 2 years now. It worked great for a long time and I was able to lose close 40 lbs on it. However, I think its effects seemed to have worn off a bit. On top of that, I must admit that my motivation has also not been what it used to. I am really feeling desperate as I would like to lose another 30lbs. I eat healthy as much as possible&amp;exercise has now become part of my routine.
My big problem is I travel constantly for work, not only in the US but all over the world. If I am lucky, I get to spend 7 days at home in a given month. I am planning on getting the HCG online&amp;doing the injections myself. However, I have two concerns:
1. How conservable are the supplies if I have to take them on a plane across the world?
2. How strictly do I need to follow the diet for it to be effective, given the fact that I live in hotels&amp;do not have access to a kitchen to prepare my own meals.
Any advice you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your support&amp;motivation. I love reading how everyone&apos;s success stories. You all have inspired me tremendously.


Hi Munchie. The HCG has to be kept cool and away from light. Oshun August 31st, 2009, 10:42 AM Toy- I hear you about liking being a student. Ire ally enjoyed myself when I went back to school this last time and as soon as I was finished I really missed it. Guess that&apos;s why I picked up these two classes even though it adds to my insanity level! Maybe I&apos;ll have to hit you up for some tutoring if my Statistics class starts giving me h e l l ;)

This is amazing! huerita August 31st, 2009, 10:44 AM hizboo - OMG! it is so fantastic that you are no longer diabetic. That is soooo exciting. Besides being fat, becoming diabetic is the main reason I said&quot;that&apos;s it I have to lose weight and my daughter does too.&quot;My mom got diagnosed a couple years ago. I have uncles on both sides of my family and grandfather and mom who all are or were diabetic.

I am so excited for you. That must have been an awesome day. Congratulations!! Oshun August 31st, 2009, 10:46 AM Hello everyone!

oshun- how are you doing??? I think i like P2 better than P3! Weird huh? I guess I am just so used to being restricted!

I am doing well. Thanks for asking. This round has been much more difficult than the first one. It seems I hit one or two set weights.

I think you doing a steak day would be good and don&apos;t forget about the apple day to release water.

I forgot what some of the ladies were doing for a BM. I think they were taking Smoov Move tea or something to that effect. huerita August 31st, 2009, 02:08 PM Taz, I don&apos;t really fix the cabbage. I like it fresh so I just cut a wedge and chomp away. It&apos;s kind of sweet, better tasting than just lettuce. Where did you get the flavored stevia? I may buy from netricion. com They have 11 different flavors. They are $10 for 2 oz. each. I meant to look up a couple other sites someone said, but I got busy with work and forgot what they are. Have to look back a page or 2.

I never got any bumps, other than the red dots on the tummy from the injections. But I did notice my first 2 days I got a little dizzy, light headed right after the injection. Now, I don&apos;t get that. Can&apos;t even tell that I injected anything, I&apos;m just not hungry and have to notice that it&apos;s time to eat or I would totally skip a meal! huerita August 31st, 2009, 02:24 PM The other 2 sites that Oshun gave me were vitacost and iherb. Vitacost is very reasonable and they have flat fee shipping, which is good. So does netrition. Vitacost shipping is 4.99 and Netrition is 4.95. The better deal is Vitacost and they have most, not all of the same flavors as Netrition.

Just thought I&apos;d let everyone know in case they needed a place to get it too! :-) aracely2027 August 31st, 2009, 04:54 PM Hi ladies, so i&apos;m still waiting for my hcg, i called adc and they said they were working on getting my tracking #.

For those who like cabbage:

thinly shred the cabbage add half of a lemon (depending how much cabbage you are eating also you can put vinegar instead of the lemon) and add a little of salt (depending how salty you wanted) you can add pepper to it if u like. Also i like to add chopped tomato and slice turnips, but i know mixing vegetables while being on the protocol is not allowed so just do the cabbage alone it tastes really good with about anything especially with a grill steak.;) SheilaK August 31st, 2009, 07:38 PM Hi Taz
I did my round with just the HCG, for the most part I really wasn&apos;t hungry. I was incredibly tired though. I tried to walk 1 mile per day but couldn&apos;t do anymore than that and sometimes that was a stretch. I ended up going off my blood pressure meds because it was too low. I think for some people it takes a few days for the HCG to kick in as far as the apetite goes. aracely2027 August 31st, 2009, 08:01 PM Do u just put the cabbage in a pan of water and steam it ? I been wondering how to cook cabbage I ate it raw tonight and it was ok cause I was soooo starved but yea I wanna cook it sometimes....I will try this way...Thanx....

taz- no you don&apos;t steam it, you eat it raw. So you have a whole cabbage and cut it in half and save the other half in the fridge. Now the half that you have just cut whatever you are gonna eat. you cut it into thin slice i mean thin very thin, and then you want to add the lemon, salt and pepper if you like. hmhuntr August 31st, 2009, 08:58 PM Taz- I didn&apos;t take phen with HCG and I really wasn&apos;t hungry either. Now I did suffer with some serious&quot;Head Hunger&quot;. It wasn&apos;t that I was physically hungry but my brain would drive me crazy thinking about food until I was twitching like a junkie needing a fix. The low energy could be a decrease in caffeine if the teas are decaffinated. It could just be that the teas aren&apos;t agreeing with your system. I did have to space out what I ate though. If I ate it all at one time my brain only thought about the fact that I had nothing left to eat ya know? I usually ate my breadstick ( Grissini) in the morning on my way out the door. I ate that instead of Melba toast because it seemed like I was getting more. At luch I ate the meat and veggie and then my fruit between lunch and dinner. After dinner I usually ate the fruit and then the Grissini late at night when I was in the mood for something crunchy. I wonder if the reason you and Aly didn&apos;t do so well is because you guys are primarily low carb and if the carb-fest during gorge days are wreecking havoc with your body and throwing it into a tail spin??? hmhuntr August 31st, 2009, 09:18 PM Shiela- I don&apos;t really follow any set plan on eating. With the 3 kids and work and both of us back in school I have to go on the fly. Here lately I have been a big fan of peanut butter for some reason. SO I have been eating probably about 1/4 cup in the morning on my way out the door. Lunch I sometimes make chicken salad with a small can of white meat chicken, mayo, unsweetened pickles relish, bolied egg, and onion. After it sets for a moment I put it in something called a Flat Out wrap. Walmart and Kroger sells them. They&apos;re low carb, zero sugar, and about 90 cals with a ton of fiber. I smear the chicken salad until it coevers the wrap and then roll it up like a burrito. It seems huge. Then usually bbq pork rinds for the crunch factor. I snack on PB off and on through out the day sometimes with an apple. Dinner is usually sometype of grilled or baked meat, greenbeans with onion and bacon, maybe a salad. I have also added a low fat/carb cheese stick and dill pickle spears. Pretty much always have a spoonful or two of PB right before bed also. I have no idea why because I hardly EVER ate it before. Maybe it&apos;s all of the extra protein I&apos;m getting in???I have also been indulging in the FF/SF puddings with skim milk and a little real whip cream on top. Hubby bought some popsicles that are SF/FF also with 10 cals. Yummy! Lots and Lots of unsweet tea with stevia. I am probably a fluke and this will bite me in the butt when I least expect it. Proceed with caution :o hmhuntr August 31st, 2009, 09:21 PM Oshun- I&apos;m thinking light, floaty,airy thoughts for you! I see 199 in your future:D:D:D hmhuntr August 31st, 2009, 11:44 PM I know during P3 we have our 2 lb window. How does that apply to TOM? I&apos;m due Thurs and I think that&apos;s why I&apos;ve been chowing lately now that i think about it. Anyway, my question is? If I am starting the injections on Friday and between now and then my weight DOES flux should I do the steak day/apple day or just push the water and stick with the plan? Don&apos;t ask me why this just became so clear to me. I guess it had something to do with looking at my previous post and what I have been consuming. Knowing my luck since I mentioned not being over my weight I WILL be tomorrow ya know?:p ClassNsass September 1st, 2009, 12:27 AM I know, I&apos;m terrible at posting! I&apos;ve been on the road so much, it&apos;s hard to post but I always read! I&apos;m starting my 2nd round tmrw. I gorges already and will start protocol tmrw. I&apos;m going to try and get phentermine this time around to battle my mental food addiction and for added energy! P3 has been a breeze...actually crave veggies! Anyone about to enter P3 who&apos;s nervous...it&apos;s not a big deal! I too felt crazy worried, but it&apos;s all been okay.

TAZ~in my opinion, the way your feeling is normal and your body is just deprived and trying to adjust. This diet is NO piece if cake. It&apos;s not easy and nothing to be taken lightly. Your eating 500 calories for crying out loud...that&apos;s HARD. This is most def not for everyone. You have to know the difference between hunger and mental cravings. You also have to have crazy will power. I also had no energy...that&apos;s normal. I felt like sh!t on this diet, but I lost 23 pounds in 23 days and have kept it off. Gotta weigh your options. Very few people feel&quot;normal&quot;. A few of us even experience blacking out a few times a day including myself. If you want to do it, you have to be strong...if not it probably won&apos;t work. It does work, but again...it&apos;s NOT easy!

HMHUN~Your doing so great! Congrats to both you and your husband. That&apos;s really funny about your cravings for peanut butter...both ASU and I also crave it on this diet! Her and I actually eat it during protocol as a protein!

There&apos;s so many people who are gone! I miss you all :)

Okay, here&apos;s to another round! Hope it&apos;s better than the last!! ShellPrice September 1st, 2009, 12:26 PM Taz, the rash is called pregnancy rash and is normal. I had it all down both arms and legs and it went away in about a week.

Try eating celery or carrots beetween meals. The clinic I went through to start on HCG had tweaked the protocol slightly and it offered a little more leeway which helped. They said that eating raw vegetables (except tomatoes or lettuce) between meals was a freebie and you don&apos;t even have to count those calories. I know that carrots are not on the original protocol but I lost 26 lbs my first round, so maybe they are onto something.

I am at 49.2 lbs lost now since April 15 so it can&apos;t be all wrong. SheilaK September 1st, 2009, 05:32 PM Help please! I am on day 4 of P3 and am having trouble. I gained 3 pounds so did a steak day. Went down one pound this morning but am wondering how many days are you supposed to steak days in a row? Also, my period is here so what if the weight is because of that and it doesn&apos;t go away until its over? My periods usually last at least 7 days. Help!!! I just dont want to blow this!

Thanks!:confused::confused: corkaiasja09 September 1st, 2009, 07:40 PM TAZ- U LOOK AWESOME! good job girl!! i&apos; m still waiting on my HCG. wonder if it will ever get here??? oh weell!! sorry u are feeling bad but i bet those are the hormones. i was feeling exactly like u explained during my first trimester. it was horrible so i know what u are going through... 5 pounds in 1 day is amazing!! hope u can continue... i need your progress for my motivation:o i am starting out where u were when u started, so i know i got a long road ahead of me... any way ur pics look great especially the bathing suit. u should not be embarassed at all! i cant wait for the day i can put on one. i miss swimming so bad but theres no WAY i could put on a swimsuit at this size!!! huerita September 1st, 2009, 10:00 PM TAZ - OMG, You are Hot! You look so good! I can&apos;t wait till I look that good. You have done so well on your own. I sure hope you find this a lot easier because, girl, you deserve it!!! I hope those headaches stop. I know you&apos;re not supposed to take anything, but the doc did say some patients had to and some also had to take some vitamins.

I wanted to ask you about the shrimp. You had 23 of them! Yum Yum. But were they little salad shrimp or jumbo shrimp? Cuz I only eat about 6 at a meal. I don&apos;t weigh them, just grab a handful. I sooo want to eat more at a meal. The ones I eat are jumbo with tail on.

huerita huerita September 1st, 2009, 10:05 PM Help please! I am on day 4 of P3 and am having trouble. I gained 3 pounds so did a steak day. Went down one pound this morning but am wondering how many days are you supposed to steak days in a row? Also, my period is here so what if the weight is because of that and it doesn&apos;t go away until its over? My periods usually last at least 7 days. Help!!! I just dont want to blow this!

Thanks!:confused::confused:
Hi SheilaK,

I read a few pages back (ok, maybe more than a few, not sure just where) that some had done a steak day 3 days in a row. One husband did it for 3 days and lost 12 lbs!!!
Men are lucky, they always lose faster than us. Anyhow, I think its okay to do it 2 or 3 days, just don&apos;t go below -2 lbs either.

Hope that helps!
huerita huerita September 1st, 2009, 10:10 PM does anyone have the recipe book that was being emailed around a bit? I would love to have a copy. my email is shannonlopez1@gmail.com

thanks so much!

huerita ShellPrice September 1st, 2009, 11:07 PM sent it to you.


Taz - you look great!!!!! hmhuntr September 1st, 2009, 11:20 PM Taz- I took ibuprofen several times and it didn&apos;t affect my loss. I really like the first pic in the vest...too cute! Hubby thought I was a freak for taking a camera in a dressing room! I told him there are a ton of woman that do it!:D

Sheila- For some reason it took me two steak days to get back whenever I had to do them. The first would usually bring me to .2-.4 away from where I needed to be but I did the second to make sure I was within my range.

Huerita- I buy the bag of frozen cocktail shrimp that are deveined and just need to be thawed but I put them on the Forman. I weigh them but I would guess around 20. I&apos;m a visual person so I would rather see 20 little ones than 5 bigger ones.

cork- Hope your supplies come soon! I know it&apos;s hard waiting when you&apos;re excited and ready to go!

Class- Glad to see you back and posting again. Looks like we are going to be doing P2 together. I&apos;m starting Friday. Wanted the weekend to gorge while my brother-in-law was in town and we could show here around and hit a great eatery or two.

I amazingly was within my 2 lb range this morning but I&apos;m started to feel bloated. I know TOM is creeping up on me. I can feel it breathing down my neck! I SOOO can&apos;t wait to start gorging on Friday! huerita September 2nd, 2009, 01:19 AM sent it to you.


Taz - you look great!!!!!
Thanks so much Shell. I got it. My daughter and i are both saying&quot;yeah&quot;!!!! NCGreenEyes September 2nd, 2009, 03:05 AM Hey ladies! I&apos;ve been MIA for a few days, but my work laptop had some serious viruses goin on and I was trying to fix it...I finally gave up and let the tech guy at work handle it. So I&apos;m on my personal laptop now after having to load all my stuff on here.

I finished up my round (month for me, since I do mine back to back b/c of different injections) today, and I can happily say I lost 20.2 lbs this month and 18 inches! I was soooooo excited yesterday because I could wear a pair of my american eagle jeans (size 14) that I haven&apos;t been able to wear in THREE YEARS! Granted they are a tiny bit tight still, and I can&apos;t fit into the other 2 pairs I have yet...but I was still so happy!

I&apos;m so hoping that I do well again this month, because if I can keep losing at a good rate, then I can be beyond my goal weight by the time I have to go off the diet (at the end of 4 months)....which would be just in time for December and all the yummy Christmas goodies!!

Anyway...I&apos;m too lazy right now to go back and comment on everything, so everyone hang in there, keep up the good work, good luck to those getting ready to start, and welcome back to the people who have been MIA for awhile - I know I&apos;ve missed you! hmhuntr September 2nd, 2009, 09:42 PM Taz- I took my injections through TOM but it was tword the end of my round. I didn&apos;t have any trouble with it. Now this time it looks like I am going to be starting right after starting the injections. I hope it works well. I think the reason they say notto take it is because your body already produces HCG with TOM. SO you don&apos;t need it. You&apos;re hunger should still be surpressed but the book says it&apos;s best if you have been on the injections for 10 days by the time TOM comes.

I caved and had an ice cream sundae tonight with the kids. I know that i am supposed to be gorging on Friday morning but I just said what the heck. It should be interesting huh? I would hate to have to do a steak day on my last day of P3. How bad would that s u c k?:o
I also just agreed to sign on with my PRN company for 32 hours a week as a regular employee and well as my peds. job and 2 classes at the university. I must be insane but it was really hard to turn down the money because my peds caseload dropped this month and I have my first car payment to make on the 26th. I guess ya gotta do what ya gotta do??? If nothing else I&apos;ll work off the weight by running around like a chicken with my head cut off. ASU89 September 2nd, 2009, 10:02 PM Oh my god.... 5 LONG messages in a row? Are you serious? You need to join some typing club or find something else to do with your time, because that is ridiculous how much and how often you post.
Not to sound like a total b!tch, but you are wondering where everyone is? Quite a few of us left because of you and how much you write. You totally took over this thread, which makes it no longer fun to come on here and read about peoples progress.... it&apos;s now all about you giving us up to the hour updates on yourself. Really, not many people care about how difficult it&apos;s been for you.
Just had to get that off my shoulders. anadingding September 2nd, 2009, 10:12 PM Hi girls well this Monday I started my Masters degree. It is going good so far. Im getting happier with my choice of degree. I have been doing really good on my food intake and I just started exercising again today did 40 mins on my treadmill.:D I feel like a new found motivation so I hope I can do it this time. Like I mentioned before Im not doing the HCG anymore just on my own and phen;)LOL

HUM-- yeah your right at least I didnt go back to school weighing more than I used to.

Taz- Girl you look good! And are very pretty! Congrats on your accomplishment! Keep up the good work! You know when I was doing the HCG I was also on phen maybe thats why it did not work for me.

Class--- Im glad your still here! Good luck on this round! I know that can do it!

Thanx for the sweet compliments!!!!! So the hcg didnt work very well for u? Well I must say u look great and ur also a verrrry prettty person and about halloween I would so wear something sexy even if u dont lose those 20 pounds cause u look beautiful the way u r!!!! I did get me a lady pirate costume today lol and was like hmmm I think I will dress up this year it will be fun and I look pretty good in it!....even the little brown boots to my knees!!!!! so yea it will be exciting for sure!!!! Plus Im hoping to lose 24 pounds by then so I think we can do it girl!!!! Im not on phen and havent been on phen at all this year was on it back last october when I first started my weight loss journey...but was only on it a few weeks or so....So I have busted my butt big time over the last year on my own.....it was hard but I stuck it out!!!! Im pretty strong minded when I set my mind to doing something!!!!! So u just keep up what ur doing and u will be there in no time!!!!!! Taz huerita September 2nd, 2009, 11:32 PM hmhuntr: your posts and everyone elses are interesting to me. They motivate me.

I&apos;ve been working all day and night, still am actually - deadlines you know, but I had to come on here to keep me going. I am at a plateau already and what a bummer! I am doing an apple day today. I haven&apos;t been cheating, but 4 days at the same weight is discouraging.

I&apos;m not hungry, I just need tastes, different tastes every now and then. I did go ahead and have a little crystal light for a different flavor. My problem is my boys and their dad are always cooking something that smells so good. Smelling and not being able to taste is the hard part. But I just keep thinking, well, they can go ahead and pig out, soon, I&apos;ll be looking good!

But really, just reading on here helps stay committed. hmhuntr September 2nd, 2009, 11:53 PM huerita- thanks for what you said. I know some days coming on here is one of the few things that keep me on track. Have you and your daughter gotten to try any of the recipes yet? Were you effected by the hurricane? huerita September 3rd, 2009, 09:02 AM huerita- thanks for what you said. I know some days coming on here is one of the few things that keep me on track. Have you and your daughter gotten to try any of the recipes yet? Were you effected by the hurricane?

No, we haven&apos;t tried any of them, but we have been going through the book picking out all kinds of them we want to try. I get paid once a month, mainly, depending on how many companies I do work for (bpo&apos;s) and then whenever I close an escrow. I have lots of clients and have listings, but getting an offer accepted on either side can be hard and then commission bites. I&apos;ve got one closing at the end of this month that will pay about $590. But my expenses are way higher than that. (MLS and Supra dues), gas money, internet and phone bills are outrageous.

So, when I get my big check around the 15th, that&apos;s when we&apos;ll shop for ingredients. Can&apos;t wait!

As far as hurricane? I don&apos;t know anything about it. Don&apos;t watch the news much, too busy with bpo&apos;s!

Thank you so much! TOM finally came a few days ago and I weigh 200 even so I am thinking I may have made it to 199-198 or so bc of the water weight gain.

But even so- there are people who are/have noticed the loss and I have spurred some sort of weight loss competition among the people around me. :p

Except they don&apos;t know I am on HCG. Oshun September 3rd, 2009, 01:02 PM I apologize. I misread and that was you that is no longer diabetic! Congratulations! That is a wonderful thing for your long term health! MO-chic September 3rd, 2009, 01:06 PM I started back on P2 Tuesday. Im now on my first day of VLCD. I didnt do so well last round. I didnt lose much and gained it all back on gorge. Hopefully I will be able to get it off quick. I know exactally what my problem was. I didnt eat accourding to the protocol. I pretty much ate like I was still on P3. Well now that Im in school I wont be sitting around the house all the time and wanting to eat. I will let you know how Im doing. I am going to try and get on everyday or so. Ive been taking my laptop to school so that maybe I would have a chance to check in. Its practically impossible to do that when I get home. Hope everyone is doing good! MO-chic September 3rd, 2009, 01:45 PM For some reason the first part of my message didnt show up. Im sorry I havent been on here in a while. I started school and its been crazy. I know a lot of you are in school too but man, I have been a stay at home mom for 4 years and all this homework and never being home is taking me a while to get used to. I will try and get on here more often. I&apos;ve been taking my laptop to school and I though I might be able to get on sometime while Im there cause once I get home I think it will be impossible. ASU89 September 3rd, 2009, 01:46 PM Ana - Thank you! I just chopped off 6 inches! It&apos;s so much nicer than having long hair...especially having to walk in this heat to and from classes! Good job on getting a great start on your masters. I&apos;m still an undergrad. :)

Huerita - I don&apos;t think I was being rude or snobby. I was just saying what was on mine and everyone else&apos;s mind. :rolleyes:

Oshun - WOW you are on a roll missy! Congratulations!

MO - You have been missed! You need to start getting back on here everyday lady! We all miss you. Congrats to another round! ClassNsass September 3rd, 2009, 06:06 PM Ana~Girl, you better stay here and not leave again(I guess I should take that into account too haha). I really do enjoy you here and look forward to losing together again! Good luck with this week, we can do it! One day at s time!

ASU~WOW, you look FABULOUS! Honestly, you look like a stick! Must be nice lol. How are you doing with your low cal diet? Hope it&apos;s going well for you :)

MO~Oh how I&apos;ve missed you! I was getting concerned that you were falling off the wagon and I really didn&apos;t want to see that happen as you&apos;ve worked SO hard and came SO far! I know it may be hard to get on here, but do it for yourself...even if it&apos;s just a 5 minute post! It&apos;s great motivation for you and I KNOW you can get back on track and reach those goals. Come on girl, let&apos;s do it!!

I don&apos;t think ASU was meaning mean in any way. She had just had enough and honestly spoke for a lot of us. I think it&apos;s great if we all get on here once a day and give a re-cap of how it went...if we lost, if we gained, or if we cheated. Our struggles, our failures. It&apos;s a motivation tool for us all...a great outlet. BUT, when someone posts all day long, it gets a bit repetative, irritating and frustrating at times and can ruin the fun in this. I think we are all here for the right reasons and to help eachother and be there for one another. This really isn&apos;t a chat room, it&apos;s a place to check in and I think that&apos;s how it should stay :)

As for me...oh Lordy! From gorging I&apos;m up almost 8 pounds, yes that&apos;s EIGHT! Yucky! I made a yummy cake and ate at least 2/3rds...that could be the culprit haha. I was only trying to do a good job gorging sheesh! Lol. I went to the doctors today and got a script for Phen. Last round was really tough for me mentally and physically so I&apos;m hoping it&apos;ll help with the mental cravings and to increase energy. We&apos;ll see! Just an FYI for anyone on phen...I filled it at Costco and supposedly they are using a different distributor so my total cost for 30 pills was only $9.23! The last time was $65! Craziness! So, here&apos;s to hoping these flippin 8 pounds come off by like tmrw?? lol only playing :)

Hope your all having a beautiful day :) ASU89 September 3rd, 2009, 06:15 PM Oh man Class, 8 lbs haha. Sounds like what I gained my 2nd and 3rd gorge days. It took about 2-3 days to come off, but it is definitely worth it. I love when I eat and eat and eat my favorite foods until the point I get disgusted by them for the whole entire round. My low cal diet is going well. I can eat all my favorite foods within portion size... today for lunch I got a huge thing of frozen yogurt for about 150-175 calories. I LOVE frozen yogurt. :) Oh and I can eat a million carbs a day, as long as I stay within my calorie range I still lose... so it&apos;s nice.
By the way, I think the picture elongates my face and makes it look slimmer.. I swear it isn&apos;t that thin yet! ;) Suzy-Q September 3rd, 2009, 07:14 PM OK, newbie dopey question alert...

What are these gorge days you all are talking about? corkaiasja09 September 3rd, 2009, 08:58 PM taz dont stop coming to the boards just because somebody is rude or mean !!! i still want to know ur progress.... my package came today !! YAY!!! i will start my journey on saturday. i still want to keep in touch so u can PM me ur progress as much as u like. i will try to check back often!!:) SheilaK September 3rd, 2009, 11:24 PM Hello everyone,
Glad to see some of you back, we have missed you. I am not doing so well, my body evidently liked P2 a lot better than P3. I am retaining so much fluid it is crazy. I have done 2 apple days and nothing is helping, I should also mention that it is TOM so that is contributing but I am getting very frustrated as I have gained 7 pounds!! What to do?:(:( hmhuntr September 3rd, 2009, 11:41 PM Sheila- I wish I knew something to tell you. TOM has a way of messing things up doesn&apos;t it. How&apos;s your sodium intake? I know pork makes me retain even more water than usual. As long as you are doing what you are supposed to maybe it will level itself out?:confused:

I loaded my injections tonight and we are gorging tomorrow. TOM is here for me as well so this should be interesting. Good Luck everyone! NCGreenEyes September 4th, 2009, 01:58 AM Hi ladies! So I&apos;m down 1.6 lbs from yesterday - woohoo!! I know that&apos;s not gonna happen that often, but it felt nice! This weekend is going to be soooo bad for me, I don&apos;t even want to discuss it! We are just going to say that I&apos;m taking the weekend off of the diet..or call it a loading weekend...whatever haha. Not really thrilled about what the outcome will be weight-wise, but I&apos;m really looking forward to it, and I need to go out and enjoy myself because of a lot of emotional stuff goin on with me right now.

Ana - Glad to see you back and that you are dedicated! Keep it up girl!

Oshun - Isn&apos;t it great when people start noticing?? It makes you want to try even harder!

MO - Welcome back!! You have been missed! I know that you can totally do this...you&apos;ve proven that already. Just stay tough, focused, and let us know when you need encouragement!

ASU - You do look great! I&apos;m glad to hear that the low cal diet is working well for you, that&apos;s awesome!

Class - Glad you are back...stick around this time! ;) While I know that you are not thrilled with the 8 lbs, I&apos;m sure it will come off quickly. Also, I do phen with the hcg and it really helps me. I notice big time if I forget to take the phen. Oh, and your comments on the&quot;taz situation&quot;totally sums up my thoughts on it.

corka - I think it has been said now by several people that ASU was not being rude/mean...just stating what a lot of us were thinking. This is a great place for encouragement, questions, and keeping up with how we are all doing...but we really did not need an all-day-long play-by-play of each of someone&apos;s days...summaries are one thing, questions are fine, etc....but really. Having almost a whole page of one person&apos;s posts was really driving me nuts.

Sheila - I gained a decent amount when I was on P3, but TOM is probably what is doing it to you. Just keep watching what you eat and I&apos;m sure that it will probably come off just like mine did. Hang in there!

hmhuntr - Enjoy your gorging...hopefully TOM won&apos;t mess with you too much. I&apos;m sure you are going to do great though since you&apos;ve already done so well! tazgirl31 September 4th, 2009, 10:55 AM taz dont stop coming to the boards just because somebody is rude or mean !!! i still want to know ur progress.... my package came today !! YAY!!! i will start my journey on saturday. i still want to keep in touch so u can PM me ur progress as much as u like. i will try to check back often!!:)

Thanx Corkaiasja!!!!! Ur right Im not going to let ANYONE run me off from this thread as I DESERVE to be here just as much as anyone else does!!! And I have never seen a list of rules stating how much u can post or write or how many times a day ur allowed on here so yea anyways Im bacccck to stay and will not let anyone get to me!!!! Im looking forward to completing this journey with u girl and Im sooooooooooooo excited for u that u got ur package!!!!!!!!! Taz tazgirl31 September 4th, 2009, 11:05 AM No, we haven&apos;t tried any of them, but we have been going through the book picking out all kinds of them we want to try. I get paid once a month, mainly, depending on how many companies I do work for (bpo&apos;s) and then whenever I close an escrow. I have lots of clients and have listings, but getting an offer accepted on either side can be hard and then commission bites. I&apos;ve got one closing at the end of this month that will pay about $590. But my expenses are way higher than that. (MLS and Supra dues), gas money, internet and phone bills are outrageous.

So, when I get my big check around the 15th, that&apos;s when we&apos;ll shop for ingredients. Can&apos;t wait!

As far as hurricane? I don&apos;t know anything about it. Don&apos;t watch the news much, too busy with bpo&apos;s!

Huerita!!! Thank you girl!!!! After a couple days thinking about all this Ur right I have Been a inspiration to MANY people on here with my strong will and commitment of losing all this weight without phen or anything else but Hard work!!!! And I am going to hold my head high and not let the little petty comments or anything else get to me!!! I am a better person then that and I am a strong person who can do this with or without anyone caring about my experiences or progress!!! But I have met some really good people on this thread who are my REAL friends and WHO has been looking up to me and following my progress and therfore I will not let them down!!!! And I am very glad I have met u cause u are A KIND, WONDERFUL, PERSON!!!!! And U have made my first week alot better!!!!!!! Soooo Im happy to be back and looking forward in getting to know u alot better!:) Taz tazgirl31 September 4th, 2009, 11:20 AM Ahhhh these last couple days have been great!!! And Im soooooooooooooo happy about my weight loss thus far!!! I have lost 9.1 pounds in 4 days!!! wooohooo!!!!! exciting!!! Its like christmas every morning getting up and getting on the scale for a new number!!!!!! Im just really impressed how well this hcg works!!!! I wish I would have started it back a few months ago and I could have been to goal already!!! But Im seeing 199 anytime soon so Im excited!!!!! As I have NOT seen the 100&quot;s in over 10 years so the day I see it I no I will cry and jump for joy!!!!!! I havent gotten my TOM yet.! But its slowly coming! I have decided to go a head and keep taking the injections through my period!!! Hopefully it wont be to harsh!!!!! haha.....Oh also wanted to share my yummmmm dinner I had last night!!! I piled some lettuce on my plate then cut up some cucumbers had like 5 slices of them and then took my grilled shrimp and put on top of this and then took and squirted a little vinagar over it all and WOW what a treat!!!!! it was sooo good Im having it again for lunch today!!!!! I no ur not really supposed to mix the veggies but I have been and so far havent had any trouble with it!!!! Anyways Thats all I have for now!!!!!! hope everyone has a awesome day!!!!!! Taz:p:p ClassNsass September 4th, 2009, 12:14 PM NC~I&apos;m so sorry, I meant to congratulate you before on your recent 20 pound loss. Goodness girl, your doing so great! I think we are only a few pounds away from eachother now. Good luck this weekend....just work extra hard when it&apos;s over for a few days! I have a question...how much Phen do you take a day? I take it towards the afternoon so it curbs my evening mental addictions to food(my brain thinks I NEED munchies all evening and night). Phen keeps me bright eyed and bushy tailed though. I always have bad insomnia with Phen....oh well, just pop a sleeping pill LOL.

HM~Ahhh, good luck to you and your hubby this round! Don&apos;t gorge as much as me haha. I actually think if your starting TOM at the start of HCG it may work out better. I know a lot of us stall when TOM comes, so you&apos;ll be smooth sailing after a few days until the end...that may be nice :)

Sheila~Have you tried taking a water pill? I take one every few days on P2 and P3...more often maybe in P3 as I&apos;m eating more foods. When TOM comes, I&apos;m easily up 5-8 pounds...so that could be culprit as well. Hope it&apos;s resolved soon for you.

SuzyQ~Gorging is what you do the first 2 days on the HCG protocol on Phase 2. You basically eat as much fatty foods as you possibly can. The gorge weight you gain is gone fast and somehow jump starts the weight loss.

ASU~OMG...frozen yogurt is my absolute FAV! Pinkberry being the ultimate lol. I ate it a few times a week on P3. Lucky you! Please eat some for me okay? I know, I thought of you when I saw I had gained 8 freakin pounds....I know you had a simular situation. NO fun!

As for me, I&apos;m down 3.5 pounds today.....woot woot! Have about abother 4 to lose to get rid of the gorge weight. I&apos;m hoping by Monday I&apos;ll be either back to where I started or have lost more. Phen REALLY helped me yesterday. There was a huge difference in my mental cravings so I&apos;m hoping this round will go better than last. Also, I&apos;m starting to think this bath of HCG may be more potent and my last bath was indeed a bad one. The one thing I noticed was that when I mixed my first HCG round, the HCG powder when liquified was VERY bubbly and fizzy. This time around the HCG powder when liquified was flat....no bubbles or fizz. So now I&apos;m really starting to think they were different medications. Kind of scary!! I&apos;ll be gone tonight until Monday so I&apos;ll probably check in again on Tuesday with hopefully some FAB weight loss stats LOL.

Oh yeah, I posted a new album from photos of my last round. It&apos;s only 23 pounds and there&apos;s really only a slight difference in my hip area, and thighs. I need to get photos of when I was 256 for a HUGE comparrison of how far I&apos;ve came!

Okay girls....going to start packing and cleaning! Hope everyone has an amazing holiday weekend. Be good! tazgirl31 September 4th, 2009, 12:24 PM I started back on P2 Tuesday. Im now on my first day of VLCD. I didnt do so well last round. I didnt lose much and gained it all back on gorge. Hopefully I will be able to get it off quick. I know exactally what my problem was. I didnt eat accourding to the protocol. I pretty much ate like I was still on P3. Well now that Im in school I wont be sitting around the house all the time and wanting to eat. I will let you know how Im doing. I am going to try and get on everyday or so. Ive been taking my laptop to school so that maybe I would have a chance to check in. Its practically impossible to do that when I get home. Hope everyone is doing good!

Oh I wanted to say Welcome back Mo girl!!!!! I love reading ur posts and ur progress!!!! I looked at ur pics last night for the first time and WOW...its amazing how much u have changed and how much ur hubby has changed!!! I was speechless!!!! And I do have to say one thing!!! lol......U HAVE SOME PRETTTY SEXY LEGS HAHAHAHA!!!!! omg u lucky girl.....and soooo tan!!!! ur hubby is going to just flip out totally if u keep getting smaller and smaller lol.....hes looking really great also I was amazed at his weight loss and how much of a difference now!!!!

Halloween 59 days hmhuntr September 6th, 2009, 12:11 AM ewwww! I am now atthe end of my gorge days and I have to say i feel like crap! I looked like I was drunk yesterday. I guess it was a carb and sugar overload but I was out of it. Hopefully this cures my craving for this stuff because right now I don&apos;t want to even think about it, let alone eat it.....uugghh:(

Shell- Holy crap! The 50 lb mark!!! That&apos;s huge!!!! Congrats!!!!
Class- That&apos;s an impressive drop girl! I bet by the morning you will be out from under your gorge weight without any problem. I&apos;m afraid to see what my damage is in the morning.
NC- just jump back on the wagon come Monday. We&apos;re all here for you if you need it! I&apos;ll be thinking about you.
Taz- WTG girl!!! Those side effects seem totally worth it now don&apos;t they?:D

Guess I had better eat one last thing. Hope everyone is enjoying their holiday weekend. anadingding September 6th, 2009, 01:42 AM Okay just got back from the barbecue. UUGh I ate too much!:( but the good news is that I got in my 40 min on the treadmill. And guess what? This is the first weekend in a long time that I didnt drink! Im so proud of that. My friends were calling me to go out on Friday, but I stuck to it and didnt go. :) Just thought I share. LOL

Now granted I didn&apos;t drink any water what so ever those two days and TOM is still a factor but wow! He stood on the scale in disbelief! Here&apos;s hoping it falls off quickly. Is it wrong to do a steak day right off the bat???:o

Taz- woo hoo...welcome to onderland, it&apos;s been a long time coming!
Ana- The fact that you didn&apos;t go out drinking is a huge deal! You should be proud of yourself! You identified a factor that was keeping you from your weight loss goal and took control of it! WOO HOO!!! tazgirl31 September 6th, 2009, 03:00 PM Well we def. did the gorge thing! He is up 9lb and I am up 6lb from our gorge days!

Taz hmhuntr September 7th, 2009, 08:08 AM After day 1 of VLCD I am down 2.6lb. Sadly that hasn&apos;t put much of a dent in my gorge gain but I&apos;m keeping my head up and moving forward. I had no hunger what so ever yesterday so I know I gorged well! Like it says in the book, we must go up in order to go down. Plus TOM is still a factor so I&apos;m not complaining! Good luck ladies and have a great day...I&apos;m off to work. tazgirl31 September 7th, 2009, 11:08 AM Wooohooo down another 1.1 today so now weigh 198.6!!! I have lost a total of 12.1pounds in 7 days Im really happy with this loss!!! Especially since TOM is still not hear....Anyways Im doing great so far...Still going thro my hungry moods but Im handling them pretty well....Although I will tell on myself Hubby put a big plate of grilled chicken in front of my face last night after a 4 hour dentist cleaning And I was starving to death so Ummm I caved and had a little chicken tender xtra lol so I was alll mad at him and worried my weight would be over 200 this morning and to my surprise I was down another 1.1 so I was sooo happy....I did however drink an xtra liter of water and a cup of tea before bed lol and was up all night peeing like always!!!! I have been peeing sooooo much since beginning this diet....I cant belive it..Im up all night long.....But I love it cause it makes me feel like the plan is still working well!!!!!! I had a great treat this morning for breakfast!!! Hubby baked me an apple with cinnamon and stevia on it and OMG it was the best treat ever!!!! It felt like I was cheating it was so good...I will never have a raw apple again after having this lol....


Hmhuntr

The next round I do I am going to GORGE myself so much its gonna make me puke lol cause I now see how well this plan works so wont be worried about the weight gain so much!!!!! Taz huerita September 7th, 2009, 01:15 PM Hi all,

Its really good to hear everyone is doing well and losing. I&apos;m on injection day 21. I have been so good, no cheating, drinking my water but not exercising. I work all day and night. I am soo bummed. I have been exactly the same since last Sunday, the 30th of August! The stinking scale won&apos;t budge. My daughter and I keep journals so I can see when I hit that number. After 4 days at the same weight I did an apple day. I dropped a couple ounces. But here it is 4 days later and its the same stinking weight!! GRRR!

What is going on? I so don&apos;t want to do another apple day. Should I? The only things I&apos;m not doing correctly is that I don&apos;t drink coffee or tea in the morning, just water, don&apos;t eat the breadsticks, and don&apos;t walk for an hour a day. Okay, I really don&apos;t get enough sleep either, but I work on deadlines and have been overloaded. Major deadline today as well.

I&apos;m not on TOM, that came on my 1st day of injections. I don&apos;t know why my body is being so stubborn. I am so frustrated!

huerita anadingding September 7th, 2009, 01:55 PM Hi girls, so far so good. I exercised my 40 min on treadmill yesterday. :o Im going to clean today then get my 40 min in. Honestly if I haven&apos;t lost any weight I wouldnt be surprised because 40 min isnt much to lose weight, but overall I feel better like I have more energy and my depression has remained hidden these last days lol. So my goal for this week starting manana when my son goes back to school is to do my taebo video as well as my 40 min on treadmill and maybe ill get 20 min on my elliptical everyday. I know that before when I lost over 40lbs it was because I was exercising for about 3 hours a day so exercise here I come. LOL:D I&apos;ve been thinking I have been dieting since April 1st and I have yet to hot my first 20 lb mark. Its time! Hope it comes soon.

hmhuntr---- thank you so much for your encouragement! Yeah drinking has definately been the biggest factor in my weight loss journey. I hope I can continue to leave it behind on the weekends. Congrats on your 2.6 lbs loss. Thats a lot you should be proud of that and not to worry cause you will lose all your gorge weight faster than you think.

Taz- awesome job its impressive how much you lost in just a few days. Keep up the good work.

NcGree-- Where are you? I know you are still doing great! :)

Class--- always on the road. LOL How are you doing?

Shell- Congrats on your 50lb mark, keep up the good work.

huerita-- you should try a steak day it seems to work for everyone when they hit a stall.

huerita

Hey Huerita! Im happy to see u back!!!!! Im sorry ur having a rough time with being stuck...I would try a steak day I hear that gets ur weight moving again!!! I was also reading and not sure if its true but If I understood it correct on another site that if u dont eat all the food ur supposed to it could slow or stall ur weight loss....So maybe u could try having all ur food even the melba toast....Im not expert its just what I have read on other hcg support sites!! I no the apple day would sux just eating apples all day...ughh I would for sure starve! I dont walk at all since I been on this plan, and I dont drink the tea either I just drink 3 liters of water a day cause I have found that the more water I drink the better my loss is the next day....Try not let this get u down I no its hard when ur stuck and just cant seem to move even tho ur not cheating....I would feel the same way and dread when that day comes for me....U will get thro this.....Just hang in there!!!!!!!! Taz huerita September 7th, 2009, 04:37 PM huerita-- you should try a steak day it seems to work for everyone when they hit a stall.

[/B]

But, I was under the impression that the only time you do a steak day is when you are in P3 and not taking injections. If that&apos;s so, I&apos;ll do it today.

Taz, yeah, I eat my meals but not the bread. Most feedback I&apos;ve had on that is it slows the loss down a bit. It&apos;s just my body because my daughter is still losing pretty much every day, sometimes only ounces, but it&apos;s progress. My stinking scale is not moving!

I knoooow I need to exercise. My daughter does every day, and she gets better sleep than me too!

huerita

Huerita, the sleep is critical. If I don&apos;t get enough it seriously slows the loss down.

Try a steak day. I know some say that is for the P3, but it works during the injection phase. I usually drop 2+ lbs when I do one.

Good luck! huerita September 7th, 2009, 06:33 PM Thanks Shell, Ana, and Taz,

I think I&apos;ll do a steak day tomorrow. I&apos;ll get to sleep early tonight cuz I&apos;m almost done with all my assignments. 1 left to submit to lender then 1 offer to submit to agent and I&apos;m done! (yeahhhh!) Bubble bath time tonight too.

I had a feeling the lack of sleep could be a factor. My daughter walks and uses videos and uses the elliptical. I do the same too when I have time, it&apos;s just that this week, I haven&apos;t had time for squat!

We start P3 the end of this week. My daughter is excited but bummed she can&apos;t have any breads or pasta. We&apos;ll splurge on that on gorge days again I guess.

Oh my goodness..ur ready for p3 huh? wow I still have like 30 days left on my p2 cause Im doing the 40 day round...Im sooo scared for p3..so Im anxious to see how u all do on it...maybe u can give me some good food ideas for when Im on it..cause it seems like theres starch and sugar in everything...so idk...it also worries me about staying in a 2 pound range...it seems impossible but I guess others have done it successfully...I no one thing Im on a mustard crave and I never liked mustard before..and now Im having it on EVERYTHING....I mean this literally...on burger, chicken and ummmm even celery lol...my hubby said r u sure ur not pregnant...Im like no I guess Im just really super hungry and thats why Im eating weird lol...The mustard down the celery makes me think its cheese cause I HATE plain celery but its pretty darn tasty with mustard lol....Taz hmhuntr September 7th, 2009, 09:50 PM huerita- I wonder if the reason your body is hanging on to that weight is because it is your body&apos;s old&quot;set weight&quot;? I remember reading that it can take several days for your body to get over that hump, re-set itself and start losing again. I have done the steak day during P2 and did well. I&apos;ve not tried the apple day yet. It probably wouldn&apos;t hurt to do a steak day though. I&apos;d just double check the possibility of hidden sodium to be sure you&apos;re not getting more than you realize. Hang in there girl!
ana- I know you are a busy busy girl...how are you finding the time/opportunity to workout? That seems to be my biggest struggle right now. I need all the advice I can get!
taz- celery with mustard? That&apos;s a new one on me! I&apos;m gonna have to try it because I don&apos;t like raw celery, maybe that will help.

I started my PRN job but on a full-time basis as of today (they fired someone and asked if I&apos;d like to step in) and I really don&apos;t like it! I didn&apos;t care for it much as a PRN but I wasn&apos;t there all that much. After today I can honestly say it&apos;s really not my cup of tea but it will help with the bills. I&apos;m just glad I still have my&quot;regular&quot;that I love even though I only do it 15 hours a week. I&apos;m just meant to work with kiddos I guess:D tazgirl31 September 7th, 2009, 11:06 PM huerita- I wonder if the reason your body is hanging on to that weight is because it is your body&apos;s old&quot;set weight&quot;?

OMG....LOL I was umbarassed to even write what I am eating lol but TRUST ME ITS GOOD LOL....or Im just real hungry hahaha.....I hate plain celery so I was lookin at that list of foods we can have and I thought hmmm thats it mustard....so yea now that I tried it once its like Im just freaking craving it everyday.....I had it for lunch and dinner tonight.....was soooo goood.....U let me no if u try it and what u think lol.....Im sure I will still eat it when Im off this plan cause its so good to me!!!! Huby thinks Im sooo weird lol.....Oh and Another thing...I have been eating spinach like everyday with vinager on it...I eat it everyday with lunch or dinner one or the other...and I have been having a BM every single day since I been on this plan...I no alot of u had trouble with that area so thats why Im bringing it up....Maybe this is why Im doing so well with my weight loss also...still no TOM tho but the pain is there and killin me...Im still on my injections and not planning on stopping them even if it comes.....haha....sorry ur job isnt all that great for u....maybe it will get better the longer ur there.....just look at it as xtra money for clothes shopping when ur to goal!!!!!!! Taz huerita September 7th, 2009, 11:59 PM Taz, I didn&apos;t have any celery, it got all used up in potato salad today (and it looked real good, dogone it!) but I just chopped up cabbage and mixed it in like dressing. It&apos;s not bad!

hmhntr, I think you&apos;re right about it being an old set weight of mine. I really need to break past it or it&apos;s just going to be confirmed again when I go into P3! Steak day tomorrow here I come and keeping my fingers crossed!

Yeah, we are only doing 23 day rounds cuz too many times it gets very boring on a diet. This one hasn&apos;t been that way, for the most part, but it is restrictive. It&apos;s just easier for us to break it up a bit and also then you don&apos;t risk immunity as much as on the 40 day round. So, shots are supposed to end tomorrow, but we have some left and I&apos;m going to stay on the HCG until it&apos;s gone and then do my last 3 days. She&apos;s going away from Thur-Sun so today was her last injection. That way she will have a little more flexibility with her friend for the weekend.

After that, we will be off for a full 3 weeks and then start back again. We are going to make a bunch of the recipes and freeze them so we have a wider variety and a bunch of new flavors. I&apos;m also gonna get some miracle noodles for the next round as well as some Stevia. I&apos;ve had to put it off for this round, but I&apos;m getting paid soon! tazgirl31 September 8th, 2009, 12:09 AM Taz, I didn&apos;t have any celery, it got all used up in potato salad today (and it looked real good, dogone it!) but I just chopped up cabbage and mixed it in like dressing.

Mmmmm potato salad sounds sooo yum!!!! what kind of dressings did u mix the cabbage with? is it something we can have in p2? Just curious...I dont really like raw veggies without something on it lol.....Taz Oshun September 8th, 2009, 03:30 AM Ana - Thank you! I just chopped off 6 inches! It&apos;s so much nicer than having long hair...especially having to walk in this heat to and from classes! Good job on getting a great start on your masters. I&apos;m still an undergrad. :)

Huerita - I don&apos;t think I was being rude or snobby. I was just saying what was on mine and everyone else&apos;s mind. :rolleyes:

Oshun - WOW you are on a roll missy! Congratulations!

MO - You have been missed! You need to start getting back on here everyday lady! We all miss you. Congrats to another round!



Thank you ASU! Good to hear from you! Oshun September 8th, 2009, 03:33 AM Hello everyone,
Glad to see some of you back, we have missed you. I am not doing so well, my body evidently liked P2 a lot better than P3. I am retaining so much fluid it is crazy. I have done 2 apple days and nothing is helping, I should also mention that it is TOM so that is contributing but I am getting very frustrated as I have gained 7 pounds!! What to do?:(:(



Hello Shelia,

I may be late, but just try to stay calm. Try reducing your sodium -flush with water...I know TOM is hard. You will stabilize.

Thinking of you... Oshun September 8th, 2009, 03:42 AM Hi ladies! So I&apos;m down 1.6 lbs from yesterday - woohoo!! I know that&apos;s not gonna happen that often, but it felt nice! This weekend is going to be soooo bad for me, I don&apos;t even want to discuss it! We are just going to say that I&apos;m taking the weekend off of the diet..or call it a loading weekend...whatever haha. Not really thrilled about what the outcome will be weight-wise, but I&apos;m really looking forward to it, and I need to go out and enjoy myself because of a lot of emotional stuff goin on with me right now.

Ana - Glad to see you back and that you are dedicated! Keep it up girl!

Oshun - Isn&apos;t it great when people start noticing?? It makes you want to try even harder!

MO - Welcome back!! You have been missed! I know that you can totally do this...you&apos;ve proven that already. Just stay tough, focused, and let us know when you need encouragement!

ASU - You do look great! I&apos;m glad to hear that the low cal diet is working well for you, that&apos;s awesome!

Class - Glad you are back...stick around this time! ;) While I know that you are not thrilled with the 8 lbs, I&apos;m sure it will come off quickly. Also, I do phen with the hcg and it really helps me. I notice big time if I forget to take the phen. Oh, and your comments on the&quot;taz situation&quot;totally sums up my thoughts on it.

corka - I think it has been said now by several people that ASU was not being rude/mean...just stating what a lot of us were thinking. This is a great place for encouragement, questions, and keeping up with how we are all doing...but we really did not need an all-day-long play-by-play of each of someone&apos;s days...summaries are one thing, questions are fine, etc....but really. Having almost a whole page of one person&apos;s posts was really driving me nuts.

Sheila - I gained a decent amount when I was on P3, but TOM is probably what is doing it to you. Just keep watching what you eat and I&apos;m sure that it will probably come off just like mine did. Hang in there!

hmhuntr - Enjoy your gorging...hopefully TOM won&apos;t mess with you too much. I&apos;m sure you are going to do great though since you&apos;ve already done so well!



I know! I actually got my lazy self up and dug up a lot of my old 14s and have been wearing them. I have like a ton more - some I only wore once or twice.

I am just praying that I can maintain while on P4 and never gain this much weight again. There is a huge difference in the way I move or even in just being aware of my body, the way my body feels- even when I am eating food. It is like I am more aware of feelings and sensations in my body whereas before I was kinda of numb.

I do think that I want to lose some more though. Maybe go from 190&apos;s to maybe 160&apos;s. I am pretty tall so I think 160 would be good. I will have to think on it some more bc I probably weighed 160 when I was in the 6th grade! LOL

I am just so happy to be out of the 200s! Oshun September 8th, 2009, 03:45 AM Welcome back Mo!

Congratulations Taz! You are doing well!

Hmhntr - hang in there! hmhuntr September 8th, 2009, 07:16 AM Just a quick update, hubby is now down to his original weight from round 1 and I am down another 2 lb today. I think TOM is finally wrapping up (fingers crossed) I&apos;m getting closer to my round one weight. I&apos;m excited to start losing the real weight again and actually see 14? it&apos;s been well over 15 years! A long time comin&apos;:D TheToyMaker September 8th, 2009, 09:19 AM Morning all you losers! I hope everyone had a wonderful Labor Day. I&apos;m still hanging in here with P3. It&apos;s real up and down and the&quot;up&quot;part just drives me crazy. I know that&apos;s to be expected but it still makes me crazy. My next gorge days aren&apos;t until Friday, September 18th and I cannot wait. I didn&apos;t lose much on my last P2 and I am so ready to be below 200. Hopefully within the first 7-8 days on the next P2 I will be below that.

ASU -- I love the new&quot;do&quot;. It&apos;s so very flattering. I think I&apos;m going to have mine cut the next time I have my color done. I just need something with some shape to it. Right now mine is just long and straight with bangs.

MO -- It&apos;s good to see you again. I hope you enjoy school. I&apos;m loving my classes but they take so much time. Good luck on your P2 this time.

Shell -- Congratulations on the 50 pounds! That&apos;s wonderful!

NC -- Twenty pounds is great!

Taz -- I really like that red and black dress.

Ana -- Girl, you&apos;re tearing it up on the exercise. I can&apos;t seem to get to the gym because I&apos;m always racing off to class. I have been walking on my road about 3 days a week but that&apos;s not enough exercise for me. I&apos;ve got to step it up.

Everybody have a great day. Oshun September 8th, 2009, 01:34 PM Raw This is pregnant women&apos;s urine still in liquid form

So I&apos;m back after the Labor Day weekend....and we will not even DISCUSS what I ate! I am up about 4 lbs in 3 days...although I wasn&apos;t *that* bad...still bad, but geez. Although it probably didn&apos;t help that I had a horrifyingly stressful and emotionally draining weekend...and barely slept the whole weekend....so I&apos;m really hoping that now that I&apos;m back on the wagon and trying to get more sleep it will fall off. *Crossing my fingers*

Thanks everyone for the compliments (I&apos;m too lazy right now to go back a page...at least I admit that I&apos;m too lazy to do that lol)!

Sounds like everyone is doing well, and I just want to comment to Ana and say hang in there on the drinking...stay away is going to keep helping your weight loss so much!

Hope everyone is doing well and back on the wagon! ClassNsass September 8th, 2009, 04:39 PM I&apos;m back from Labor Day weekend as well! I was good up until Sunday when I ate an apple streudal, gold fish, cookies, crackers n cheese, pop corn, soda...etc. Monday I had eggs n toast, cookies, pizza, and frozen yogurt. SO needless to say I only lost 2 pounds. That means I still have 2 pounds to lose to be at my lowest weight back in my first P2. UGH, I was hoping to be there or less YESTERDAY! I&apos;m soooo bad. Okay, back on track! I&apos;m bent on getting in the 160&apos;s SOON!

ANA~I&apos;m SO proud of you for not going out drinking! Your doing so good and I&apos;m so happy for you. Keep up the good work girlie :) . I think you asked what brand of hcg I take....It&apos;s hucog I believe from all day chemist.

Shell~Congratulations on the 50 pound mark....WOOHOO! YOU GO GIRL!

HM~It sounds like you and your hubby gained right around what I did. Man, we must really get our gorge on! LOL. Your hubby got that off QUICK! I&apos;m 6 days in and have only lost 5 or so pounds! I was bad though, it&apos;s my fault. My first round I lost almost 15 pounds in the first 7 days...wowza! I should have stuck to my diet!! You both sound like your off to a great start though....keep it up!

Toy~I&apos;m sorry you aren&apos;t enjoying P3. I LOVED P3....I could eat almost anything. I didn&apos;t watch the scale though....weighed once a week and I always fine. I&apos;d eat terrible one day then the next I&apos;d be good and it someone balanced out. Not too much longer and you can start back on P2. You&apos;ll get into onderland before you know it girl!

Hope everyone has a good day :) tazgirl31 September 8th, 2009, 07:04 PM Welcome back Mo!

Congratulations Taz! You are doing well!

Hmhntr - hang in there!

Good luck on getting thro p3 Im sooo worried about that part....cause the up and down will frustrate me so much....I hope ur under 200 sooooon!!!!! Its an amazing feeling u will love it!!!! The scary part is trying to stay under it and not have ur weight go up...my biggest fear!!!!! Taz huerita September 9th, 2009, 01:42 AM Hi everyone,
Sorry I don&apos;t post often but I get on here a little bit when I can. I did not do a steak day today as planned because when I got up and stood on the scale, miraculously I dropped 3 full lbs! But here&apos;s the kicker, I started my TOM last night too! Go figure. I just finished it 2 weeks ago. But I&apos;m old (hehe) and don&apos;t always know when it&apos;s going to surprise me anymore. So, maybe that had something to do with it also, but I&apos;m hoping that when it finishes, which should be about the same time I finish P2, that I will drop some more, since usually I am up just before and during, and down (on the scale, I mean) at the end of it. Plus, if I keep losing like I was in the beginning, I just may hit that short term goal. I&apos;m only 6 lbs from it now and my&quot;dream&quot;short term goal is 6 more over that. That way, I will finally be out of the&quot;terrible two&apos;s&quot;!

h huerita September 9th, 2009, 01:44 AM Mmmmm potato salad sounds sooo yum!!!! what kind of dressings did u mix the cabbage with? is it something we can have in p2? Just curious...I dont really like raw veggies without something on it lol.....Taz

Hi Taz,
Not dressing, no, I took your suggestion for celery and used mustard! It really wasn&apos;t bad! I don&apos;t think I could eat it like that every day, but yeah, not too bad to have every now and then. Who&apos;d of thunk it!

Im happy u lost 3 pounds girl......That stupid tom is always messin with us...TRUST ME...its messing with me hard and IDK what to even do.....Im miserable as ever and feeling soooo fat as ever and my lower abdominal hurts and my back hurts ughhh Im now offically late on my period.....Oh and not to mention my breasts hurt soooo bad I cant stand it lol......Its weird cause I do have endometerosis really bad and my periods have been messed up in the past but the last year they been pretty stable...well last month all this started..the darkish brown looking blood...and its still doing this now just when I pee...thats when it comes out...so Im getting worried.....I have had like 4 D&amp;C because of problems like this they say the uterous lining needs to be cleaned out....so Im worried Im needing another one now since its been so long......ughhh Im so dissappointed cause I no I have gained weight I just no it and feel it....I havent got my scale battery yet and now Im thinking I dont even want it or want to see my weight right now....I no I am bloated out like crazy.....so I guess its common to gain weight before the period huh? and u always drop it tho afterwards? I hope I do.......this sux.....was doing so well and now tom has to mess it all up!!!!!!! Taz hmhuntr September 9th, 2009, 11:47 AM Hey ladies, I just snuck onto the computer at school for a moment...I&apos;m supposed to be studying for this stinkin test at 1. Anyway. Hubby is now under his ending weight from last time by .8 I think he said in his message. I lost another 2lb this morning and am now almost even with where I was before as well. YEAH! It&apos;s a shame it won&apos;t stay at 2 lb a day LOL! At least I know I am over my body&apos;s set weight point so maybe I won&apos;t get hung up this time like I did last time. (hopefully)

Huerita- Sorry about TOM but WTG on those 3lb! I&apos;m really going to have to try the whole mustard thing now since you liked it too. Just a little something to break it up you know?

Class- man all that food you listed sounded good. I&apos;m not hungry but I&apos;m sure I could eat!:D

NC- I know you said it would be a tough weekend for you. I&apos;m glad to see you made it through and are back with us now. That bit you gained was probably just from the sodium. Don&apos;t sweat it!;)

Toy- maybe with school underway you&apos;ll be able to have more of a routine and the next round will go smoother. I was shocked just how fast the scale could turn on you in P3 and mine never went back down fast enough!

Oshun- are you on P3 right now? Sorry, I&apos;m trying to keep everyone straight. If so...how are you holding up? Kelly62 September 9th, 2009, 04:55 PM I wish I understood how this stuff works and the diet you guys are talking about. tazgirl31 September 9th, 2009, 05:52 PM I wish I understood how this stuff works and the diet you guys are talking about.

My suggestion would be to go back and start reading thro the pages and u will learn everything u need to no!!!! Trust me thats what I did when I started and it has everything!!!! Even the list of supplies needed to start it!!!! Then if theres still things u dont understand ask away and we will all try to help u!!!!! It was just alot easier reading everything and everyone elses experiences then trying to ask a million different questions!!!!!! haha.....The diet plan is also on these pages...basically its a 500 calorie diet a day....and u give urself a injection of HCG! It really works but is a very strict plan!!!!!!!!! But so worth it in the end!!!!!!!!!! Taz corkaiasja09 September 9th, 2009, 08:53 PM i finally got my stuff..YAY!!! i will start my gorge day on Saturday!!! woohoo!!!!:D ASU89 September 9th, 2009, 09:39 PM Ana - good luck on that little plan of yours. Sounds like it&apos;s going to work for you. Glad to hear you&apos;re doing well. You&apos;ll lose those 20 lbs in no time if you stick to it!

Toy - Thank you for the hair compliment. I know what you mean about P3...when you see the scale go up you get frustrated..don&apos;t worry girl you&apos;re doing amazing! Your gorge days are coming up soo soon.....hang in there until then!

NC - I hope you got some well needed sleep.. I&apos;m sure those 4 lbs are gone by now. You have done sooo outstandingly well throughout this whole thing.

Class - You look soo pretty in your new default picture. You skinny b!tch! :) I know what you mean about going a little over board this weekend..haha...Not even going to weigh myself for a few days because of it! I finally got back on track yesterday and will weigh myself once I think I&apos;ve lost the few lbs I most likely gained...UNLIKE YOU..STILL LOSING WEIGHT AND PIGGING OUT. I&apos;m not even going to go there with you on how I am jealous about that, missy. :) I know you&apos;ll get into the 160&apos;s SOON!


I honestly don&apos;t like getting on here anymore to reply or even post updates on myself...the only reason I do is for the few friends I want to keep in touch with. This thread just seems so SLOPPY and all over the place. Maybe I&apos;m just too picky... IDK.. I just know that I used to like coming on everyday.... We used to write a lot before, but MAN..I just can&apos;t do it. :rolleyes: SouthernCharm01 September 9th, 2009, 09:59 PM Helllllooooo Everyone.... Both New and Old
I have tried to resist responding but after ASU&apos;s post I couldn&apos;t help it....
ASU I totally agree with what u said and I miss those days(not to put anyone down or anything) but the way the post used to flow was like AMAZING and SO INFORMATIVE and GOOD. I am still doing HCG but I have become sort of a silent board member, So ASU PLEASE CONTINUE to log on girl.... U and MO(Heeeyyyy MO) were my inspirations. I miss all the old members too. It was like we were one big happy family :).
So ASU if you leave this board girl that&apos;s not going to be good. So please hang around o.k????

To eveyone else congrats on your progress and hang in there!!!
Be Blessed
SC jbo September 9th, 2009, 10:03 PM Just a quick hello to everyone, sorry I am mia, started a challenge and been really busy with getting back to work. I have managed to get into the 180&apos;s!! So far 11 more pounds gone so hopefully returning to work and stopping the breastfeeding has helped.

Asu-I LOVE YOUR NEW PIC your way cute. you have to pm me on one of your last post. Why ya so upset?? I think i have an idea but not 100% sure. Have fun back at school and drink a bit for me, lol, gosh i miss those times.

Class-Your new pic is very becoming as well.

I haven&apos;t seen punkmom, or i missed it, not sure which.
Mochic-Hey gurlie looking like your still sticking to the grind.

hmthunt-I love the pic of you and your hubby, your soooo tiny OMG. Congrads.

Everyone else hello. jbo September 9th, 2009, 10:10 PM asu-one more thing, it comes in waves. Look how long I have been a member!!! ON and off again on these forums. Some people you flow with and others not so much, lol. I take breaks but needless to say I end up back here for motivation and support and I really have met some wonderful friends on this site. I share my facebook with a few from a challenge back in 06. I even have a really close friendship with one that I call on the phone to chat with!!!! You may need a break but you may find you can&apos;t live without this place. I always found if you send the people you want to keep in contact with your email then you can keep in touch, just a little tid bit. Now get off here and go study or drink or dance or just have a good time in school and don&apos;t let this place stress out the fun loving girl you look like you are. It was nice meeting you on here and thanks for all the replys and advice you gave me.

Yes I am back on P3. I think I will do it until November tom make sure I don&apos;t develop immunity. It is ok. Just trying to hold back on the sugar and alcohol bc I am craving chocolate and drinks. :) huerita September 10th, 2009, 11:51 AM [/B]

Hi Oshun,

I&apos;m about to start P3. Any tips? What must I absolutely avoid and what is okay? Can I start using moisturizer again? I&apos;ve gone without makeup and moisturizer for almost a month, really would like to be able to use it again.

From what I understand no sugars or starches/breads, pasta (dangit) is that correct?

I&apos;m down 20 lbs and I so don&apos;t want to blow it when I&apos;m off the HCG.

Thanks
h HollyMarie September 10th, 2009, 01:55 PM I am curious and this may sound really dumb but what are gorge days, streak days, apple days, and VLCD? I am curious to know the info on anything that will help the pounds melt off! Someone please clue me in! HollyMarie September 10th, 2009, 01:56 PM What is P2 and P3? HollyMarie September 10th, 2009, 04:01 PM TAZ: I have been looking through the threads for 3 or 4 days now and can&apos;t seem to locate the info I am searching for. When you go on the VLCD, how many days do you stay on it? How long have you been doing this? and does it really work? How much success have you had with it?

Hello H!

Congrats on your total loss!

You can use all your normal cosmetics. You are right with no starches, no breads, no pasta, take it easy on the sugar. I think you can have like 20 carbs/sugar a day [total not each] and all the fat you want.

If you gain you can quickly lose by doing a steak day or eating boiled eggs. Hope that helps and good luck!

Hello Holly,

You can read through the thread or you can get the book by Linda Prinster on Amazon. It explains a lot including how it functions in the body and she has a massive recipe book. Kevin Trudeau also has a book that goes into the biology of this and I think some copies of Dr Simeons [the protocol founder/inventor] original text can be found for free online. anadingding September 11th, 2009, 12:12 AM Hi girls. Oh my! I&apos;ve been doing so good and I messed up bad on Monday I ate and ate no exercise and I felt yuckie and a failure yet again, so I continued the over-eating through today! I haven&apos;t weighed in cause I know that I will not be able to deal with it. Hopefully i can start fresh manana. But im so proud that I have been sober LOL Honestly today I felt like drinking one, but instead I went for iced tea soda. LOL Cause I learned that I think that by drinking just one I will feel better, but in the end all it has done is caused more interruptions of my weight loss goals. I know that the HCG failed for me because I wasn&apos;t ready mentally. I feel like im a step closer, but dont want to do it yet because I need to overcome my urges to overeat and prove to mself that I can commit. Only then I know I will be ready and I know it will work.

Halloween 59 days NCGreenEyes September 11th, 2009, 12:36 AM Hi Ladies! So I was down 1.6 lbs yesterday and 2 lbs today....so I&apos;m only about 0.8lbs from where I was before Labor Day....stupid temptation of holidays!

hmhuntr - Seems like you are doing well! Keep up the good work! Enjoy those 2 lb days while they last :)

ASU - Thanks for the encouragement - I&apos;m trying to get sleep, I just have a lot going on stress-wise in my personal life..so it&apos;s a little hard but I keep telling myself that I will not lose if I do not sleep! You look great in your new pic btw! And I have to say that I completely agree with what you said about coming on here and posting...I am only doing it for a few people. There are just too many posts from the same people over and over, and writing so much that is unnecessary...I mean most of the time when we wrote a lot before it was either a question, or partially about ourselves then addressing others. It just doesn&apos;t seem to&quot;flow&quot;like it used to, does it? I hope that you keep coming back though because you&apos;ve been great inspiration and encouragement to me!!

Southern - I totally agree. Sorry to hear you have become a silent&quot;old&quot;board member...it seems like that is happening to more and more of us (MO?)...I hope we can all rally together and try to get our board back in order. I know, I sound really witchy...I don&apos;t mean it to be mean to anyone but it&apos;s just how I feel and I think a lot of others feel.

Ana - Don&apos;t beat yourself up for endulging...I did all Labor Day weekend and while I&apos;m not thrilled about it making me gain weight, I&apos;m just trying to get back on the horse. You are doing so well with resisting the urge to drink - I&apos;m so proud of you! Keep it up and stay tough!!

Everyone else - hope you are doing well and dropping lbs like crazy! hmhuntr September 11th, 2009, 11:23 PM Oh NC- I spoke too soon LOL! Yesterday was a 1.4lb and then today .6 so I think I am starting to level out so to speak. But hey, as long as it keeps moving down I&apos;m happy. Hubby has taken off like a shot this time, hope it lasts. I know you are getting back down from a temptation but those are two great loss numbers back to back:)

My coworkers took me out for lunch today to a Chinese buffet (very cruel) but I think I did the best I could. Chilled shrimp, orange wedges, and 4 small pickle spears. I was bummed at first but when I looked at their plates all I saw were fat, calories, and a 6 lb jump so I was ok after that.

Ana- I think it&apos;s super smart to wait until you&apos;re 100% commited. How&apos;s school going? I&apos;m still waiting to hear those exercise tips for crazy busy ladies (no joke:D)

jbo- It looks like you have really motivated alot of people with your thread and your weight is just sliding off. Two excellent outcomes!:D NCGreenEyes September 12th, 2009, 12:25 AM So I am down 1.8 lbs today - officially below what I was before Labor Day - yay!!! I would love to keep losing at this rate but I know that is most certainly not going to happen. I&apos;m just so glad I got down pretty quickly from my Labor Day cheat.

hmhuntr - It does sound like your losses are leveling, but I&apos;m with you - a loss is still a loss! That&apos;s great about your hubby...it&apos;s so unfair though that guys lose so much better than us! I understand how you felt at lunch - been there, done that, but it sounds like you did pretty well, especially considering the damage you could have done.

Hope everyone else is doing well and losing, losing, losing! corkaiasja09 September 12th, 2009, 12:06 PM ok so im all ready to start mixing the hcg for my first day of gorging and i dont have a sterile mixing vial!! is there anything else i can use for mixing or where i can buy one??? i been waiting for so long to start and i keep getting these roadblocks.... anadingding September 12th, 2009, 01:51 PM Hi girls, well I decided to weigh in and see the damage. Not too bad 185.6 but really disappointing because I was doing so good for four days. I haven&apos;t exercised again going to see if I can today.

NC-- Oh my gosh! You look so good girl! Congrats!:D I have to catch up to you! LOL;)


hmhuntr-- thanks girl. School is going okay so far, but a bit disappointing because I had no idea that this class I am taking right now will not count towards my masters. It is a pass or fail. If you pass you will continue on to the masters I guess is just a class to determine if you are ready for a masters degree. The good thing is that it will be over around Oct 11 or 12th I believe. So as far as when I find the time to exercise is that I have a lot of time right now and I should not make no excuses. I am currently not working and during the day my son goes to preschool. I know how you feel cause I used to work full time sometimes more and full time student and a mom so yeah that was hard! So right now really I just have school and that&apos;s in the evenings.

I wish I could get up really early like at 5am to start exercising but I find it difficult. LOL:rolleyes:

corkaiasja09--- I wish I could help, but I have no idea if you can use something different.

Halloween 59 days hmhuntr September 13th, 2009, 09:10 PM Good evening Ladies. Hope everyone is surviving their weekend relatively well. I flubbed a little yesterday and ate a piece of pizza for breakfast. I don&apos;t know WHAT I was thinking. I altered the rest of the day and shoved water like you wouldn&apos;t believe and managed to still lose 1 lb this morning!!! Hope it doesn&apos;t catch up with me in the morning when I step on the scale. Hubby broke into the 280&apos;s and is doing backflips! I&apos;m so close to the 140&apos;s I can taste it. Hopefully it will let me in soon.

Ana- sorry about your P/F class. That does stink. Don&apos;t you love how it doesn&apos;t count but you still have to PAY for it! Thanks for giving me your low down on exercise. I hope you are at taking a little bit to enjoy the piece and quiet when he leaves. That&apos;s priceless right there!:D

Cork- I had the same trouble so i measured out what Bac water I needed in a syringe and then drew out the rest so the bottle was empty. Then I readded the hcg solution mix and whatever else bac water I needed back into the bac water bottle and combined. Then drew it into the syringes from there. It worked...I didn&apos;t want to wait either:rolleyes: NCGreenEyes September 13th, 2009, 10:23 PM Hey ladies! So I was up almost 2 lbs today....but it was my own fault. I broke down and ate pizza yesterday :( That, and I know I didn&apos;t get nearly enough sleep. I am hoping to have a good drop tomorrow morning if I get enough sleep....but I guess I&apos;ll have to wait and see!

Ana - Thanks!! Don&apos;t beat yourself up too much, especially since you are losing&quot;the hard way&quot;right now! Just jump back on the horse :) Exercising definitely makes a difference! And I feel your pain on the school stuff, though thankfully I have been done with school for about 2 years now.

hmhuntr - Yesterday must have been a pizza day! You are so lucky though that you still lost - I&apos;m jealous!! You and your hubby both have been doing so well. I cannot wait until I am your weight, so even though you want to get smaller, enjoy it for me til I can get there ;)

Hope everyone else who is MIA is doing well!! Anyone heard from MO or any of the other&quot;old posters&quot;lately?? TheToyMaker September 14th, 2009, 08:39 AM Morning everyone! I cannot believe it&apos;s already Monday. It rained here all weekend and it&apos;s supposed to rain more today. Everything is soggy and gross. I have been a total disaster on P3 this time and am almost back to the weight I started P2 on last time. Oh, I could just kick myself! My first day of gorging for the next P2 is this coming Friday and I cannot wait. Surely I won&apos;t gain that much more weight between now and Friday -- or at least I hope not. I think I will only do a 23 day round and give it 200% this time. Of course, if all is going well, I can always mix the next vial for the 40 day round. I&apos;ll just have to wait and see.

I hope everyone else is doing well. I can&apos;t stay and chat because people are lurking outside my office. TheToyMaker September 15th, 2009, 07:40 AM Hi! It&apos;s a new day and I&apos;m pleased to report I was down a tiny bit this morning. I can&apos;t do a steak day today because I have class tonight. It would be way too late for me to eat by the time I got home from class and actually cooked something. I think I&apos;ll do a steak day tomorrow to see if I can get off a bit more before Friday. Everybody have a lovely day. It&apos;s still raining here and it&apos;s just nasty. I forgot my umbrella, left it on my front porch -- the neighbor&apos;s dogs will probably run off with it and tear it up. Oh well....

How&apos;s everyone else doing? hmhuntr September 15th, 2009, 07:41 AM Toy- sorry to hear about P3. I couldn&apos;t believe how quickly the weight can jump back up. It&apos;s like one little thing and you&apos;re up3 lbs ya know? But you&apos;re starting fresh on Friday and that&apos;s what counts, you&apos;re not giving up! Everything has been pretty stressful and routines mixed up on your end but now you know what to expect. You can do it girl..and even better than before! Eat something heavenly for me!:D

NC- It MUST have been pizza day that day I guess! My slice was only cheese so maybe that&apos;s what saved me a little. I don&apos;t usually eat meat or anything else on it. I&apos;m starting to notice the sleep affect now. Never had the issue before but now my loss is really small if I&apos;m up past 1am. Kinda stinks because that&apos;s when I get my best work done LOL! You might find this humorous...I measured today and I still don&apos;t get how with my weight right now I still have 42-43 in hips???? I guess pushing out 9 lb babies didn&apos;t help. Maybe I&apos;ll check into getting the bone shaved down when I reach goal;) LOL!

Yesterday only had a .4 loss (up late) so hubby said let&apos;s do a steak day. Down 1.2 today. Hubby has been flying through. He lost 2lb yesterday and 2.2 today!:rolleyes: ( 284.4 lb) Guess once he broke his set weight the sky is the limit. I did actually FEEL hungry yesterday not just mentally. I&apos;m hoping it&apos;s not immunity creeping up on me because I only bought enough for this round and can&apos;t up the dosage, I may have to bear it out. I hope everyone has a wonderful day and makes great food choices with ease:) TheToyMaker September 15th, 2009, 08:16 AM Hmhuntr -- Nine kids? Is that a typo? Oh my, after 9 kids I&apos;d think your hips would be 96&quot;! No wonder you&apos;re up until the wee hours. How do you have any time for yourself?

You know, I haven&apos;t even thought about what I&apos;ll eat on my gorge days. Last time I had lots and lots of bacon and some Ben and Jerry&apos;s. It worked pretty well because I didn&apos;t really gain any weight but I was satisfied from the high-fat menu! 160lbsorbust September 15th, 2009, 07:02 PM Hello Everyone;
It has been four months since I last visited, but I have dusted off my supplies and am getting ready to start back dieting. The great thing is I only gained back 10 pounds. I am soooooo bad during the summer with fairs and amusement parks. I am having my daughter come over and help me shed all the bad food from the cabinet. I&apos;m sooooo happy to see that many of you are stll here. hmhuntr September 15th, 2009, 11:11 PM Toy- no, not 9 kids....9 pound kids....wow, I would be bald if I had 9 kids!

160lb- Welcome back. Have you picked a gorge day yet? Toy is looking to gorge Friday, maybe the two of you could buddy up for added support?

I have had the WORST case of cravings for sour cream and onion chips. Guess what I happen to have in my house right now? Yup- you guessed it. I&apos;m not eating them but I have licked the flavor off of quiet a few of them...no joke! Good thing the kids aren&apos;t up or I&apos;d never hear the end of it. I&apos;m saying a prayer that my scale is kind to me in the morning. I&apos;m drinking water to try and counteract it but we&apos;ll just have to see.:rolleyes: TheToyMaker September 16th, 2009, 10:44 AM Hmhuntr -- LOL! How funny that I misread and thought you had 9 kids! I&apos;m glad you cleared that up for me!

160lborbust -- As hmhuntr said, I&apos;ll start my gorge Friday morning. Want to join me?

I&apos;m down a little bit this morning and I&apos;m happy about that. I cannot wait to get back on those shots.

Does anybody here skip days so they won&apos;t become immune? I wondered if I could do 5 shots, skip 2 days and then 5 shots again, etc for a total of 43 shots. That would give me a longer period of time to keep losing weight. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to try it this time because I&apos;ve had a hard time staying focused during the last 20-23 shots. I&apos;ll just wait and see how the first&quot;mix&quot;goes. I really need to take off some major pounds this round because the holidays are coming up. I&apos;ll be going to the BF&apos;s family with him so I&apos;d like to wear something cute.... hmhuntr September 16th, 2009, 12:34 PM FYI- Licking chips is as bad as eating them apparently. Up some today. I should have just eatin the damn things:rolleyes: TheToyMaker September 16th, 2009, 02:36 PM Hmhuntr, the coating on chips contains loads of salt. I bet you&apos;re retaining fluid. anadingding September 16th, 2009, 05:28 PM hi friends. Been pretty good on my food lately, haven&apos;t exercised, but hopefully soon. ;) I just got me period this tuesday so didnt weigh in. I have been researching a lot on different menstrual products. LOL Sorry out of the weight loss range:rolleyes: but we are girls and hopefully you ladies don&apos;t mind. LOL Well believe it or not I have never used a tampon always been a pad girl. So decided to try them out OH MY GOSH !..... It went through 5 tampons before I got it right. LOL But anyways after I did I think Im going to stick to pads. LOL I found a lot of info on menstrual cups that you only have to change every 12 hours, but they seem to big and rubbery LOL Okay so then I though of just completely skipping my periods. LOL since I use the nuva ring for b-control then I could just replace it every 4 weeks with a new one without leaving it out for a week to get my period. so thats what Im going to try next cycle. LOL I mean you really dont need your period if your not trying to get preggos so yeah we will see how that goes. Any advice,comments would be appreciated.

Toy- your off to a good start!

Humt--- you made me laugh when you said you were licking the chips. LOL but dont worry it probably is just salt in your system. I bet tomorrow you will see a loss.

Where is everyone?:( I hope you girls are doing good. We miss you. Come back.

Halloween 59 days NCGreenEyes September 16th, 2009, 10:07 PM Hi Ladies! Sorry I have been MIA for a couple days - been busy! Still dropping the weight - slow, but it&apos;s coming. I didn&apos;t actually see a loss today, but it was because I weighed a lot earlier than normal. I was bad today though and didn&apos;t eat well....but I have been pouring in the water and did my exercise, so I&apos;m crossing my fingers for maybe at least a *little* loss. Hoping to have some good luck the next 2 days - going to see about 4 houses in the next 2 days....so hoping I find one I love!

Toy - It&apos;s good that you are ready to start P2 back, hopefully it will go well for you :)

hmhuntr - I am for sure a late nighter...but I have the option to sleep in the morning so I think that&apos;s what helps me. And there is nothing wrong with an hourglass figure...but if you are worried about your hips I&apos;m sure that your next round will help! And I laughed about you licking the chips...haha I have so felt like that - but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s just water retention like the others said.

160 lb - Welcome back!!

Ana - I did the whole&quot;skipping the period&quot;thing for awhile when they thought I may have endometriosis...I was told that it doesn&apos;t hurt you, it just may be interesting when you decide to start having it again.

And helllllllloooo....where are all the other ladies - and um, MO? I don&apos;t think she&apos;s been on here in forever...anyhoo - if you all are lurking..come back to us! SheilaK September 16th, 2009, 11:01 PM Hello Everyone,
I haven&apos;t posted in a while cuz it has been a bit crazy. I am still on P3, I finally got rid of the extra 8 lbs that I put on when i first started P3 (had my period too) it was not a good combination! Anyway, I have been having a carb here and there and have been ok so I am hoping i am stabilizing. I am actually looking forward to my next round, you get used to losing the weight and now thats I am maintaining I am anxious to lose again.

Toy-Good luck on your next round, I am feeling the same way you are. I would really like to lose well, I had been wondering about taking a day off too, no one has responded to that though. I do worry about becoming immune before I lose all my weight so if it would help to skip one day a week I would do that. Suggestions anyone?

Hmhunter-My girlfriend actually chews up the chips and spits them out so she doesn&apos;t get the calories, not sure if it really helps though. I love to lick the seasoning off of sour crm&amp;onion chips but then I usually also eat the chip!! Not for the last 6 weeks though.

Ana-I don&apos;t have any help on the period stuff, I would actually go without mine if I could! Good Luck!

NC-Slow is better than none right? What type of excercise are you doing? I keep telling myself I am going to start some toning excercises but just haven&apos;t gotten there. I do walk every day though.

Oshun, Mo and the rest of you, just want you to know that i miss your posts! You were always helpful and entertaining!! Come on back!

Good Luck with weigh in tomorrow!:D:D justkarib September 17th, 2009, 01:24 AM I&apos;m still reading and keeping up on this thread after taking weeks to read through the 100+ pages a bit back. I&apos;m still interested in HCG but the phen seems to be working for me right now. So I&apos;m sticking with that and will do the HCG if I need to.

Ana-I wanted to chime in for you. I use the Nuva Ring as well and after 3 weeks the hormones in it are basically gone. So if you try to leave it in for 4 weeks, you might start bleeding since it&apos;s not releasing much anymore. I tried that a bit back and got to 3 weeks and 4 days and started bleeding. So if you want to keep it from coming, you need to put a new one in every 3 weeks so you are always getting the max does of hormones. Good luck with it. No one likes their TOM. NCGreenEyes September 17th, 2009, 01:55 AM Sheila - Thanks for the encouragement. As far as my exercise, I do an aerobic walking video that is about 20 min and 1 mile. When are you planning to start your next round?

Toy&amp;Sheila - As far as taking the shots differently, since I do mine through a clinic I actually only take 2 shots a week, and so far it has seemed to work well for me. By doing it that way I only have to do P3 once every 4 months.

As for me - I need to stop myself from being too much of a nightowl and get to bed. I&apos;ll be here tomorrow...so hope everyone has a great weigh-in and maybe we&apos;ll have some more of the&quot;oldies&quot;back posting ;) TheToyMaker September 17th, 2009, 08:46 AM NCGreenEyes -- You only take 2 shots per week? Are you able to stay on the VLCD with only 2 shots or do you also take Phen to supplement? That&apos;s interesting. ms750 September 17th, 2009, 01:10 PM Hi Ladies!! Glad to see everyone is still maintaining well! After all of that waiting and excitement to start (I was suppose to start 8/17/09), wouldn&apos;t you know TOM appeared...then after that I had to take PREDNISONE. I knew right then I wasn&apos;t starting...as of matter of fact Prednisone has never been my friend, gained 10 lbs in one friggin month....

Anyways I finally did it after being mad all that time looking at my box of supplies and I mixed up everything last night, screwed it up a bit, but I did it.. Realized the research company shipped me the wrong size glass vial, so I ended up mixing the HCG solution directly into the bacteriostatic water bottle, after removing 1.5 ccs (28 shots at 175 iu I think). Started filling my syringes and then realized that I was using a 1cc syringe and was suppose to be filling the entire thing. For some reason my brain was calculating all the wrong numbers at all the wrong values...Think I went through 6 of the 5cc syringes and about 35 of the 1ML...Do you think that will cause any issues?? Chalk it up to trial and error and a learning experience.

Did my first shot this morning...actually did it at work..no problems, no pain..Enjoying my gorge-fes days here, not going to tell you what I&apos;m eating because I don&apos;t want to be the blame for any extra tastings and nibbles!! Looking forward to taking ANOTHER set of before pictures Sunday morning.

Missed you all and your inspiration!!:p:p ShellPrice September 17th, 2009, 03:41 PM Sorry I don&apos;t get on here very much anymore. Work has been crazy. I just started back on P2 after a 9 day break. My husband and I have our cycles mapped out until Christmas so that I have breaks for business meetings. There would be just no way to do this diet while in New Orleans for a week. I did very well during my break until Sat. I fixed brownies and cake for my husbands reunion. the brownies stuck together so bad that they weren&apos;t pretty to take, so we ate them. Obviously sugar is my curse because I had gained 7 lbs by the time I ended my gorge days. By today I had dropped 2.4 lbs of it so maybe it&apos;ll leave as quick as it added on.

Toy - the clinic that I went through only had me doing shots 3 times a week on Mon, Wed&amp;Fri. I just take double the dose on those days. I haven&apos;t been hungry without the phentermine, but some people are.

NC - You are doing so great. I can&apos;t wait to hit 77 lbs lost.

Ana - great to see you back. PunkMOM September 17th, 2009, 04:21 PM Well hello ladies!!!

I have done ok during P3. I am staying around 140ish. Give or take a pound or two both directions. I will start my hopefully last round on Saturday. Gorging all weekend woooohooo and then back into the VLCD for the last pounds to say goodbye. I want to get down to 128/130 and then maintain that in P3 for at least 2 months or so (even through the holidays) and then possible do another short round depending on if I gain or not to even me out at 120.

I finally put some pictures up on my facebook lol. For the longest time I had pictures of my husband and the boys and a face shot or two. It feels good to not hate the way I look 8.5 months after having a baby.

NC - Your new picture is smoking girl!! You look amazing!!!
ASU - are you still doing the HCG? I love your hair. I got mine chopped to just below my shoulders a few months back. So much easier to fix now!!

To everyone I&apos;ll catch up with what is going on with you girls in time. I will be posting more during P2 since I always need the support!! NCGreenEyes September 18th, 2009, 01:00 AM Hi ladies - so I got lucky after my little cheat yesterday and still managed to lose .8 lbs! Woohoo! As of right now I sit at 180 even.....so I am realllllly hoping that in the morning I will be below 180 officially! *Crossing my fingers*

Toy - I do take Phen along with the shots. There have been days I have forgotten to take it though and been fine.

ms750 - Glad to have you back, hope you have great success this round!

Shell - It looks like you are having pretty good success now since you&apos;ve started back, just stay as tough as you can!

Punk - Glad you are back girl!! Sounds like you maintained well so yay for you :) I&apos;m sure that you will do well this round. That&apos;s funny you mentioned about the facebook because I finally did the same thing for the first time in a REALLY long time! And thanks so much for the compliment...I&apos;m finally starting to feel like the&quot;me&quot;again that I haven&apos;t felt like in years! It&apos;s nice to that I am slowly getting some confidence back. We&apos;ll definitely be here for your support, and I know we need yours too :)

Hope everyone else is doing well and losing, losing, losing! If not, tomorrow is always a new day! PunkMOM September 18th, 2009, 11:47 AM I am curious and this may sound really dumb but what are gorge days, streak days, apple days, and VLCD? I am curious to know the info on anything that will help the pounds melt off! Someone please clue me in!


Hi Holly!! I would suggest reading Pounds&amp;Inches (http://www.hcgdietinfo.com/Dr-ATW-Simeons-Pounds-and-Inches.htm) by Dr, Simeons, This is the original protocol.
Here is a summary of the VLCD. (http://www.hcgdietinfo.com/HCG-Diet-Protocol.htm)

VLCD - Very Low Calorie Diet

Gorge Days - First two days of the shots, eating (gorging) yourself on foods to load your fat stores. This is a very important step. It is hard to make yourself gorge especially if you are in the habit of eating healthy but it really is important and with enough stores people tend not to have bad hunger/cravings during the first week of the VLCD.

Apple Day - An apple day is used during P2 to break a plateau. You eat up to 7 apples in one day drinking water ONLY if parched. You eat and drink nothing else.

Steak Day - A steak day is used in P3 when your weight goes 2.1 lbs or more over your ending P2 weight. You fast all day drinking lots of water. You can also have coffee. For dinner you eat a HUGE steak followed by an apple or tomato and nothing else. You should see a good loss the next day,

Phase One (P1) - The protocol is broken up into what Kevin Trudeau calls phases, I have not done P1 before, this is where he says a month before you start the shots you should cleanse your body, This is NOT a Simeons protocol phase.

Phase Two (P2) - This is when the shots are started. The first day of the shot you &apos;gorge&apos; yourself on fatty foods, and do the same on the second day of the shot. On the third day you start the VLCD following the protocol to a TEE!!! This part lasts 23 - 40 days of shots. Followed up by the 3 days of VLCD while waiting for the HCG to leave your system.

Phase Three (P3) - This is the MOST important phase IMO. This is where you train you body to use the foods you eat for energy and reset you hypothalmus. For 3 weeks you eat NO sugar or starch and then slowly add these back into your diet paying close attention to how your body responds. This phase will set your metabolism and how your body responds to food for the rest of your life.

Phase Four (P4) - This is the final phase. I do not know as much about it since I have not reached my goal weight and have yet to enter this phase.

This is just a basic outline of the diet and what is required. You will gain a much broader understanding if you read the actual protocol as developed over many years by the main who created it. The book HCG Weight Loss Cure Guide (http://www.amazon.com/HCG-Weight-Loss-Cure-Guide/dp/1434842002) by Linda Prinster is a must read and full of information to make the diet easier to follow and understand.




My friend did the HCG, but she bought it on the internet and followed a very specific diet plan. She lost 16 pounds in three weeks, but that was without Phen.

I&apos;m taking Phen and Topomax in addition to the B12-Lipotropic Shots each week, and I saw that my doc has the HCG shots on his receipts. Was thinking about asking him when he uses them. Maybe to push you out of a plateau? I lost a lot of weight when I was preggo with my daughter (was totally healthy, my metabolism just revved up) and I thought maybe this might simulate the same thing-- you know, without the 18 years of servitude that follow. ;) kidding.

Anyway, the plan I&apos;m on now has worked so far (12 lbs in 2 weeks) so I&apos;ll stick with it.

Congrats on your loss!

oh, and ps. don&apos;t fertility docs give those shots to help conceive? be careful...

We are well aware of the fact that HCG is used to help women conceive. We have been told this many times lol. Please realize that the women taking it for this are taking doses around 10,000 I.U. For the HCG Diet we dose a MAXIMUM of 250 I.U. daily. I think we are definitely safe. This diet has been around since Dr. Simeons published a report about it in 1954. Plenty long enough for any dangers or unwanted effects to have been reported. anadingding September 18th, 2009, 12:22 PM Hi girlies Glad to see everyone is doing good. Looks like my TOM is almost gone! YeY. Thank you girls for the advice. I will definitely try the 3 week thing with the nuva ring. Hope that goes well. I know it will probably take some time for my cycles to start adjusting to the new routine. Cant wait to see how that turns out. :)

Nc- Do you know how many mls the dc gives you, 2 shots a week sound a lot better, lol? You are doing awesome girl, keep up the good work!

ASU89 September 19th, 2009, 01:26 AM Toy - your new picture is lovely!! Good luck on your next round..keep us up to date!

Punk - doesn&apos;t it feel nice to do your hair in half the time than before?! I kind of miss having long hair, but then I think about what a pain it was to have to do everyday... and how sweaty and gross it got walking around campus. I love this new cut though! Nope, I am not doing HCG anymore, just doing my own little diet which is working wonderfully. Hope you have fun gorging! Good luck this round, I know you&apos;ll be at your goal in no time!

Ana - how&apos;s your diet going? What does it consist of? Calorie intake, exercise, etc etc.

NC - oh my gosh girl.. you get me speechless every time I read your posts. 180 LBS?! That is AWESOME! I am so proud of you!!! I remember not too long ago you were just waiting to get into the 190&apos;s... I think you have the most determination on here haha. You are admirable! NCGreenEyes September 19th, 2009, 01:45 AM Hey ladies - late night check in for me....although that is fairly typical isn&apos;t it? Haha. So today I weighed in at 179.4!! Woohoo, bye bye 180&apos;s! However..........after an evening of rather disappointing house-hunting....I was a very bad girl for dinner. I&apos;ll just leave it with two words: Pizza Hut. I didn&apos;t have lunch today though and I have tried to flush myself full of water, and did a little extra exercise....so I&apos;ll see the damage in the morning I guess. I hope it&apos;s not too bad :(

Ana - Thanks!! I am hoping that your dieting/exercising will work well for you, I&apos;ve got my fingers crossed for ya! As far as how much the shots are, all I know is that it says 35 I.U. Whatever that means. And I take the highest dose of Phen (I think) - I&apos;d have to look. All I know is it has been working like magic....I&apos;ve lost just under 80 lbs since mid-April...with a month off in there!

ASU - I soo need to join the haircut club...but really I will probably just get a trim since I don&apos;t like to chop my hair off too much when it starts getting to be cooler weather. Yours is really cute though! And thanks for the compliments - it does seem like just yesterday I was waiting and praying to get under 200 and to my short-term goal of 190! I&apos;m trying to take smaller steps now - my next goal is 160...so we shall see how long it takes to get there! I don&apos;t know that I have the most determination...probably anyone in my situation would - I&apos;m going through a rough separation from my husband, working, trying to stay as busy as possible to keep my mind off things, and trying desperately to find my first home to buy so I can get out of this rent house w/ all it&apos;s memories (we&apos;ll leave the description of the rent house at that). And....the weight I had gained was from health issues, and my husband was TOTALLY unsupportive about it, and actually was really very mean about it....so while the weight loss is totally for me to get back to feeling like myself, it is also kind of a&quot;ha-ha&quot;to the husband ;) Btw, sorry for such a long response! How are you doing on your diet??? Kudos to you and Ana for doing it on your own!!

Hope everyone else is doing well and staying tougher than me over the weekend!! If not, don&apos;t feel bad I&apos;m right there with you! :) anadingding September 19th, 2009, 12:41 PM hey girls.

Asu- glad to see your back. Well as far as my diet its going pretty good. I dont drink no soda, chips, and try to limit my starch. I exercise on and off, need to get a routine going though LOL.

NcG-- You go girl! I cant wait to hit the 170&apos;s. I;ve been in the 180&apos;s forever! But I think it is finally going to come! LOL Keep up the good work!

Well Aunt Flow is gone! YEY! LOL I weighed in today and I am at 182.8! Finally hit my first 20lbs LOL About time! 170&apos;s please stay near by please! LOL

Oh girls, I havent had a drink still. LOL

I have another month to go on P3.

Does anyone know if vitamin E or evening of primrose are bad to take on P2? hmhuntr September 19th, 2009, 07:26 PM Hey ladies- I was up, then I was down, and today I fell into an&quot;I don&apos;t want to do this anymore&quot;mood. I&apos;ve had some junk and am pretty sure it won&apos;t be good tomorrow. Hopefully when I wake up tomorrow this will all be a bed dream....or middle of the phase&quot;cheat&quot;that jumpstarts me through the other half. I&apos;m my own worst sabotage.

NC- Why is it that you and I seem to&quot;fall off the wagon&quot;at the same time? We must be sharing a wave length or something LOL!

Ana- Congrats on your 20 lb mark! That&apos;s a big deal! PunkMOM September 20th, 2009, 03:00 PM Hello ladies!!!

WOW I went CRAZY on gorge day one. I had more food in one day than I usually eat over a three day period. I was up this morning WAY up lol. I was about 6 lbs heavier this morning HOLY COW!! I really really really hope it goes away quickly and easily!! It is hard from going .6 shy of the 130&apos;s to darn close to the 150&apos;s again.

I have a few phentermine I might take during the first week. I have been taking probiotics over the last week and a candida cleanse. Hopefully that will help with the cravings b/c I plan on being VERY strict this round.

Hope everyone else is doing great. tazgirl31 September 20th, 2009, 07:21 PM Good job to everyone losing!!!!! Today is day 20 for me I still have like 28 days left since Im gonna use up all my HCG rather then waste it!!! Long as Im not getting immuned to it I will continue it all!!! Anyways I havent been exercising since I started this plan but decided to try it today so I walked not quite a hour and went 2.76 miles...I burned 430 calories....I would have went my last lap and made it even 3 miles but I was getting really sick and blacking out so decided to stop.....But I think this was good enough...Im just curious to see what it does to the weight loss in the morning! If I gain I wont be walking no more lol.....If it turns out ok I may continue walking but maybe not as long as I dont want to be burning off 500 calories and only eating 500 calories...thats no good....Anyways hope everyone else is doing great!!!! Im trying to lose 14 more pounds by my birthday which is in 16 days!! I sure hope I can do it and make my first mini goal!!!!!!!!!! Taz tazgirl31 September 20th, 2009, 07:25 PM Hello ladies!!!

Hope u lose big!!!!!!!!!! good luck:) Taz TheToyMaker September 21st, 2009, 07:32 AM OMG! How can it possibly already be Monday? I need a few more days of the weekend. I started my gorge Friday and did my first shot Sunday morning. I gained 2.5 pounds goring and this morning I had lost 1.3 pounds. That&apos;s pretty acceptable!

ASU&amp;OSHUN -- thanks for the nice compliment on my new profile pic. I was sitting here at work the other morning downloading some photos from the weekend and decided I&apos;d take that one. Because I like to play in makeup I think I&apos;ll start taking photos of my face with the various makeup colors I choose just to see which are flattering and which aren&apos;t. With a picture I can really scope it out!

NC -- big congrats on the&quot;less than 180&quot;weigh-in. That&apos;s wonderful! You&apos;re such an inspiration.

Ana -- a 20 pound total loss is great!

Corkaiasja09 -- Yes girl! A 5 pound loss in 6 days is fabulous! Keep up the good work.

Taz -- Good luck on your goal of 14 pounds in 16 days. You look so small in your pics.

TEE HEE! We&apos;re all such losers! Ladies, have a fabulous Monday. Maybe Mo will show up at some point this week so we&apos;ll know she&apos;s still alive and how her classes are going. tazgirl31 September 21st, 2009, 11:34 AM TOYMAKER!! CONGRATS on ur loss this morning thats great!!!! And thanx for the compliment:) Im really hoping to make my birthday goal that will be the best present ever!!!

So now I just have 13.3 pounds to lose in 15 days lol Im counting down.....this plan has been really successful for me I have lost almost 18 pounds in 21 days so Im really happy!!!! Im doing great not cheating even tho there has been many days I have wanted to cheat for sure!!! lol.....Im going to mix my second bottle of HCG today and start it tommorow!!! I sure hope it works as well as the first bottle lol....Hmhuntr Im gonna do like u and use my bac water bottle to mix it in cause hubby threw my sterile vial away by accident....hope this wont hurt anything.....I have decided to go a head and order some more HCG MAYBE 4 of them so I can have them before the holidays when the mail is so slow...cause I plan on doing another round and so does my hubby so this will be exciting!!!! Well off to start my busy day good luck to everyone!!!!!!! And TOYMAKER, we are ALL big LOSERS hahaha........Taz TheToyMaker September 21st, 2009, 12:04 PM Taz, 1.5 pounds is wonderful! I might have to walk today after work. I don&apos;t have class tonight so I could put in some hoof time. I&apos;ll let you know in the morning. ms750 September 21st, 2009, 12:58 PM Well I gorged Thursday, Friday and Saturday...Sunday I got on scale and it said 246lbs...holy moo-moo dress Batman!! I couldn&apos;t eat everything yesterday is that normal?? I had tea and an apple for breakfast and forced myself to eat around 7pm and that was it...will that adversely effect results?

This morning scale said 243lbs so I&apos;m good with that. I forgot my lunch, so I bought a salad and split with coworker. Baby Spinach, grilled beef tenderloin and italian dressing (i removed the &apos;shrooms and onion straws and just dipped the fork in the dressing). I have no idea what the weight of the meat was or what was in the italian dressing besides loads of minced garlic (restaurant makes it on site) Is this a really bad screw up...do I need to start over, or do I just keep going from here??!! tazgirl31 September 21st, 2009, 01:32 PM Taz, 1.5 pounds is wonderful! I might have to walk today after work. I don&apos;t have class tonight so I could put in some hoof time. I&apos;ll let you know in the morning.

Yesss let me no how it works out for u!!! I am for sure going to keep walking now after having great results like this!! I was always worried that if I walked it would make me gain but Im thinking walking will help me lose alot more!! Oh and it felt so good to walk again cause I was walking 10 miles a day before I started this plan...although I did feel a little out of shape yesterday haha but I no it was just cause I had such little energy from not eating much now!!! I hope u have great results I will be anxious to here!!! Taz



MS750
CONGRATS on ur 3pound loss thats awesome!!!! I dont think what u ate will cause that much damage if any!! I wouldnt start over I would just continue the plan and see how u do with tommorow weigh in!! I think u will be fine!!! about the skipping meals Im not sure really cause I no I have skipped my lunch vegies and I am always down more the next day so Im not sure...some says u should eat all ur calories and some think its ok to skip some of the food lol...maybe someone else will be able to help u with this one!!!!! Good luck on this round!!!!!! Taz PunkMOM September 21st, 2009, 06:03 PM I lost 1.2 from yesterday. That puts me still 4 lbs higher than BEFORE my gorge lol. Hopefully that will go quick!!!

Toy - We are pretty much gonna be doing this round together. We can use each other for motivation. I started my gorge on Saturday and boy did I enjoy it lol :) Good luck on your P2!!!!! I&apos;m so happy to be back and losing again. The end is almost in sight!!!

ms750 - Just keep on keeping on. It may have little effect on your loss but if it does just give it a few days and then things should go right back down. What dose are you taking? I think the higher the dose the more cheats will effect you. I started my first round at 200 i.u. but now have settled in to 140 i.u. Everyone is different but I find that works for me.

I ordered the Lupi for this round but it hasn&apos;t arrived yet so I am using the Hucog I had left over from the last time I ordered. Hopefully my Lupi will arrive soon so I can mix it up and use it instead. I am just so happy to be back on the losing train.

Here are a couple of pictures FINALLY :)

Me Saturday night (ignore the hair and the paint job lol)

Ryder&amp;I on the carousel at the mall today
http://www.gmtnd.com/family/merrygo.JPG rokprincess September 21st, 2009, 11:45 PM I guess I&apos;m doing this whole thing wrong.... I have had minimal sucess on phen, yet I still go back to it. I would sit and read all the posts to work out these HCG questions I have, but I&apos;m just taking a study break... Do you ladies order them or get them at your doctors office? I&apos;m just courious... OK.... now back to studying for my sign language quiz in the morning.... TheToyMaker September 22nd, 2009, 07:09 AM Good Morning! Yesterday I completed my second day of P2 and I am pleased to report a loss of 1.7! I am so excited. Of course, as the days pass it gets way harder for me to stay on the straight and narrow. We&apos;ll see....

Taz -- I did walk for about an hour yesterday. I didn&apos;t let myself get really fast like I usually do. I think I was afraid I&apos;d burn too many calories on too little food! I did have a nice loss and now I&apos;m wondering how I can walk tonight. It will be way after dark when I get home from class. If it were winter I&apos;d just walk on my road (I live out in the country with no street lights) but it&apos;s still warm enough that I&apos;m afraid there will be a snake on the road. Yeah, I&apos;m a big chicken about that. I think I may wear something that&apos;s&quot;exercise acceptable&quot;to class tonight and just stop at the gym on my way home. How hard can that be since I have to drive right by it?

PunkMom -- yes, we&apos;re doing it together this time. I&apos;m only one day ahead of you. Stay strong because we can do this. You really do look small in your pictures. I love the one of you and Ryder on the carousel.

Rokprincess -- most of the people on here seem to just order the HCG and supplies on their own. There&apos;s a lot of information about it on pages 3-7. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.

Everyone have a really good Tuesday. It&apos;s probably going to rain here so I&apos;m thankful I won&apos;t be racing out of here at lunch for a class. rokprincess September 22nd, 2009, 11:37 AM Thank you TOY.... and congrats doll!!!! InnaBinna September 22nd, 2009, 01:22 PM HCG injections?
Lipo Shot?
B-12 Shot?

What&apos;s the difference?
I got my phentermine from a regular physician and he doest give those kinds of shots ? where can I get one?

Thank You tazgirl31 September 22nd, 2009, 05:09 PM Good Morning! Yesterday I completed my second day of P2 and I am pleased to report a loss of 1.7! I am so excited. Of course, as the days pass it gets way harder for me to stay on the straight and narrow. We&apos;ll see....

Yayyy for u!!!!! That was a great loss!! Yea I hear u about walking fast like we normally do...I am not gonna be walking that fast anymore either it made me really weak and sick....But it does help with the weight loss in my opinon!!! I so dont blame u for not wanting to walk at night on a country road lol...I would be a chicken also and I hate hate snakes!!!! Yep u FOR sure need to go to that gym tonight after class lol....even if its just a few mins....its better then no exercise at all!!! It was pouring down rain last night so I didnt get to go to the track and walk and was so disappointed but tonight I will be going....I still lost really good tho so that made me feel good...I have a membership to the gym but havent been in over 3 months cause I would rather walk outside then on a dang treadmill it just gets to boring for me!!! Well I will be anxious to hear how u do tommorow with ur weigh in!!!!!!!!!! Taz tazgirl31 September 22nd, 2009, 05:13 PM I guess I&apos;m doing this whole thing wrong....

Do you ladies order them or get them at your doctors office? I&apos;m just courious... OK.... now back to studying for my sign language quiz in the morning....

Most of us order it online!! Its alot cheaper then going to the dr and getting the injections!!! If u get some time read through pages 3-8 I think it is and all the supplies needed are listed there and where to order it from!!!! U can learn alot by reading thro this long long thread lol.....Thats what I did before I started on the injections!!! Its amazing and really does work!!!!!! if u cant find the info needed pm me and I will send u the list!!!!!! Taz SheilaK September 22nd, 2009, 09:37 PM Hi everyone,
I am just wondering if all of you who have done 2 or more rounds would post the results from each of your rounds? Did you lose as well on your 2nd and 3rd rounds as on your first? Did you do anything differently in the 2nd and 3rd rounds? I am just wondering what to expect when I start up again. I lost 28 pounds my first round which was a 40 day round and am trying to plan the rest of this out around the holidays.

Thanks for everything! rokprincess September 22nd, 2009, 09:43 PM shelia... WOW.... that is great.... did you get yours at the doctors or did you order it? and what was the cost? hmhuntr September 22nd, 2009, 10:36 PM Well....it wasn&apos;t a phase. I dropped out completely. I don&apos;t know what got into me but my head just wasn&apos;t in it anymore so i figured it was best to stop instead of cheat all the way through it. Hope I made the right desicion. Hubby is still going strong...God love him! He was 284 this morning. I&apos;m trying to be supportive of him since he is doing it alone now. I&apos;m so proud of him.

As for the rest of you&quot;losers&quot;;) WTG!!! I plan to follow everyone&apos;s progress. Maybe after a bit off the protocol I&apos;ll get my butt in gear again. Good Luck ladies:) tazgirl31 September 23rd, 2009, 12:11 AM Well....it wasn&apos;t a phase. I dropped out completely.

Ahhh hmhuntr I no how u feel....this plan is a really hard one to stick to ..especially since its ur second round!!! I just mixed up my second batch tonight and so I have 21 more days to go....ughh Im dreading the next phase cause I just dont see how it will be impossible to keep this weight off I have lost.....especially with adding so much calories back....Im kinda nervous about it.....Im happy ur hubby is still hanging in there!!! Thats great.....ur at 150 so I would be very very pleased at that weight!! U have done realy good and u prob just need a little break......Oh I noticed when I mixed this batch tonight it was bubbly for some reason...I dont no why the last time it wasnt like this....I hope its not bad or something....was weird how it was white bubbles .....almost like foamy...I didnt shake it just rolled it like before...anyways keep checking in with us I like to read ur messages!!! let us no how ur hubby keeps doing as well:) Taz TheToyMaker September 23rd, 2009, 07:12 AM Morning everybody! I got on the scales this morning and had a VERY pleasant surprise. I am down 2.4 pounds from yesterday! I did walk last night but it was only for 30 minutes. I stopped at the gym on my way home from class but couldn&apos;t spend much time since I have a test today and needed to study.

hmhuntr -- I totally understand about not wanting to keep on going with the round and cheating the whole time. I think that adds such stress because you NEVER want to see the scales the next morning. How well I do know that! You&apos;ll get back on it when you&apos;re ready. And you&apos;re so close to goal that when you do decide to finish it will take you no time at all.

SheilaK -- I don&apos;t know what it is about the second round of P2 but a lot of people don&apos;t do nearly as well as they do on the first round. My&quot;not so good&quot;results were totally my fault because I couldn&apos;t seem to stay focused. This is my third round of P2 and since Monday I&apos;ve lost 5.4 pounds. Of course, loss this fast won&apos;t continue for the long stretch because I don&apos;t really think it&apos;s humanly possible but I am more focused this time.

Taz -- You would laugh if you could have seen the dance I did over the weekend when I came home and there was a black snake on my front porch!!! OMG! Of course, it wasn&apos;t poisonous but I don&apos;t even like to watch those things move. I didn&apos;t kill it because it will keep away the bad snakes but I certainly didn&apos;t want it looking at me!

Everybody have a fabulous day. I&apos;ll check in periodically but right now I&apos;ve got to get some work done. tazgirl31 September 23rd, 2009, 11:42 AM TOYMAKER:::::::
My gosh u r kickin butt lol!!! I can only imagine how excited u were when u seen the scale this morning!!! Keep up the walking it really will pay off even if its just 30 mins thats good enough!!! Thats what Im doing just keeping on walking and getting as much time as I can in even if its 20 mins....EWWWW I no black snakes are supposed to be harmless lol but ummm yea Im terrified of them also.....They are just to creepy looking and I sure dont want them anywhere near me! I stepped on a snake bare foot one time and omg I about had a heart attack lol...was terrible!!! My weight is driving me crazy lol 2 days it will be over a pound loss then one day only ozs lol it sux but I just hang in there cause either way its still a loss so Im happy!!!! all im living on is chicken breasts, spinach and lean burger and celery lol do u have that recipe book u could email me? aly sent it to be before but I didnt have adobe reader so never got to open it but I have it now so would really like to check it out!!! my email is bail5m@yahoo.com!!!! I think I need some new food ideas lol!!!! well good luck tommorow Im crossing my fingers for a big loss for u again!!!!!!!! Taz ms750 September 23rd, 2009, 12:46 PM Taz- Thanks, you were correct. This morning I was down to 240.8. Thank goodness...it&apos;s too early in this to get on the disappointment train!

Punk- I&apos;m doing 175 iu doses 6 days a week. I was seeing a big gap between iu dosage so I just went in the middle, although I&apos;ve been told that I am on the high end. I had never heard the relationship between dosage and cheats, I&apos;ll have to look into that. It might be true because last night I had a hard time. My 12 year old had the best looking bowl of Froot Loops that I have ever seen!! I had saved my fruit (strawberries in 2 tbl of lemon juice and stevia)...wasn&apos;t quite the same but I didn&apos;t fall to the Toucan!!!

Inna- Anytime that a doc has given me Phen, it always came with a bi-weekly B12 shot, I supplemented in between with sublingual B12 pills, but to be effective doc said they have to be over 2500 mcg. Maybe ask the doc if he can give you one, or if you&apos;re up to it, I know a couple of people that order their own and do their own injections.


In the cookbook and elsewhere I noticed that with the vegetables there rarely is an amount (luv the sweet japanese cucumbers) that you are suppose to eat. Eat until you&apos;re full? tazgirl31 September 23rd, 2009, 01:30 PM Taz- Thanks, you were correct. This morning I was down to 240.8.

Yayyy for u girl!!!! Im happy!!! I didnt think it would mess u up!!!! Hey Im doing the 175IU also and I am glad I chose to do this amount I think it is awesome!!! I have lost right at 19 pounds in 23 days!!! so its working great!!! And I was really hungry the first week but now Im not...I havent been eating my lunch veggie and havent been eating my dinner fruit the last couple days and Im still losing good...ahhh and I no how u feel about seeing ur daughters food cause my hubby makes this house smell so good with all his cooking and im stuck with spinach and chicken hehe...but I tell myself hey it may smell good but my weight loss will look even better!!!! so that makes me turn away and stay on track......I have not cheated at all since being on this plan and its been hard at times but I have just made myself stick it out!!!! I no ur gonna do well just whatever happenes or no matter how much yum foods are in front of u DONT CHEAT AT ALL!!!! it will all pay off for u and u will be happy u didnt!!! also I was wondering why u only take the injections 6 days a week? I take mine every single day and dont skip at all...I even take mine during my Period and it stops me from gaining any weight at all.....cause usually im up a few pounds but I didnt gain anything this time with injections!!!! anyways I will stopp babbling Im just really happy for u and hope u do awesome and meet ur goal!!!!!! Taz TheToyMaker September 23rd, 2009, 02:10 PM Taz -- I hope somebody sends you that cookbook. I found mine in&quot;my documents&quot;but it&apos;s requiring a password to open it. I have no idea what the password is so mine must be damaged. I printed it out as soon as I got it and haven&apos;t tried to open it since then.

Somebody please send Taz the cookbook -- Her email address is a few posts up. thanks!


Nevermind -- I found the password! tazgirl31 September 23rd, 2009, 03:45 PM Taz -- I hope somebody sends you that cookbook.

Oh Thanx!!!! Im hoping to try some new foods or ideas as Im getting pretty burned out on the same things lol.....do u have any favorites u have tried yet? rokprincess September 23rd, 2009, 04:20 PM Taz... i sent you a pm, not sure if you got it or not about some info on the shots... i&apos;m so freakin&apos; courous now...lol SheilaK September 23rd, 2009, 06:27 PM Hi again!

rokprincess-I ordered my Hcg off the internet and gave them to myself. I ordered mine from alldaychemist it takes a few weeks to get so you have to be patient. I don&apos;t think giving the shots is hard, I was a little nervous at first. I was actually more wound up about mixing the Hcg correctly. I am in P3 now and wish I could just go right back to the VLCD (very low calorie diet) I am getting frustrated with P3, I can&apos;t seem to keep my weight stabilized.

hmhunter-I feel so bad that you are taking a break but sometimes you have to get into the correct frame of mind, it is a very difficult program to follow. Please stick around though, we will miss you.

Toy&amp;Taz-you are doing great keep up the good work! I wish i was losing with you!

punkmom- You are so tiny!! You look great! How many more pounds do you want to lose?

Don&apos;t want tol leave anyone out but am running out of time so good luck everyone! I am jealous of everyone who is losing I hope to join you soon. tazgirl31 September 23rd, 2009, 07:10 PM Taz... i sent you a pm, not sure if you got it or not about some info on the shots... i&apos;m so freakin&apos; courous now...lol

Im sorry I didnt even no I had a pm from u until now I will pm u with all the info that I think will help u!!! U will sure love this plan when u start dropping the weight which will happen right away!!!! Im amazed everyday how great it works!!!!!


SHEILAK::::
Im really worried about starting p3 also...cause I just dont see how it will be possible to keep my weight within a two pound range....its gonna be hard.....I mean if it keeps going up then we cant eat all day but a steak and tomato...thats gonna **** if I have to do that like every other day lol.....Im getting more and more nervous and I sure dont want to lose all this weight just to gain it back u no? sorry ur getting frustrated I would be too!!! I hope u can start stabilizing and get thro this phase so u can do another round if thats ur plans!!!! Good luck and keep us updated on how ur doing cause I have 20 days left and will be where u r now!!!! Taz corkaiasja09 September 23rd, 2009, 07:14 PM i would like the cookbook too plz!! man this food ****s!! im living off spinach and chicken. im about to grow feathers!!!! i am still losing though so that is good.

I no what u mean about living on chicken and spinach lol thats me to....Im gonna try the chicken salad receipe it sounds sooooooo goood!!!!!!!! Taz Lisathemommy September 23rd, 2009, 09:05 PM One of my friends at work did HCG, but she used drops that she put under her tongue each morning, and it went hand in hand with a very low calorie, strict diet. Also, it was only for 4 week increments. After 4 weeks, she lost 26 pounds. She said, the HCG helped her not to be hungry and helped target the weightloss to the areas she needed to lose the most, such as her stomach, thighs etc, instead of her face, which is where we tend to lose it first. She got this from a weightloss dr and it was very expensive, about $300 for four weeks. After the 4 weeks, she started taking Phentermine and has lost over 40 pounds now. SistaCyster September 23rd, 2009, 09:13 PM Newbie here (sort of).

I&apos;ve lurked a lot but I was too lazy to register. This HCG thing seems really intriguing, and I had 100 dollars to spare so I bought the supplies. Can someone please send the cookbook to Chibop6@aim.com? I really want to read up and be totally prepared before the supplies come. Has anyone lost 100 lbs using it?

Thanks!!:) rokprincess September 24th, 2009, 01:32 AM OK... I ordered it!! My friend is going to give me a box of her daughters needles(she has 15 boxes and goes through 1 every other month), not much of a loss, but she wants to see how I do on it. Anyone know where I can get the water? The place Taz sent me to does not have it and all the other sites it&apos;s like $20 with shipping...Also, I ordered it from Allchemist, but now I have gone and read through more post, seemd like people were having trouble with them.... Anybody had problems lately? TheToyMaker September 24th, 2009, 07:52 AM Morning! My loss for today is .5. It had to slow down sometime! I did walk for 40 minutes yesterday afternoon. Maybe the scales will show a bigger loss in the morning. However, a loss is a loss and .5 does make me happy.

Rokprincess -- I sent you a PM with a site for the water.

Gotta go! SistaCyster September 24th, 2009, 09:42 AM Rokprincess,

I ordered my supplies from allchem. I thought the water comes with the HCG, am I wrong???? Where should i buy the water? TheToyMaker September 24th, 2009, 10:17 AM SistaCyster -- there is some liquid that comes with the HCG but DO NOT use that to mix it. You need to get a container (usually 30ml) of bacteriostatic water to do the mixing.

Edited to say -- You will not use the entire contents of the 30ml of bacteriostatic water but once again, DO NOT use the liquid that comes with the HCG. tazgirl31 September 24th, 2009, 11:50 AM OK... I ordered it!! My friend is going to give me a box of her daughters needles(she has 15 boxes and goes through 1 every other month), not much of a loss, but she wants to see how I do on it.

Anybody had problems lately?

Oh wow researchsupply didnt have the water? I guess i WILL have to find another place to order more from now then to...Oh and alldaychemist I didnt really have any trouble with them they kept up with me thro emails and everything it just took like 15 days for me to get the HCG......Oh and I think the biggest thing that everyone went thro is that after a week or so u may get a email saying to send a check that ur payment didnt go thro but just ignore that I got the same thing but its nothing U will still get ur hcg and dont send another check!!! I dont no whats up with that but its really nothing....Also u can get the 31g syringes at walmart pharmacy with no prescripton all u do is tell the pharmist u need some insulin syringes 31g and they will get u a box of 100 for like 13$ I love these cause they are so small and dont hurt at all!!!!!!! Taz tazgirl31 September 24th, 2009, 11:58 AM Morning! My loss for today is .5. It had to slow down sometime! I did walk for 40 minutes yesterday afternoon.

Gotta go!

girl I no what u mean I was only down 3oz today:( and I walked 2.5miles last night and burned 377calories!! and skipped my lunch veggie and dinner fruit....so I think I over worked my body and thats the reason I had such a low loss...so Im just gonna walk maybe 30 mins a night and not go so fast and wear myself out!!! I always no when My weight loss is gonna be real low cause I dont have to run to the bathroom all night....and then the nites im up all night peeing I always lose good.....I always drink my same 2liters of water a day tho....but like u said A loss is a loss so I will be happy with it...at least it wasnt a 3oz gain right?! My body is all messed up Im even having a 2nd period now...ughhh Im so woried Im not gonna make my birthday goal now from all this....keepin my fingers crossed tho!!!! SistaCyster September 24th, 2009, 03:47 PM Thanks toymaker.

I just realized the water will be coming with the supply kit I ordered, not with the hcg. I want to get down to 235 on phen before I use the HCG. I really hope it works thought. I am sure I will lose weight on 500 cals a day but my anxiety is regarding hunger. I don&apos;t want to take the phen and HCG at the same time (I mean, what would be the point of using hcg). You all look great though!

Thanks for the response texasbeauty1982 September 24th, 2009, 04:02 PM The stranger is back! hehe ;) sorry..I know, Im always MIA but once u giys hear what I have been up to this past month then you&apos;ll know why I&apos;ve been MIA!

So, first things first, school is back in session..4 classes..I also received a phone call a few wks ago from my ex hubby that I have the kids with and...drum roll plz.....He has signed his rights over to me and now the kids live with me PERMANENTLY. YAY!! :) I couldnt be happier but I had to transfer them to my school district and move them in and yada yada yada so its been a difficult transition for me but a good one at that...Also, on the first real night that I got the kids back, my oldest ends up SPLITTING his chin wide open on his scooter and we end up in the ER all night getting stitches...wasnt fun...AND I had my annual Pap a few wks ago and I got bad news..My doc says I am at stage 2 abnormal cells so I have to have a choloscopy(sp?) done Oct 7 to see how bad and where it is so we can treat it if necessary or before it becomes worse...lovely hah?? ALLLL of this in the matter of a few wks....I think this is why I have been sick to my stomach and not sleeping lately...I need to go to my family doc and ask her for a chill pill or something cuz Im overly stressed!!!! AGH! lol :( But I guess you take the good with the bad right??

ANA-you are looking HAWT girl! keep it up

ASU-I have missed ur attitude ;) lol love the hair btw..

NC-well hello gorgeous :) how r u doing? staying strong??

everyone else, even though this page has really changed alot with who gets on here and what-not, I hope everyone is doing great! Keep it up! TheToyMaker September 24th, 2009, 08:21 PM Hey Tex, it&apos;s great to see you! Girl, you&apos;ve been having one tough time. I am glad you&apos;ve got your kids again. I know that made you really happy. Sorry to hear about the health problem. Keep us posted, ok?

I&apos;m still plugging along and trying really hard to stay focused. I&apos;m only taking 2 classes so I can only imagine how busy you are with four!

Drop in to see us again! NCGreenEyes September 25th, 2009, 12:45 AM Hey all - sorry for being MIA again for a little bit....things have been crazy and the beginning of the week was *really* tough for me. Tuesday was what would have been my husband&amp;my 2 yr wedding anniversary....my mom took me shopping to take my mind off it, but of course *he* could not leave me alone that day...so it was rough. He&apos;s kinda been like that to me all week, and I&apos;m about to lose my mind. On a better note though, I looked at a house last night that is AWESOME and made an offer today...drum roll please....and got it signed, accepted and sent back within 30 min from when my agent sent it to them - for $12,000 less than asking!!! So I am moving in pretty much a month - WOOHOO!!!! I&apos;m so ready!!!

Nehoo....diet wise been a little rough - I really have done bad this month but I&apos;m still losing inches so I guess even though my weight loss is kinda eh, at least the inches are still going bye-bye. I am really going to make myself crack down now tho...just wish TOM would hurry up so my weight quits fluctuating.

Tex - I&apos;ve missed you girl! It sounds like you have had such a tough month, although I&apos;m so very happy for you that you&apos;ve got your kids permenantly now!!! I will keep you in my thoughts for your health...I hope it turns out okay - keep us posted.

hmhuntr - Sorry to hear you are taking a break, but you know what you need better than anyone else. We&apos;ll be here when you need us, and I am sure you will rock the diet after a little break.

Everyone else - I&apos;m too lazy to go back and comment on everyone, but I hope you are losing well and staying stronger than I have been...sorry for the long post btw!! TheToyMaker September 25th, 2009, 08:59 AM Good Morning! I am down another .6 today so that&apos;s good. At least I&apos;m going in the right direction. That&apos;s 6.5 since Monday and it&apos;s only Friday!

NCGreenEyes, congratulations on the new house. That&apos;s so exciting. Now get to packing!

I hope everyone has a great Friday! PunkMOM September 25th, 2009, 11:27 AM Hi ladies. Well after I posted Monday night I started feeling yucky!! My baby also developed a runny nose and since it hasn&apos;t gone away I&apos;m taking him to the doctor this afternoon. We went to the mall with my best friend Monday and her son. She ended up taking him to the ER Wednesday night and he has pneumonia. I have had a horrible week. I have not stuck to the plan and I think that my Hucog was a BAD batch. I have been starving and usually when I am not feeling good I have no appetite. My Lupi came in so I am mixing it up today and hope it will work better.

I am exactly where I started and I am thankful that I am not higher. I did realize that I should be starting TOM either tomorrow or Sunday so that doesn&apos;t help matters.

hmhuntr - Sorry to hear about your stopping this round. That is EXACTLY what happened to me my second round. I just couldn&apos;t do it. I took a week or so off and then started back. I had to get my head in the game so to speak. I look forward to seeing you post and keeping us updated.

Toy - CONGRATZ on your losses. It does make it easier when you see the results from HCG. That was always an issue before with me. I am an instant gratification type person. I didn&apos;t want to wait a week to see only a pound or two loss. lol

ms750 - Oh let me clarify what I meant by lower doses and cheats. What I meant to say was that the less HCG you have in your system the less a cheat might make you gain. I don&apos;t know that it would have anything to do with cravings. I think that once a person gets their perfect dosage that should help with cravings and the first week is always really rough.

taz - I am glad that 175 works for you. Everyone is different. Some need the 250 and I do much better with my lower dosage. I do think the lower the dosage the harder it might be to stabilize. I think toward the end of this round I might increase to 175 for about a week to ten days.

Sheila - Thanks for the compliments. I finally don&apos;t hate the pictures I am in. How is P3 going now? It is hard to stay exactly within 2 lbs that is for sure.

Lisa - I am a member at another HCG board on yahoo groups. There have been many people who have had success using sublingual HCG. Do a google search for it and you can find loads of information.

texas - WELCOME BACK!! So good to hear about your kids I know that must make your heart feel complete. I hope everything goes good with your doctors appt. Definitely keep us updated and I will keep you in my thoughts!!

NC - ohhhh awesome news about the house. I remember how excited we were when we finally closed on our house!!! Owning a home is a wonderful sense of achievement!! I bet your ex is really kicking himself in the *** now lol. You look amazing. rokprincess September 25th, 2009, 12:47 PM Taz... THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU... I have ordered everything and my friend is so stoked about doing this, allthough not so much so about the diet. I told her it will be easier since we have each other...lol!!!! Anyway, everyone keep up the good work!!!!

Taz tazgirl31 September 25th, 2009, 03:03 PM Punkmom:::::
I love ur profile picture u r sooooo pretty!!!!! Im happy u are to the point of loving ur pics and being happy with them now...I used to hate my pics taken also but its getting alot better now!!! Its a nice feeling!! Yea Im happy I went with the 175 I was going to start the 250 but then chickened out the last min worried I may get to immuned to it or something.....but I have heard of alot of people doing the 250 on other hcg sites Im on!!! I think u will be pleased with the 175 if u do it towards the end....I dont get hungry or anything and ever since I been on this HCG its like it has given me so much energy and I cant even sleep at night now.....do u have that problem? lol....maybe its just me Idk!!!! Changeling September 26th, 2009, 11:06 AM Hi everybody!
Totally new at all this - ordered my hcg online (5000&amp;2000), my water, got the needles - couple questions now....do I need the empty vials that are part of a kit that&apos;s sold? Also, could someone send me this cookbook that I have seen passed around on here? email is lady_ray97@yahoo.com
So most people do the 175iu? If you do less/more, does it not work as well/better? How close are most of you to the original protocol? Is the first week really that hard? Any adverse reactions at the injection site? Where do you suggest injecting for least pain? I am a total baby when it comes to needles, btw.....
I am pretty excited to start this after reading all the success stories on here!
Thanks in advance for any and all replies! Changeling September 26th, 2009, 11:07 AM Sorry for all the questions up there! (Just realized that was quite a bit!) PunkMOM September 26th, 2009, 11:52 AM Good afternoon ladies!! Not sure how but I did lose a little weight this morning. I ate soup and a sandwich yesterday that were NOT on protocol. I did mix up my lupi and am using it now. I have eczema and I have noticed while on the HCG it gets really really bad on my hands. I can barely even bend the fingers on my left hand and I can&apos;t use cortisone. I did buy some Gold Bond anti itch cream which seems to help and hasn&apos;t messed with the diet so far. I can deal with it though since all the weight loss makes it worth it lol.


Changeling - As for the dose I think most do 175 with total success. I do a little less but that is just because I have done a few rounds and it seems to work for me. The first week is hard...I&apos;m not gonna lie to you. It is definitely a &apos;mind over matter&apos; time. I never realized how much eating and cravings are in your head and almost like an addiction. It got better as time went on though. The shots are totally painless. I am not a fan of needles...at all but I haven&apos;t had problems with this. The needles are very thin and if you grab the tummy fat inject the needle then release the fat inject the hcg and remove the needle it&apos;s very quick. The more you vary off of the original protocol the less success you will have. It is also harder to stabilize if you don&apos;t follow the plan. I think we have all had a bad day and given into a craving but not enough to call it a failure. You have to have your mind into it.

Oh wow...I have a very sad baby. He has a runny nose and is teething. I have to go snuggle him. Poor little guy.

Hope you all have a great weekend. RolliePollie September 26th, 2009, 11:56 AM Can someone please send me a copy of the cookbook too please? chrissvan26@yahoo.com. Thanks! tazgirl31 September 26th, 2009, 05:32 PM OMG I was soooo happy today I am finally out of the ninetys:) I weighed in at 189 this morning!!!!! was sure a big surprise for me:) I REALLLY think Im gonna meet my birthday goal just around 9 pounds to go wooohoo!!!!! It seems like I have my good days and my bad but Long as I keep on going even on my bad days I always seem to amaze myself!!!! Looks like we have lots of newbies!!! Thats awesome!!!! welcome and I cant wait to hear all about ur success!!!!!!! So far I have lost like 21 pounds in 27 days!!! Would have been more but My tom messed me up some, but Im still pleased with this amount of weight lost!! I could have never lost this much on any other plan!!!!! Well off to clean a huge dental office......good luck to everyone and hears to losing big!!!!!!!!!! Taz hmhuntr September 28th, 2009, 12:05 AM taz- I know you were doing backflips when you saw the 180&apos;s! What a wonderful early birthday present to give yourself.

Punk- That is a SUPER cute picture in your avatar! Love Love Love it! Thanks for the kind words.

NC- Congrats on the house. I agree with the others; I bet your ex is kicking himself right about now....as well he SHOULD be!

Tex- I thought you fell off the face of the Earth girly! Sorry to hear about all of the crazy surrounding you but I&apos;m SO glad you were able to get the whole apt thing worked out a few months ago cause you def needed the space after all. How&apos;s school going for you?

I could kick myself right now because i would be close to finished with this round if I hadn&apos;t given up. Thursday is hubby&apos;s last injection. He is doing freakin&apos; amazing! As of this morning he was 274 lbs! His goal is to be 269 on Thursday and I totally think he can do it! He has lost a little over 50 lbs and 31 inches total. His clothes are starting to hang on him. He said after the first of the year he wants to do another round. That way he&apos;s not trying to do the protocol around all the holidays. I have been eating everything that doesn&apos;t bite me first. Honestly i think some of it is just trying to stay awake. I seem to eat more when I&apos;m tired. I just wanted to check in and say that everyone is doing really great. To all of the newbies....it&apos;s worth it! It&apos;s hard at times but the results are phenominal! Let&apos;s see some update pics all you ladies that have started new rounds!!!
