Arek Sarkissian II/Savannah Morning News Advertisement By Savannah Morning News , Savannah Morning News Emergency-oriented couple aid injured cyclist on Ogeechee Road Savannah Morning News Savannah Morning News August 15, 2010 6:19 AM EDT Copyright 2012 Savannah Now.

Kevin Tomko and his wife were heading to pick up some medicine before embarking on vacation when an event that defines their professional purpose unfolded before them.

About 1 p.m. Saturday, an unidentified man on a bicycle merged from the edge of the right lane to the left lane on Ogeechee Road just west of Chatham Parkway and was struck by a Toyota Avalon.

&quot;We slowed down because he started to truck toward the middle of the road - it looks like the lady didn&apos;t see him,&quot; Tomko said of the cyclist and the Totyota&apos;s driver. &quot;She didn&apos;t see him until he hit the windshield.&quot;

Tomko said that&apos;s when he and his wife, Dana, sprang into action. Kevin Tomko is a captain who commands an engine company with Savannah Fire&amp;Emergency Services, and Dana Tomko is an emergency nurse with Memorial University Medical Center.

&quot;What we&apos;re trained to do is give a quick assessment of the situation, and he had an extensive number of injuries,&quot; Kevin Tomko said of the cyclist. &quot;It was just an unfortunate situation.&quot;

Tomko said he and his wife administered first aid to the victim until Southside Fire/EMS paramedics arrived moments later to relay the man to Memorial. As of Saturday night, he was listed in critical condition, said Gena Moore, metro police spokeswoman.

Moore said the collision closed Ogeechee Road until about 4 p.m., when Sgt. Tony Gallo allowed one lane of the busy, four-lane highway to partially reopen. Meanwhile, members of Gallo&apos;s metro police accident investigations team took measurements and gathered witness statements. The mangled bike involved in the wreck was seen in the left turn lane of the highway, not far from a shoe and hat that lay in a westbound lane.

Michael V. Jones said his 63-year-old mother was driving the Toyota west to pick up some things for a family outing when the cyclist&apos;s body slammed against her windshield.

&quot;She&apos;s pretty shaken up, but she&apos;s doing better,&quot; Jones said of his mother. &quot;She&apos;s saying he came out of nowhere.&quot;

Tomko said he was impressed by Southside medics&apos; response. Of course, he also praised his wife.

&quot;Well, I didn&apos;t have my jump bag, and I don&apos;t think she is used to working in the field like that,&quot; Tomko said. &quot;I don&apos;t think the level of care could have gotten any better.&quot;

 

 Out-of-control pickup closes West Chatham KFC 

A West Chatham KFC remained closed Saturday night after a pickup slammed into its gas meter and ignited a scorching fire, according to Savannah Fire&amp;Emergency Services.

About 2 a.m. Saturday, Savannah firefighters were called to the fast-food restaurant near the intersection of Chatham Parkway and Ogeechee Road after getting reports of a wayward Chevrolet pickup that hit a gas meter and caught fire. Crews arrived moments later to find the pickup and south side of the building charred by flames from the wildly spraying natural gas, said Mark Keller, Savannah Fire spokesman.

He said it appeared the driver of the pickup took off on foot before help could arrive. Tire marks and mangled branches led firefighters to believe the vehicle somehow left Chatham Parkway before hitting the gas line just behind the restaurant&apos;s drive-through menu board.

Firefighters appeared to have extinguished the flames but kept pouring water on the fractured pipe and toasted pickup until gas crews were able to shut off the spewing vapor at 3:40 a.m.

It was unknown Saturday night when the restaurant would reopen.
