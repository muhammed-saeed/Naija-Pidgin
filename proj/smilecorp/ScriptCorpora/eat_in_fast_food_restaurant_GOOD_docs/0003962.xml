 Ive had my berries for 3 years now and have had limited success. This year I decided I was going to do something about it so I had a soil sample done by the state extension office. Of course, the results came back saying my ph was too high, at 5.9 among other things. I had a long discussion with someone in the extension office and received some specific instructions on what and how much of various additives to make a &quot;cocktail&quot; for my bushes. The ingredients were 2 1/4 cups of alum. sulfate, 4tbsp 10-10-10 and 6tbsp of ammoniam sulfate 34-0-0. WEll the local feed and seed had all but the ammoniam sulfate. The guy working said they didnt have that but did have calcium nitrate which if I doubled it would be the same as the 34-0-0. So I substituted and put out my fertilizer cocktail yesterday. Last night I just happened to be surfing some blueberry websites and noticed one that said do not put calcium nitrate on blueberries. Then I saw another ect ect. I never saw an explanation as to why nor did I see what would happen if I did, so Im asking you guys, did I just kill my dozen blueberry bushes that Ive been growing for 3 years????? Thanks for your help!

 Bluberries need the nitrogen, but cannot obtain the nitrogen they need from most nitrate based fertilizers. The ammonium sulfate was the right fertilizer for your blueberries. You may not have killed them, but definitely do not continue using the fertilizer &quot;cocktail&quot; that was created. Only time will tell if you really did damage to your plants.

 Ammonium sulfate is 21-0-0 not 34-0-0. Someone misunderstood somewhere. 21-0-0 is a very good blueberry fertilizer in small amounts applied about every 2-4 weeks until you get the growth you want. Then cut back to maintain moderate growth.
For long term lowering of pH, elemental sulfur is much preferred over Aluminum sulfate. So right now I&apos;d apply about one cup of sulfur and the 4-6 tbsp of 21-0-0 around each bush. Water it all in good.

 fruitnut he already fertilized heavily with calcium nitrate which in all likelihood will kill his blueberries. If anything he should water, water and water some more to try to wash it out. At this point I don&apos;t think hitting them with more fertilizer is going to help no matter what kind it is. After all he just hit them yesterday with 34-0-0. Hitting them the next day with another 21-0-0 would very likely burn them. The sulfur is not going to hurt and may help to maintain the PH after a heavy watering.
If they were mine I would try like mad to wash out the calcium nitrate. I would wait on more fertilizer until after I had watered them half to death. Then I would add a sprinkling of granulated sulfur and mulch with Sphagnum Peat Moss and fertilize over that.
When I say water them half to death I mean just that as it really is their only chance as a high dose of calcium nitrate is almost always fatal to blueberries. I added less than a forth that much to my blueberries and lost them all three years ago. I did a lot of research before buying and planting again this year.

 Thanks guys, I was afraid of that. Ive got some fairly recent thick mulch on them. I suppose the only hope I have is that the water dilutes and washes out the nitrate. This is just an unbelievable situation.

 One other thing....how long have I got? How long should it take for the nitrate to kill the blueberries? And if by some strange reason it doesnt kill them, how long before I know if they survived? Ive got my underground hose running on them now and I suppose I will leave it running all night.

 HD/big box stores had the &quot;missing&quot; fert you were looking for -- at least they do in my area (Central CA).
At this time of year, at my local stores, they have huge stacks of them moved near the doorway, here is what they carry: It&apos;s Shultz Super 21-0-0.

 Also HD carries the sulfur, at mine it&apos;s this: Espoma Soil Sulfur 
It takes a while (like 50 days) to fully lower the pH.

 Calcium nitrate in reasonable fertilizer amounts is not toxic to blueberries. They just prefer ammonium (or urea) forms of nitrogen. Years ago people gave their blueberries a postharvest nitrogen boost with &quot;bulldog soda&quot; (sodium nitrate) which is harsher than calcium nitrate.
It&apos;s too late now, but very light watering would probably have been better in order to allow the nitrate to be used by bacteria in the mulch. It would slowly leach out later in useful manner.

 If the leaves are not browning and crisping up within 3-4 days you should be ok. If they start dying off in the next few days though then they may not make it. They will probably suffer some from the over watering but its really your only chance of saving them. I always come here for advice as there are a lot of experts I respect. The blueberries I lost were in pots and I did not realize what I had done until after they were dead. With a little luck your results will be better than mine were. So glad I have my blueberries dialed in now. Live and learn.

 Agreed, water as much as you can without drowning the plants. If you have a heavy clay soil, you may want to dig some drainage areas so that the fertilizer can leach out. All are correct, it your plants can survive the next few weeks, you might be OK. Granulated sulfur definelty will not hurt at this point and may actually help. Good luck...

 Well, I&apos;m with gonebananas, I doubt that nitrate is that toxic. After all nitrate is produced by soil bacteria all the time. If you apply ammonium, it is converted to nitrate by soil bacteria within a week. So I don&apos;t think these blueberries will die. Do it right from now on and you should be OK.
Blueberries are very sensitive to too much salty fertilizer at one time. You can kill a plant by applying too much 21-0-0 at one time. So apply any fertilizer in small doses and water well.

 Well I lost four big 4-5&apos; tall blueberry bushes after applying calcium nitrate three years ago. I have heard other members here say the same in past threads. Not to mention every university site I have read says avoid it and there is a reason.

 Thisisme:
I&apos;m not discounting your experience. I have experience killing blueberries as well. Also I&apos;ve burned back the leaves more than once, shoot more than several times. Sure you want to avoid nitrate, especially calcium nitrate. It raises the pH, not what you want. It adds calcium, not what you want. Eight of the first 12 blueberries I planted died and it wasn&apos;t from nitrate. I&apos;ve burned the leaves on others with ammonium sulfate and other acid fertilizer.
I can&apos;t remember anyone saying their blueberries died of nitrate. Also I&apos;d be interested in reading any research on the subject.
You may well be right so if you can educate me and others with further info that would be greatly appreciated. I appreciate your input here and elsewhere. Keep it coming.

 Did some quick research and there are a lot of people saying that nitrate may kill your blueberries. The most specific information said that on certain soil types, nitrate can be very damaging to the plant. I&apos;m wondering if this means low organic matter soil or what? Does anyone have more specific information on this?

 Purdue: Nitrate can be occasionally damaging to blueberries.
Univ of Georgia: Ammonium nitrate is OK as fertilizer if total applied nitrogen is less than 20 lbs per acre.
Oregon: Blues recieving nitrate preformed poorly compared to ammonium (said nothing about plants dying). Blues lack the ability to take up nitrate and can not convert it to a usable form. Ammonium sulfate is best if soil pH is above 5 because it lowers pH more than Urea. Use urea if pH is below 4.5 as it lowers pH less.
Miss St Univ: Nitrate can be toxic on certain soil types but didn&apos;t specify.
Overall my sense is that nitrate is not good and can occasionally be toxic at high rates. But it&apos;s not a certain death sentence. I suspect this persons plants will be fine esp with watering and if the soil drains well.

 fruitnut I guess there is no need for me to look any up since you now say can kill. Most of what I have read says sever damage and may kill. Sever is not mild or moderate. Sever is the last level of damage before kill. He did not give them a light dose either which is my reason for concern. Most of the time with blueberries I fertilize at 1/4 strength. He used the worst kind at 34-0-0 so water, water and water and they may make it.
I studied like mad before investing in blueberries again. Those four big plants I killed three years ago cost me a mint.

 Could you scrape away a layer of soil with the nitrate fertilizer in it, if you can see where the granules are? That could lessen the damage (if any will be caused) somewhat.

 fruitnut just going from memory here but ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate are two different things. They have much different absorption rates and nitrogen conversion rates. One is ok in small amounts and the other is not and the one that is not is calcium nitrate. I know its easy to confuse the two because we are talking about nitrate and nitrogen when discussing both but they are not the same thing and can&apos;t be used interchangeably when it comes to blueberries.

 I agree with all the negatives about using nitrate-based fertilizers on blueberries. However, just a quick note about your 5.9 PH level. Blueberry plants like iron and they have found iron moves best when the PH is between 4.8 and 5.2. That&apos;s one big reason why blueberries need the lower PH. My field is naturally 5.4, but the well water I use is rated at 10 which causes the soil PH to rise over 6. I add sulfur every year to try to keep it down, but I also add a tablespoon of iron chelate around each plant every other year just to make sure my now 4 year old blueberry plants get the iron they need.

 &gt;&gt; ThisisMe: The blueberries I lost were in pots and I did not realize what I had done until after they were dead
If these are the four plants you lost in experience due to the CalcNit that makes a lot more sense. The rate of absorption and availability of Nit to the blues is typically different than in containers.

 All nitrates are soluble, possibly the foremost thing I remember from schoolboy chemistry. Nitrates being the most soluble of solvents or something. Another thing I&apos;d certainly remember is not to put the alkaline Calcium on acid loving plants. Instinctively now I&apos;d try to flush with soft, preferably vinegar laced water. I think 1 tablespoon of vinegar per gallon would be a good amount though it&apos;s worth you looking up the correct ammount people use for generally watering blueberrieswith tap water. Addition of sulphur to th top soil and watered in can only be a good thing afterwards but if my plants showed signs of being seriously affected, I&apos;d probably even uproot, rinse and replant them in wet peat in the hope they&apos;d recover.
Anyway, hope you get to save the blueberries.

 I am waiting for blueberries to arrive from Miller&apos;s Nursery and am planning on planting them in raised beds in a sunny field. Can anyone tell me exactly what I should use for a soil? I am having a soil test done but would assume that the ph is going to be too high. I am in MN.

 tarainmn when growing in native soil its recommended that you prepare the soil a year ahead of planting. In a raised bed I think you will be ok though. I grow in 15 gallon pots because its easier to control the PH in an enclosed environment. I have no experience growing blueberries in raised beds. However since you don&apos;t have a year to prep the soil. If your PH is not low enough I think I would go with a mix in the raised beds similar to what is use when planing in pots. There are others who have planted in raised beds though so their advice may be of more value.
MY BLUEBERRY SOIL MIX
1 Part Perilite.
1 Part Potting Soil.
2 Parts Small Pathway Pine Bark.
2 Parts Sphagnum Peat Moss.
1 Tablespoon Cotton Meal per gallon.
1 Teaspoon Granulated Garden Sulfur per gallon. Could be more if the pot is small but mine are in 15 gallon pots..
1 Tablespoon Granulated Ironite per gallon.
1 Tablespoon Down To Earth All Natural Fertilizers 4-3-6 Acid Mix per gallon.
After they start leafing out I fertilize every 2-3 weeks with Miracid For Acid Loving Plants at about 50% of the recommended dose. I give them a small drink of water just before and just after I fertilize.

The plants are nice and healthy growing well and producing fruit so I guess they must be happy.

 I don&apos;t know if calcium nitrate will kill your blueberries, because I have never used this fertilizer on our blueberry patch. However, I do know, from years of experience, that 6 fluid ounces of 5% vinegar(grocery store standard) mixed in with 4 gallons of tap water will gently and safely lower soil pH. The effect is immediate. I also use agricultural sulfur to lower soil pH, but an application of sulfur takes 6 months to 2 years to become effective. In your situation, I would be watching the color and condition of the leaves, and I would be using water mixed with vinegar to lower pH, at the first sign of yellow and/or pale leaves.

 Just thought Id provide an update. Ive anxiously walked out each morning to check my blueberries worried that I would see them drooping and yellowing. Thankfully I am happy to report that they appear to be fine. I have no idea if Im out of the woods yet or not, but a few indicated that if I was going to have problems, it would begin to show in just a matter of a few days. Its almost been a week since the nitrate fiasco with no ill effects so far. Thanks for the advice on how to handle. Hopefully the flushing has flushed out the bad stuff! Am I out of the woods?

Thanks for the update and glad to hear your plants look good. My guess is you are past any danger, in fact, I&apos;d be amazed if there were a serious delayed effect.
You are probably weary of advice right now but I&apos;ll give a little anyhow. If I had your situation, I&apos;d use sulfur for long term lowering and maintenance of pH. Also apply 21-0-0 in small doses to get as much growth as needed.
Good luck!!

 Before I start let me say that I have mainly just grown daylilies for the past 20+ years and have never been interested in growing blueberries or other berries until the past couple of years...That said, I didn&apos;t know the first thing about the growing and maintaining of blueberries. As I learned more I knew that I had the perfect plot of land for the new fruit field. It is 3.5 acres and has a nice gentle slope with a north-south orientation, which I found out was good for water and air drainage..The field had been corn ground for years and with a healthy dose of lime annually added the ph was in the 6.5-7.0 range..I had the field disced and planted it with KY-31 fescue 2 years prior to planting..A year before planting I laid out the field into 4&apos; wide rows with 8&apos; spacing between them. Now these rows are 380&apos; long so getting them straight was the hardest part..I used tall posts and string and let the string lay just above the ground and then drop my mower deck all the way down and mowed the strip following the string and wallahh..Nicee perfectly straight rows about 50&quot; wide which was close enough to 4&apos; for me. Then I would just measure over 8&apos; on each end, move my post and string and repeat all the way across the field..The hardest part was getting the first row straight..So I measured from the centerline of our road to line it up so it would at least be constant with something..After this was done across the whole field, I then sprayed the strips with roundup as It was easy to see because of them being mowed short..I then spent an entire year tilling and spraying, over and over AND OVER, until nothing else was coming up..I onlt tilled the top 6&quot; of soil as the holes for the blueberry plants would be drilled later..We received all of our 6 month old cutting starts of various blueberry plants in April and potted them up in a 50% peat and 50% double ground pine bark nuggets. At the same time I applied some Tiger brand elemental sulphur the the tilled strips where the plants would be planted..There was a simple formula to follow to figure application rate to change a known Ph, to a desired Ph. I used a pull behind spreader and it worked perfectly..I will caution that when using any sulfur products to protect your face and eyes and use a dust mask..Also only apply on a dead calm day..Remember this stuff when reacting with sweaty skin produces sulfuric acid and even in very small exposures is very painfull..Take my advice please..Ok so back to the plants...I had 1,000 blueberry plants in 3 gallon pots which were watered daily..The next thing I needed to figure out was what type of fertilizer to use..I like most of you in this forum, had read countless posts to this question, and was very confused on what to get..Then my miracle happened..I met the people at Florikan. Afetr discussing my needs for the plants they came up with a formula for me that to say the least works 10,000% better than anything I have ever heard about blueberry plants being able to do. Again there was a simple formula on the bag for a certain pot size and application rate..There was formula&apos;s for in ground plants as well.I used their nutricote 3 stage fertilizer and just applied it around each plant in the pot, using a small measuring cup which I attached to a stick and just dipped out that amount each time from a 1 gallon bucket. No bending over or anything this way...And very precise..Afetr they were fertilized, all I did was water them..EVERY DAY....Remember they were in peat and pine bark so ph was never an issue all summer long..One less worry..In the mean time my field was going througha metamorphosis from being an alkaline soil to acidic..One thing I forgot to mention is that after I applied the sulfur I did till it in very lightly only just to mix it in and get the process going..One other thing I should also mention is that you should always apply elemental sulfur in the spring as it works better as the ground warm instead of in the fall as the ground cools..Anyway, back to the plants..The first few weeks of April I didn&apos;t notice any change much, but as temps hit the 70s they started growing like crazy. I had always been told that Blueberry plants are slow growing and it take at least 4-5 years before a respectable crop is harvested..So that&apos;s the mindset I went into this with..Just to be a long term investment with no real return for a few years..I&apos;m going to try and shorten up this post a bit and jump forward on the growth..By the end of the summer I had pruned the plants 3 times each time taking about 12-18&quot; off. By the time they had stopped growing they were in the 5-6&apos; range...YES 5-6 FEET!!! And I&apos;m not talking little spindly growth..These darned things had 8-10 new shoots from the base and all were branched like a tree by the time I had pruned 3 times. We even got several berries off them to get a taste of the different varieties which was a treat. I cannot say enough about all the folks over at Florikan. You will not find a more helpful group anywhere in the industry..Later in the summer I had to get some other varieties from another vendor that grew them out at there farm..These were varieties that I just couldn&apos;t get from the first grower. When I went to pick them up in person, I was tunned to learn that these 12-18&quot; plants I was picking up were 2-3 years old..Don&apos;t get me wrong, they are nice healthy plants, but jeeze I pruned more in one pruning than these plants were tall. By the way, that grower now uses Florikan on his plants. We drilled all the holes with a 12&quot; 2 man auger over the coarse of a few days, and got all the plants in the ground by the end of Oct. My last concern with the plants was with so much new tender growth would they harden off before winter and would there be any tip burn and die off due to the new growth not hardening..We had a very cold winter this past season and now all the berries are blooming and I am happy to say that out of 1,000 bushes we only lost about 1 dozen plants and as far as winter damage due to new growth, near 0 problems with tip burn or die off...I walked the rows today and I was able to stare in amazement as I saw plants that are a deep green color in the leaves and OMG at the blooms..Remember, these were 6 month cutting only 10-15&quot; tall when we got them. Here we are exactly a year later and I have a field full of plants that are putting on growth again and are literally COVERED in blooms...I mean covered...I did some quick samples and I am getting between 16-20 blooms per cluster..with and avearge of around 40-50 clusters per plant.When I did the math and figured what the potential pounds per bush will be, I came out to around 5,500 pounds this year. That is even factoring in about 25% loss from where I stand now. So at 2.00 dollars or so per pound u-pick that comes out to 11,000 dollars this season.ONE YEAR after planting in pots...Blueberries do not have to be over complicated..I have now learned that there are 3 things that blueberries need for sucess like this. #1- PH...If your PH is not correct then your wasting your time..Before I planted last fall the elemental sulfur lowered it down from 6-7 to 4.8. You have to have correct ph if you expect your plants to grow and thrive like mine have...I learned an aweful lot from the Florikan folks about ph and blueberry plants and they open me up to the reality of how it all works..The only credit I will give myself is that I listened to people who were the experts...There the ones that deserb=ve the real credit...#2 would be water...If you are growing them out in pots or in the ground then make sure they always have water..I watered EVERY day all summer..I now am getting ready tolay down irragation lines before long in the field to supply the water needed to sustain the growth I am use to. #3 would of course be choosing the right fertizer..Florikan has that down to a science..Without getting into all of that gain I will just say that if you are ready to suceed at blueberries, give them a call. I will post pics on my site sometime over the summer of all of the growth and everything I have been talking about..If a pic is worth a thousand words, then these should be worth millons...That is it for the main 3 ingrediants for sucess for me anyway...There are many other things to consider like what plants to get, who to get them from and so on, but thoise are your decisions..I had to get plants that would do well for me..I planted 13 varieties and planted them from right left across the field in ripening order so that there is a steady progression or picking across it. I also at the same time put in Blackberry and raspberry plants..They were too potted up and treated the same way, except for there potting mix was a bit different...More like what I pot up my daylilies in. I used Florikan on them as well and had the same exciting results..I should have close to 10,000 pounds of black and raspberries this year from them as well. Again thanks maily to Florikan fertilizers...One thing about the 3 stage I will tell you is just the basics..The first stage starts releasing at 72 degrees, so you can apply it early in the spring while you have some down time...It will just lay there until the weather hits 72...Rain and time have nothing to do with it...Once that stage is released then the clock starts ticking and the next stage will realease at a determined time from the start of the process..The last stage releases slowly in the late summer/early fall to help them harden off..which I can now attest worked beautifully...We are also one of 2 growers only of the Japanese Haskap. These are true haskap from the japanese islands and mainland that Maxine Thompson collect seeds from many years ago..Although the Canadians are realy pushing what they are calling Haskap, they are derived from more Russian cultivars that people in the lower 48 are not going to be happy with because the climate is just not right for them like the japanese varieties are..I&apos;ll get into all that on my site or this is going to turn into a novel..I hope this help to provide so info for people interested in blueberries without complicating it too much..Blueberry plant can be and are very easy to grow, you just need to get the righ info from the right peole and take your time in preparing your area..I so thankful the good Lord gave me ears to listen with, and even though I tend to talk alot, the ability to shut up so I can hear what people are telling me..Many sucesses....David.

 First of all, you guys have to realize that university recs are based on commercial production and these gurus are ignorant about plants grown in home orchard situations. This is disturbing because it leaves you with having to listen to anecdotal observations and also relying on your own eyes.
How many times on this forum have I stated that I&apos;ve seen plenty of very productive and healthy blueberry plants growing in soils with a pH in the mid 6&apos;s.
Mulch makes iron available to blueberries at much higher pH than the literature will ever say because no one is going to do the research. Mulching is just too expensive when you are growing 100 acres of blueberries. The gov doesn&apos;t fund research to help home growers succeed (and I&apos;m not saying they should).
The universities try to be helpful by dispensing info based on commercial production and it is useful but not to be taken absolutely.
I suspect the reason mulched plants can get iron is because acids released during the decomposition of the mulch frees it up, at least on a shallow layer below the mulch where ample feeder roots can suck it up. Research by Whitcomb has shown that only a fraction of the root zone needs to have available iron to serve acid loving plants adequately.
The only reason I know of that N. fertilizer would be harmful to blueberries is the damage done to their shallow delicate roots when applied in excess. Ammonium N. may be the form that blueberries can absorb but it would be as likely to burn roots as calcium N. IMO when used in similar quantities.
I fertilize my blues with my own urine when their leaves start to turn in the fall. They do great. I have some other plants that I only mulch and spare the urine and they also do great.
If soil has a lot of organic matter and plants are mulched and watered they shouldn&apos;t need much supplementary fertilization. Most blueberries that fail have been allowed to dry out during the growing season- they are very hard to keep adequately watered when they are establishing. One drought during the season can stunt them.

 I fertilize my blueberries mainly with cottonseed meal, bought relatively inexpensively in big bags at a feed and seed store. It is slow release, organic, and acidic in nature. New plants that recently were potted (say a few weeks before) are given a starting boost of Miracid diluted to a bit from full-strength and with the potting soil already wet. Very occasionally if I want darker leaves I might spray with Miracid or with iron (sulfate or chelated, whatever I have around). Even more rarely, after thick mulching I might toss a little regular fertilizer atop the mulch. This is more fertilizing the bacteria decomposing the mulch than the blueberries, at least right away, but the blueberries eventually get the nutrients and via an organic route (at least for the N).

 David:
You bring up some interesting points I&apos;ll comment on. But first I have to say man that was tough reading. I hope you aren&apos;t offended but can&apos;t you see how much more readable Harvestman&apos;s comments are when broken into paragraphs? So forgive me, I&apos;m glad you posted, but I think you lost most readers before they started.
Blueberries like most fruits can be kicked into rampant vegetative growth if given enough water and fertilizer. I don&apos;t doubt that your plants grew 6-8 ft in one year. But here&apos;s the deal, if you do that this year you&apos;ll have big beautiful berries that have no taste. They&apos;ll be 90% water and won&apos;t store worth a lick so sell them quickly.
With a you-pick operation you need fruit eating quality above all else. So my advice would be to slow your plants down to about 18 inches growth this year. Your customers will thank you.

Hey man, hope I wasn&apos;t too hard on you. I did enjoy your post and hope you will report back. I&apos;m purposely holding back on both water and fertilizer on my potted blueberries. If I push either, the eating quality suffers.
You could reduce the irrigation and not apply any more fertilizer until they slow down. Actually 18 inches growth on bearing plants is quite a bit. Twelve inches would be plenty.
Good luck and post back later!!

 My problem with the report on miracle blueberry establishment is that it simply doesn&apos;t sound credible. This is a one person endorsement who&apos;s credibility always has to be suspect on the internet. What he is saying is that a company has come up with a miraculous formula that they aren&apos;t sharing with the major agricultural universities in this country. Commercial producers could save millions of dollars around the country if such a method was known to them.
The company in question would have no difficulty in publicizing such unprecedented success and their method and materials would be used by every commercial grower the moment the word got out and it would get out like the water held by a collapsed dam.
I&apos;d love to believe this story, and I hope a regular contributor here tries it out and reports back, but the results given sound like snake oil to me. If I&apos;m wrong, I&apos;ll gladly eat crow.
Just trying to keep it real,

 Alan:
It does sound credible to me. If one applies enough fertilizer and waters every day plants can move into a growth phase that maybe some haven&apos;t seen. Plant growth goes wild. I&apos;ve had blueberries in pots send up 4ft suckers in no time flat. I&apos;ve seen the same with figs. My grapes in the greenhouse grow at an unbelieveable rate despite no water and no fertilizer within 8ft of the base for 4 yrs. I can only imagine what they&apos;d do with a push.
One thing we don&apos;t know is where David lives. Maybe watering every day outside isn&apos;t that extreme. When you have control of water and fertilizer like we do out west, you can see some strange things.
Besides I&apos;m not so sure this is the way you want to grow bb even the first year. Certainly not when they are bearing. My bb quality is very bad with too much water and N. The other fruit trees are the same.

 &quot;Remember this stuff [ag sulfur] when reacting with sweaty skin produces sulfuric acid and even in very small exposures is very painfull&quot;
One of our many horticultural myths, just like &quot;chlorine and water produces hydrochloric acid.&quot; Oxidation of sulfur (e.g., burning) and reaction with water produces the much weaker sulfurous acid. People should be careful of course, but sulfur is not notoriously an irritant. I&apos;m fairly sure soldiers 100 years ago dusted it on irritations and wounds and people traveling in forests in summer dust it inside their lower pants legs now to avoid chiggers. It doesn&apos;t noticeably bother my skin.
Also, I have little trouble believing one can get very rapid growth out of blueberries. Tall ones being sold in little pots in nurseries often evidence having been intensively grown for height growth.
North Florida and southern Georgia are big in commercial southern highbush blueberries now and I can see someone specializing in their fertilization. But I agree the advertising tone can&apos;t be overlooked.

 I gotta tell you, thats what go me into this mess originally. In the past Id never put anything on my berries. No fertilizer, no nothing. I had an underground drip line that ran the length of my berries and over to my tomatoes. My berries produced but just didnt thrive...a few berries per bush and no rapid growth. In addition the berries were sour. I waited until they were the deep blue color to pick and still they were sour. Someeone told me that it could be they were getting too much water. Everytime I watered my tomatoes I was watering the blueberries, which was too much. His contention was that all that water was diluting the blueberry&apos;s natural sugar, therefore making them taste sour. Any validity to that?

 Yes too much water will dilute the sugar. That&apos;s what I was telling David. Too much nitrogen at the wrong time is also bad. So I ration water and don&apos;t apply any nitrogen from bloom until harvest. After that I prune. Then I usually apply more water and some 21-0-0 to get 12-18 inches new growth. That new growth will be covered with bloom next spring.
I&apos;ve never burned the plants if I dissolve one teaspoon 21-0-0 per gallon of water and apply to potted plants. I have burned them by applying 21-0-0 to the soil surface in pots and watered in.

 Our blueberries have consistently good flavor, over the past 15 years. Each shrub gets one tablespoon of Miracle-Gro, for acid loving plants, mixed with 4 gallons of tap water, twice per season, April and May. I always have to water during the August drought, sometimes in July, and rarely in the spring. We have hard water, and our soil is calciferous, so keeping the pH correct takes considerable effort, but that&apos;s a different question.

 OK, I reread the post and the guy certainly sounds sincere. My gut reaction was to not believe because there is a lot of presumption in the post stated as established fact- like that the specific formulations of this company were responsible for the growth and that it wouldn&apos;t have been possible in a higher pH. I like to see a control as part of such absolute conclusions.
It was a little hard to absorb the story, and I didn&apos;t realize that the rampant growth was all accomplished in pot culture.
I still find it extremely difficult to believe that a company has come up with such a superior nutritional formulation that as he himself mentioned, he gets much much better growth than commercial nurserymen who specialize in blueberry plant production. If they have in fact found such a superior formulation, I&apos;m sure the word will get around very quickly. Commercial nurseries use a similar potting mix, supply ample water and fertilizer and don&apos;t get nearly that growth. How do you explain that, Fruitnut?
By the way, last season&apos;s rain was relentless and blueberry production in my area was extremely good. I didn&apos;t notice a huge drop off in flavor although my yealds were huge. A little less brix, but still quite delicious.

 It just sounded to me like David was using a controlled release fertilizer both in pots and later in the field. The 5-6 ft of growth was after they were planted in the field. At least that was my understanding. I&apos;ve seen some amazing growth with enough water and fertilizer. But amazing growth and high quality fruit are worlds apart, at least for me.
I like my blueberries also. I&apos;ve grown some pretty good ones. But I&apos;ve also grown some that were pretty tasteless. The tasteless ones have been the over watered ones. I&apos;ve got a Primadonna right now with big beautiful fruit getting ripe. But it carried excess vigor over from last year and I must be watering it too much. It has about 2ft of growth on some shoots with no N this year. Fruit is pretty flat tasting.
The people who can&apos;t get their Blueberries to grow have too high pH or aren&apos;t applying enough water or fertilizer. They are capable of very fast growth. But they&apos;re so salt sensitive that it is easy to burn the plants.

 Fruitnut, if a blueberry get&apos;s inadequate iron due to high pH the leaves will look chlorotic. If the leaves have healthy cloraphyl then it shouldn&apos;t matter what the pH reading is- at least that is my understanding. Carl Whitcomb did research with pinoaks that showed that the pH did not have to be changed beyond the soil surface to solve iron deficiency.
You got me reading the post a third time, and no, the dramatic growth was while the plants were in pots.

 Harvestman: Yes the growth he claimed was in pots from April until he set them out in October. I&apos;m still a believer that it is possible. While David didn&apos;t say, Florikan is a Florida company so he has a very long warm growing season. I&apos;m pretty sure I could get that growth in my greenhouse from now till October. I&apos;ve got 11 new plants potted up. They are very small. I think I&apos;ll push some of them really hard and see what happens.
My main concern is still that plants that vigorous won&apos;t be set up to produce quality fruit next year.

 Ok...I&apos;m on break again and will try to address everyones questions or concerns..I had no idea the hornet&apos;s nest I was stirring when I made this post....I&apos;ll try to paragraph better this time as well..
First off, I live in Murray,Ky. which is far west Ky. about 10 miles north of the tennessee line in the lakes region. Our temps fluctuate from well below zero in the winters to well over 110 degrees plus in the summer..Some years are wet, some are dry..The last 2 years have been what I call a very normal season.
I grew the plants in 3 gallon pots from spring till fall last year when they finally got planted out and overwintered in the ground with heavy sawdust application as mulch.
I fertilized with Florikan brand Nutricote staged release fertilizer one time only in the spring shortly after potting them up and they started to grow.
The plants were from cutting made the previous fall but had good root systems when we received them. They were only 10-15&quot; inches at best when we received them.
I pruned them 3 times to keep them branching out and to make a fuller bush. Each time I pruned off a good 12-18&quot;.
I watered them in the 3 gallon pots everyday unless it rained.
We did get maybe a 5 gallon bucket of berries off the plants while growing themin the pots. All were great tasting to me. The Hannah&apos;s Choice and Draper were the largest..About the size of a quarter. Bluecrop was right behing them on size...All the berries I tasted seemed good and were not watery looking or tasting..This season I guess will be the test..
Harvestman..I had to read you comment twice about credibility...Now I see where your coming from..You were not referring to me personally but just to a one person opinion...Took me a second to get it..BTW I am no way affiliated with any company I meantion here other than just using there products..Just wanted to get that out of the way..
I haven&apos;t posted here before because I have never grown blueberry plants so didn&apos;t see a point..I have posted in daylilies for a long time though and I&apos;m well known over there..
I have been raing daylilies for years and just wanted to add something different to diversify our farm..Like I said it took 2 years of prep work before I ever planted anything...This just didn&apos;t happen overnight..
I documented the entire year of growth with hundreds of pics showing growth rates, with a tape measure to show scale. I also video documented the year as well with many comparisons to the later plants I got from the other grower I talked about. Pics don&apos;t lie, and I&apos;ll extend an open invitation to come visit anytime you like to see for yourself what the plants look like...I promise you I won&apos;t say I told you so a single time..Not my style..
I have thousands of customers as far as my reputation that can vouch for me as far as daylilies go..How do you oil a snake anyway?? Just kidding..
Florikan has been in the blueberry fertilizing business for years and they do have a long list of commmercial nurseries that use their products successfully..I&apos;m not saying there are not other fertilizer companies with equally as good or better of a product..I just didn&apos;t find any...
Fruitnut... I wish you could see all the fruitbuds and blooms now on the plants...Of course some varieties are blooming in stages but overall from what I have read seems as though mine are doing extremely well. I did about 25 cutting last year myself of Bluecrop just to screw around with it..They are anywhere from 18&quot; and up with a few in the 24&quot;+ range..All are loaded with buds as well..I know I know, I have heard rub off the buds so the plants can grow the first year or two...Kind of wierd because everyone is saying slow down growth..LOL...
Like I said I have all kinds of documentation,pics,and vids to validate what I&apos;m saying along with an invite to come by in person to anyone that wants to..We have lots of crows around here to..I hate crows..
One other thing needs to be mentions and most I&apos;m sure already know this but some reading this may not is that all plants have a ph range where they perform best. Ph allows plants to take up nutrients and when a certain plants ph waivers oputside that range, guess what? It&apos;s not able to take up the nutrients it needs and will die if not corrected or at least just not thrive and look very chlorotic as mentioned before..This is true in blueberries,daylilies, and all plants..
Forgot to say above so I will now, that the sulfur when hit mu skin may have not chemically been sulfuric acid it sure weren&apos;t baby powder baby..I&apos;m 43 years old, 6&apos;4&quot; and 285 pounds and was crying like a baby...I think people need to be very aware of the precaution they need to take when using it is all..I think all will agree with that..
And lastly and probably the most importantly is that when I made this post, I had no intention of ruffling feathers of anyone..I saw that a few people were struggling and just wanted to share a few tips that have worked for me and me only..I was hoping to just maybe pass something on so someone wouldn&apos;t have to struggle...Struggling sucks!!
Maybe some people in the past on here have made bogous claims and if so, then I guess i&apos;ll have to pay the price from them crying wolf..I hate that because all I want to do is help out people wether it be in berries,daylilies, or more importantly life..
We are all just here for a short time and we need to make the most of it..I never try to give advice about something I have no experience with or no nothing about..There are tons of things in life I don&apos;t know anything about and guess what I don&apos;t claim to..I really don&apos;t know alot about blueberries but I know alot more than what I did a few years ago..Only by listening to the good factual info from others...
I hope this has cleared things up a bit from a personal and professional standpoint..Although I&apos;m not sure how professional I would call myself as that sounds a little high and mighty..But you get the point..

Thanks a ton for posting back. That was very informative and well written. Most importantly thank you for taking all the jabs in a very generous and mature manner!!!
I have an email in to Florikan hoping to find the product you used. Can you tell me more specifics about their controlled release fertilizer for blueberries? Have you tried anything else? I&apos;d like to try something for blueberries and potted fruit trees.
Many people have trouble getting blueberries to grow. I think part of that is because they are so sensitive to salt burn. A controlled release fertilizer seems like the way to go to me. I can get plenty of growth but have burned them at times.

 Dave, you should never take internet skepticism personally. Gardeners tend to exaggerate just like fishermen and everyone else. On the internet, you can&apos;t even look into someones eyes to try and get a read. But I did say that after reading your post twice you seemed sincere.
Your growth rates do sound incredible to me but I&apos;ve only
grown blueberries in NY. I used to use Osmocote, which is probably similar to the product you use, but it wasn&apos;t specifically formulated for blueberries. It was the recommended fertilizer for potted blueberries at the time.
I dropped blueberries from my nursery operation some time ago because I don&apos;t have a lot of water to work with and anyway, I never got anywhere near your growth rate so they weren&apos;t making me money.
Everyone who&apos;s followed this thread this far knows about pH&apos;s affect on nutrient availability. I just try to explain to people that they needn&apos;t wait a season to get a complete change in pH before planting. Of course if they are getting anywhere near your growth in pots they may as well.

 I don&apos;t take things personally much anymore...Pretty thick skinned...Problem with a slow release vs. a controlled release is that the slow release just gives a steady release of whatever is in the fertilizer usually when the coating gets wet and sheds..The controlled release I use doesn&apos;t shed the first layer until 72 or 73 degrees..can&apos;t remember which..Anyway, after that the timer starts and at a pre programmed time from the first release you have your second release, and a third in the same way if a 3 stage..Much more efficient I feel.
The reason it took nearly 2 years is that I wanted all weeds and vegetation completely killed off, and the ph just right..I&apos;m going to pull a sample this week and see where I&apos;m at on ph but I think I&apos;m in the 4.8-5.0 range.
I use to fish competitively in the 80&apos;s and never stretched the truth...lol..Biggest largemouth I have wrangled to date was a 10lb 6oz monster..I do have pics of that one btw..Bad thing was it came 2 days after a very high payout tournament that we just finished respectable in..That one fish would have made a huge difference...Story of my life...

 I would be very happy to get 2&apos; of growth per year let alone the kind of growth Dave is talking about. With the kind of growth he is getting. I could plant two 3&apos;X100&apos; rows in my back yard spaced 6&apos; apart and make some big bucks at our local farmers market.
I have been toying with the idea of a 3&apos;X12&apos; raised bed for blueberries. Now Dave has me thinking with dollar signs in my eyes.lol

 Interesting as with all the talk of nitrates early in the thread, that Florikan product that is doing so well for Dave is 7.4% Amm. Nitrate. I guess in-line with what a couple of you said, the fear (reasonable amounts) of nitrate being the BB &quot;death sentence&quot; is not substantiated.

The only thing I could find was the 16-4-9-270 Total Blend. It is 7.45% nitrate nitrogen. The nitrate comes from ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate. Agree that sounds a little strange. I sent an email to their Texas rep several days ago and have got nothing back. That&apos;s a bit frustrating. Guess I&apos;ll stick with what I have.

 There were some studies done on blueberries using different types of nitrogen. Plants fertilized with small amounts of ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate did as well as plants fertilized with other forms of nitrogen. The study I read did not use or refer to Calcium Nitrate. Even Dave Wilson&apos;s site says to stay away from Nitrate fertilizers as they can Kill Blueberries and he does lots of work with UC Davis and the USDA.
Take a look at STEP #3 in the link below.

 I&apos;m really going out on a limb in trying to explain why the 16-4-9 works so well for blueberries but here goes as it was explained to me..Remember, I going off memory here so if I get something a little off don&apos;t cricify me too bad..
Chad Keel is the sales rep I deal with, but Harmon Gilbert is a wealth of knoweledge in R&amp;D;and really explained it well to me..
The probelem most people face with using Nitrate forms is that the fertilizers they use tend to dump and will release way to much at once or at the incorrect time. The coatings they use to control this are second to none and if you really explore there site you will see that they have had the best in the business working on these polymers for years to get it right.
The 16-4-9 I use grated has 7.45% Nitrate Nitrogen but also has 6.95% ammonical nitrogen as well. Also there is a generous amount of sulfur at 2.60% along with several of the trace metals such as magnesium,iron,manganese, and zinc, which help give your plants that healthy green and keep them from getting clorotic looking..Iron from what I gather is very important...Below is how it is released:
*The Ammonium Nitrate, Potassium Nitrate, Ammonium
Phosphate, Manganese Sulfate, and Zinc Sulfate have
been polymer coated to provide 15.6% slow release
Nitrogen (N), 4.0% slow release available Phosphate
(P2O5), 6.5% slow release soluble Potash (K2O), and 0.07%
slow release Zinc (Zn)
So as you can see even if you have higher amounts or percentages of Nitrates you can still get outstanding results because it is released in a very controlled manor..
I was told to use the 270 day release because if I apply in say spring, then 270 days later we are into winter and really no need to have much going on then...They need to slow way down...And the proof that this works is that like I said in my first post, the plants did harden off and showed virtually no dieback or winter tip burn..That fact alone is worth alot to growers, knowing you can push them hard and not have issues with winter burn of non hardened growth...
I have had a few blueberry growers stop by and they were amazed that I can get this kind of &quot;Healthy Growth&quot; as they put it and still have the amount of bloom that I do now..Please remember that I&apos;m not the one that deserves ANY credit..All I did was follow advice from people I entrusted my planting to...And one thing you can trust me totally in is that if it was a bad experience and it all went bad, I would post that too..
Something I noticed today as I was walking the rows was that I guess it really doesn&apos;t take as many bumble bees to pollinate a field as what I first thought...I timed one lone bumble bee when he got to a very large plant covered in blooms and he went from bloom to bloom on that bush and hit em all in about 7 minutes..so basically in 116 hours he could do all 1,000 bushes by himself...He had plenty of help but was neat to put a pencil to it and crunch the numbers..
The biggest problem I know is coming is the Japanese bettle hatch..they are aweful here and I will have to spray wettable sevin to kill them. It works well though and kills them in seconds, and is completely safe after 5-7 days to eat fruit that has been sprayed..I&apos;ll just have to be careful on the timing...
I know my boys will be glad when all the sawdust mulching is over..We are on our 3rd tractor trailer load and will finish before long..That has been the hardest part of the whole thing..We scoop it on a 6x10 trailer I pull behind the atv and then offload it by hand. A tractor would be simpler but it would tear up the grass middles I have worked so hard to maintain so were are doing it the hard way, but the end result will be more satisfying...
Of the 13 varieties we are growing, Patriot seems to be the worst, and if it doesn&apos;t permorm well will difinately be replaced...I will give it a few more years to see though..Duke,Bluecrop,Hannah&apos;s Choice,Draper,Jersey,and Northland seem to be the leaders so far..Aurora,Bonus,Chandler, and Collins are smaller but those are some that were grown out by another grower for me and I didn&apos;t get some of those till after the seaon was over...Maybe I can get them as big as the others now.
Bluejay and Blueray are large and doing well too.
That&apos;s it for now. David.

 Thanks David:
OK, at least we know exactly what you used. It must work even being half nitrate. That&apos;s kinda what it sounded like to me, nitrate is dangerous only in large doses. Now it is possible that calcium nitrate is especially dangerous. But I&apos;d bet that&apos;s only dangerous in large amounts also. So all this is good to know.
I&apos;m going to get some controlled release if I can find some and try the stuff. The Florikan material is about $2+ per lb. 21-0-0 is about $12 per 40 lbs locally.
Meanwhile, small frequent doses of urea or 21-0-0 will give all the growth you need for anyone still wondering.
I may try urea. It&apos;s cheap, my pH is low enough already, and I think it is less likely to burn the plant.

 Dave, I believe Osmocote is made the same as your stuff. It is polymer coated and was developed by a Japanese company over 25 years ago and for quite a while they had the monopoly on polymer coated time release fertilizer. The only other option was sulfur coated urea which had the problems you mentioned.
If you are able to turn a rooted cutting into a 6 foot bush even after cutting it back 3 times and all in a single growing season, maybe you should go into the nursery business. Not a single other commercial grower I&apos;ve ever heard of gets anywhere near your results. I have to admit, I&apos;m still skeptical, but I&apos;ll happily pay a premium price for your 2-year plants with the potting soil shaken off.

 Dave I&apos;m with harvestman. Do you realize what blueberry bushes of that size sell for? Every year you could sell every mature plant you can grow for more than you would make off the plant in 10 years running a you pick operation. I would say more but thats at selling them at prices lower than the cheapest competition. After a year or two word would get around and you could raise your prices.

 david, I have been following your story too and am really, really interested in seeing your pictures and am also reading about the Florikan product to see if I can try it.
As harvestman and thisisme said, please consider going into the nursery business! The bb bushes of the sizes you mention cost an arm and a leg around here.

 It isn&apos;t that hard getting blueberries to grow. What&apos;s hard is getting them to grow without burning them. They grow like weeds if pushed with water and nitrogen. But I&apos;ve burned them enough times that it slows me down.
I&apos;m going to apply 21-0-0 at the rate of 1 teaspoon per gallon once a week. In between I&apos;ll keep them well watered. If I don&apos;t burn them they&apos;ll grow as much as an inch a day. But it usually takes about a month before they kick into gear. I really do think two feet a month is doable.
I&apos;ll post back after they take off or get burnt.

 Fruitnut- One thing I forgot to mention is that yes the 16-4-9 I use is rather expensive but on a large scale I think you get your return on your investment much quicker.
All of you plant people in here already know this but just want to mention that although the 21-0-0 will probably work for you, you yourself referenced the fear of burning..The fertilizer I&apos;m using did not burn..It has been a full season since the start and had no issues with tip burn or die off over the winter due to tender growth.
I used a medium application rate but I&apos;m going to go with a heavy rate this season and really push them...Yes I have heard everyones warnings about fruit quality suffering, and have retained that advice, but someone really needs to push the envelpoe with these and see what the breaking point is..It always has to be done in all things in life because we as a species are just never happy with &quot;just good enough&quot;..
One more thing that needs to be mentioned and started to say above but got sidetracked is that the nitrogen is not the only thing that causes growth..Now before you scratch your heads saying whats he talking about, think about the other nutrients that are needed for overall plant health..Nitrogen is always important I agree, but a healthy plant needs a good foundation under it...The Phosphorous and Potassium and all the trace metal minerals are very important to allow the nitrogen to work properly.
Think about it...If we just eat the same ole thing (say just meat or just one type of food)day after day, week after week, yes we can survive and grow, but how is our overall health???
I guess I should have mentioned I was a chem major with a minor in ag, maybe that would have let people understand why I am the way I am...lol..
Harvestman- While Osmocote is a wonderful product and has been around for years, the probelem I hear from several people is that it can and will dump all at once, causing the fears of the burn scenario to come to life..Florikan&apos;s products I have used thus far, never dumped..And beleive me I watched em like a hawk...If it had dumped and burned my plants Mr. Keel would have had a phone call with some explaining to do..I was just as skeptical or probably moreso...
Again the timeline on the growth was thjat these plants were cuttings in the late summer/early fall of 2008 by another nursery. When they sent them to me in April 2009, they were 12-18&quot; at the most.(Bluecrops were the largest at around 18&quot; at best)...The Hannah&apos;s Choice and Drapers were just a darn stick mabe 10-12&quot; with some roots...I was pissed when I got some of them but witha phonecall they assured me that was the standard for some varieties that were newer..I thought yeah whatever...
The 16-4-9 was applied shortly after potting in April 2009 and like I said I watered daily..I have not fertilized since then..I pruned off 12-18&quot; 3 times during the summer and still ended up with a field full of very nice full bushes that are currently in near full bloom and look very healthy.
I told a few other growers about how much I cut off and they said the same thing you guys are in that there was enough material thrown away to start thousands of new bushes..With our daylily operation and family, plus working a full time public job, there just wasn&apos;t enough time in my day to do it..But you all are right, I guess I could do pretty well selling plants, and if you can find me some 40 hour days I&apos;ll be glad to go for it..

Thisisme- Yes... Again I realize the money that could be made at this..I have seen bushes on a couple of sites that sell for 50 bucks plus for the same size or smaller..Only there plants I believe are 3-4 years old..I can do it in one year without a doubt..I already have...I told my wife the other day that if I sold the large bushes for 10-15 bucks each I could probably make a killing..I just can&apos;t belive that the demand for plants is so high..Where the heck do they all go??? At some point won&apos;t everyone have plants?? LOL...
Asleysf- I really don&apos;t need to talk business, this isn&apos;t the place, but you can ask someone about our farm and what we are doing now...You&apos;ll see it&apos;s not my first rodeo...I&apos;m just a berry virgin right now..Been doing daylilies forever..
Fruitnut in your last post above you say your going to push with the 21-0-0 at 1 teaspoon a week per gallon??? Again you mention fears of burning them..My rate last year with the florikan was just a little over a tablespoon once per year!! Why would you want to spend all that time fertilizing? Even if your paying .30 cents per pound and your fertilizing every week so if you do that for just say 4 months thats 16 times you fertilize...
Lets say for arguments sake you have 100 plants, thats 1,600 teaspoons of fertilizer...Where as I will only use 100 tablespoons which is what...um..300 teaspoons..you are going to use over 5 times as much fertilizer with all the extra time included in applying, and really only save .50 cents per pound over the Florikan if it is $2.00 per pound...I will say that mines was no where near 2 bucks a pound...It may have gone up though..I haven&apos;t even looked at invoices..Wife does all that..
You see what I&apos;m getting at though..It all mainly depends on the scale your doing things and If you only have a few plants or if someone is just wanting a few for home gardening then I probably couldn&apos;t justify the 50 pound sack of fertilizer..But if you or anyone else has more than just a few then I would highly recommend using Florikan..See I&apos;m not pushy..I have no reason to be..
I am very brand loyal and when I find something that works for me I stay with it..If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it kinda guy...I&apos;m a chevy, daiwa, yamaha, and remington kind of guy...see what I mean...And now I&apos;m that way with Florikan....I have no vested interest in what people use or buy for anything, but like to pass on what works and even what doesn&apos;t and let people decide for themselves..
Another thing I would be interested in getting a survey on are 2 things...
#1 How much are say 3-5&apos; Highbush plants going for in your area.
#2 How much per pound are u-pick berries in your area while in season.
Around here berries are 2-3 bucks a pound u pick which seems fair enough...I have paid that for years and seems like you get a pretty good bang for your buck at that price..
Bushes, if you can find them at the fancy nurseries in town are 15-20 bucks for 2&apos; bushes.
Well that time has come boys and girls...see you next time..same bat time...same bat channel..
If you recall that phrase then you just aged yourself.
David.

 David The blueberry bushes you are producing sound like they could easily be sold at a premium over whats available for sale today. Its not hard to set up a website with pictures and its not hard to be included in the popular search engines either.
As far as price goes this year I paid $ 16.95 each for two 3-4 Southern HighBush plants with no branching. One had two canes the other had three. A few years back I paid roughly double that for two plants about the same height with minimal branching and 3-4 canes per bush. I was happy with both purchases as they were better plants than I had seen anywhere else. Current prices for plants even 1-2 taller go up exponentially almost doubling in price for each foot of growth after that.
Right now you have an advantage over every blueberry grower any of us have ever heard of. The possibilities for earning money with that advantage long term are enormous. Word of mouth is the best advertising. People coming to your you pick could be buying your berry bushes. People love to tell their friends about what they are growing and where they got it from. With the web site locals can just tell their friends and family to look you up which increases sales.
None of this has to be expensive. You could run the you pick just as you were and put up a sign with prices for potted blueberry berry bushes. It will not cost you business it will increase your sales and the word of mouth advertising which is free and valuable. Of course you will be busy during the picking season but thats not when you sell bushes over the internet. Internet sales are when the bushes are dormant and local sales are during the picking season and as long after as you wish to remain open to the public there after. The combination provides a more continuous cash flow. Sure it may take a few years to really get going but all businesses do. You knew that before you even got started.
Have you thought about the possibility of selling blueberries to people in a stand along with blueberry jams and jellies at youre you pick for people who do not have time to pick their own?
Dude its exciting to be you right now. Heck Im not even you and Im excited for you.

I have some in pots that I did from cutting myself last year just playing around..They are 2-3&apos; tall and loaded with blooms right now for such sized bushes..Your right though..Yes I could sell plants, but right now we are so busy with ...other things that you&apos;ll soon find out about..Ask around like I said and then you&apos;ll understand why I&apos;m so busy..
I wouldn&apos;t sell any bushes for a super high price anyhow..If I could get 10-15 bucks for a year old bush that would be ok with me...Who knows..
I have so many projects going on right now...you have no idea..The biggest and most exciting thing really I&apos;m working on right now plants wise is the Japanese Haskap we are testing and growing..We will eventually do a huge mass planting now that I have seen how tough they are here..If you think growth on my blueberries are crazy then I can&apos;t wait to see how quick the haskap mature...They have already put on 12-18&quot; of new growth this year and are hanging full of berries..MMMMM...
Well gotta go for now..

 Dave, as far as I can see, your product is designed the same way as Osmocote and it is completely meaningless to assert that the concensus is your product is the stuff and Osmocote falls short. Where is the research to back this up, please?
Information is far more helpful to me than testimonials, even your very colorful delivery of testimonials Why do I feel I&apos;m being snowed?

Ummmm...I&apos;m trying to see where I asserted there is a consensus that Osmocote falls short and &quot;My product&quot;(not sure how you figure it&apos;s mine) is the stuff?? I&apos;m not a research lab and have no idea how they stack up personally as I have never used Osmocote..If you&apos;ll look at what I actually said is that Osmocote is a wonderful product and been around for years...I guess I&apos;m just really slow at getting where I said all these things....
I said plain and to the point that I had heard from several people about the burn issues where it had dumped on them..nothing more..Just seems like with all the implied fears of burn than one wouldn;t want to take a chance..By all means if you feel Osmocote is the best please use it...Isn&apos;t that what were supposed to be here for anyway? To help one another???
To me a testamonial is worth more than a bunch of data..I love data and eat it up, but... and this is the big BUT...Proof is in the results seen and delt with on a daily basis...so I constantly have to slap myself with a reality stick and realize that 2+2 doesn&apos;t always equal 4...
I went through the same skepticism when people told me..heck actually called me names and such, that there was no way to get tetraploid pollen from a diploid daylily...Now I utilize the trick I stumbled on with that to produce dip x tet crosses all the time...
As far as my testimonials go...I&apos;m colorblind somewhat and I&apos;m not sure how to address that one..
I don&apos;t snow people...that falls into one of the two categories of people I really dislike..Liars..the other would be thieves..
My suggestion in here would be to buy what the heck you are successful with and stick with it...I know that&apos;s what I do so I shouldn&apos;t expect I guess anyone else to do it..
I really am sorry if your offended Harvestman, I apologize if I did that..Not my style..Maybe we should work together to improve things even more...You guys been doing this a heck of a lot longer than me..
Well off to bed..One more night this week and then I&apos;ll have a weekend off full of work...I go to work to rest it seems like...
Everyone have a great weekend...Play in the dirt...It&apos;s good for the soul..

 harvestman the cynical side of me says Dave is trying to promote this fertilizer company a little to much. Another side of me says if I got the kind of incredible results he claims I would be telling everyone about it too. Not knowing any better yet I am going take him at his word and take a wait and see attitude.
I am not going to go out and buy any of the fertilizer he is using. Not because I think he is giving us a snow job. I just dont trust that these slow release fertilizers release at the same rate in all climate zones. That and I am a bit of a cynic. I want to see his results he is claiming repeated by others in different locations and climates.
Not because I think he is giving us a snow job or trying to pull the wool over my eyes. But because one mans results in one area often cannot be repeated by another man or even the same man in another location. I would like to see fruitnut or someone else I trust like you do a trial.
I would even trust results from ashleysf cebury ericwi or even chasgh and gone bananas. Are any of you going to try this stuff? Sure would like to see it in action with pictures start to finish. For that matter I would even like to see pictures of Daves blueberry bushes.

 thisisme - I&apos;m not intentionally promoting any company...I&apos;m not affiliated with them in any way, shape, or form. Just have had sucess with there products so far is all..
If I mentioned the place a few times that I bought my plants from, does that mean I&apos;m promoting them too much???
I think we all should report good and bad experiences..Problem seems to be the way I&apos;m seeing it anyway, is that if you so call &quot;promote&quot; a company for it&apos;s product then you are looked at by others as an isolated case, or your classed a certain way...And on the flipside, if you slam a company, even in a tactful way, for having a product that doesn&apos;t measure up in your experience anyway, then your lynch mobbed...
So how in the heck do you win this??? I guess not post and then what&apos;s the point of even posting??
Anyway..enough of my ranting...
You bring up a good point about fertilizers performing differently in different zones and climates..They may not..I guess if ya know alot of people all over the U.S. and weant to take the time you could ask and find out how different things perform..
I know when I first started getting info on BB 2 years ago that when I called up the big BB growers and asked what fertilizers they used they nearly always just said a slow release or staged release, and would never tell me a company brand to look into...I got the feeling that was like a secret or something, and couldn&apos;t for the life of me understand why someone wouldn&apos;t want to share just simple things...But then again maybe that was a secret to there success or something...Still haven&apos;t figured that one out.
As far as the last thing you remarked on as far as trusting me??? I don&apos;t have a problem with that...Like I said before I have been doubted from time to time by others, and heck I have even doubted myself quite often, especially when I first got those plants last spring..I didn&apos;t say alot to my wife at the time, but I felt I had made a huge mistake getting into berries...Like I said some were so tiny with one little twig a few inches long..
I felt alot better when I saw them start growing...That first few weeks was agonizing a heck though..I really havent felt totally confident about them until this spring when I seen they pulled through the winter unscathed..And we had a very bad winter here..We had tons of snow which was great, but then had a 3 week cold spell of below zero - teens for highs with no snow..I guess those things are tough..Now that they are blooming good I feel so much better..Kinda like holding your breath all winter and now finally able to exhale...Guess that&apos;s what I am doing on here...Exhaling...
No body has to &quot;Trust&quot; my results on my word..Like I said, if anyone lives close they are more than welcome to stop by..Just let me know ahead of time so I can throw some meat on the grill..
I have tons of pics from start to finish..I think it would be easier to just email me and me attach then in a return email, than clog up the forum with pics..I even have a tape measure stretched out to show height scale and comparison pics as well..I&apos;ll have to go through and pic out the pics that show start to finish because I took alot..I want you all to be satisfied with them..
If you want I&apos;ll take some pics of them blooming now as well(I need to anyway) and I&apos;ll take a couple of the cuttings I did last summer showing them now blooming and the size they are..
I have some somewhere of them when I made the cuttings originally that I&apos;ll look for..Just looked like a darn stick..I did notice that certain varieties are easier to propagate than others..Afew I had no luck with at all..
Well, my break is over, so back to work..I&apos;ll try to post again in a few days and get pics together..

 Dave, you did it again, making claims that just aren&apos;t backed by any research I&apos;ve seen. Osmocote has been well researched and I&apos;ve seen charts of it&apos;s reliable time release. Researchers like Carl Whitcomb have recommneded it for years for fertilizing sensitive plants like blueberries. Show me a single piece of research that shows your product is more precise and you will have gone a long way to convince me.
As it stands it doesn&apos;t seem possible to me that your claimed results are primarily due to some super product.
Sometimes amazing stuff happens, but not for the reason one assumes- that&apos;s probably why the world has so many religions. Assuming you are being honest, (which cannot be established by photos, by the way, unless you can prove chronology) doesn&apos;t mean your explanation is correct. You&apos;d need to duplicate results with a control to do that.
You say you cut back your plants several times during their first seasons growth, which brings to my mind 2 questions. Why would you be cutting them back- who told you to train blueberries this way? Not at all how I was taught. Heading cuts aren&apos;t traditionally used for blueberries, instead whole branches are removed when they become unproductive. I can think of a reason, but I&apos;d rather have you tell it.
The other question is how tall would these plants have become without the heading cuts- 12 feet, maybe. I suggest next time you forgo the heading cuts and submit your results to the Guiness book of records. Than you&apos;ll really get some great recognition. Florakan might offer you financing for the effort it they&apos;re smart and find you credible.
Meanwhile I&apos;ll stop interupting this discourse with my skepticism if you give me the name and phone# of the nurseryman who you straightened out and is now using your product. The season is far enough along now to compare his results to yours.
Thank You, Alan Haigh

 Harvestman- Do you only urinate to fertilize? I have been doing this for the past couple weeks in an effort to lower the PH. Does it work for that too? Can I overdo it? Just frustrated because my blueberries were all planted in raised beds and separate containers with acid soil 3 years ago and the PH is no different than the freaking ground (7.0). The plants are doing well though. Go figure.

 As I keep saying, you may be getting a reading of 7 but the blueberries are finding the iron they need in patches of more acidic soil- that, at least, is my untested theory. Not actually completely untested because Whitcomb was able to eliminate chlorosis in pin oaks with a surface application of sulfur where trees recovered long before a lower pH reading could be detected. This was actual research, by the way.
Urine is the equivalent of urea as far as acidification- in other words it takes a long time to change the soils pH. I&apos;d be careful with it during the growing season- I use it in the early Fall as plants change color. I don&apos;t have experience using it as a growing season fertilizer for blueberries. I have no idea at what point it could burn their roots.

 david, I am not at all skeptical and I would love to give you credit (and Florikan too) if credit is due. It is not only those who respond to this post, there are thousands of people who &quot;lurk&quot; on this and other threads who would love to see your pictures. You do not need to email it to several people or crowd this thread with them. Just upload a few pictures to any photo upload site (they are all free) - I am sure you already use one of those sites - and post a link to the pictures in this thread.
Growing plants is not my area of expertise, but rather a dedicated hobby of mine for several years, and whenever someone makes posts about extraordinary success, I always like to see the pictures.
(And FYI, I checked prices of bb bushed for you at my local high end nursery - 2 gallon blueberries were $19.99 and 3 gallon monrovia grown blueberries (maybe same size as yours) were $39.99.)

 Once again, I want to say that skepticism on the internet is not a personal matter. I use this site to try to sort out contributed observations and make sense out of them. Once in a while someones observation is way out of wack with my personal experience as I&apos;m sure some of my observations are to others.
This can be where I actually learn something new, but I need to sort out assumption from reality- even aside from the likely occurance of exagerration and the less likely occurance of blatant falsehoods.
Just because someone gets amazing results one season with one method doesn&apos;t mean that results will be duplicated again or that the results are caused by the presumed explanation.
I have seen many miracle products come and go in the home gardening market place- all accompanied by testimonials that seem to irrefutably show the merit of the product. Often this is where it is useful to turn to what commercial growers are doing and what are there results.
If Dave has a way to consistently bring a small rooted cutting to full bearing size in a single season, I know I won&apos;t have to take his word for it. His suggestions that commercial growers guard their secrets is not really credible because the manufacturer of the products are much larger businesses and will make sure every commercial grower will learn about them.
If Dave owes his success to the unique qualities of Florikan fertilizers and their general recommendations then those results will soon become the industry norm, because nothing in the methods he describes are different from general production techniques as far as I can see.

 Dave as I said before I am taking you at your word and taking a wait and see attitude. I have to say though given the time line you present along with the size of the bushes I see in the pictures if I were you I would be very impressed with the fertilizer too.
By the way great job putting the site and the pictures together.

 That is very nice David and I have to agree a very professional operation all the way around. The growth is as advertised. For those who have never pushed their plants hard, the photo showing the strong new upright growth at the base of the plant is what I&apos;ve seen. It&apos;s about the third photo down in that series. When you push strong upright shoots like that, the very rapid vegetative phase has kicked in. Those shoots can grow about 18-24 inches per month. That&apos;s a rough guess on my part but far above growth rates for the small wood that is more horizontal.
I&apos;ve started my fertilizer experiment today that if all goes well should show results similar to David&apos;s.

 Very nice indeed! I also agree with AshleySF -- many folks will lurk and find your pics inviting and positively inspiring. Don&apos;t be surprised if you start getting emails directly (esp. if your email is enabled on this site).
In my 1/2 season of experience, I agree with the strong fert is on the low growth (as compared to one long thick shoot you see in typical nursery purchases). I placed more fert on two of mine and set aside to compare against the same variety receiving identical care -- definitely saw new growth at the base -- but nowhere near this size!
Good job again!

 Thought I&apos;d add a little balance to my last comments. I just measured three strong shoots that arose from the base of my potted Star last year. They shot straight up last summer and I topped them at 40 inches. This year those three shoots have 1-3 branches at the tip and about 20 berries. But they are bare, straight sticks below 36 inches. That&apos;s not the kind of fruiting wood that will give you a big crop.
A big crop is set on the 8-12 inch, more horizontal shoots that arise from moderate growth rates. One or two years of rapid growth will probably increase yields in the first 5-6 yrs. But then I&apos;d favor much slower growth rates.
I&apos;ll be the first to admit that my blueberries don&apos;t always taste the best. I think part of that is just the nature of the crop. But part could be me pushing too much water and fertilizer. I&apos;m rationing water now on my mature plants and haven&apos;t fertilized this year.
All in all this has been a good discussion!!

 Yes, the pictures show some exceptionally healthy plants. They don&apos;t look anywhere near 5 to 6&apos; to me though- am I being biased? They are, however, a good advertisement for your fertilizer.
I&apos;d still like to contact that commercial grower you spoke of to see what his results have been since switching to your product. 
 
 
 
 Another thought: train not head vigorous shoots

 If I&apos;m able to force vigorous upright shoots on my small plants this summer, I&apos;m going to train those shoots, not head like I have before. These shoots we are talking about would be called water sprouts in a fruit tree. Like water sprouts they can be mostly blind wood. To make water sprouts fruit, we train them rather than head. So that&apos;s what I&apos;ll do next time I get I get a chance on blueberries.
What I expect by training them over at a flat angle is lots of upright moderate vigor shoots. I think this could give a lot more fruitful wood in year two than heading like David did.
Any thoughts or comments?

 I&apos;m not getting long winded tonight..We have shoveled about 1/2 tractor trailer load of sawdust today, plus did 12 daylily orders and I&apos;m beat..The real credit should go to my wonderful wife and my boys that help me out so much..Without them I just couldn&apos;t do it..
Thanks for all the positive comments..Sorry I couldn&apos;t get that page made for ya&apos;ll before now..Just a time thing..
Gonebannanas, thisisme, ashleysf, thanks again for the positive comments..I think the pics that really show the growth best are the winter ones, even in the background you can see consistent growth with the exception of the varieties I got from the other vendor last fall..I&apos;ll fertilize them my way and try to catch them up to the others..
Fruitnut - I hope your experiment surpasses what I have done..That goes for everyone else too..I would love to see peole that have more experience than me, and really know what there doing, to try out the same protocols and see if they can make my results seem tiny..That would really make me happy, as I want everyone to suceed, not just a few..
Cebury - Thanks for the comments as well..I was stunned at the growth coming from the base when it first started..I thought something was wrong with them as I had never grown BB before..Those new shoots totally enveloped the original growth of the plant very quick..I had no idea that this wasn&apos;t the norm...If I do get alot of emails for some reason, I hope people understand I&apos;m spread pretty thin right now, but I&apos;ll get back with them as soon as possible..I can&apos;t imagine what I could tell them though..
Harvestman - I have some pics that show one of my 6&apos; tall 275 pound boys next to it holding out a tape measure from bottom to top that can be read very easily and will show scale..I&apos;m just careful about posting pics of my kids..I know you inderstand that..Most all the plants that I grew out are in the 5-6&apos; range now..One exception is Northland, and I think if memory serves me that it&apos;s a half high..Could be wrong though..The Northlands are in the 3-4&apos; range..All the others are larger, except the ones I got last fall.
I&apos;ll try to find some that show scale better..But if you know how big a 3 gallon pot is you can sorta figure it our..A 3 gallon is 12&quot; tall. By the way it&apos;s not &quot;My Fertilizer&quot; just a product I have had some sucess with..I know what you meant though but just want to make that clear..
The grower that switched to Florikan...I&apos;ll give him a call and see if he wants to take calls or emails..I wouldn&apos;t want to say yes without asking..Just a respect thing..I really hope he has had great sucess so far this year but it&apos;s probably to early to tell..Most of my heavy growth was later in the summer..
Never though about training them..I guess what I was trying to accomplish by pruning was basically the same thing..Everytime I would prune, 3-4 shoots would fan out, and then again at next pruning, making the bush fuller with more fruit bearing wood. I can tell you though that there was one group I pruned too late and the new growth didn&apos;t mature into fruiting wood in time..Now instead of fruitbuds and blooms, I just have leaves..No big deal, it was only one row, but a lesson learned..That&apos;s why I kept good records, because now I know when late pruning is really too late..Kind of a fine line..But now that won&apos;t happen again..
Lastly, as I&apos;m about to go to sleep here, I want EVERYONE here to understand that my only, and I mean ONLY reason for ever posting was that I saw a few people struggling and wanted to try and help..I never wanted to shake a hornet&apos;s nest, I just wanted to help..If I have stepped on anyones toes or caused a problem I sincerely apolgize..It&apos;s just not fair to let people struggle with something when you may have a solution that will make there problem go away or at least ease a bit..
Do I have all the answers? No..I&apos;d be lying if I said I did..Have I had sucess with a process..I feel as though so far I have..Will that sucess continue? Who knows..I would sure like to think that they will continue to grow and thrive, but again, I&apos;m no expert...How can you be an expert on this stuff in a short time...No way..We all have to start somewhere though..
Gotta get some sleep now..5am comes early..David.

 David,
Is there a particular reason that you didn&apos;t plant any rabbiteye or Southern highbush types? Or, did I just miss them in the list of varieties you planted?
I&apos;m located 60 miles or so east of you, in Hopkinsville, and for me, the rabbiteye types are vastly more productive(larger bushes&amp;more berries) than the northern highbush types you planted. I&apos;ve had no issues with winter-hardiness or damage.
Have a neighbor whose family runs a U-pick operation down around Adams, TN(about 30-40 miles south of here), and he indicates that the rabbiteye types are the top producers for them.
I know the UofKY folks don&apos;t recommend the rabbiteye or Southern highbush types for most of the state, but down here in southern west KY, I think they&apos;re &apos;the bomb&apos;.

 When I selcted all Northern Highbush it was just based on what I found on the net and what I was told would probably do best here in my climate and micro-climate..Only time will tell if I made the right choices..When I picked these out I was tring to go for a long season with different ripening times, disease and hardniess issues that were at a minimum, and tried and true varieties that would do well and came recommended by others..I have alot of land here so I can always add southern and rabbiteyes if I like but for now I&apos;m seeing how these play out. You get a chance come over and visit..Just give me a call before you come so I can plan some time..Let me know, David.

 Dave,
Your good intentions are clear, I wouldn&apos;t worry about anything since nothing you&apos;ve said was rude or directed at anyone personally. You came along with that one long post (without formatting) claiming to have astounding growth from a fert. It looked suspicious, disorganized, and when someone new comes along with a posting like that it&apos;s usually BS (hit-and-run SPAM) and the person never posts again.
Your statements were challenged and you responded like a rational, caring adult. As your photos helped confirm your growth statements, as equally impressive was your operation that appears thoughtful and professional (as fruitnut commented).
You have four of the top expert posters (of which I&apos;m not one) in this forum participating in your thread

 Yeah I&apos;m sorry about that first post..I was on break and it was the middle of the night ans was trying to slam it all out in a hurry before I had to get back to work.
If I could redo that first post I would and make it easier to read..If anyone knows some on GW that will let me redo it I&apos;ll use more paragraph breaks and what not..
I don&apos;t take anything personal anymore...Just don&apos;t see the point..Now if someone attacks family or friends then that&apos;s another story..But for the most part I am pretty laid back..Life is way to short to be arguing all the time..
Constructive criticism is always good though..I&apos;m glad there are some experts in here, cause I sure am not..
I didn&apos;t realize there was alot of spamming in here but I guess it&apos;s everywhere now..
Kinda hard having a business and trying to post in here sometimes without crossing a line..People ask you something pertaining to your business or your site or something and then your stuck, because you really can&apos;t get into it on GW and I totally agree with that policy and understand..But I&apos;m a gardener and grower of plants I like first, business second..
I have hundreds of pics I took of the BB planting but just tried to pic through and get the ones that were best represenative of my results..
I used the same fertilizer on my Blackberry and Raspberry planting as well..Only problem with that is that both of those plants grow like weeds anyways no matter where your at..so I don&apos;t know what&apos;s normal and what&apos;s not with them..I know there should be ALOT of berries though..Planted about 1,800 of each..
I planted Natchez,Ouachita, and Triple Crown Blackberries... And a dozen Kiowa blackberries just for the heck of it cause I heard when mature the berries on them can be as big as chicken eggs..Saw one guy in Arkansas that had a dozen Kiowa berries in an egg carton..I was sold..
Only thing about Kiowa is that there is no way I&apos;d let anyone piock them, especially kids..If you tripped and fell into those things you would kill yourself trying to get them off you...Even the leaves have thorns..Hope the berries don&apos;t LOL..
I planted Nova and Dormanred raspberries..Love the Nova&apos;s growing habit and taste, but those dormanred&apos;s are prickly as heck..I got them because I was told they would be good in the heat of the summer and would be after Nova..
If anyone has experience with those let me know..I only got enough last year to taste a bit..I liked the Nova&apos;s better I think.
Well I need to get back out and get to spreading more sawdust..Anyone wanna help???

 Dave, thank you very much for your trouble. The pictures helped tremendously. Somehow I pictured your description as being more substantial plants, although the ones you showed are still quite amazing.
You definately have me rethinking blueberry production methods should I ever choose to grow them in my nursery again. For others here, I think your method of first sizing them up in pots may be quite valuable.

 Harvestman- Thanks for the positve comments. I like being challenged as well as long as we keep it constructive..No harm no foul.
I will tell you that the 2 main reasons I potted them in 3 gallon pots were that:
#1 My ground ph wasn&apos;t were it needed to be as I had just applied the elemental sulfur and it had not reacted fully and had time to mellow a bit..Everything I had read seemed to point to being patient with this step or I&apos;d be sorry..So I waited and pulled a sample in the fall and it was right on..Thats when I knew I could plant without any issues with Ph.
#2 Was because I could control 100% or everything they needed. Water, Fertilizer,everything...I thought if I could push the heck out of them that yes my fruit may suffer this first year but the plants would be a few years ahead of what I would have been able to do in the ground..I had alot of money tied up in them and needed every advantage I could get my hands on.
Maybe different protocols would have worked better, maybe not, I just had to make a decision on what methods I was going to use based on the best info I could gather..It could have just as easily been a disaster I suppose..That&apos;s why I took 2 years before I ever jumped into it..When I finally jumped in, I felt I had done all I could do to have sucess.
As far as fullness I was decribing the best to my ability..I really didn&apos;t have anything to compare to, but compared to the way they were when I got them....Well you see my point there...The big 8&apos; diameter bush, canes as big as your wrist type plants, only come with age I suppose..And there is no miracle fertilizer or method that can speed that up...Only time...Just wanted the biggest possible plants I could grow by transplant time. I tell ya they were very heavy lifting and putting into holes..They were just so big and cumbersome compared to say a 1 gallon pot. But all and all worth it...
Like I said if anyone wants to stop by sometime just let me know..I&apos;ll put you to work if you stay too long though...

 Since this thread was primarily about fertilizing, I think it&apos;s worth commenting that Florikan may really be onto something (even inasmuch as the skeptic Harvestman started to buy it).
Florikan&apos;s website describes how their new technology Nutricote, combined with their existing CRF Florikote (this older line is similar and a competitor to Osmocote), is innovative in supplying nutrients in their new line of Staged Nutrient Release Blends. Unless Osmocote has something in the works, I think Florikan may have leap frogged with this new product line.
I doubt there is any 3rd party independent research yet as it&apos;s fairly new, but it is something to certainly give a try based on such anecdotal evidence thus far.

 I suspect many are outside more often, as I am, too.
Dave, you gotta show pictures man to make us real jealous!
My 1st year crop (started out as one twig with very few roots, not the 18month ones you bought) are fairly very small still, not much growth. But the 1yr+ ones have doubled in size. But I need to get the stuff you&apos;re using, I&apos;m seriously looking to move to CRF.
BTW: I had a typo in my last post which changed the meaning significantly. The comma was in the wrong spot. It should&apos;ve read &quot;their new technology, Nutricote combined with Florikote ...&quot; Nutricote is the Japanese invented polymer method (oleofin resin) which is also a big part of their SNR packages. Of course, no EDIT feature in GW!
Question: Are you SURE that link you provided at http://www.florikan.com/d/labels/16-4-9-270.pdf is THE product you are using? I ask because it&apos;s not their new flagship &quot;Staged Nutrient Release&quot;, nor a 3-stage release as you&apos;ve stated above; the 16-4-9-Total-270 is an 80% 2-stage total (NPK+minors) release with the remaining 20% comprised of front-load non-CRF granules and a magnesium CRF. Whereas the SNR can/has prills for individual majors (and/or minors) with different amounts released at different times. The total blends are mostly &quot;total&quot; NPK+Minors coated into one prill, like their regular CRF product. The SNR obviously has many different components in each handful, whereas a 2-stage may have as few as 2 or several more more depending on variety.
The one you apparently are using appears to have 4 different components: One NPK+minors mid-term (grey prill), one NPK+minors late-term (grey prill), some non-coated NPK (unstated nutrients; blue granules), and one mid-term Magnesium CRF (maybe two, unstated; red granules).
I can&apos;t warrant accuracy on the red/blue colors and where I wrote &quot;unstated&quot;, because that was info I deduced based on their literature, pictures, and the blend list. Their technical documentation although comprising 120+ pages [intentionally] walks the fine line between saying what each blend DOES vs. identifying what the exact blend IS. It&apos;s nice and pretty and well organized, but it feels like 50% of EVERY page was covered with testimonials.

 Cebury-
Your correct that is the wrong link but closest thing I could find..I&apos;m now going with the 16-4-9 and 16-4-12 and also some very strong stuff they mixed for me..Doing a test to see just how far I can push them till they explode or die..lol..Stuff like this has to be done though so mistakes are learned from and application rates established..Someone has to be the Guinea pig....
Everything I use is the SNR..The custom mixes are not on there site..As far as testimonials goes...If everyone is getting results like I am seeing here then in my opinion I&apos;m surprised there aren&apos;t more...
Got to remember that Florikan has a product line that covers alot more than berries and daylilies/perennials..What I&apos;m doing is probably just a drop in the bucket to them..
I&apos;m not going to praise them on other fertilizers they have for many other things that grow, because I do not grow other things other than daylilies and berries, so I&apos;m not qualified to comment...I will say this though..If there other ones work as well on trees, shrubs and the whole gambit of things out there, and can do for those thing what they have done in my limited experience then I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to purchase that either..I will almost bet that there other products work as well, but again no first hand knoweledge..I guess that&apos;s where testimonials come in..

Can you tell us for sure the exact blend you are using? Not just the NPK or # of stages. It may not be a given NPK released over # stages; it can get sophisticated as they can release majors and minor nutrients individually and at different stages over different durations.
 I&apos;m now going with the 16-4-9 and 16-4-12 and also some very strong stuff they mixed for me. 
Your website states your &quot;farm is a test plot for Florikan&quot;. Does this mean they concocted a custom blend for blueberries and are testing it out on your farm?
There are folks now (and over time more, as they read this post) who want to try the *exact* product line you&apos;re using. Although I doubt most will be able to, as it&apos;s not a retail product. Especially if it&apos;s a custom test blend asked about above.
For the grower who may read this, their material consistently encourages &quot;call us, we have great service&quot; and they will advise on the best mix for your situation, taking into account your goals, crop, temps, pH, and other soil characteristics, etc. I have a feeling their salesmanship talent is superior once you get on the phone ;-) They even allow a grower to custom design a blend with &quot;only a 4 ton minimum order&quot; . I&apos;m looking for about 4 lbs (to start) ;-)
 Got to remember that Florikan has a product line that covers alot more than berries and daylilies/perennials. 
To put things in perspective, I&apos;m not &quot;in the industry&quot; like others in this thread. I&apos;m a small backyard gardener and a beginner at that. However, I did study their *entire* website including published guides that explain their technology and detail the entire product line (including about a dozen &quot;standard&quot; SNR blends). I&apos;m familiar with reading technical material for various industries and as far as their material goes, it was an easy read.
Oh yeah, seriously Dave, more pics! I&apos;m sure you have lots of free time on your hands since you don&apos;t have to fertilize very often! ;-)

 Wait just a minute here. Florikan&apos;s technology may be a step up from Osmocote but independent evaluations are essential. Not just to see how they stand up to other time release products, but also to the more affordable fertigation techniques popular with the industry. I don&apos;t think you necessarily need control release if you just provide the right balance of nutrients in daily watering.
What I drew from Dave&apos;s testimonial is that putting the blueberries in 3 gallon pots where you have complete control of their environment and give them daily water and the right nutrients you can get much more growth than what I expect when I put a small plant in the ground- acidic soil or not.
If you really want to prove your product, try some other nutrient sources with the same pot culture method.

 I don&apos;t think you necessarily need control release if you just provide the right balance of nutrients in daily watering. 
Keyword here is &quot;need&quot;. I may not need it, but certainly desire it over providing the &quot;right balance of nutrients in daily watering&quot;. I water and fert weakly,weekly for my container fruit trees and they do fine. Reaching 100 containers pushed the time requirements beyond practical. &quot;Once and your done&quot; Staged-CRF sounds like a pipe dream, but I must love pipes or something.
I agree about independent testing. But regardless of their hype, the SNR product doesn&apos;t strike me as revolutionary in it&apos;s complexity, it doesn&apos;t even seem like new technology to me. It&apos;s simply the next logical step in CRF: Providing specific nutrients at the time the plant needs them -- rather than releasing every nutrient simultaneously at some set ratio, over a released schedule (traditional CRF). I&apos;m certainly not as knowledgeable as you, but this is sensible in that it&apos;s attempting to mimic what a good gardener would do manually -- at least one who knows his crops nutritional needs over the growth cycle.
Again for ME, if it works great and reduces effort to &quot;once and you&apos;re done&quot;, I don&apos;t care how it stands up to other techniques in the industry that take more effort -- but yes I do care that it is affordable.
Harvestman: What are some of the &quot;more affordable fertigation techniques popular within the industry&quot;? Are they practical for home gardeners? I&apos;m ready for other methods that don&apos;t require frequent mixing or hand watering distribution. I thought CRF was the way to go, but I&apos;m all ears. Perhaps nutrient injection into low-flow irrigation?

 Cebury -
I had to go back through all my records to find the exact mix I used last year...It was a 16-4-9 Nutricote Total Blend SNR.. This was a trial that they were using and wanted me to try it and see how it would do. I follwed exact application rates at a medium rate. These were 3 gallon pots so that is how I figured the rate.
I talked to Chad keel and he told me that it was a blend similar to the 16-4-9 Total Blend on there site now..
Funny thing happened..Right after I posted here..well within a week or so, the results I sent them(Same as what I posted here) apparently got back to someone in R&amp;D;and now they want me to be a be designated as a trial plot for them to try out some new blends. Had to think about it overnight and agreed to do so..No, I do NOT work for them or have any vested interest in the company..Just want to make sure you all understand that...Don&apos;t want to be accused of anything..
I&apos;m getting 3 different blends from them..A 16-4-9, 16-4-12. and then a very strong SNR they are blending for me...It seems like it was a 18-8-20, but I&apos;m at work and don&apos;t have the email so I may be off a bit. I&apos;m going to third up my field and apply 1/3 on each variety..The stronger blend he wants to wait till the 3rd week of May to apply. I keep up with the results and as I find out things, you all will find out as well...Good and bad..Hows that for honesty...
All the peole I have delt with so far at Florikan have been outstanding in the customer relations area..Very polite and fun to deal with..Very knoweledgable, as I am not about how it all works..You can tell they are passionate about there products..Nice to get that from and AMERICAN company..
More pics??? Jeezers...Yeah right i have sooooo much free time..that&apos;s a BIG LOL....
I&apos;ll post more when they are fruiting I guess..Be glad when this weather stabilizes some..Looks like I have good fruit set though..
Harvestman -
Not sure if your above post was directed at me or Cebury..
I agree with you 100% that all one probably needs to do to get results like I have so far, is to get the combination of nutrients right, plenty of water&apos; and a good PH value that makes the plants happy and you can duplicate my results to a T, I would think. The ONLY reason I&apos;m doing it this way is to save time and that I&apos;m getting good results..Contrary to what people think, I do NOT have ANY spare time in my life..And anything that makes my work load less is welcome
If anyone can come up with better methods at a cheaper cost and that is less time consuming that what I&apos;m doing now, please tell me...I&apos;ll switch in a second...

I&apos;m with you again in that I&apos;ll bet that they will not grow as fast in the ground as in pots..Although they are irrigated and mulched heavy and will get the equivelant rate of fertilizer for in ground. Only time will tell. And I&apos;ll share that too...
I wish I had time to try other methods and nutrient sources, but I just don&apos;t have the time to right now...Wouldn&apos;t even know where to start as I wrapped up everything I learned into my method..If someone has a method I&apos;ll try it though..Just don&apos;t have time to find out what all I would have to get together..
All in all I would say that the method I used to get them to the size they are now was a good decision..I think someone wanting to do a new planting would benifit greatly and probably be ahead 2-3 years by starting them in pots and growing them out at least the first year this way..But time is what makes mature bushes...If someone can develope a method to get them mature quicker then I&apos;m all ears..
I think I have proven though that this is a good way to get started off ahead somewhat..
I&apos;ll be real curious to see the results of the test this year..I&apos;ll try my best to keep you all posted..
One quick question...Do deer bother Blueberries?? I have a huge herd that have been traveling through nightly since we planted them last fall, but they have not even took one nip at them yet...Are they waiting for the fruit to ripen? Same with the blackberries and raspberries...If they are going to I guess some bottles of pee laying around will do the trick..Works good...Let me know..David.

 My interest always goes beyond just quickest easiest recipe for results. I&apos;m totally obsessive abut why something works so I can really make the information my own- in other words tweek it to my own needs.
Dave&apos;s production technique is different to me more for the size of his pots than his fertilizer formula, and I would love to know how much that influences the vigor of his plants. Usually a one gallon pot holds the kind of plant Dave started with for at least a year in commercial production.
Potting mix and pots cost a lot more than fertilizer. Blueberries may well respond more to a larger space for roots than most other plants- they certainly behave differently than other plants I grow as far as root growth is concerned. The roots take years to leave the pots when I set the pots in the ground while other plants will send out roots to the surrounding soil in one season.
The near 100% organic matter of Dave&apos;s mix may also be an essential component of the rapid growth and the fertilizer may not be nearly as affective in real soil applications.
I agree that for a home grower, using time release is the best option for convenience- although adding a TBS of Miracle Gro to 5 gallons of water, as I do with all water I give my vegetable starts is pretty quick. You could attach one of those hose feeders to water your blueberries with a similar dilute mixture without too much effort.
What I want to know, is how good are Florikans formulations compared with the balance in Mir. Gr. type products. Is it only the precision of the release that makes them better or is the specific balance of nutrients important? I can&apos;t take Florikans word on the answer to that question but I&apos;m not quite curious enough to do the research myself.

 Harvestman-
I have to go for quick and easy...No time at all extra..I&apos;d love to be able to run many different tests but just don&apos;t have time..
I chose 3 gallon pots on the theory that Blueberry roots need more width than depth...The pot size surely didn&apos;y hurt any..Contrict roots and constrict growth..That much I know is certain from growing daylilies in pots for 15 years...We pot up 5,000 annually.
Here is a tip for pots..If you need a large quantity, get them from BWI if they are in your region..I get my 1 gallon pots for 12 cents each..That&apos;s only 12.00 dollars per sleeve of 100. The 3 gallons are 47 cents each in quantity of 100 or more. Just thought I&apos;d share that..Now that my Blueberry bushes are planted I have 1,000 3 gallon pots to pot up larger daylilies in..Love that recycling...
I just got done fertilizing the blueberries..I mean just right now..1,000 plants took 2-50 pound bags of fertilizer..I did 1/4 with 16-4-9 180 snr at low rate, 1/4 with the same at medium rate, and 1/4 16-4-12 180 snr at low rate, and 1/4 with the same at medium rate. Did all the potted cuttings from last year with 16-4-12 at high rate..What the hell huh...
Be curious to see how this all pans out..I recorded what went where so as to see if there are any changes...I&apos;ll let everyone know as time allows...
I always used miracle grow on my veggie garden with great results as well..
I irrigate the berries and can inject whatever I want into the lines..Pretty cool set up..
As far as Florikan vs. Miracle grow...Not sure whats in MG..Aint that funny ...never really looked...Always bought and used it on there reputation..Sound familiar??? LOL..
Anyway..The way in which Florikan releases is the key..If there is a key at all..They are multicoated with different layers of this nurtrient or that one and at 77 degrees average temp the first coating starts activating the release agents(Must be top secret) and then the next layer after that to release what the plant needs at the corresponding time and so on..Pretty neato stuff if you really read what they do..I think thats probably why it works so much better than alot of fertilizers out there...No bashing now..Just speaking my opinion..
Well of to bed in a bit..Last night of work this week. Everyone have a good weekend...keep your powder dry..

 I&apos;ve seen rapid vertical growth in blueberries that had their light source threatened. All that had happened is I&apos;d left the grass grow high around the 1ft plants which grew fast. Within severa weeks the blueberries had grown thick, quite well leaved, entirely vertical shoots of well over two feet to stay above the grass heads. Eventually I cut the grass and was left with much bigger plants which went on to keep growing at their normal rate from then on. No fertilizer was added to mine and the plants didn&apos;t seem to suffer, it just appeared to beweed like growth the plant was easily capable of if it was needed.
I&apos;m not saying the Florikan isn&apos;t doing what you describe but looking at the pictures of how you&apos;ve set the plants out, could be that competition for light could be partially responsible for rapid growth in yours too.

 Dablaw: Thanks for looking through your paperwork/calling to find out the formula. If they told you &quot;this is a custom blend we recently created&quot; then the &quot;16-4-9 Total Blend SNR&quot; doesn&apos;t really tell me what it is. I could be wrong, but it&apos;s more likely they just handed you their established &quot;16-4-9 Total&quot; and the &quot;16-4-12 SNR&quot; these are both listed in their catalog.
If the link you provided IS the actual one you started with (which it very well may be) that&apos;s all I needed to know.

 One thing that&apos;s missing from this thread is that blueberry fertilization is recommended in the early spring because blueberries have a very short window in which the roots can most effectively absorb N. To me, this blows Florikan&apos;s theory of timed release out of the water. The fertilizer may be the best timed release product on the market, but that is immaterial if the roots can&apos;t absorb the timed release.
Dave, I certainly don&apos;t doubt your success w/ Florikan, but you appear to be very conscientious about a great many factors (i.e. watering plants daily) that may have contributed to the success of the blueberries.

 Mootube-
Although I&apos;m sure not dicounting what you say about the competition theory, It&apos;s not one I would recommend as nothing needs that much competition IMHO.
The plants you are no doubt talking about being close together are the ones in the pics I have showing them all crowded together..I had the same growth out of one section that had 110 plants in it that were not close together at all...sooooo...
Cebury -
The custom blend I&apos;m referring to was brand new at that time...not at the time of this posting..and the same with the 16-4-12..
Chad Keel told me that the ones I received were not in the online catalog..the 16-4-9 is not a total that I got now...neither is the 16-4-12..Sorry I&apos;m not much help in that area..I&apos;m just getting what they advise...The labels are nothing like the ones on the site...Sorry..But the link is very close to what I&apos;m using and don&apos;t think that there is a huge difference...
The 18-8-20 I&apos;m going to apply in mid May I know they don&apos;t mix yet for general sale..I am just experimenting right now..When that application is applied I should have all the info in place to see any significant changes over 13 varieties of blueberries, with 5 different application rates, and 3 formulas..
Should be alot of info to process and hopefully I can be able to have a halfway educated discussion after everything I absorb this season..I hope by me being the guinea pig it will save alot of others money and time, as well as making very expensive mistakes..
Olpea -
Here is what I know so far about how Frorikan releases not only N but P and K and the micros...
At 77 degrees(I think I previously said 72-73) the N is released because at 77 degrees they have tested that this is when the greatest need for N starts, followed by a need for P and K with K and the micros being released at a staged(not timed) in unison with the corresponding needs of that particular plant. That is why they not only have the different NPK ratio&apos;s but have anywhere from 80-360 day release times..It took me more time than my pea brain can handle to get a grasp on it but finally the bell went off and I had my &quot;Well Duhhh&quot; moment when it finally sunk in.
Florikan is not at all affected by water..The fertilizer I laid down yesterday will be the same on moday after we are experienceing 10 inches of freakin rain..By the way my 1 acre pond is full now..Was dry a week ago...
The concentric coatings and associated release agents are pre-programmed to start at 77 degrees(for what I&apos;m using anyway)..That puts the wheels in motion and from there it&apos;s agents start a process and release in stages that are in direct corelation to the plants needs during the year...
What&apos;s great about that is that I can lay it down in January if I want to and until thew temps hit an average daytime temp of 77 degrees, it will just lay there..Not getting diluted by rain or affected by the sun or any other factors. What better time than mid winter to fertilize when everyhting else is kinda caught up..I gurantee you that after this season all mine will be done in the winter..I&apos;ll just get a longer release time of say 270-360 days instead of 180 days like this year..
That&apos;s where I think they have really done there homework..And please..I have no idea if other companies do the same thing..I can&apos;t check out all companies..Just know what I am learning and seeing..
If someone else can find a better one to try, then please send me the info and an order form...I&apos;ll be glad to use it..
I suggest that if anyone want to try and challenge them or there products to give them a call...Talk to either Chad Keel -Field rep...or Harmon Gilbert Head of R&amp;D...Just;be forwarned that these guys arent like me..They know EVERYTHING about there products..So if your going to challenge them..Be prepared...LOL...Olay!!
Nobody ever answered me on the deer question??? Do they browse on BB bushes or the berries???

 Olpea:
Hadn&apos;t heard what you are saying about bb only effectively taking up N in spring. I can tell you mine respond any time of year that it&apos;s warm. If I apply a dilute rate of 21-0-0 or complete water soluable fertilizer, they will respond with new growth within a month. If I keep pushing the fertilizer they will keep growing. It&apos;s not that hard to push them into the type of vigorous growth David describes.
Ordinarily I haven&apos;t wanted 5-6ft of growth a year, certainly not on bearing plants. But I have no doubt it can be done. I have some small plants that I&apos;m pushing now. I&apos;ll report back later. I also have plants that have been in the same 15 gal pots without repotting for 6 years. I&apos;m certain I could double their height from 4ft to 8ft in one year.

 Blueberries are not a preferred plant of deer but in heavy pressure years they create havoc by feeding on current season shoots. I haven&apos;t observed them feeding on the fruit. Maybe Florikan is working on a time-release deer repellent.

 Fruitnut,
I&apos;ve read that blueberries most effectively absorb N at spring. I can&apos;t remember the numbers, but it was something like they can absorb 50% of the N in the springtime, and it goes down to something like 25% absorption in the summer. I can&apos;t remember exactly where I read it, but it was some credible publication (MSU or something).
Upon further reflection, I would say this does not negate Florican&apos;s theory of timed release, or your multiple application method. All it really means is that the best &quot;bang&quot; for the buck is spring applications, where blueberries take up a higher percentage of the N applied. Which, as I remember now, was the point of the article.

 Oldpea -
The main reason I chose to use the florikan brand was that I could put it on anytime I wanted and basically get the same results if there was enough warm seasonal growing time left for them to grow..
Like I said, from now on I&apos;ll be fertilizing in mid winter and be done with it..That&apos;s the beauty of this stuff or any other snr out there that will do the same.
It&apos;s much easier for me to have a free day in the winter than during the growing season..
I want to share one other find that will be of use as well..Hi Yield brand Grass Killer is safe to use in and around blueberry plants without any harm to them..I sprayed 2 potted ones last year on a 100 degree day and sprayed it full strength and they never stopped growing or showed ill effects from it..
My next test is I&apos;m going to spray some Amine 400 2,4-d on them to see what happens..This is a broadleaf weed killer. I have a feeling it will probably kill the crap out of them, but if they show little or no effects that would be huge...To be able to control grasses and broadleafs early in the season would be great..Maybe already someone knows what works and what doesn&apos;t??? If so please share...

 Hi all,
After reading all these posts I am a bit confused. I am attempting to plant blueberries as a makeshift hedge. I replaced all the lovely Florida sand with a mix of garden soil, peat, manure, and pine bark. The PH is right at 7.
Do you think using the Epsoma soil acidifier and the vinegar/water trick will lower the PH enough to keep the little guys happy? I&apos;m not too worried about berry production right now but would like some good growth. Everything grows like gangbusters here but you guys have got me worried.
Should I also use some Miracid when I plant?

 O.K. I&apos;m baaaacccckkkkkk...The results from the Amine 400 2-4,d was that it killed the blueberry plant I tested DEAD when soaked in it...Again The Hi-Yield brand grass killer for grasses do not have any affect on BB plants..
So nearly been a month now since I last posted..Blueberry bushes look good with the exception of being weighted down so much on youger canes with so many berries..I guess that is one fault of growing them too quick...
All in all things seem to be going well with the test on fertilizer amounts...No real noticable difference in low and medium rates yet or between the 2 blends..
Starting to see some new shoots coming up which is encouraging...The ones I had left over in pots seem to be ahead a bit though, and greener...Alot of that issue is using fresh sawdust instead of aged...I guess as the dust breaks down it&apos;s robbing a bit of N but I can&apos;t say that it is causing harm...No yellowing or anything, just some reddish color...Some of that could be from the last month or so&apos;s cooler temps...Now were in the upper 80&apos;s and low 90&apos;s andthey are greening up fast so I suspect the cool weather to be the biggest culprit of that...
Looks like I have only lost around a dozen or so plants out of 3.5 acres so thats good too...Never seen so many raspberries and blackberries in my life..They must really like it here..Blueberries are producing well and just starting to ripen...Duke, Hannah&apos;s Choice,Draper, and Patriot are the farthest along..
I have to say that out of the 13 varieties I am growing that Patriot seems to be the worst performer overall..They are the only variety out of the 13 that are not growing well and have very few berries..I&apos;ll give em a few more years and if they continue to decline or underperform, out the will go...They have the same exact growing conditions as the other 12 varieties I grow...Anyone else notice issues with Patriot??? Hope everyones Blueberries are doing well..

 Dave,
i purchased 18 blueberry bushes over a month ago and out of the 6 varieties, i have only encountered problems with the patriots. nothing too serious but annoying non the less. those problems consisted of extreme reddening of the leaves and dropped flower/fruiting buds. i was told the cold was to blame but with the beautiful warm weather here in central nj the patriots have rebounded and are now doing well, but refuse to grow fruiting buds.
in any case, i am new to growing blueberries and i am trying to find a decent fertilizer. in doing so i stumbled on this thread where you mentioned useing 16-4-9 so i searched high and low for the florikan 16-4-9 with no luck. so instead i bought a 50 lb bag of florikan total 17-5-8; thinking if the numbers are close then im good lol. any truth to that? like i said before im new to all of this so mistakes will be made. i am hoping to grow extraordinary blueberry bushes like the ones you have successfully grown so i can start my own u-pick within the next couple of years. if you or anyone els can help alleviate some of my ignorance i would greatly appreciate it. thanks
-Matt

 apex:
You don&apos;t want fruiting buds on plants purchased one month ago. Many people recommend removing most of the fruit the first year. Blueberries have such a high tendency to overbear while young that I can&apos;t disagree.
The wood that the plants are growing now will fruit next year. You won&apos;t see prominent fruit buds until next spring but they will be there.

i appreciate the concern but i think i may have led you to believe my plants are a month old. i purchased my blueberry bushes almost a month an a half ago, to be exact, and from what i was told, they range from 3-4 years of age. the bushes are all about 2&apos;-3&apos; in height and have quite a few clusters of small green blueberries, with the exception of the patriots which are very bushy but lack flower/fruit growth. from what i read online only 1-2yr plants should have their flower/berry buds picked off. there is a chance that i could be mistaken so please correct me if i am wrong.

 How big were the pots they came in? If they were at least 3 gallon than you should hope for fruit the first season. Be careful- those potted plants will dry out in a single day when it&apos;s as warm as it&apos;s been. You can be set back a whole season if they get too dry. Takes a while for potted blueberries to establish roots in the surrounding soil.

 Harvestman:
when i purchased the bushes they were in either 2 or 3 gallon containers; definitely not smaller than 2 gallon. and you&apos;re right they can dry out fast, but i water them almost every morning except on days when rain is forecast. they are mulched with about 3 inches of small pine nuggets, which helps keep the soil moist a bit longer.
anyone:
i purchased some 17-5-8 time released fertilizer and i was wondering, should just throw the fertilizer onto the soil or mix it in? i know that sounds like a dumb question but would it work the same if i just throw it on there then cover it back up with the pine bark?

 Apex - Thanks for the info on the Patriots...Mine are doing exactly the same here in Ky, so this leads me to beleive that it&apos;s a variety issue..They were the slowest to grow and thrive compared to the other varieties I grow.
As far as the Florikan Fertilizer..The 17-5-8 should be ok...I&apos;m no expert on this but I&apos;m with your line of thinking that if the numbers are that close it should be ok, especially if it&apos;s a SNR...
It needs to be incorporated at least 2&quot; under the mulch or just at the mulch/soil interface to work properly...This is per Chad Keel at Florikan&apos;s instructions..But you would be ok to place on the top of the soil then cover with mulch I would think, especially if they are established plants...
Fruitnut - Good to here from you..I agree that rubbing off the fruit buds is best, but I&apos;m wanting to see what the consequences of letting them fully fruit this year will have on subsequent years, and will more and more fertilizer have to be used to offset this stress of putting on fruit so soon.. I hope some of this info will benefit other coming in behind us that are wanting to grow BB plants without as much trial and error.
Harvestman - Good to here from you as well..Your dead on on the watering of potted BB plants..Apex, heed his warning..When it&apos;s over 70 degrees potted plants start evaporating moisture and need frequent watering.. Over 85 degrees or more and daily watering is a must..
Apex when I first potted mine up last year I put them in the 3 gallon pots and fertilized and then cover with double ground pine nuggets...Worked great..
Funny thing today..Had a guy stop by when I was outside watering potted daylilies and some of the BB bushes I started from cuttings last year...He told me he lived a few miles down the road and watch our progress daily as he would drive by..He said he couldn&apos;t stand it anymore and had to ask where we got BB plants that size and that they must have cost a fortune..
I told him the story, and he ended up wanting some of the left over BB plants I grew and some of the last years cuttings..I think he felt a little more at ease about growing BB plants now, and he left happy..I guess that is the kind of reward that money can&apos;t buy...Made me feel good to help someone and make them feel better...
I told him about all the info here on GW in the Fruit and Orchards forum and he says he&apos;s going to start digging around here for info..
Anyhow....Back to the salt mines..Breaks over..

 Dave, I hope the next time you start some blueberry plants you&apos;ll try fertilizing a few with another slow release fertilizer to see how much your results are dependent on the Florikan formula. I&apos;d like to see a comparison to Osmocote at a similar NPK ratio.

 Patriot is a smaller plant than many other blueberries. You can expect it to finish 3-5 feet tall. So if your complaint is that it is smaller with the same care, you might reconsider.
Of the 5 varieties I grow, it is the smallest. Most of the cold rated high bush varieties are actually &quot;half bush&quot; size.
Jersey is the only cold rated variety that I have that is an 8 footer.
Patriot usually produces well.

 Dave:
I have a few Japanese Haskap plants being delivered in about a week, Tungra and Borealis, and i was wondering what type of soil mix you use to grow yours? also do you use the same florikan fertilizer on the Haskap plants as well? if you have any other helpful tips on growing them that would be great. seems that its kinda hard to get growing info on these plants since they arnt grown much here in the US. i plan on potting them up just like my blueberries. thanks

 Harvestman - I&apos;ll try some osmocote to do a comparison next time I do cutting..Not sure when that will be..
Oregon - Thanks for the info on the Patriot variety..It just seems that variety is either doing great or dies..No in between with it..Seems very finicky compared to the other 12 varieties I planted..And like I said before the whole field had got the same treatment, so there is no reason, that I can see anyway, there should be an issue...
Apex - I would like to congratulate you on you &quot;Haskap&quot; plants but unfortunately what you are getting is not Japanese Haskap..The hybridizer of those 2 varieties in Canada is using that term very loosely, calling the Japanese Haskap only because the people that head up the japanese haskap market deemed them acceptable enough to be considered &quot;Haskap&quot; The name &quot;Haskap&quot; in my opinion as well as Maxine Thompson&apos;s,(Only breeder of true japanese Haskap) should be reserved for plant material consisting of exclusively japanese plant material lines of breeding.
The Canadian people are pushing this, planting hundreds and hundreds of acres of Tundra and Borealis as well as the numbered seedings as well..They are very limited as to what will grow in there prairies and Maxine has found that those that do well in Canada fill the cold hour requirements way to early for the U.S. and will bloom prematurely before any pollinators (bees) are out, thus not getting proper fruitset...Many times they will also break dormancy during warm spells in the winter and start growing then get extreme damage from a weather change again..
They are pushing this market to a fever pitch point and are very apprehensive about anyone developing a market for &quot;Haskap&quot; in the U.S. They have already emailed me, and you can tell by there tone that they are nervous at the idea of someone infringing on there market they thought they had complete control of..
I&apos;m sure if they read this as well that they will email me all hateful again..Oh well..This is the United States Of America, and the last time I looked we have free enterprise here still...
As far as the mix is used on the Haskap I have...I just use some composted leaves, mulch, topsoil and a little fertilizer and thats about it.
Out of the 33 Haskap seedlings I grow, I am getting some real interesting flavors in the berries...Peach, a raspberry blueberry blend,and a few with flavors I just can&apos;t relate to anything..Good thing is that Haskap do not need acid soil to thrive, and are very cold tolerant...The true Japanese varieties that we are growing do not break dormancy prematurely either...Good luck with the Tundra and Borealis..Hope they do well for you...

thanks for the info but is there any way that you will sell me some of those haskap plants??? lol. im just really serious about growing haskap. i&apos;ll even go as far as flying all the way to your farm in Kentucky to personally hand you cash for a couple plants! no matter the price. sounds crazy but i feel kinda cheated with the borealis and tundra.

 Sorry can&apos;t sell haskap plants yet because of an agreement I have with the hybridizer..Maybe in a few year we will have some seedlings selected for propagation for the general marketplace..Just want to make sure that the plant and the berries are top performers and that takes time as you know...

 Well it&apos;s been nearly a month since an update on the BB tests so here goes...
First I&apos;d like to say that our poundage is as follows as of today:
Blueberries - 2,600 pounds
Blackberries - 4,300 pounds
Raspberries - 920 pounds
I&apos;m very happy with the totals this year, especially since we just planted last year. They more than paid for there selves in one season. That I&apos;m very happy about.
The Blueberry plants averaged 2.6 pounds per plant so far. Not bad for plants a year old..
Blackberry plants blew me away with there pounds so far..
Natchez is hands down the biggest and best tasting blackberry I have ever seen..All the u-pickers went nuts over them..They avearge about 2 or more inches long and an inch to inch and a half wide. 20 of them weigh a pound. I have pics too. I had no idea they were this size when we purchased them.
Ouachita is the sweetest Blackberry and around quarter size or bigger. Very high yeilding.
Triple Crown Blackberry is just now coming in and absolutely loaded with berries. The texture of TC is chewy somewhat but very sweet...Love em..
Nova red raspberry proved to be a good early season red raspberry that has a cool clean taste.
Dormanred raspberry is awesome as a hot weather plant with it just laughing at the 100 degree plus days and high humidities we have been having..The berries are huge and hang in clusters like grapes...Outstanding...
Of all the Blueberries I&apos;d have to say that jersey is sweetest,followed by duke,collins,and draper. For size Hannah&apos;s choice,followed by bonus,chandler, and bluecrop with Bluejay good as well..
In the fertilizer test we did here is what I found...
Where we used the high application rate the plants were more vigorous compared to the medium rate. I kind of thought that&apos;s how it would be but did this test to see if more was needed to get better results..It seems that the high app rate works best..Lots of ne growth in the field, just as happened in pots last year..I cannot see any ill effects on the plant letting them bear this year heavy..Time will tell with that though..
Out of 1,000 Blueberry plants I have counted 26 that have died..Not too bad of an average I suppose..I&apos;ll replant them this fall.
Oh one other thing..I grew a few plants of Kiowa blackberry. They are extremely thorny but had to see if the rumore were true about chicken egg sized berries...The rumors are true..My oldest sons GF pulled one out of there the other day that was bigger than a egg..I took a pic to compare..Oh and they taste good too..Very sweet and small core and seeds for such monster berries..
Hope to hear from all of you..David.

 This thread has been very interesting for me. The high growth rates produced by pushing high nitrogen fertilizer explains why so many container grown plants are so susceptible to disease. If I only ate 4 dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts per day, I would put on weight, but would I be healthy? Using organic plant foods produces plants with slower growth that is less susceptible to disease.
I don&apos;t want the fastest growth from my plants, I want ROBUST growth. If you go back to the original question in this thread you can get the point exactly. If CHASGH had been told to use an organic plant food mixture, it would have been almost impossible to damage the plants.

 gtippit, sounds like your speaking from religion and not science. pushing growth is just as likely to help fight disease as encourage it, depending on the disease and plant.
in my nursery, I much prefer starting with plants that have been pushed and are very vigorous, not so much for higher survival rates as for accelerating growth and marketability. organic n is identical to synthetic and you can push plants with the organic stuff as well- say your own urine which is about a day from being urea.
i agree that excessive N is often used in ways that encourage disease or early death of plants such as lawns that become more susceptable to fungus problems when pushed with too much N and water and large trees which companies will push fertilizing when they are already of adequate size. trees eventually grow themselves to death and fertilizing them can speed the process. big watery cells with thin walls seem to encourage sucking insects and fungus as well. however, sometimes extra N is said by cornell to help trees outgrow an invasive fungus.
dablaw, congratulations. i&apos;m happy for your success and grateful for the information you&apos;ve provided here.

 As far as my education in biolgy, if you think yours is bigger, I&apos;ll take your word for it, &apos;cause I don&apos;t play those games with other men.
You just reinforced the point of my post about nursery container plants and excess fertilizer. You said you don&apos;t care so much whether the plant lives or dies after it&apos;s sold. You said you only care about getting the biggest plant you can to market as fast as possible. I have wondered for many years why container grown plants often struggle after being put into the ground. With bare root and ball&amp;burlap;plants the stress from root loss causes transplants some problems. With container grown nursery plants, there should be no stress, yet they often still struggle after being put into the ground. Nursery growers are putting out large plants the same way that Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds hit homeruns.
When it comes to putting toxic nerve agents on my food before I eat it, I am somewhat religiously against it. For fertilizers I&apos;m not a purist about organic methods. For my tomato plants I use epson salt and a water soluable high phosphate fertilizer for foliar feeding after I start picking ripe tomatoes. Manure on the roots of plants is fine, but I prefer not to have it on the tomato I&apos;m about to eat for dinner. (To paraphrase an old joke, I prefer salt and pepper, but some people same I&apos;m a bit slow.) I spray a dilute solution of these to provide magnesium and phosphorus, which seem to encourage successive blooming on my indeterminate tomato vines.
If you search with Google Scholar for &quot;excess nitrogen plant disease&quot; you will get your choice of scientific studies. Here is an abstract on just one study on the subject.
&quot;This multidisciplinary study examined the effects of nitrogen fertilization on nectarine yield, fruit quality, brown rot and moth pests. Results indicate that excess nitrogen fertilization did not increase fruit yield or improve fruit quality; however, fruit on overfertilized trees were more susceptible to attack from brown rot, peach twig borer and oriental fruit moth.&quot;
http://californiaagriculture.ucanr.org/landingpage.cfm?article=ca.v049n04p13&amp;fulltext;=yes
The authors of the study are plant patholgy PhDs. Theirs are probably bigger than yours.
In &quot;The Effect of Nitrogen on Disease Development and Gene Expression in Bacterial and Fungal Plant Pathogen&quot; from the European Journal of Plant Pathology, the authors show how it is specifically excess nitrogen in plant tissue that triggers many plant pathogens. Giving plants a diet of high nitrogen fertilizer is like giving your kids a diet of pure sugar. Plants need nitrogen and kids need sugar, but giving too much in either case causes problems.
In addition to it being bad for the plants and the environment, when you are talking about fruits and vegetables, the quality of the produce is reduced. An organically grown home tomato has more taste than one grown using artificial fertilizers that lack all the micro-nutrients the plants need.
One of the most effective tools for feeding plants and suppressing plant pathogens is foliar feeding with compost tea. Unfortunately it does not work very well with blueberries because of the waxy coating of their leaves, especially rabbiteye bushes.
Agriculture researcher tried for years to find any cost effective way to control destructive plant parasitic nematodes. By accident a student at Georgia Tech a few years ago found the best control measure yet. His family ran a shellfish processing facility on the Florida panhandle. Their cartage fees for shrimp and crap shells were expensive, so the student helped his father set up a process to compost the shells and sell the finished compost as high nitrogen plant food. Farmers discovered that when the microbes that fed on the chitin of the shells were put on fields with nematode problems, the microbes began devouring the nematodes, whose bodies are also made up largely of chitin. Prior attempts with almost everything short of thermonuclear weapons had failed to rid infected fields in south Georgia and north Florida.

 Of course excess means damaging. What I objected to was your blanket condemnation of quick release fertilizers which have their place. Too much of most things is damaging- that&apos;s why it&apos;s called excess.
My nursery business is about selling bearing age trees to customers who usually than have me take care of their trees after I install them. These trees are healthy and strong and loss to disease or other issues is very rare. Probably that&apos;s why so many of my customers have been with me for well over a decade and I have close to no turnover. Of course, I don&apos;t use excess N. in managing any trees.
You sound pretty religious to me or should I say ideological. Your welcome to your beliefs but the way you instantly asserted that I don&apos;t care whether my babies live or die indicates more emotion than rational thinking to me.

 I meant that I didn&apos;t expect higher survival rates from plants just because they were juiced. Scrawny trees I get from nurseries that don&apos;t push growth generally survive also- but they take me a year or 2 longer to get to marketable size.
I don&apos;t think the trees I get that have been pushed, presumably with generous N, are less healthy or more prone to disease.
Sure, truce.
By the way, Dave&apos;s using time release N and he&apos;s feeding his family with the money from the plants he&apos;s pushed with ample N. It&apos;s fine to grow food organically but I think what Dave&apos;s doing is also quite impressive.

 OK guys...Glad you worked out that issue..lol...I&apos;m so dense I guess I totally missed something but I&apos;m leaving it alone..
Harvestman..Good to hear from you and hope your having a productive year...And yes your right...Those plants I pushed paid for themselves in one season with some left over..That was my whole point of pushing them..I din&apos;t know how it would all turn out but so far so good..I think just having a good growing year with no late freezes helped alot too, so the plants were able to start growth early and never slow down..
The sawdust mulch at 4-6 inches deep is a key thing for the BB bushes..The surrounding ground is very dry as we have had no rain in weeks...But scrape back the sawdust and the soil has very good moisture content and cool as well..I think that is a must for success...
We had another 60# of Blueberries picked today..I planted them to ripen in succession across the field...The Dukes and Hannah&apos;s choice are almost done..Patriot,Draper,Collins and Blueray have another week and they will be done...Northlands and Bluejay are winding up soon too..Bluecrop,Bonus,Chandler,and Jersey still have quite a few green ones left..And Aurora is just coming in..Kinda nice the way ripening progresses across the field..
My opinion on organic is this..I&apos;m impressed with anyone who can grow veggies or any other hort crop without chemicals..
Here is my approach: I use no pestisides what so ever until all the fruit is picked out for the year..The only bug I am having issues with is the Jap beetles..I knew it would be an issue but I just let them have a few berries and there happy..I&apos;ll bet between all berries I grow they didn&apos;t eat or ruin over 15-20 pounds of fruit..
It would have cost me more in liquid sevin to fight them than I lost in fruit..And I would have had alot of berries rot while waiting the 7-10 days for the sevin to disperse enough to safely harvest..I think this was the right approach for me anyways..Let me know you guys opinion though...
As far as herbicides..I spray poast for grass on the edges or the rows only and ONLY on a dead calm day with my nozzle setting wide open as to not cause mist...I use roundup for other weeds in and around the Blackberry and Raspberry plantings only..Works great with very minimal damage..
All herbicides are applied ONLY around plants that are either done fruiting or between pickings(4-5 days) If the berries are approaching ripeness I don&apos;t use anything..I&apos;ll just catch up and spray heavier AFTER all the fruit is picked...
I believe this is a very safe approach to handling both issues of insects and grass/weeds. And I still know how to use a hoe and to just pull some weeds as well..
Organic No...All natural...I don&apos;t know...Safe, yes..I want people to feel safe eating right from the bush and I will anytime I have pickers in the field..I wouldn&apos;t let anyone eat something I wouldn&apos;t eat myself..
Just to be clear I hardly have even sprayed at all..Just a little here and there and usually it&apos;s a row or a variety that is done fruiting for the season so no harm anyhow..
I haven&apos;t sprayed sevin yet anywhere but will in a few weeks when all fruiting is done on a whole variety.
BTW Harvestman..I got me some Osmocote that I found in a cabinet and will do a somewhat controlled comparison next season to see what happens..
I pulled a soil sample last week and I&apos;m still at 4.8-5.4 avearge over the field..It has now been somewhat over a year since the elemental sulfur application..
Thhis has sure been an enjoyable discussion and at 135 followups has to a record huh?
Can&apos;t wait to total up the results from pounds produced and health or the plants come sept or so..Be a good long post about that...I really hope this helps someone not go through as many growing pains as I have..Later Taters,David.

 Had a few minutes on break to offer up a little more info...
I did a application rate trial and here is what the results were in a nutshell..I will post exact results later when I&apos;m home and have my records, but basically here is what I found..
I used two different Florikan Staged Release Fertilizers for this test..16-4-9 and 18-4-12.
The 16-4-9 and 18-4-12 had results that were indistinguishable..The difference was in the application rates.
I applied low and medium rates on all 13 varieties we grow.
The low rates were not enough to sustain the plants and 30-45 days after applied, the plants started showing signs of nitrogen deficiency. The medium rate application stayed with the plants and is still making them perform well. Good green foliage, pleanty of new growth, and were able to thrive during peak berry production periods and still maintain a healthy plant..
Like I said I&apos;ll post all 13 varieties with detailed rates if there is enough interest here to warrant it..If not I won&apos;t bother..I&apos;m passing all this info along to Florikan, as they were wanting to know if growers noth and south of me would need low or medium rates, as well as what I would need here..
They are going to take all this info and try to tweak there applications for BB..Kind of shocked me when they said that if growers could get by with a more cost effective low rate then that would be great...I thought they were in the trade to make money by selling lots of fertilizers...And they are, but they all seem to genuinely care about all of our successes..Kind of rare these days to find a company that cares..
The only Blueberries I have now are Aurora..What great berries..Huge and tasty..Can&apos;t wait till they are mature plants..
Triple Crown Blackberries are in right now and man oh man are they sweet and tasty...I&apos;m very impressed with them..I picked 10, 5 quart buckets of them this morning..It only took me a little over an hour to do so...
The flavor of TC when you eat it fills your whole mouth and sinuses with a super sweet, one day away from fruity wine kind of taste, that will knock your socks off...
Lastly the Kiowa&apos;s, although thorny, are the freakiest large Blackberries I have ever seen..I took some pics and I&apos;ll post em on my site as time allows..Big as a chicken egg?? Yes they are...
Fruitnut,Harvestman...How are all ya&apos;ll doing???

 Dave, I need a deeper well. We are having drought here for the first time in what seems like a decade. My blueberry plants (except those in pots) have not gotten any supplementary water of significance for over a month but are holding up and supplying the most highly flavored fruit in memory.
Last year fruit was bland because of continuous rain and cool for 2/3s of summer. Early plum (Methely and Early Majic) are also very highly flavored but cots have been a bit dry. Raspberries amazing as I&apos;m sure will be the blacks when they ripen.
I&apos;m still waiting for your comparison to Osmocote. I&apos;m inclined to think that your secret is large pots, lots of water and plenty of available N but that the brand may not be as important as you think. Prove me wrong again!

 Ok...Now that the app rate for fertilizer is over I re-fertilized to bring all the plants up to speed together..I have a question on a few varieties that I&apos;m growing that are just not doing well..I&apos;d like to know if anyone else knows if these bb varieties are more difficult to grow..Keep in mind I grow 13 varieties..
1st is Patroit...Aweful..Didn&apos;t perform that well in pots before planting and really has suffered in the ground. Leaves are constantly a red tinge and just lagging along..Had several die.
2cd is Collins...Although not suffering as much as Patriot, it&apos;s a close second..Not as many red leaves but the smaller ones are really struggling..
3rd is Bonus..This one was one that I got from another vender last fall and was small in 1 gallon pots along with several others...It was nice and bushy though, and healthy green and now the whole row is turning reddish and suffering..
Keep in mind that all are treated the same way except for the fertilizer test but ironically these that are suffering received avearge, not low rates...
If you read this post you know that the whole field was treated the same, so that&apos;s not an issue or they would all be suffering..Rows of other varieties on both sides are thriving with tons of new growth and good green foliage..
The only thing I&apos;m thinking is that the month of June was near or above 100 degrees almost every day, and no rain, although we irrigate...All have 4+ inches of sawdust..All applied the same way and the same type of sawdust..So if the sawdust was an issue depleting N from the plants, they would all have the same symptoms I would think.
The heat is the only factor I can see playing a role here..If someone sees something I&apos;m not please speak up..
Soil test on every row provided a consistent 4.8-5.4 average.
I&apos;m thinking that there just must be some varieties that will not tolerate a Ky. summer..Should I just accept this and replant with one of the other 10 varieties that are thriving...
I chose the varieties I grow for hardiness and different berry qualities, as well as ripening times so I could stagger ripening times to have berries most of the summer...
This is how I planted to ripen across the field...
Duke - 2 rows
Hannah&apos;s Choice - 1 row
Patriot - 2 rows
Collins - 1 row
Blueray - 2 rows
Draper - 1 row
Bluejay - 2 rows
Bluecrop - 3 rows
Bonus - 1 row
Chandler - 1 row
Jersey - 2 rows
Aurora - 2 rows
Anyone got any ideas??? Harvestman, Fruitnut???

 I won&apos;t mess around with subpar varieties. The only question is what to replace them with. If you are happy with some of the others, plant more of them. Otherwise try something new. I grew up in northern Illinois so think all of KY must have mild winters. Probably not true.
Have you considered some of the southern highbush? That&apos;s what I have and find them very vigorous, easy to grow, and very productive. Might not be hardy for you but I really like Star and Southmoon. Reveille is known for high eating quality. Bluecrisp and Sweetcrisp are supposed to be extra crisp and highly sought by consumers. Emerald and Jewel are very high in yield.
Have you thought of a test block? Three to four plants each of many varieties. Plant most of the weak growers back to what&apos;s working and one row to some new stuff.
I could be wrong but I think the southern highbush will outgrow the northern by a big margin. Just don&apos;t know how hardy they are in your area.

 So are Patriot, Collins, and Bonus a sub par plant for our climate here in west ky? We get up to 110 degrees plus in the summer and down to -10+ in the winter..Very volitile here...Like I said all the other 10 varieties are growing great..I&apos;m really inclined to think it&apos;s just a heat issue and those that are suffering are not as hardy..Let me know what you think and thanks for the input through this whole topic of discussion..
I hope this goes down as a what to do and what not to do from experience in the field from all of us so others can plan better without the trial and error.

 dablaw, You said &quot;I irrigate the berries and can inject whatever I want into the lines&quot;. What kind of fertigation system do you use?

 Well...I&apos;m Baaackkkkk...LOL..Just had a few minutes and thought I would revive this post again as it seems like there have been alot of blueberry questions in the last few months that I think we probably hit on in here somewhere surely....
Learned alot this year as it was my first full year to have plants in the ground..I have to slap myself to realize that it was only a year ago that we planted in the ground...All but 3 of the 13 varieties we grew did well..
Bonus,Collins,and Patriot absolutely hated it here this year..They will be replaced.
Really paid close attention to the plants over the course of the year to let them tell me what they needed....Most of them grew without anything special, other than fertilizing and watering..I can tell you that the deep sawdust mulch carried us through the EXTREMELY HOT summer and drought we have had all year...Kept the ground evenly moist and constant temp very well...
When you have heat hot enough and long enough to boil the sap and split trees, then it&apos;s a good test to weed out the weak....
Although I didn&apos;t get quite the growth I did in pots, I still got very good growth..I pruned only once this time though compared to last summers 3 times or so in the pots...
The results now are good, very stocky plants with a good foundation under them..The berry quality was excellent this summer and I can&apos;t wait to see how they produce next year...
Well that&apos;s it for now..Hopefully a few will keep adding to this post..

 Dave, good to hear from you, and I&apos;m glad you survived the hot dry one. Someday I hope to experience a &quot;normal&quot; growing season before I die.
Maybe you should start a new thread so new participants don&apos;t have to go through 120 postings. You could even summarize the course of the discussion if you get a few moments because I think that maybe 10% of the dialogue would be very useful to blueberry lovers. You&apos;d have to be a little crazy to read through the whole thing at this point, I think.

 For blueberries....Ammonium Sulfate is best.
I also find that Potassium Nitrate benefits ALL fruit crops in a positive way. It is quickly absorbed and induces a bigger fruit size in all fruit trees and shrubs. 
 
 
 
 Speaking of PH

 Wow...this is a big thread.
Quick question does it matter if the vinegar is white or red?
also what about if it is 6% acid instead of 5% ??
good to go?
how long are the effects for?

 Yes, it matters, because white vinegar is much much cheaper than red, especially if you buy it in gallons. Cheaper is better when the results are the same.
For stronger vinegar, dilute it a bit more.
If you are growing blueberries, best to test the pH occasionally. That will tell you when you need to add more vinegar.

 Very nice thread. I have recently purchased a farm with about a 3 acre plot of blueberries. Much in need of pruning, mulching, rejuvenation, replacement planting, drip irrigation repair, pigweed infestation solution, etc. Not a young man either at 59.
So how are all of you applying fertilizer? Broadcasting by machine or by hand? We have started putting on ammonium sulphate as the soil test reveals much of the planting to be high PH and even the parts that are thriving are near the top of the desireable range (4.5-5.2) We have been applying it in little 4 oz (8 tablespoon) cups and dusting it all around the drip line of the plants. Doesn&apos;t take too many hours of that to make fertilizing a 2400 plant field something you feel in your back at night!
I am also curious about those of you who are using a blend like 12-12-12 or something similar with regard to the potassium. Most things I have said say to avoid putting Pottasium chloride on blueberries, and to use potassium sulphate instead. The problem is I can&apos;t seem to find a blend that does not use potassium chloride or some derivative of muriate of potash. Maybe it doesn&apos;t really matter as I know actual blueberry farmers who seem to put on 10-10-10 that only contains K2O (chloride form) and even the Florikan label says it contains potassium chloride.
