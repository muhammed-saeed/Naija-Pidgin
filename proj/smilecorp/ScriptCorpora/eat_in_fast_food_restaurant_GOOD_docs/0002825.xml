Author: CappyNJ A rmusic montage of the 1980 film&apos;Popeye&apos;, directed by the late Robert Altman and starring Shelley Duvall and Robin Williams in his film debut. www.HaphazardStuff.com I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little. Even though the film has gotten harsh criticism (supposedly even Williams regrets it) after seeing it again recently I thought it still had a goofy charm. I had always hoped Altman would have done some kind of DVD commentary for this film, but unfortunately that never happened. I haven&apos;t read too much from the principals regarding this film. I&apos;m sure there are some memorable stories and interesting anecdotes behind the making of it. (Has Dennis Franz ever talked about his recollections of being cast as one of the&apos;Palookas&apos;?) I had heard the main parts were originally intended for Dustin Hoffman and Gilda Radner. Someone recently told me the Sweethaven town set is still standing in Malta and has become a tourist attraction. The theme song is performed by Face To Face. http://wn.com/&apos;Popeye&apos;_The_Movie_Music_Video

The big-budget musical/comedy would star Shelley Duvall, Paul Dooley, Ray Walston and that popular television star Robin Williams. Would it live up to the high expectations of being the blockbuster everyone thought it would be? Glossing over the debate whether Popeye should be categorized as a superhero or not, I decide to unravel the mystery and confusion regarding this bizarre, notorious film. *Special thanks to the talented Julian for his kick ass version of the Popeye theme (The Sailor&apos;s Hornpipe) used during the opening montage. Be sure to check out his stuff! You&apos;ll be glad you did! www.youtube.com Warning: Spoilers Ahead! Even though the film is over thirty years old I thought I would mention it just in case. As usual this project turned out to be much longer and involved than I initially planned. Normally there would have been some major cuts made, but with YouTube now allowing me unlimited time limits I thought -- I would take my time, not worry about the length and see how it goes. http://wn.com/Superhero_Films_Ch_16_&apos;Popeye&apos;
