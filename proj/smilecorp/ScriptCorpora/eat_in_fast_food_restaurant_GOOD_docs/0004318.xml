Burger King Tips
 Double check your order before leaving the drive thru. My order is wrong here about half the time.
 
Michael T. This place messes up your orders. But hey you get free food out of it, if they do.
 
Samantha H. This is the slowest burger king ever! Dont go here! They don&apos;t start your food until you ask how much longer it will be 3 times. Free WiFi make sure to bring a laptop so you have something to do.
 
Mike E. Got a free cone there one night ..people are really cool ...five star I recommend u try them out :)
 
Charleston S. This place needs someone who wants to work. Seems like only the manager and one other person to do everything.
