 1.  You can start a snow cone business with no debt 

For many 1 st time entrepreneurs the biggest barrier to entry is either a lack of funds, or a fear of taking out debt that you won’t be able to pay back. In any business there is always a risk of failure and no one wants to risk bankruptcy. Even opening something as simple as an ice cream shop, fast food restaurant, or boutique will require the average individual to take out a significant loan.

Snow cone stands are a business than can be realistically be started for as little as $5,000 and as much as $20,000 depending on how thrifty an individual wants to be. If you are a 1 st time entrepreneur this can be a great way for you to dip your toes in the water without spending your life savings or getting into debt. 

 2.  Snow Cone Stands are scalable 

As mentioned above it is possible to start a snow cone stand for a very reasonable price. $5,000 to start your 1 st business is about as great of a bargain as you can possibly find. Just as many fast food restaurant entrepreneurs continue to fund new restaurants with profits from the old, the same thing can be done with snow cone stands. In fact, it’s easier with snow cone stands than with any other business I know of.

In a typical summer it is completely reasonable to expect to make $5-25,000 in profit, particularly if you are working the stand yourself at least some portion of the time. If this is the case and you continue to be frugal in your capital investments, then you could realistically open at least 1 new snow cone stand each season. With a little time and experience it wouldn’t be impossible to be opening several each season.

 3.  Snow cone stands have a straight-forward business model 

The business is not only scalable from a financial standpoint, but also from a management standpoint. Snow cone stands are simple enough to run that hiring high school kids to work is a common practice. With a few quality employees an owner can run 3 or 4 snow cone stands as easily as a 1. The main work of an owner is making/delivering ice, mixing/delivering syrup, collecting deposits and making payroll. When an owner already has to make ice and mix syrup it doesn’t take much additional time to do this for several stands.

 

 4.  It’s a business you can run in your spare time. 

If you are less ambitious than the type of owners above, then this may just be a business to run in your spare time. If you work a normal 40 hour per week like many of us, then this may be the perfect side-project. Once you are up and running then it is not an issue to hire high-school kids to work during the day and then take care of anything necessary during the evening. The stand I owned most recently was worked by high school kids during the day and weekends, while I gave a percentage of profits to a friend in order to make ice and syrup, pay the rent and payroll, and make deposits. I was running this business putting in less than 10 hours per week.

 5.  Snow Cone Stands have an extremely high cash margin. 

A typical snow cone costs between $2 and $4.50. The cost of goods sold (COGS) of a snow cone include ice, syrup, cup, spoon, straw and napkin. This amount does not include labor, rent, utilities or any other fixed cost.

When you buy supplies in bulk these costs should average no more than 20 to 30 cents per snow cone. At this point you have gross profit of anywhere from $1.75 to over $4 for each snow cone. Then you simply need to sell enough to pay for the month’s labor, rent and utilities.

A solid rule of thumb provided by the 1-800-shaved-ice is to multiply each ounce of a cup by $0.02. Therefore a 12-ounce snow cone would have COGS of roughly 24 cents.
