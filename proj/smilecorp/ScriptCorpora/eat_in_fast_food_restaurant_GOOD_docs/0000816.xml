Rush Limbaugh Announces &quot;Two If By Tea&quot; Iced Tea

 The dittos are coming...the dittos are coming... 
​ Radio Talker and blowhard Rush Limbaugh just announced his brand new line of Paul Revere-inspired iced teas, &quot; Two If By Tea.&quot; 
It&apos;s available in four varieties - regular, diet, raspberry, and diet raspberry. All of them feature all natural ingredients and a picture of Rush on a horse, dressed and ready to warn the British that we have arms and they can&apos;t take them away.... or something like that .

Limbaugh announced the teas on his radio show, noting they are not sold in any stores because no one would buy them no sane company would carry them he wanted to be able to ensure everyone got a fair shake at buying the teas, which are priced at $23.76 per case (missed opportunity Rush, shouldn&apos;t they have been priced at $17.76?)
 
The tea, according to the website, &quot;represents traditional American values of capitalism and excellence. Each bottle is designed to rise above the sameness and mediocrity that threatens our great nation.&quot; Wow! That&apos;s a big responsibility for a little bottle of iced tea, don&apos;t ya think, Rush?

Stranger still are the insights into Limbaugh and wife Kathryn&apos;s bedroom romps in the FAQ&apos;s section. In answer to the question, &quot;Why is Rush Putting his name on a tea?, it states, &quot;On Rush and Kathryn&apos;s wedding night, Kathryn said to him - &quot;Rush, why don&apos;t you put your mug on a tea beverage dressed up in colonial costume including a wig with a bow and a tricorne hat, riding a frightened-horse, holding a bottle of tea with an American flag on it?&quot; As she was pouring over historical poems and references in her galloping mind, Kathryn said, &quot;We should call it Two If By Tea™ !&quot; Rush said, &quot;OK!&quot;

The only part of this whole tea debacle that&apos;s not a total joke? Two if by Tea will donate a minimum of $100,000 to MC-LEF (The Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation) beginning in June 2011.

Typical Liberals! No facts just name calling. How much are you parasite liberals donating?
 
Hi Rush, I wanted to change my order to raspberry flavor&amp;your people wouldn&apos;t let me change
my order. I called the same day and emailed too. Please see what you can do for me. 
 thank you  bobandpat2@comcast.com
 
sad, sad libs can&apos;t stand it when someone makes a dime they can&apos;t get their hands on.  OH NO, not for themselves, to give to protect the insects, right to trees.  They really need very little to get by, a gov. check or two for themselves and every member of their family.  You know you can have 7 government babies, free phone, apartment, food, med. care, child care and you still want someone to personally pick you up, put you on the bus to take your butt out of the way of the huricane.
 
Laine Doss another elite liberal media loser that sounds a little childish with her less than objective review of Rush&apos;s new tea line.   More power to Rush....he way more to charity each year than Doss makes.......and though it may hurt Ms. Doss.....Rush speaks the truth.   Can&apos;t wait to get my first case of Rush&apos;s tea and support MC-LEF.   Dittos Rush!
 
I for one would sure be interested in knowing how many new jobs were created with the production of this new product.  
Seems to me Rush needs to show President Obama how it&apos;s done.
 
If you want to set the price, why don&apos;t you go build your own iced tea company!
 
More proof why Sarah Palin should run and win!  If the Liberals hate her that much than she must be the one!for the job
 
Go get one of those great high paying jobs that can provide all those things, you know like the jobs your dear leader Obama keeps talking about!
 
Obama has already acomplished that!
 
Laine Doss
It is a wonder to read such unbiased writing. But then again, I am sure you would write against any good cause,if it is sponsored by hardworking americans that earn their money rather than getting government handouts. I hope your food stamps and welfare do not run out as you probaly cannot support yourself as a wwriter.
Richard
 
What!!!!!....is my government social security check not coming? I was soooo counting on your lib programs to survive in my old age. Not sure 65 will remain the retirement age anyway.
 
Oh well...they had the tea party date wrong, too...can&apos;t wait to try the raspberry.
 
Considering that CEO&apos;s take home pay averages 650 times workers pay, I want to see the top 5-percent income earners pay 100-percent of income tax. They can afford it and then some. There is NO reason why any American should be without health care, food or shelter in this civilized rich nation.
 
Yes, and while his a$$ got richer he&apos;s employing and contributing to the employment of how many? Shipping is&quot;free&quot;but you can bet that UPS is getting paid for delivering it to your house and that&apos;s good ol&apos; American Teamsters. Why is it that Limbaugh getting richer is evil but nothing is ever said about (insert Hollywood Star name here) getting another 10 million for their next movie? It doesn&apos;t bother me that either get richer. We have the power to choose wether we wish to support them with our $$.
 
Rush has “created” more jobs than Obummer and the always brilliant Bite me administration has all year. 
Just admit, you hate prosperity and love trickle up poverty.
 
Don&apos;t you just wish you were as&quot;foolish&quot;&quot;- sorry she makes you uncomfortable!  Idiot!
 
Very true that major brands do give out samples on their products, search online for&quot;123 Samples&quot;we just got ours today. You wont need CC.
 
People like you need help.
 
You are not the same Dozersbro as the first reply. That&apos;s me.
 
bromes4378, making Palin look foolish takes NO effort.
 
What good work? Dope head? Overeater? Repugnant rich man at the expense of people who believe any lie?
 
Capitalism=Greed.... Used to not be but now it is. Hope you&apos;re rich!
 
Why don&apos;t you aholes go back to your righty sites and kiss the a$$ of the likes of Savage, the most despicable one of all, Limbaugh and racist Boortz. YOU will all get the poverty you deserve when your right wing greed mongers get all the tea party and Republicans elected.  Enjoy your misery and poverty, cuz they are coming to take it away and leave you on the street you idiots.
 
When you jerks are 65 and living on the street while his fat a$$ is sitting in his Palm Beach mansion sipping his racist tea I just may laugh at you.
 
limbaugh is a blowhard ahole. He and his ilk will put people you recreant5 in the poor house too as his a&amp;&amp;gets richer. You deserve such a creep.
 
Go Rush, You have got those liberal pinheads frothing at the mouth, if one of these nuts bites your dog get him some rabies shots rights away.
 
Guess your not a fan of his or his message
 
I will say one thing. This New Times writer DOES know how to stir up a controversy!
 
Say what?
 
Very interesting man that I ve never heard in my life even though I have never seen this great man before.  Because I am a foreigner knowing English very little couple years ago, once I listen to this man from that day I don&apos;t miss his show even one time besides he has transcript that I can learn from not only his humor, geneousity, articulation...
 
Her article is intended to ridicule Rush, but it&apos;s free advertising for him and actually inspired me (and hopefully others) to order a case.  As with most liberal intentions, it resulted in the opposite effect of that intended.  Raise taxes . . . get less revenue.  CashForClunkers . . . raise the price of used cars, thus hurting the little guy.  More regulation?  Send jobs abroad.  

Check which areas of the country are losing population . . . . . it&apos;s no surprise people are leaving liberal strongholds in droves.  Detroit&amp;NY are but 2 examples.
 
Once again Rush rides roughshod over the Liberal LEFT media.  The more you fools on the left try to make Rush seem foolish, the more successful he gets.
 
What you characterize as &apos;Palin&apos;s flub&apos; was actually based on a letter written by Paul Revere himself. In fact, Revere DID tell the British that a force of 500 members of the Colonialist militia was on the way since he warned the populace of an impending British military action.  

One leftwing historian has announced that he disbelieves Revere!   Anything to make Palin look foolish, eh?
 
Don&apos;t buy it if you don&apos;t like the markup.  Capitalism 101.
 
wrong ... it is sexual activity between adult and child ..... heterosexual or homosexual ....
 
Ditto, bro.  If the only thing about this not a joke is that $100K goes to MC-LEF, Ms. Doss calling herself a&quot;writer&quot;is the biggest joke of all.  Nota bene Ms. Doss&apos; placement of mention the military: the last full paragraph!  Mr. Limbaugh has 20 million listeners; I wonder if Ms. Doss has 20 million readers . . . . . on second thought, no I don&apos;t.  She doesn&apos;t.

I just ordered me a case o&apos; TIBT, paid for it with money I earned (it wasn&apos;t given to me by the government, Ms. Doss - capitalism the way it was meant to be) and I&apos;ll have long forgotten about Ms. Doss when I swill it.
 
No middleman - all the money for Rush and Charity - efficiency at it&apos;s best!
 
I think the author hit the nail on the head. Ok, I have to say it before someone else does...PUMPKIN HEAD  LOL LOL LOL!
 
Check Websters or reference an English 101 textbook. You are wrong FinbarOS. But lets say you don&apos;t have one handy - ever hear of a man lusting after a young girl? Remember Amy Warmus? Certainly not homosexual! Now get off the internet, go back to the boobtube and watch Fox News.
 
I&apos;d try it but am afraid it&apos;ll make me a bad fatty who needs viagra, so I&apos;ll pass.
 
Pedophile is a subset of homosexual. Ya dolt!
 
And now an English lesson for Jagzster.  Pedofile = Man/Boy.  Homosexual = Man/Man or Woman/Woman. Ya dult!
 
Crickets?
 
Another act of blasphemy on Paul Revere&apos;s ride. First Palen&apos;s flub and now Limbaugh cashing in. Lord knows when Hannity will weigh in...
 
Who pissed in your cornflakes this morning? You should have classified this rhetoric from&quot;Obscurity&quot;to&quot;Tantrum&quot;
 
You must forgive Laine. After all, hardly a man is now alive who remembers that famous day and year.
 
Immature?
 
The beauty of the internet. Put some stuff on the web, tell your Jim Jones followers how good it is and watch them drink.&quot;Free Shipping&quot;sure, it&apos;s free if you don&apos;t factor in the exponential mark up.
 
Why give up $6/case by charging $17.76? Sounds like a&quot;made&quot;opportunity to me. LOL
 
Laine is lame.
 
Laine Doss sounds like a 14 year old middle school girl.  Just silly.
 
Turn him off if you don&apos;t like He speaks what&apos;s on his mind lord help us if we heard what&apos;s in your mind !!
 
Child Molesters are almost always homosexuals (man/boy) and appeal to and support Leftist. -not Conservatives.
 
Paul Revere&apos;s Midnight Ride was in 1775 Ya Big Dope!
 
Laine - Initially, I took exception to your snarky comments on Rush&apos;s venture.  Then I thought about all the good works he has done, whereas you are a non-achiever.  Your jealousy of Rush is thereby easy to understand.  You will never amount to anything in life.  Have a nice day.
 
This pumpkin headed blow hard continues to revel in his success thanks to the wacko right. They will support whatever he hawks just like they do the adulterer and child molesting reverends.
 
Rush, Kathryn seems to have been VERY BORED on her wedding night.  Two If By Tea, Rush? Really...? You&apos;ve attached yourself to a symbol of the spirit of Americans at the time of our indiependence, for your own agenda.  That&apos;s quite parasitic, I think.  But, it&apos;s a catchy name... OK, I&apos;ll try some....  Oh, wait... On second thought, If it&apos;s all the same to you, I&apos;ll pass on any drink offered to me by&quot;loud and aggressive persons&quot;... I find them to be&quot;a vexation to my spirit&quot;.
 
I wonder if he will come out with an oxycodone flavor tea
 
Laine Doss, you must be the most immature writer I have ever experienced in at least 20 years. People like you are the reason the media has become such a joke.
