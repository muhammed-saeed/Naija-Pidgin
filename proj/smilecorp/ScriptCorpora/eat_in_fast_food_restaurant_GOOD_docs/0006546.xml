 The type of food. Fast food is quick, low quality, fattening and cheap. Regular restuarants have more choices, better quality, more healthy options,&amp;more expensive.

 fast food is called fast food because you get your food in seconds after you order normally under a minute. Normally fast food is considered unhealthy but it really depends on what you order. These days you can order a salad from a fast food. So in a fast food restuarant the salad is already packaged and refrigerated, when you order they just pick that up and give you.

A regular restaurant is mostly a sitdown and dine experience. It takes atleast 5-10 mins for the food to arrive after you order. There is a waiter and all the formal process. If you order a salad, they will actually make a salad after you order it. You can call it slow food.

 fast food, food is ready when you get there, its cheaper, in and out in 10 minutes, and usually the food is lower quality and fried, restaurant, sit down meal, can take normally an hour, to an hour and half, more expensive, but this is because they take more time to prepare it and also will use much higher quality ingredients, and healthier methods of cooking than a fast food restaurant

 the quality of the food is typically better/more expensive at a regular restaurant while fast food restaurants will have your food prepared faster. Typically if it has a drive thru window then it&apos;s fast food.

 Alot of the times fast food because it is made in a fast way is less expensive than a typical restaurant and the food is not as good.
