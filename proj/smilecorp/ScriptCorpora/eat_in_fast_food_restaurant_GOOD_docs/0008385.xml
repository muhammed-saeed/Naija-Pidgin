Plan a Thanksgiving Dinner Lesson

Gather food ads from the local grocery store and markets. Give your student a 
 budget to work from and the number of guests they will be serving. Then have 
 them plan their Thanksgiving meal. This uses many math skills (especially 
 multiplication, since turkey is sold by the pound). For a variation on this 
 lesson, have them compare the cost of the meal from two different grocery stores.

Pilgrim Meals and Table Manners

Discuss eating customs and table manners . 
 Did you know that the Wapanoags used to eat whenever they were hungry? It was 
 not usual to find pots cooking in their homes throughout the day. On the other 
 hand, colonists had a fixed timetable for eating their meals, such as breakfast, 
 dinner and supper. The eating pattern of the Pilgrims also differed. They used 
 spoons, knives and fingers to eat, they did not have access to forks.
 
The First Thanksgiving Story

Watch and listen as the traditional Thanksgiving story is told 
 of the Mayflower&apos;s trip across the ocean loaded with over 100 
 passengers.
 
Thanksgiving Dinner Geography Lesson

A typical American fast-food restaurant meal would include chicken (first 
 domesticated in China) and potatoes (from Andes) or corn from Mexico), 
 seasoned with black pepper (from India) and washed down with a cup of coffee 
 (of Ethiopian origin). Holly Ramer provides food for thought in her article on turkey cooking methods around the country.

Did You Know?

 June is National Turkey Lover&apos;s Month. The heaviest turkey raised weighed 86 pounds. In England, 200 years ago, turkeys were walked to market in herds. They wore booties to protect their feet. Turkeys were also walked to market in the United States. Turkey breeding has caused turkey breasts to grow so large that the turkeys fall over. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , more than 45 million turkeys are cooked and eaten in the U.S. at Thanksgiving—that&apos;s one sixth of all turkeys sold in the U.S. each year. American per capita consumption of turkeys has soared from 8.3 pounds in 1975 to 18.5 pounds last year. Age is a determining factor in taste. Old, large males are preferable to young toms (males) as tom meat is stringy. The opposite is true for females: old hens are tougher birds. Giblets are the edible internal parts of a fowl, including the gizzard, heart, liver, and neck. They are normally removed, placed into a plastic bag, and then reinserted into the turkey&apos;s vacant body cavity. A Southern tradition is to make gravy stock from it, while most people just give them to their dog or threaten their children with them.
