 There are many backflow incidents which occur that are not
reported. This is usually because they are of short duration and are not detected, the
customer is not aware they should be reported, or it may not be known to whom they should
be reported. Some backflow incidents are detected too late to conclusively determine the
cause. Many backflow incident reports are not made public. Understandingly then, the
incidents reported in this publication are only a very small number of the incidents that
have occurred. 

 The incidents contained in this publication were obtained
from numerous sources. Credit was given on individual reports to the primary source of
information, although several sources may have been used to gather information. The
incidents were summarized as best as possible from the information at hand. Information on
individuals, and company names were normally deleted. Any errors or omissions are
inadvertent. 

 It is the desire of the Pacific Northwest Section,
American Water Works Association to bring to the attention of the public, and to water
purveyors that do not have a cross connection control program, the risk of contamination
of potable water systems posed by cross connection. Providing details of backflow
incidents is one way of illustrating the risk. The reader of this publication is
encouraged to contribute additional incidents. A backflow incident report form, containing
the address for reporting an incident to the PNWS-AWWA Cross Connection Control Committee,
is included at the end of this manual.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: August, 1923 LOCATION: Everett, Washington 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: G.M. Roscoe vs
City of Everett, 10/13/25 PACIFIC REPORTS, Crt. of Appeals, Vol 239 

 SUMMARY: A typhoid fever epidemic, that
resulted in two deaths, was caused by contaminated river water pumped from a lumber mill&apos;s
auxiliary water supply into the public water mains. 

 DETAILS: 

 In April, 1923, the City of Everett installed a new water
main to a service area that contained a lumber mill located on the Snohomish river. The
mill contained an auxiliary water system supplied by pumped water from the river. The
intake for the mill&apos;s pump was located a short distance from the point where the city
sewers discharged into the river. The auxiliary water system was separated from the public
water system by a&quot;series of check valves&quot;to prevent the pollution of the
public system. The check valves had a by-pass; the valve on the by-pass was intended to be
kept closed. 

 The public water system normally operated at a higher
pressure than the pumped auxiliary system. During the summer months, however, due to the
heavy use of water for sprinkling, the pressure in the public system dropped below the
pressure of the pumped auxiliary supply. 

 During the summer of 1923, an epidemic of typhoid fever
occurred in Everett. Two persons died from typhoid fever in August of 1923. The
investigation of the epidemic revealed that the cause was the contamination of the public
water supply from water pumped from the river through the by-pass around the check valves
in the mill&apos;s service connection. The City of Everett was sued by the families of the
deceased. The courts held the city negligent and awarded damages to the plaintiffs. In
finding the city negligent, the court cited the following: 

 - Complaints had been made to city from May continuously
until the time of the epidemic, about the smell of the water, its appearance, and that
persons were made sick therefrom. 

 - The city never inspected the valve on the by-pass from
the date of installation of the new main to determine if it was closed. 

 - Any promise made by the mill to remove the by-pass could
not relieve the city of responsibility. 

 - The ease with which the valve could be sealed or the
by-pass removed, and the imminent danger from the connection to the auxiliary river supply
were strong factors in finding the city negligent.

 SUMMARY: At the 1933 Worlds Fair, an
epidemic of dysentery spread among the visitors, of the eight hundred identified victims,
more that forty died. Backsiphonage through&quot;generally defective water and sewerage
piping layout&quot;in a hotel was attributed as the cause of the disease outbreak. 

 DETAILS: 

 During the first season of the 1933 Chicago Worlds Fair an
epidemic of amoebic dysentery spread among visitors, and of the eight hundred victims more
than forty died. To trace the disease outbreak, over 16,000 questionnaires were mailed to
out-of-town guests who had registered at the hotel during the three months of the summer.
As the replies came in, all who reported intestinal symptoms were telephoned or
telegraphed to obtain names of the attending physicians, who were notified to watch for
amebiasis. 

 More that twenty law suits in excess of $6,000,000 were
filed against the Congress Hotel. The first of these suits, for $600,000, was filed by a
doctor and his wife. They became gravely ill with amoebic dysentery which they claim to
have contacted while staying at the hotel. 

 The Entamoeba Histolyica bacteria had spread into
the potable water piping in the hotel. The rare disease, as far as the United States was
concerned in the 1933, frequently deceived physicians by symptoms which simulate other
ailments. It has misled surgeons into operating for appendicitis. 

 The disease was first thought to have been spread by food
handler. However, although all infected food handlers were removed, new cases developed
among the guests of the Congress Hotel and of another close by hotel. 

 The Board of Health report found&quot;old and generally
defective water and sewerage piping layouts , potentially, at least, permitting back
siphonage of a number of fixtures such as bathtubs and flush-toilets into water lines. An
investigation by health authorities revealed that&quot;the pumping plant in Hotel C also
supplied water to Hotel A in such a manner that if C&apos;s supply became polluted it would
also pollute A&apos;s&quot;.

Vermont Records, 187 Atl. 808 (1936) 

 SUMMARY: Typhoid bacilli contaminated
river water enters city water system through a by-pass maintained solely for fire-fighting
purposes, causing the death of a youth. 

 DETAILS: 

 An action was brought by the administrator of the estate
of a 17-year-old young man against the defendant city for death allegedly negligently
caused by typhoid from typhoid bacilli in river water which contaminated the city water
system because the river water got in through a by-pass which was maintained solely for
increasing water pressure for fire fighting purposes. The village of Winooski had a water
system which was used for domestic and fire purposes, but its pressure was not adequate
for fighting extensive fires, and to supplement the village system, a woolen company&apos;s
supply pipe was equipped with a by-pass with a PIV valve in it. This equipment was so
installed that by opening this valve the river water would be forced into the mains of the
village system. When this was closed a check valve held back the water from the river and
prevented it from entering the village pipes. The purpose was to enable the village to
secure added pressure on its mains in case of an unusual fire. Later the city took over
the village system and some time later the mill company system was not needed by the city
for fire protection, but it was still in use by the mill company and the by-pass and valve
remained in place until removed subsequently. 

 Upon reading the meter of the woolen mill, it was
discovered that the meter was running backwards and the valve in the by-pass was left
open, which unquestionably established the fact that the river water was passing through
the by-pass into the mains carrying city water supplied and used for domestic purposes.
The judgment of the lower court entered on the verdict for the plaintiff was affirmed upon
appeal.

 SUMMARY: University students in a
laboratory drank water contaminated with brucella causing severe illness and one death. 

 DETAILS: 

 in 1938, 80 students at a large midwestern university
reported remittent fevers, malaise, headache, and anemia. Their symptoms led to a
diagnosis of undulant fever (brucellosis). Curiously, only those students who had been
working in the cultivation of bacteria in one of the laboratories were affected.
Investigation revealed that a hose connected to a faucet in the laboratory, the other end
of which was submerged in water containing brucella. A temporary reversal of pressure,
possibly the consequence of a demand for water in another part of the system, had drawn
the water teeming with brucella into the drinking supply. Of the 80 students affected, one
died.

 SUMMARY: An open valve on a frostproof
hydrant permitted sewage from 10 families to enter the water main. 

 DETAILS: 

 In Newton, Kansas, in 1942, one of the town&apos;s two water
supply mains had been temporarily taken out of service. A house service connection to this
main supplied three frostproof hydrants and two frostproof toilets. Some unknown person or
persons tried to obtain water from one on the hydrants. When no water flowed, the person
departed, leaving the valve open. Later, it was discovered that a neighboring toilet sewer
was clogged and that sewage had overflowed into the hydrant box, for 2 days all the sewage
from 10 families had been permitted to flow into the water main. When the main was put
back into service, there was no attempt to sterilize it and more than 2,500 persons in all
parts of town suffered enteric disorders as a result.

 SUMMARY: The valve of the main water
supply was turned off each night at a school to conserve water causing atmospheric
pressure to move waste water into drinking supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 In April, 1944, after an outbreak of gastroenteritis in an
Oklahoma school, it was found that none of the flushometer valve toilets with submerged
inlets were provided with vacuum breakers, which prevent atmospheric pressure from forcing
waste water into supply lines. Each night, to conserve water and eliminate the possibility
that rooms might be flooded if a leak should develop, the custodian turned off the valve
at the main supply line. As the pressure in the supply lines was cut off, atmospheric
pressure in the toilet bowls moved the waste water up into the drinking supply. Most of
the people affected were those who drank from faucets on the first floor of the school;
there were progressively fewer cases on the second and third floors, as the atmospheric
pressure moved less of the waste water to those heights.

 SUMMARY: Following a fire, a connecting
valve in a pump house was left open allowing river water to enter a school&apos;s domestic
supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 At a school in Milford, Nebraska, the fire lines and
hydrants were separate from the domestic water supply, although the two systems were
connected through a valve at the pump house. The source of water for the fire system was
the river. In January 1947, following a fire, someone negligently opened the connecting
valve at the pump house, and river water entered the domestic water supply. About 150
people came down with gastroenteritis.

 SUMMARY: A pipe to a beverage machine at
a golf and country club was connected to the recirculating hot water system containing lye
and chromate. 



 DETAILS: 



 Eleven caddies experienced nausea, severe vomiting, and
abdominal cramps after consuming a&quot;soft drink&quot;at a New York golf club in 1964.
The beverage was a commercially prepared mixture of syrup with carbonated water in a
vending machine. Investigation revealed that a pipe carrying water into the machine was
connected to the recirculating hot water heating system instead of the drinking water
system. The day before the incident a lye and chromate solution was added to the hot water
system.

 SUMMARY: Backsiphonage from unprotected
autopsy table contaminated hospital water. 



 DETAILS: 



 In 1964 nurses at a Michigan hospital complained for some
time about rusty water coming from one of the hospital drinking fountains before the
maintenance department finally checked into the matter. The drinking fountain was located
about two doors from the hospital autopsy room. Hospital autopsy tables have a sump to
collect cuttings and washing from the autopsy procedure; they are also equipped with a
hose-spray unit for washing off cutting, organs, etc. The table at this hospital was not
equipped with a hook to hang up the hose-spray, so the pathologist placed the nozzle in
the table sump when not in use. The hospital also had severe backsiphonage problems and
the autopsy table did not have vacuum breakers installed. Blood and other washing from the
cadavers were being sucked into the hospital water supply system and were being
encountered by the nurses at the drinking fountain! This is an example of a cross
connection in one of the most shocking, revolting and dangerous forms.

 SUMMARY: Irrigation of a field with
undisinfected sewage, in a city whose potable water system is supplied by 12 deep wells,
causes at least 246 cases of gastroenteritis. 



 DETAILS: 



 On the morning of August 13, 1965 the Madera County Health
Department learned that Madera physicians were seeing an unusually large number of
patients with gastrointestinal complaints. A check of city physicians and pharmacists
revealed at least 246 cases of gastroenteritis, heavily concentrated in the southwest part
of the city. Diarrhea was the most prominent symptom. Abdominal cramps, nausea, and
vomiting were also common. Two children were hospitalized. There were no deaths. 



 There is considerable evidence that the waterborne
epidemic of enteritis was a result of sewage contamination of the city water supply
through one of its wells. The direct evidence includes the high coliform count from well
No. 14. 



 Indirect evidence includes the demonstration that water
could flow from a sewage irrigated field into well No. 14. Medical data supported the
conclusions regarding the contamination. 



 The waterborne epidemic seems to have occurred as a result
of the combination of several circumstances, some of which are unusual: 



 1. Irrigation of a field with undisinfected sewage. 



 2. Presence of a gopher hole leading in a particular
direction. 



 3. Connections between the valve excavation and the well
pit. 



 4. Presence in the pit openings to the well casing. 



 Measures were taken to prevent future recurrences.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: October, 1967 

 LOCATION: Renton, Washington 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: The
Record-Chronicle newspaper 

 Vol. LXVII No. 42 



 SUMMARY: A cross connection between a
gasoline pipeline and the city water system resulted in about 2000 gallons of gasoline
entering the water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 About 2000 gallons of gasoline was introduced into the
Renton water system when a pipeline company connected a new gasoline pipeline to the water
system to pressure test the gasoline line. The Renton fire department flushed a 2-inch
water line that ran almost pure gasoline for about 15 minutes. The only injury was to a
man that suffered singed hair on his arms then the pan of water he put on his gas stove in
his trailer exploded. A nearby lumber company had previously complained of detecting
gasoline in their washroom tap water, but when investigators arrived no gasoline could be
detected. 



 It was normal procedure for the pipeline company to use
water for hydrostatic testing of gas pipelines. The gas entered the water mains when the
pipeline company suffered a mechanical valve failure that allowed gasoline (under higher
pressure than the water mains) to backflow into the water system. 



 The gas pipeline company paid for all the injuries
involved and agreed with the city to use a reservoir in future to pump water into gas
pipelines instead of directly connecting to a water main.

 SUMMARY: A bubbler connected to a fire
protection system instead of fresh water line causes seven cases of infectious hepatitis. 



 DETAILS: 



 A New England town had two separate water systems - one
for potable water, the other for fire protection. The fire protection system pumped
untreated water directly from the river. In 1967, at an industrial plant in town, workers
mistook a fire system line for a fresh water line and connected a bubbler to it. After
drinking the water from the bubbler, seven people developed infectious hepatitis and over
a hundred were ill with gastroenteritis.

Spokane, WA 



 SUMMARY: A maintenance man ingested water
containing sodium dichromate after the contamination of a school&apos;s water system by a
boiler chemical treatment compound. 



 DETAILS: 



 A local hospital reported that a maintenance man from a
rural school had been brought into emergency complaining of extreme stomach cramps. The
man&apos;s stomach was pumped. The lab analysis showed that the man has ingested a chromate
solution. Further investigation showed that the solution was sodium dichromate, commonly
used in boilers for heating buildings. 



 The school where the maintenance man worked was supplied
with water from a well. When the maintenance man disconnected the piping between the
pressure tank at the well site and the school building to replace a valve, the building
water system was drained toward the well. 



 The boiler feed line&apos;s single cast iron check valve
leaked, allowing the backflow of the boiler treatment chemical into the potable water
system. When the supply line was returned to service, the boiler treatment chemical was
distributed throughout the school&apos;s water system. 



 Upon completing repairs at the well site, and since the
day was very warm, the maintenance man immediately returned to the school for a drink of
water from a drinking fountain. The maintenance man stated he did not consume a large
amount of water, but that the water did have a slight&quot;off taste&quot;. Since the
school was on summer vacation, no other persons drank the water. 



 The school plumbing system was thoroughly flushed to
remove the chemical.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: September, 1969 

 LOCATION: Peoria, Arizona 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: City of Glendale,
Arizona 



 SUMMARY: An arsenate based herbicide was
backsiphoned into the municipal water system following a water main break. 



 DETAILS: 



 On the evening of September 25, 1969, the Water Supply
Division received a call from the City of Peoria stating that a portion of their water
system had been accidentally contaminated by a poisonous weed killer. A farm workman was
filling a weed killer tank utilizing a garden hose from the farmhouse spigot. The water
service to the farmhouse is by the City of Peoria&apos;s water system. During the filling of
the tank the worker left and upon returning noticed that the tank, instead of being full
of water and herbicide, was empty. In checking around the area he discovered that a
contractor had broken into the water service main directly in front of the farmhouse,
draining the main and causing the tank contents to be siphoned into the water system by
direct cross connection. He immediately alerted his employer, who in turn called the City
of Peoria. They in turn called the State Health Department. 



 State Health Dept. personnel began immediately sampling
the nearby service connections for arsenic levels as the herbicide was a sodium arsenate
compound. Meanwhile, the City of Peoria began flushing fire hydrants in the vicinity and
warning all users in this section of the system not to consume their water. This was
accomplished by the Police and rigidly enforced by loudspeaker trucks. Each resident was
warned not to use the water for drinking purposes and to drain his own part of the system
by turning on hoses, basins, and other water discharge points. 



 The Laboratory and the Water Supply Division coordinated
their efforts in the collection of the samples and the determination of the various
arsenic levels in the system affected by the contaminant. The arsenic level at the
farmhouse was determined to be 98 parts per million (ppm), a severe toxic dose for most
humans, at the outset of the contamination. After thoroughly flushing this portion of the
system it dropped to 0.02 ppm by the next morning. The remainder of the samples in the
public water system were less than 0.01 ppm, which is the recommended limit for arsenic.
Water supplies containing more than 0.05 ppm of arsenic must be rejected for public use.
By 10 a.m. the next day the system had been thoroughly flushed, and all samples indicated
the arsenic level had been completely flushed from this portion of the system.

 SUMMARY: 83 football team members and
coaching staff were stricken with infectious hepatitis by drinking water contaminated by a
backsiphonage incident. 



 DETAILS: 



 A water line, serving a series of sunken sprinkler boxes
used for irrigation, was extended to a faucet used by football player for drinking water
during practice. Children played on the field and used the irrigation boxes as toilets, 4
of the children had infectious hepatitis. 



 Early one morning there was a fire in nearby Worcester,
fire-fighting pumpers reduced the pressure in the water line to the practice field to
below atmospheric, causing backsiphonage. 



 83 football team members and their coaching staff drank
the contaminated water at the faucet and became ill with infectious hepatitis. Nearly
every game of the season was cancelled. 



 Subsequent tests made by flooding the boxes with dyed
water and opening fire hydrants in the area below the practice field showed water could
flow from the pits to the faucet.

 SUMMARY: University football team members
stricken with infectious hepatitis through irrigation water backsiphonage. 



 DETAILS: 



 In 1969 over 50 members of a university football team
became ill with infectious hepatitis and their football season was cancelled. Irrigation
water had been backsiphoned into the drinking water supply at their locker room through an
unprotected cross connection. A main water line repair had drawn water to the atmosphere
creating a vacuum or a siphon on the supply line and the irrigation water puddled around
the sprinkler heads was drawn back into the potable water system. When water service was
resumed, the water contaminated with hepatitis germs was used by the football team for
drinking and bathing. The simple installation of a vacuum breaker could have prevented
this unfortunate incident.

 SUMMARY: An open valve at a wine
distillery resulted in the backflow of sparkling Burgundy wine into the city water main. 



 DETAILS: 



 In December of 1970 in a winery in Cincinnati, Ohio the
water supply valve was inadvertently left open after flushing out wine-distilling tanks.
The result was that during a subsequent fermenting process, sparkling Burgundy backflowed
from the vats into the city main and out of the kitchen faucets of nearby homeowners. This
typical reversal of flow in water piping caused by the distilling tanks operating at a
higher pressure than the city water supply did impair the condition of the water but did
not make it dangerous. Indeed, many thought it was the best water they ever tasted.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: December, 1971 

 LOCATION: Spokane Valley, Washington 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Byram
Enterprises, Spokane, WA 



 SUMMARY: Bacteriological contamination of
the community water system would periodically occur following the backflow of stagnant
water from an abandoned pressure tank and plumbing system. 



 DETAILS: 



 Bacteriological samples collected from a small grocery
store-coffee shop often would show the presence of coliform bacteria. The grocery
store-coffee shop was located at the front of a long building. The rear of the building
was unoccupied. 



 Upon investigation, an abandoned well was found in the
rear of the building. This well had served seven other premises before the community water
system was installed. A connection to the community water system was made at the front of
the building. Although the well was abandoned and not attached to the plumbing system, a
500 gallon pressure tank was connected at the rear of the building. The building contained
about 400 feet of water piping ranging in size from 1/2-inch to 3-inch. Most of this
piping was not in use, hence contained stagnant water. 



 When the county street flusher truck filled its tank from
a nearby fire hydrant, the pressure in the water system dropped to between 30 to 60 psi.
This allowed the stagnant water in the pressure tank and piping system in the building
containing the grocery store-coffee shop to flow in to the occupied portion of the
building and into the community water system. Due to bacteriological regrowth in the
stagnant water piping, following a backflow incident, the bacteriological sample collected
from the grocery store-coffee shop would show positive with re-samples showing negative. 



 Abandonment of the pressure tank and all piping downstream
of the last utilized plumbing fixture corrected the cross connection.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: November, 1972 

 LOCATION: Tacoma, Washington 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: City of Tacoma 



 SUMMARY: The failure to disconnect an air
line used to purge exposed water lines during cold weather resulted in air being pumped
into the water distribution mains. 



 DETAILS: 



 On November 26, 1972, air was pumped into the City of
Tacoma water system from a compressor located in the City Transit Shop. An air line used
to purge exposed water lines during cold weather had been accidently left on allowing air
under 180 psi pressure to enter the city water mains. 



 As a result of the backflow incident, a foreman and crew
spent Sunday afternoon and evening and all day Monday responding to the eleven complaints
received from customers related to air being forced into the water mains. 



 The Transit Shop was ordered to install an approved double
check valve assembly on their water service.

 LOCATION: Huachuca City, Arizona 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Arizona Dept. of
Health Services, 

 City of Glendale, Arizona 



 SUMMARY: With a loss of water pressure,
the pesticide CHLORDANE was backsiphoned through a submerged garden hose into the water
distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 23, 1972, the State Health Dept. received
notification from Huachuca City that the city was investigating a complaint of strange
taste and odor in the water distribution system. The city thought that the cause was
backsiphonage from a drum of pesticides. 



 Water samples analyzed by the Arizona State Department
Laboratory found CHLORDANE pesticide residuals varying from 0.8 to 236 ppb throughout the
area. 



 Upon investigation, a residence was discovered, in the
area where the complaints occurred, where pesticides had apparently been mixed regularly
in a 30 gallon drum by an employee of an exterminating company. One empty drum with an
odor of pesticides was laying on the ground. There were also two faucets with hoses
attached, the end of both hoses had a strong odor of pesticides. 



 On the afternoon of March 21, to install a new water meter
on the distribution system, an employee of the water company closed the outlet valve on
the pressure tank at the well pump which serves water to the area. The first water quality
complaint was received the following day. 



 The well and pressure tank, and the major portion of the
water distribution system are at a lower elevation than the residence where the pesticides
were mixed, accounting for the backsiphonage condition. 



 The only person reporting illness was a woman who drank
coke with ice from an ice-making machine in a bar located in the affected area. 



 1972-003 

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 1972 

 LOCATION: New Westminster, British
Columbia 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Unknown 



 SUMMARY: River water, drawn by an
automatic pump, was forced past a check valve into the potable water system of a mill. 



 DETAILS: 



 A large mill on the Fraser River near New Westminster,
British Columbia began experiencing a high rate of absenteeism. The Personnel Manager
called on the local health unit to see what might be the cause. The absent employees
showed the following symptoms: 



 1. Stomach Cramps - moderate to severe 

 2. Diarrhoea - severe, lasting up to six weeks 

 3. Considerable weight loss (7-20 lbs.) 



 However, appetites were generally good and employee&apos;s
families were not affected. 



 Inspection of the premises revealed that the cafeteria and
food dispensing devices were kept clean and sanitary, as were water fountains and
washrooms. However, a dual water system was noted. One was connected to the City water
supply and provided for washrooms, drinking fountains, automatic food machines and the
domestic system generally, as well as for fire hydrants, sprinklers, boilers and various
other mill operations. The other was an auxiliary system, connected to that section
serving the mill operation. Water for the auxiliary system was drawn from the Fraser River
by a pump which was activated whenever the City supply dropped below a set pressure. Also,
it was noted that the river inlet was close to the City sewer outfall. There was a check
valve below the domestic section and the industrial portion. However, further checking of
the system showed that whenever the automatic pump drew water from the river, it was
forcing the water past the check valve on the domestic side of the system. No lives were
lost but the episode was certainly expensive in terms of days off work and lost
production.

Department 



 SUMMARY: Upon the opening of a fire
hydrant, the Seattle Fire Department discovered diesel oil in the water; the result of a
cross connection between and the hydrant drain and the sewer. 



 DETAILS: 



 On Saturday, March 24, 1973 the Seattle Water Department
received a report that the fire department had operated a fire hydrant and&quot;gasoline&quot;had come out of the port. Upon inspection, there was oil around the
fire hydrant (it turned out to be diesel oil) and in the street, but the water coming out
of the fire hydrant cleared after a few minutes. It was theorized that the diesel oil had
entered the barrel of the hydrant through the underground drain on the hydrant. 



 On the following Monday, the odor oil was found again in
the water from the fire hydrant. The hydrant was dug up and a drain line was found leading
to the sewer. An inspection of the area found diesel oil in a nearby service station and
the operator reported that diesel oil had been dumped into the sewer recently.

 SUMMARY: A break in a 24-inch water main
resulted in CHLORDANE being backsiphoned into the distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 An exterminating contractor created an illegal cross
connection by diluting a quantity of the highly toxic insecticide, CHLORDANE, by means of
a submerged garden hose into a drum. A break in a 24-inch water main occurred during this
operation, caused a negative pressure in the distribution system resulting in the
backsiphonage of the contents of the drum, through the house service connection and into
the distribution system. 



 Although extensive flushing of the water main was
undertaken by the water authority, the velocity provided by the standard fire hydrant
ports was insufficient to properly flush out CHLORDANE from the large main. The required
velocity was achieved by attaching a fire pumper truck to a 4-inch port on the hydrant.

industrial mall was contaminated through the backflow of a cleaning solvent from an
automotive coating shop. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 25, 1973, a backflow incident was reported in
an automobile coating shop located in an industrial mall. Cars are driven into the shop
for the application of undercoating and preventative coating in trunks, under hoods, door
panels, etc., to prevent corrosion. The mall was only partially filled with tenants; the
undercoating shop located in number 11, and the next occupied unit being number 21,
leaving 9 unoccupied units in between. 



 In the pre-cleaning operation, hot and cold water was fed
to pump operating at approximately 75 psi. The discharge side of the pump connected to a
gun type spray nozzle. A hose was then connected from the pump into a solvent tank that
supplied the solvent to the spray gun. 



 On October 25, the pump was left on between cycles,
allowing the pump pressure of 75 psi to overcome the city water main pressure of 50 psi,
causing the cleaning solvent to backflow into the potable water supply piping in the mall.
A tenant in unit number 21, the next occupied unit, reported a bad taste in the water,
leading to a discovery of the cross connection. 



 In order to clean the water piping of the contaminant, it
was necessary to drain the lines, after which they were steam cleaned.

 SUMMARY: A faulty check valve in a
greenhouse allowed fungicide to be injected into city water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 Due to a cross connection between a pressurized chemical
application system and a potable water line and a mechanical failure of an unapproved
single check valve, an undetermined volume of a fungicide was injected into the city water
distribution system. City water pressure - 60 psi, Chemical application system pressure -
300 psi. 



 Numerous complaints were received concerning odorous
drinking water from residents in the area.

 SUMMARY: Water system contamination
resulted from the backsiphonage of the herbicide Balan from a trailer mounted tank being
filled by means of a garden hose. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 11, 1974 the Village of Soldiers Grove, Illinois
reported that their water system had been contaminated by the herbicide Balan. A fire
hydrant was being replaced at a major intersection in the village. Because no valve was
provided in the hydrant lead and valving of the water main was inadequate, it was
necessary to close off the reservoir and drain the entire distribution system. The
herbicide entered the distribution system just 200 feet east of the hydrant being
replaced. 



 The herbicide had been syphoned out of a 300 gallon tank
mounted on a trailer. At the time of the water system shutdown, water was being added to
the tank by means of a garden hose, with the end submerged in the liquid. Six and one half
gallons of herbicide had been added to the tank. 



 The herbicide Balan is practically non-toxic, and at least
2 lbs. of the undiluted herbicide would have to be ingested by a 200 lb. man to cause
death. 



 The water system was thoroughly flushed and chlorinated
before being returned to service.

 SUMMARY: The high rate of flow caused by
the activation of a fire deluge system reduced pressure in a domestic water line at the
Sea-Tac Airport to below atmospheric causing the backsiphonage of a chemical De-Germ and
other pollutants into the potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On July 18, 1974 an engineer with Sea-Tac Airport informed
the Seattle Water Department that a backflow incident had occurred at one of the airline
buildings and that a chemical, De-Germ, was introduced into the potable water supply. Two
units of the airline building&apos;s fire deluge system had activated, causing the chemical and
possible other pollutants to enter the domestic water system at the facility. 



 Two pumps at the airport water pumping station had
activated, causing a peak of 195 psi in the airline hanger facility. About 15 minutes
elapsed before the airport fire department had secured both the fire and domestic water
supplies. A 2-inch water line to an irrigation system at the airport broke on or about the
same time that emergency pumps were activated. When the water service was restored, blue
colored water was observed coming from the drinking fountains. 



 The hanger facility has one 2000 gallon capacity storage
tank containing the blue colored chemical De-Germ, used to sanitize and flush toilets in
aircraft. A 1 1/4-inch RPBD was installed as a result of an earlier backflow incident in
this area. It was found that a domestic 3/4-inch cold water line was directly connected to
the storage tank lines, by-passing this RPBD. 



 When the deluge system was activated and excessive demand
was placed on the supply system, reducing pressure to less than atmospheric. The chemical
and possibly other pollutants were backsiphoned into the domestic water system. When the
emergency pumps were activated, the chemical was spread to other areas of the airline
hanger.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of a boiler
treatment chemical into the water system caused several children to become ill after
consuming contaminated soft drinks at a fast food restaurant. 



 DETAILS: 



 On December 7, 1974 in a moderate size city in North
Carolina, a fast food restaurant received complaints of a bitter taste in the soft drinks
they were selling. Over 300 people were served soft drinks during the period in question. 



 Syrups were changed several times but to no avail. The
manager, realizing the principle ingredient was water, drew a glass of water from the
nearby tap. It was found to be discolored with a strong chemical taste. The local water
department was notified and an investigation was immediately started. 



 The water department traced the problem to a chemical in
the water and determined that the particular chemical was used to treat boiler water in a
fertilizer plant, located one half mile away from the restaurant. Investigation at the
fertilizer plant revealed that a check valve on the supply line to the boiler was leaking
and allowed the chemicals in the boiler to backflow into the water main in the street that
supplied both the fertilizer plant and the restaurant. 



 Complaints of children becoming ill as a result of
drinking the beverages at the restaurant have been received with threats of lawsuits.

 SUMMARY: Twenty employees became ill as
result of consuming water contaminated with a chromate solution through a cross connection
with the building&apos;s air conditioning system make up system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On September 21, 1974, trouble developed in the 5th and
6th floor air conditioning system located in a 32 story office building. The building was
equipped with an air conditioning system located in the roof, however, the 5th&amp;6th
floors had an independent system. 



 To repair a compressor, the service company temporarily
connected the 5th and 6th floor system to the building&apos;s air conditioning system.
Following repair of the compressor on September 22, a maintenance man from the service
company connected a hose from a threaded faucet on the 5th floor to the 5th and 6th floor
air conditioning system to obtain make-up water. However, the building&apos;s air conditioning
system remained hooked into the 5th and 6th floor air conditioning system. Since the
building&apos;s air conditioning system pressure was higher than the potable water system
pressure on the 5th and 6th floors, water from the air conditioning system containing
chromates flowed through the temporary hose connection into the potable water system. 



 Twenty employees in the office building became ill after
drinking the chromate contaminated water.

 SUMMARY: The backsiphonage of a chromium
compound from the chiller water of an air conditioning system contaminated the drinking
water system in the auditorium housing the 94th Annual American Water Works Association
Conference and Exposition. 



 DETAILS: 



 Tuesday, June 18, 1974, was a hot humid day for the
thousands of registrants at Boston&apos;s Hynes Memorial Auditorium for the 94th Annual
American Water Works Conference and Exposition. 



 Murmurs of&quot;turn up the air conditioning&quot;were
soon followed by&quot;check the air conditioning&quot;as thousands of people noticed a
yellow hue to the drinking water. A chromium compound was added to the chilled water
system by means of manual shut-off valve. It was later determined that this shut-off valve
was inadvertently left open. A reverse flow condition occurred and resulted in&quot;yellow water&quot;being distributed to drinking fountains, soda fountains and
coffee makers in the auditorium.

 SUMMARY: During the filling of a portable
toilet company&apos;s tank truck, a solution of soap and formaldehyde was siphoned into a
customer&apos;s water line service. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 16, 1975, a truck driver employed by a portable
toilet company attempted to fill a tank on his service truck from a standpipe connection
on a domestic water service line while a City of Tacoma Water Division crew was working on
the service connection. The water was turned off at the service connection to permit the
city crew to cut the 3-inch service pipe to install a new water meter. The truck driver
submerged a hose in his tank containing a soap and formaldehyde solution, then turned on
the hose bib, thus creating a backsiphonage situation which resulted in the contents of
the tank being siphoned into the service line. 



 No one was reported to have consumed any of the
contaminant. 



 The water customer was ordered to install vacuum breakers
on all hose connections within the property. The portable toilet company was instructed to
install an approved air gap on the fill connection their tank truck.

 SUMMARY: The contamination of a small
public water supply system was caused by the backsiphonage of the pesticide Endrin from an
applicator&apos;s tank truck during filling. 



 DETAILS: 



 In November, 1976, approximately 300 gallons of liquid
containing 1.2 lbs of the pesticide Endrin was backsiphoned from a pesticide applicator&apos;s
truck into a small public water system service to 21 residents at East Monitor near
Wenatchee, Washington. Endrin is a very toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon which is applied to
orchards in the late fall for the control of mice. The lethal dose (LD 50) for the
compound is 5 mg (dosage) per kg (body weight). 



 The incident occurred when, by coincidence, three
applicators were filling their trucks from three separate hydrants on a pipeline
connecting the system&apos;s well to a storage tank. The tank was located about 1/2 mile away
at an elevation of nearly 200 feet above the well. The withdrawal of water to fill the
trucks at the lower elevation created a negative pressure in the high end of the pipeline
and the contents of the truck at that location were siphoned into the system. 



 The system does not have anyone in charge on a full-time
basis. Consequently, the contamination problem was not detected and brought to the
attention of health officials until two days after the incident took place. During that
time, several families drank and bathed in the contaminated water. Fortunately, the
chemical was greatly diluted in its passage through the storage tank and no illnesses were
reported. 



 When the State was notified, the system was ordered shut
down, water consumers were appraised of the situation and a sampling program was
initiated. The initial samples showed 130 ppb of Endrin in the water. It was necessary to
drain and scrub the reservoir and continually flush the system for more than a week before
the contaminant was reduced to negligible levels and the system could be placed back into
operation.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: March, 1976 

 LOCATION: Chattanooga, Tennessee 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: &quot;Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report&quot; 



 SUMMARY: Water system contamination
resulted from the backsiphonage of the insecticide Chlordane following a break in a city
water main. 

 DETAILS: 



 On March 24, 1976 several residences in Chattanooga, TN
noticed that their tap water had suddenly turned white and smelled of insecticide. By the
following day it was established that a 3 block area was affected and the water supply was
promptly cut off by the water purveyor. Samples of the water taken on the evening of March
24, revealed Chlordane as the contaminant in concentration up to 1200 parts per million. 



 A house-to-house survey conducted on March 26&amp;27,
reached 45 of the 49 affected households. Of the 112 persons questioned, 17 said they had
drunk the suspect water, another 15 had casual contact through washing, bathing or
brushing teeth. Four persons gave a history of probable Chlordane toxicity; that is
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, in addition to neurological
involvement such as dizziness, blurred vision, irritability, headache, paresthesia, muscle
weakness, or twitching. Nine others had gastrointestinal symptoms alone. One of the
suspected cases developed a fever of 102 F. No deaths occurred. 



 Results of the quantitative analysis for Chlordane in the
water focused attention on a section of one affected street as the possible source of
contamination. A strong smell of Chlordane came from the fountain of a house there, and
soil samples from around the house were found to contain Chlordane in concentrations
greater than 1,000 ppm. Chlordane had been used at the house on March 24, for
extermination of termites. The concentrated Chlordane solution had been diluted with tap
water approximately 90 minutes before Chlordane was detected downstream in the water
system. The exact mode of entry of the insecticide into the water supply is not clear. The
most likely explanation is that the siphonage of Chlordane occurred during the process of
diluting the insecticide when the hose from the faucet dipped below the level of the
concentrated Chlordane. Several water mains had been broken the preceding week by
contractors, causing variable water pressure in the system. The Chattanooga Water
Department later reported that all traces of Chlordane could not be flushed from the
system, the 3 blocks of contaminated water mains were replaced and 47 homes vacated. The
total cost for main replacement and payment of damages exceeded $1,000,000.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: March, 1976 

 LOCATION: Salem, Oregon 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: City of Salem 



 SUMMARY: Water fountains in the State
Capitol Building were contaminated with freon gas from a ruptured heat exchanger. The gas
after combining with fluoride in the water supply, formed an acid compound that caused a
bitter, burning taste. 



 DETAILS: 



 On the evening of March 9, 1976 in the State Capitol
Building at Salem, Oregon, two maintenance workers drank water from a drinking fountain
and reported a bitter taste to security guards. 



 About 8:30 a.m. the next morning, one maintenance worker
sampled the water by taking a drink from a fountain. The worker still felt a burning
sensation in his mouth at 10:30 a.m. The fountains in the building were shut down and&quot;taped off&quot;to prevent anyone from drinking from them. 



 The suspected contaminant was freon gas that entered the
potable water system through a rupture in a heat exchanger of a chilling unit. This was
confirmed later in the afternoon when a refrigeration repairman arrived to test and repair
the heat exchanger. 



 Freon gas when mixed with water containing fluoride
creates a type of acid, thus explaining the burning sensation experienced by the
maintenance personnel. 



 Maintenance personnel removed the heat exchanger from the
system, completely drained the water system, including the holding tank on the top floor,
then flushed the system.

 SUMMARY: The backsiphonage of a
fertilizer occurred when snow clearing operations knocked over two fire hydrants. 



 DETAILS: 



 In Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1976, as a result of snow
clearing operations, two fire hydrants within a one block area were knocked over. The
result was that through backsiphonage a blue colored liquid fertilizer from a nearby
florist operation entered the water supply. Numerous consumer complaints were received.
Since the contamination was colored, luckily no one ingested the water.

 SUMMARY: A faulty DCVA permitted lake
water to be pumped through an irrigation system into the public water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 16, 1976 the San Antonio Water Board received a
call from an employee of a claims center, stating that there was possibility that water
from a private lake located on the grounds had been pumped through the lawn sprinkler
system into the center&apos;s domestic line, then into the public water main. 



 An investigation revealed that no chlorine was present in
the claims center domestic water supply, and bacteriological samples taken of the water
were positive for total coliform. At the same time, the public water system had a chlorine
residual of 0.75 mg/L, which could indicate that no lake water had entered the public
water system. However, a check of water meter readings showed approximately 103,000 cu.
ft. of water went through the meter in the reverse direction. 



 A 3-inch double check valve assembly was installed on the
supply to the lawn irrigation system from the center&apos;s domestic line. The DCVA was not
tested at the time of the installation in 1974 or at any time thereafter. 



 The irrigation service with the DCVA was removed, leaving
the irrigation system to be fed solely by the auxiliary supply.

 SUMMARY: An unprotected cross connection
between a closed hot water heating system and the domestic water system resulted in the
backflow of Borate-Nitrite from the heating boiler. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 15, 1977 a hospital in Seattle, Washington
reported&quot;red&quot;water. Upon investigation, the problem was determined to be a
cross connection between the closed hot water heating system and the cold water make-up
supply line. No backflow prevention device was provided on the hot water heating boiler. A
PRV apparently failed, forcing water treated with Borate-Nitrite (for corrosion
protection) back into the potable water system. 



 The Borate-Nitrite solution in the hot water heating
system is mixed 1:1000. The water in the lavatory above the cross connection had
approximately 175 parts per million Borate-Nitrite. The water in the fresh water make up
line had approximately 3450 ppm Borate-Nitrite. The color of the water was pink and
fuschia respectively. 



 The Poison Center was contacted to determine the toxicity
level of Borate-Nitrite and to determine what effect, if any, the material would have on
the accidental consumer. The levels detected in the lavatory hand basin were low enough
that only persons who were acutely sensitive to the material would have any reaction.
However, the strongly contaminated water would have caused skin reactions and immediate
vomiting. There were no further incidents reported in the hospital and no cases of illness
noted from ingesting the Borate-Nitrite. 



 A RPBD was installed on the water make-up line to the
boiler.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of a photographic
developer solution lead to 544 crewmen on a U.S. Navy vessel developing gastrointestinal
illness. 



 DETAILS: 



 Between July 21 and July 31, 1977, 544 crewmen aboard a
large U.S. Navy vessel developed gastrointestinal disease. The illness was characterized
by the acute onset of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea generally resolving
within 12 to 36 hours. Stool and vomitus culture from patients as well as cultures of
water and various foods failed to yield any bacterial pathogens. 



 On the morning of July 28, when reporting for their
required morning roll call, 301 men from four units with the high attack rates wee
interviewed. Fifty-five of these individuals met the definition of the case, i.e.,
vomiting during the last seven days, leaving 246 controls. Interview responses indicated
that cases were significantly more likely to have drunk water while the ship was at sea,
implicating the ship&apos;s water system. 



 On July 19, two days prior to the onset of the outbreak, a
chilled drinking water system to the forward part of the ship was used for the first time
in over a year. Because the time relationship implicated this water system, it was shut
down July 28. Within the next 24 hours, there was a reduction in the number of cases. 



 Subsequently, it was learned that the chilled water system
supplied water to automatic photo-developing machines on the ship. A makeshift cross
connection in the form of a rubber hose was detected leading to the ship&apos;s potable water
system from a 40 gallon tank used to mix photographic developer solution that contained
hydroquinone.

 SUMMARY: The failure of a control switch
permitted the backflow of a scale prevention chemical into a buildings water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On July 11, 1977, the water quality division received a
call from a building manager complaining about having green water throughout his four
story building. 



 An investigation revealed a cross connection between a
scale prevention chemical and the potable water supply existed within the building. The
chemical was being pumped into the potable water supply due to a failure of the control
switch which stuck in the&quot;on&quot;position and continuously pumped the chemical
over the weekend in the reverse direction from that intended. No backflow preventer was
installed on the cross connection. 



 The owner was ordered to install a reduced pressure
principle assembly at the point of the cross connection and also at the water meter on the
service to the building.

 SUMMARY: A defective check valve on a
soft drink dispenser permitted CO 2 gas and carbonated water to flow back into
copper piping of a hospital water system causing acute gastroenteritis in 36 people. 



 DETAILS: 



 Three employees at a Vermont hospital became ill with
nausea and vomiting on the afternoon of March 28, 1977, within 5 minutes of consuming a
carbonated soft drink in the hospital coffee shop. A survey of hospital employees revealed
46 additional individuals who had onset of gastrointestinal symptoms during the afternoon
or evening of the same day, of all those reporting illness, 36 had consumed soft drinks
dispensed from the beverage machine. 



 Samples of water and ice produced in an ice machine
indicated pH levels below 5.4 and the presence of a blue precipitate. After re-suspension
of the precipitate in the laboratory, the copper levels in the water and ice samples
ranged from 7-70 mg/l. (E.P.A. recommends levels of copper no higher than 1.0 mg/l). 



 The carbonated beverages were dispensed from a machine
that was supplied by carbonated water produced in a system adjacent to the machine. Carbon
dioxide gas from pressurized tanks was mixed with water to form the carbonated water used
in the soft drink dispenser. A defective check valve had permitted the co2 gas and
carbonated water to flow back into the copper piping of the hospital water system.
Leaching of the copper from the pipes resulted in high levels of copper in the water
supplied to the beverage and ice machines and to the tap.

 SUMMARY: School&apos;s water system
contaminated through backsiphonage of septic tank sewage. 



 DETAILS: 



 On May 4, 1978 the Artondale School reported approximately
200 out of 608 children from the school were absent. At the close of school the day before
only 15 were absent. The cause of the absenteeism appeared to be a gastrointestinal
illness. 



 The Washington State Epidemiologist reported that the bulk
of the clinical illness was most likely caused by the Norwalk agent virus. Illness spread
through household contacts of students and faculty with a secondary attack rate of
approximately 32%. The illness, in total, affected over 75% of the students and teachers
at the Artondale School. 



 Drinking water at the school was the vehicle by which the
etiologic virus was transmitted. The water showed evidence of fecal contamination.

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Vancouver Water
Department 



 SUMMARY: The contamination of a
building&apos;s water supply system by high concentration of copper resulted from the backflow
of carbon dioxide gas from a beverage machine. 



 DETAILS: 



 On January 18, 1978 employees of a theater reported that
the water in the building had a blue color and a strong&quot;mineral&quot;taste. The
problem occurred intermittently and a sample of the water taken that afternoon revealed
nothing unusual. However, a sample taken and analyzed the next day was found to contain
245 parts per million of copper. Drinking water standards suggest a limit of 1.0 ppm of
copper. 



 A cross connection inspection found a pressure regulator
on a carbon dioxide cylinder used at the beverage bar had malfunctioned, resulting in a
large amount of gas entering the domestic water system. The standard ball check valve
installed on this type of beverage dispenser was ineffective in preventing backflow. 



 The carbon dioxide formed carbonic acid, which caused
rapid internal corrosion of the copper water piping in the theater. 



 Although copper is not considered to be a cumulative
systematic poison such as lead or mercury, a high concentration in the water supply may
cause nausea or discomfort, and in a very limited number of people, an allergic reaction.

Department 



 SUMMARY: The domestic water system in a
high rise apartment building was contaminated by the backflow of the corrosion inhibitor
Bramco 750 from the apartment&apos;s heating boiler. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 10, 1978 the residents of a high rise apartment
building in Vancouver&apos;s West End reported that their water had a blue color and a bitter&quot;rubbery&quot;taste. Water Department staff responding to the complaint determined
that the&quot;blue&quot;water was confined to the apartment building. 



 An inspection of the apartment revealed that the single
soft seated check valve on the boiler feed line was leaking. The expansion of the water
(steam) when heated caused a backflow of the water in the boiler past the leaking single
check valve into the domestic water system. The analysis of the tap water revealed that
the water contained a corrosion inhibitor, Bramco 750, that was presently being used in
the apartment&apos;s boiler for the hot water heating system. Only one of the three components
of Bramco 750 is toxic when used full strength. With the dilution of the corrosion
inhibitor after mixing with the potable water, the consumption of it would not be toxic. 



 The Water Department issued an order to replace the single
check valve with an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. The
apartment&apos;s domestic water system was thoroughly flushed to remove all traces of the
corrosion inhibitor.

 SUMMARY: The plumbing system in a church
was contaminated by Chlordane backsiphoned through a hose bib following the shut off of
the water main in the street. 



 DETAILS: 



 In August, 1978 an exterminator was treating a church
located in a small town in South Carolina for termite and pest control. The highly toxic
insecticide, Chlordane, was being mixed with water in buckets, and garden hoses were left
submerged in the buckets during the mixing process. 



 At the same time, water department personnel came by to
disconnect the parsonage water line from the church to install a separate meter for the
parsonage. In the process, the water main was valved off in the area of the church. The
church is located on a steep hill, and, as the remaining water in the lines was used by
other residents in the area, the church was among the first places to experience a
negative pressure. The Chlordane was quickly siphoned back into the water lines within the
church. 



 The exterminators finished their work and left, unaware
that a backsiphonage had occurred. That same night, Vacation Bible School began, and as
the mothers were mixing kool-aid in the kitchen, the Chlordane laced water was used. Due
to the very strong Chlordane odor being prevalent throughout the church, detecting the
odor in the water was difficult. However, some of the adults did detect the bad taste and
odor in the water just as the children had been served the kool-aid. The children were
warned immediately and the remaining kool-aid was taken away for disposal. 



 Approximately a dozen children and three adults
experienced dizziness and nausea. None of the affected required hospitalization or sought
medical attention. 



 The plumbing in the church was flushed repeatedly and
chlorinated. Liquid dishwashing detergent was flushed through the system in an effort to
remove the Chlordane from the water pipes. Yet, some months later the whole church had to
be re-plumbed in order to get rid of the lingering Chlordane which clung to the walls of
the pipes and continued to affect the water adversely.

 SUMMARY: Contamination of a municipal
water system by DDT due to backsiphonage from a garden hose type aspirator sprayer. 



 DETAILS: 



 During the summer of 1979 the residents of Kulm, North
Dakota complained that their water had an iodine-like taste. The water left a burning
sensation on the lips and throat for 10 to 15 minutes. Residents reported both the burning
sensation and minor stomach disorders. Both the southeast and north side of town was
affected. The mayor notified the state health department. The National Guard was called in
to provide an alternate supply of water. 



 The distribution system was flushed eight times over a
period of three days to remove the contamination. Laboratory analysis confirmed the
presence of DDT at both locations. A trace amount of DDT was found in the samples taken
after repeated flushing of the system, however, none of the levels were high enough to be
toxic to humans. 



 Backflow prevention and cross connection control in Kulm
was reviewed. During the survey, two Kulm residents were found filling sprayers containing
herbicide with their garden hoses. The ends of the hoses were immersed in the herbicide
water and the hoses had no backflow preventer. If a negative pressure developed in the
water system, the herbicide could have been drawn into the water system. Apparently this
is how the DDT was introduced. Subsequent demands on the system spread the DDT
contamination. The ultimate source of the DDT was never found. The identification of the
banned substance only adds to complicate the matter. The sampling done by the state health
department was done after the fact, hence the levels of DDT could have been even higher at
the initial time of contamination.

Bureau 



 SUMMARY: Water containing detergent
backflowed through a faulty reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly. 



 DETAILS: 



 On September 18, 1979 a concrete plant at the foot of S.E.
Ivon Street reported foamy water in their plant. Two water samples taken from within the
plant by a Portland Water Bureau water quality inspector confirmed the foaming agent.
Samples were taken from three fire hydrants in the area; at two of the hydrants foamy
water was found. Water Bureau crews were dispatched to flush water mains in the affected
area. 



 A dairy in the area was suspected as the source of the
contaminant since the backflow of a similar agent occurred there in 1970 before the
installation of backflow prevention devices in the dairy&apos;s service connections. A check of
the dairy&apos;s detergent wash station found an indication of a possible backflow from the
detergent pump lines. 



 Both of the dairy&apos;s reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention devices were tested and both found to be in poor condition with a 4-inch device
completely failing the test (both check valves and the relief valve). The Water Bureau
records showed that the dairy&apos;s devices were installed by a contractor in 1971; one 4-inch
and one 3-inch. In their last annual performance test in February, 1979 both devices met
the minimum test specifications, i.e. relief valve opened at 2.0 psi. 



 Complete repair kits were installed on both devices,
replacing discs, gaskets and all worn parts.

 SUMMARY: The backsiphonage of&quot;stagnant water&quot;containing high bacterial counts occurred from a fire sprinkler
system through a leaking alarm check valve. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 18, 1979 the residents of the City of Meridian,
Idaho reported their water supply had an odor and taste of onions. During this period, the
city was routinely flushing fire hydrants throughout the area involved. As with the
complaints, the odor would occur but a consistent pattern could not be determined. The
city&apos;s water system is supplied by four wells and a 500,000 storage tank which rides on
the system. The wells have an alternate pumping schedule and the water system is looped.
This arrangement had a contributing affect on the odor occurrence. 



 By isolating portions of the water system, and conducting
a premise by premise inspection, the source of the contamination was narrowed to one area
containing a supermarket, car wash and a church printing firm. The nearest fire hydrant
was flushed and the odor became very strong. The final inspection revealed that the alarm
check valve on the fire sprinkler system in the supermarket was leaking. When the city
water pressure was reduced during hydrant flushing, the alarm check valve clapper would
leak, but the clapper would not open enough to set off the alarm. When the service was
turned off to the supermarket , the odor and taste problem did not occur during hydrant
flushing. Water samples taken from the sprinkler system identified Clonothrix fusa and
Zoogleora ramigera bacteria in sufficient concentration that would cause the onion taste
and odor problem.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: October, 1979 

 LOCATION: Seattle, Washington 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Seattle Water
Department 



 SUMMARY: The backflow of a cooling
solution into a building&apos;s water system occurred due to a leak in a cooling coil combined
with a faulty control valve. 



 DETAILS: 

 On October 29, 1979 the Seattle Water Department received
a phone call from a customer concerning pink water flowing from a drinking fountain in
their machine shop. By the time the Seattle Water Quality Inspector arrived, employees of
the company had found the cause of the pink water; a heat exchanger cooling solution
(similar to hydraulic fluid) was being forced back into the potable water system that
supplied the heat exchanger. The gate valve on the city service pipe was closed
immediately and the circulating pump shut off. The pump was operating at 160 psi against a
city water main pressure of 70 to 80 psi. Samples of the&quot;pink&quot;water were
taken, the building plumbing system flushed thoroughly, and the city water main serving
the building flushed as well. Apparently none of the cooling solution had been pumped back
into the city supply main. 



 An inspection of the plant found that the cooling solution
used at a milling machine is monitored by a temperature controlled valve on the discharge
side of the heat exchanger. When the solution temperature rises, this valve opens and
allows city water to flow through the coils in the heat exchanger to cool the solution.
The city water is discharged to waste. 



 The backflow condition occurred with the concurrent
failure of two of the system components. First, the cooling coil carrying city water
developed a leak. This normally would not itself have posed a problem, since it would
discharge to waste. However, the temperature controlled valve on the discharge line also
malfunctioned and stuck in the closed position, thereby creating a situation in which the
160 psi pump was forcing the cooling solution back through the coil into the water supply. 



 A reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
was ordered placed on the water supply line to the heat exchanger. 



 In the past, heat exchangers or other devices with cooling
coils were not cited by seattle as a cross connection as long as the discharge was air
gapped at a drain receptacle. The primary concern was sewerage backing up and submerging
the discharge line and permitting backsiphonage under a negative pressure condition.

 SUMMARY: Contamination resulted when the
wash water from a car wash storage tank was pumped into the city water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 12, 1979 several residents of the Greenwood
District of Seattle, Washington reported soapy water coming from their taps. The
investigation by the Seattle Water Department found that the soapy water came from a car
wash on Aurora Avenue North. 



 On February 10, a pump broke down at the car wash. This
was a high pressure pump which takes its suction from the tanks containing reclaimed wash&amp;rinse water, and pumps (recycles) it into the wash cycle of the car wash. This cycle
is not designed to be connected to the car wash potable water supply. 



 After the pump broke down, the piping in the rinse cycle
which operates with city water pressure was connected to the wash cycle piping by means of
a two inch hose. This arrangement allowed the car wash to remain in operation during pumps
repairs. 



 On February 12, the owner came to the car wash and
examined the pump. The pump was repaired almost immediately and turned on. The two inch
hose (cross connection) remained connected between the rinse and wash cycle piping. The
pump forced the contents of the two reclaim tanks (850 gallons) into the 12-inch water
main on Aurora Avenue North through the car wash service connection. 



 Sometime later, an employee went into the car wash&apos;s
restroom and noticed brown soapy water in the toilet bowl after it flushed. The cross
connection was immediately realized and the two inch hose removed. 



 The contamination was confined to an eight block area. The
water mains were flushed and chlorinated by the Seattle Water Department. 



 A reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
was ordered installed on the water service pipe to provide premise isolation.

 SUMMARY: Water system contamination
resulted from the backsiphonage of the insecticide Chlordane following the interruption of
water system supply pressure. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 12, 1979 the residents along the 4900 block of
Autumn Lane complained that their water looked milky, felt greasy, foamed and smelled like&quot;a combination of kerosene and Black Flag pesticide&quot;. Approximately three
gallons of Chlordane, a highly toxic insecticide, had been backsiphoned into the city
water system. 



 The contamination occurred while water department
personnel were repairing a water main. At the same time an exterminator was treating a
nearby home with Chlordane for termite control. The workmen for the exterminating company
left one end of the hose connected to an outside hose tap and left the other in a barrel
of diluted insecticide. During the water service interruption, the solution was
backsiphoned into the house plumbing and then into the city water main. The homes in the
effected area, because of the hilly terrain, were particularly susceptible to
backsiphonage. 



 The water department undertook an extensive program of
flushing water mains. The insecticide, however, adhered to the inside of the pipes. Tests
of water samples taken six days after the contamination showed Chlordane levels five times
greater than considered safe. 



 The water department tapped into the water main at two
points along the street to continue flushing operations. For several days residents either
carried water to their homes from two 400 gallon water tanks the city put up on a vacant
lot in the area, or traveled to homes of friends or relatives to shower and eat meals. 



 The contamination affected homes in the 4700 to 4900 block
of Autumn Lane. As can be expected, a lawsuit was initiated. In 1985 the lawsuit was
settled in the plaintiff&apos;s favor with an award of $13,000,000.

 SUMMARY: An outbreak of diarrheal illness
in campground residents resulted from a cross connection with an irrigation system
containing sewage effluent. 



 DETAILS: 



 Between June and September, 1979 six groups of California
residents and one group of Arizona residents reported experiencing a diarrheal illness
during and after visiting a marina and campground at a state park on the Colorado River.
The diarrheal illness was characterized by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss,
nausea, chills, headache, vomiting and fever (G. 100 deg. F). 



 The only risk factor associated with illness was drinking
water from one&apos;s campsite faucet. Forty of the 76 persons who drank campsite water became
ill as compared with 17 of the 86 persons who denied drinking the water. The attack rate
increased with the amount of water consumed. Illness was not associated with water from
other sources, water skiing, swimming, food from the campground store, or ice. 



 Evaluation of the water system in September revealed a
cross connection between a water pipe serving the west side of the campground where the
campers reported becoming ill, and an irrigation pipe containing sewage effluent.

 SUMMARY: Following the shut down of a
water main for repairs, steam from a heating boiler emerged from a broken pipe. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 13, 1979 the water board dispatched a crew to
repair a water main break. When the water main was shut down for repairs, with the
subsequent loss of water pressure, a steady flow of steam emerged from the pipe. 



 The steam entered the water system from a chemical
injected steam boiler located in a nearby building. 



 The owners of the building were required to install an
approved air gap or approved reduced pressure principle assembly on the service to the
building.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection of water
lines between potable and non-potable water at a meat packing plant caused contamination
of $2,000,000 of pork. 



 DETAILS: 



 In October 1979 at a meat packing plant in Marshalltown,
Iowa, $2,000,000 worth of pork was contaminated. The meat became contaminated when the
plant employees sprayed contaminated water on hog carcasses and cuttings during the normal
cleaning process. Food safety and quality service officials have concluded that there was
a cross connection of water lines between potable and non-potable water, causing sewage
water from the kill floor and water used to deodorize rendering operations to get into the
potable water line.

 SUMMARY: A high rise office building&apos;s
water system was contaminated by the backflow of chemically treated water from a solar
heating system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 1, 1980 a large fire occurred two blocks away
from a seven story office building in downtown Manchester, N.H. On March 2, the
maintenance crew of an office building arrived to perform the weekly cleaning, and, after
drinking the water from the drinking fountains, noticed a strong bitter taste. They
notified the Manchester Water Company which promptly initiated an extensive investigation.
Samples of the water were taken from the fixtures within the building, from neighboring
buildings, and from the water mains in the street. Preliminary analysis of the samples
disclosed that the contaminants found were not typical of the usual water main
contaminants associated with fire line disturbances. 



 The seven story office building housed one of the newest
solar heating systems in the northeastern area of the U.S. and accompanying it was a very
complex plumbing and piping system. A cross connection control inspection traced the water
line to determine the source of the contaminate. A potable supply line was located that
fed the make-up water to a 10,000 gallon hot water storage tank that was used for heat
storage for the solar heating system. Corrosion inhibiting chemicals were added to the
storage tank. The line did not contain a backflow prevention device. 



 Due to thermal expansion, the storage tank pressure could
increase above the city supply pressure. Normally backflow would not occur because a
booster pump in the main supply line would keep the supply pressure to the storage tank
greater than the highest tank pressure. Unfortunately, at the time of the fire, the
pressure in the city mains was depleted to an unusually low point and the low pressure
cut-off switches simultaneously shut off the booster pumps in the building. This
combination gave the boiler water, together with its chemical contaminants, time to travel
into the potable water system within the building. When pressure was reestablished in the
city mains and the booster pumps resumed operation, contaminated water was delivered
throughout the entire building.

 SUMMARY: A leak in a heat exchanger
resulted in oil being pumped into the city water distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 2, 1980 The City of Tacoma Water Department
received several complaints of oil in the water in the 1800 block of North Bristol Street.
It was determined that the oil was automatic transmission fluid coming from the variable
speed pump at the Westgate Pumping Station at North 21st and Pearl Streets. 



 Water was being taken from the discharge side of the pump
through a heat exchanger to cool the transmission fluid for the variable speed pump drive,
then put back into the suction side of the pump. The transmission fluid line inside the
heat exchanger developed a leak which allowed the fluid to mix with the water and be
pumped into the water distribution system. 



 The pump station was shut down until the heat exchanger
could be replaced. The cross connection was protected by the installation of a double
check valve assembly on the supply to the heat exchanger and piping the discharge to the
sewer through an air gap. 



 Fire hydrants in the area were flushed to clear the oil
from the distribution system.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection aboard a crab
processing ship resulted in the backflow of sewage contaminated water that caused about
200 employees to become ill and endangered about $35 million worth of processed king crab. 



 DETAILS: 



 A preliminary report filed by the Alaska State
epidemiologist stated that the water supply of a crab processing barge converted from a
World War II Liberty ship had become contaminated on September 22 or 23, 1980 and that
workers on the barge suffered attacks of vomiting and diarrhea until about September 26.
The source of the contamination was the ship&apos;s sewage system. 



 The processing barge draws its water supply from a
reservoir which also supplies the town of Unalaska and some 30 fish processing and canning
plants in the area. The reservoir&apos;s filters became clogged, reducing water pressure in the
system. The crab processing barge turned on its own pumps to boost its pressure. The
ship&apos;s pumps&quot;somehow&quot;created a vacuum in the system and sucked raw sewage back
into the water supply.

 DETAILS: 



 On November 19, 1980 the Water Quality Division was
notified that blue water was emerging from the main break. Upon investigation, very dark
blue-green water was found in a large quantity. 



 It was determined that the blue water was back-siphoned
from the commode tank located at a nearby residence. The customer at this address had a
bottle (inverted) of a Blue-Boy type additive installed in the tank. The commode type
filler valve was a fluid master without a vacuum breaker installed. The customer was

 SUMMARY: A break in a water main resulted
in the backsiphonage of 10 to 20 gallons of a detergent solution from a steam cleaning
tank. 



 DETAILS: 



 In August, 1980 a water main break on the supply line to a
reservoir in a small water system broke. The water users exhausted the stored water
supply, there was no longer a positive pressure in the water system. Between 10 and 20
gallons of the detergent K-90 in a steam cleaner tank at a trucking company was
backsiphoned into the potable water system. When water pressure was restored, the workers
at the trucking company noticed the color of the water was green. 



 The water system was flushed and chlorinated. 



 Approximately 1,000 people were affected by the cross

 SUMMARY: Galvanic corrosion between a gas
main and a copper water service caused concurrent leaks, hence a cross connection that
resulted in contamination of a gas line with water. 



 DETAILS: 



 The natural gas company in South Bend, Indiana was puzzled
and frustrated for several days by the presence of water in their gas lines. In the
residential area where it occurred there were sputtering gas appliances, frozen gas
regulators and homes without heat. 



 A 3/4-inch copper water service to a house was found to be
touching a 2-inch steel gas main. Exactly at the touch point a 1/8-inch hole had developed
in each line and a tight, solid cross connection was formed. Since the water was at a
higher pressure than the gas, the gas line was&quot;contaminated&quot;with water. 



 Both lines were installed at the three foot depth,
although specifications called for five feet on the water service. Records show the gas
main was installed in 1951 and the water service in 1952.

 SUMMARY: The removal of a damaged
backflow preventer lead to salt water being pumped from a shipyard&apos;s saltwater fire
protection system into the public water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On January 29, 1981, a fast food restaurant complained to
the water department that all their drinks were being rejected by customers as tasting&quot;salty&quot;. The inspection by the water department found that the cold water used
in making the drinks was chilled by passing through refrigeration coils and was
automatically blended with other ingredients to make the drinks. The chilled water system
as well as all potable water supply lines on the premises were inspected for cross
connection, however, none were found. 



 A check was then made with adjacent water customers which
revealed that an additional salty water complaint had occurred simultaneously at a
waterfront ship repair facility. Both the restaurant and the shipyard were being served by
the same water main lateral which, in turn, came off the main distribution line. A cross
connection inspection of the shipyard revealed the following: 



 * The backflow preventer that had been installed on the
service line to the shipyard had frozen and burst earlier in the winter. It had been
removed and was replaced by a sleeve in order to maintain the water supply to the
shipyard. 



 * The shipyard fire protection system consisted of high
pressure sea water mains maintained by both electric and diesel driven pumps. 



 * The pumps were primed through the use of a city water
line which was directly connected to the high pressure fire pump. 



 With the priming line left open and the first service
pumps maintaining high pressure in the fire main, raw salt water was being pumped under
positive backpressure through the sleeve into the public water distribution system. 



 To correct the problem, the city water primer line to the
pumps was removed and a new backflow preventer promptly installed at the service line in
place of the sleeve. Heat tape was wrapped around the backflow preventer to prevent future
freezing.

 SUMMARY: Approximately three hundred
residents of a housing development were without water for twenty-seven days following the
backsiphonage of the insecticides Chlordane and Heptachlor into their water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 The Allegheny County Housing Authority spent approximately
$300,000 to replace the water piping, both inside and outside, in the Groveton Village
housing development in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania. The housing development has
twenty-three buildings, each consisting of four apartments. The water in the housing
development was contaminated by the insecticides Chlordane and Heptachlor. 



 The insecticides entered the water system while an
exterminator was applying it as a preventative measure against termites. The exterminator
was mixing the chemicals in a tank truck with water supplied from a garden hose from one
of the apartments. The end of the hose was submerged in the chemical solution at the time
the water was shut-off. A plumber shut-off, then drained the water system to cut the
6-inch supply pipe to install a gate valve. The drainage point was downstream of the tank
truck. Consequently, the chemicals were siphoned out of the trunk and fed into the water
system. 



 The water supply to seventy-five apartments, housing
approximately three hundred people, was contaminated. Repeated efforts to clean and flush
the water piping were not satisfactory in removing the chemicals. It was finally decided
to replace the water mains and all the potable plumbing in the apartments. 



 There no reports of illness. Residents of the housing
development were told not to use any tap water for any purpose until the piping was
replaced. The volunteer fire department provided drinking water supplied by tank truck.
The residents were without water for twenty-seven days.

 SUMMARY: An incorrectly plumbed hydraulic
press resulted in the backflow of oil into the city&apos;s water main. 



 DETAILS: 



 The following backflow incident occurred in Santa Ana,
California on August 24, 1981. The incident was a result of an unprotected cross
connection at a water cooled hydraulic press. This incident resulted in the backflow of an
undetermined amount of oil based product into the city&apos;s water main. The sequence of
events are as follows. 



 On the morning of August 24, a complaint was received by
the Santa Ana Water Department. The customer, a sporting goods wholesaler, stated that the
water in the employee restroom contained a high amount of what appeared to be oil. A
visual examination of the water coming from the tap by inspectors from the water and
health departments verified that a considerable amount of oil was present in the water. 



 After a thorough inspection of the commercial facilities
adjacent to the warehouse, it was determined that the oil had entered the city&apos;s water
main via an incorrectly plumbed hydraulic press. Apparently, during the replacement of one
of the water cooled heat exchangers on the hydraulic press, the domestic water was
inadvertently connected to the cooled oil return line which circulates the oil at 110 psi.
Because the oil pressure was higher than the domestic water pressure, the oil was pumped
into the domestic water line and subsequently into the city&apos;s distribution system. 



 After the cross connection was discovered the necessary
corrections were made to the plumbing on the heat exchanger. The city&apos;s main line was then
flushed to remove the remaining oil, and an approved backflow device was installed on the
domestic water line to the heat exchangers.

 SUMMARY: An interconnection between the
potable water system and a cooling system resulted in the contamination of the water to a
pharmacy. 



 DETAILS: 



 On September 16, 1981 the Water Quality Division received
a call from a pharmacy at a hospital complaining about a bitter taste in the water. An
investigation revealed no chlorine residual and a slight bitter taste in the water. After
running the water for approximately 30 minutes still unable to pick up chlorine residual. 



 The rest of the hospital and the fire hydrant out front
had a 0.5 mg/L residual. The chief of maintenance was notified of the problem. There was
only a single tap between the meter and the pharmacy. This tap served as a looped system
used as cooling water. A single gate valve, in closed position, separated the potable
water from the non-potable cooling water. 



 It was determined that the gate valve was not closing
tight. The gate valve was removed and the line plugged. This solved that problem and a
chlorine residual of 0.5 was established after flushing the water line.

 SUMMARY: Malathion contaminated a water
distribution system due to backsiphonage through an aspirator type lawn sprayer. 



 DETAILS: 

 The Village of Bancroft in Shiawassee County faced a
potentially hazardous situation in 1982, which demonstrates the importance of keeping
distribution system valves in good working condition. The incident began with an old
leaking fire hydrant that needed to be replaced. The hydrant could not be isolated for
repair as the hydrant lead was not equipped with an isolating valve. The distribution
system valves did not function after years without use. To repair the hydrant, the Village
prepared for a shutdown of the entire distribution system. Customers were notified of the
planned shutdown, but not everyone could be reached. 



 When the water system was shut down, one customer was
beginning to use an aspirator type sprayer to apply Malathion insecticide to his lawn. The
customer immediately noticed a drop in pressure while he was spraying. Seeking to find a
kink in the garden hose that may have caused the pressure loss, the customer returned to
the sprayer only to find the Malathion solution was gone. 



 Backsiphonage had drawn the Malathion into the hose,
through the house plumbing and into the Village system. The customer recognized the hazard
involved and immediately notified the Village superintendent. 



 The plan developed to correct the problem included public
notification not to consume the water until further notice, a tank truck was provided as
an alternate water source, and the system flushed and chlorinated. 



 This backsiphonage problem could have occurred regardless
of the condition of the distribution system valves, but the possibility would have been
greatly reduced if a small section of the system had been shut down or if a fire hydrant
isolating valve had been provided. This problem also shows the need for public education
about home cross connections. The aspirator type sprayer, although very popular,
represents a hazardous cross connection. The aspirator should never be left unattended and
should be disconnected if any drop in system pressure is noted. The installation of an
atmospheric vacuum breaker on the outside hose bib may have prevented backsiphonage.

 SUMMARY: Ethylene Glycol backsiphoned
from an air conditioning system&apos;s water holding tank into a group of Dialysis machines
contributing to the death of several patients. 



 DETAILS: 



 A coroner&apos;s jury recently ruled in a large midwest city
that renal dialysis machines that were accidently contaminated by anti-freeze solution in
a large medical center were found to be a&quot;significant condition&quot;in the deaths
of two patients. The deceased were two of six patients that underwent dialysis at the
medical center in the Fall of 1982. One died the following day and the other died 16 days
later. 



 Ethylene glycol entered the dialysis equipment through a
series of events triggered when a manually operated valve was left open. The open valve
permitted water to flow into a holding tank that was used to replenish a mix of glycol and
water to the air conditioning system. With the valve partially open, water continually
flowed slowly into the glycol/water mixture holding tank until it filled to a point where
the pressure in the closed tank equaled the pressure in the water supply system. It is
theorized that the pressure in the medical center&apos;s water system dropped allowing the
glycol/water mixture to enter the system. 



 The filtration system on the dialysis machines are
designed to remove trace chemicals such as those found in city water, however, the
filtration systems could not filter the heavy load of chemical that it was suddenly
subjected. The effect on the dialysis patients was dramatic; patients became drowsy,
confused, and unconscious. They were promptly removed to intensive care where blood
samples revealed a buildup of acid. 



 A test of the water supply to the filtration system
quickly determined the presence of an&quot;undesirable chemical&quot;. The defective
(open) valve was then found that had permitted water containing glycol to drain from the
air conditioning holding tank into the dialysis filtration system and from there into the
dialysis machines.

 SUMMARY: Backflow through an irrigation
hose resulted in insect larvae entering a food processing vat. 



 DETAILS: 



 A food processing plant employee came into the Water
Department with an insect larvae that came out of the water hose used to wash down a
processing vat. He said the larvae was alive and swimming when it entered the vat and
lived for about 20 minutes in water chlorinated to 100 ppm. The vat was being sanitized
prior to being used for another process. 



 The Water Department went to the processing plant and
inspected all visible plumbing connections for cross connections that would allow access
of larvae. Numerous cross connections were found. It was determined that the cause of
backflow was a cross connection between the cold water feed line, a steam line and the
irrigation system used to water outdoor planters in front of the buildings. All other
identified cross connections would have allowed chemicals or food process fluids back into
the system. The insect larvae (Primitive Crane Fly) entered the system through the
irrigation piping. 



 A reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
was required on the main line to the plant. It was recommended that the irrigation service
be re-plumbed, a vacuum breaker be installed downstream of the shutoff valve, and all
other identified cross connections be eliminated or equipped with backflow prevention
devices.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection between the
potable water system and a non-potable process water and fire system in a lumber mill was
the probable cause of seven confirmed cases of Giardiasis. 



 DETAILS: 



 Information from the Lane County Health Division indicates
that seven confirmed cases of Giardiasis have been documented among employees of a lumber
company in Springfield, Oregon. The probable cause for this problem was a cross connection
between the potable water system and a non-potable process water and fire system in the
lumber mill. 



 An unauthorized connection was made at an edger which
resulted in process water from a surface source contaminating the potable water at the
lunchroom drinking fountain. Water samples collected at the mill&apos;s lunchroom showing an
absence of coliform bacteria indicated that the cross connection had been eliminated.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of water containing
hexavalent chromium occurred from a chiller in a large manufacturing plant. 



 DETAILS: 



 A well meaning maintenance mechanic, in attempting to
correct a fogging lens in an overcooled laser machine installed a tempering valve and
inadvertently caused the contamination of the water system in an electrical manufacturing
plant in North Andover, Massachusetts. Hexavalent chromium was found at levels of 50 ppm.
in the drinking water. This level is sufficient to cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, and
intestinal sickness. Maintenance crews working during the plant shutdown were able to
eliminate the cross connection and thoroughly flush the potable water system thereby
preventing a serious health hazard from occurring. 



 A large refrigeration chiller that is used within the
plant to primarily circulate chilled water for air conditioning purposes, supplied a
portion of the water to a laser machine in order to keep its lenses cooled during the
operation. The water used in the chiller system was treated with hexavalent chromium, a
chemical additive used as an anti-corrosive agent and as an algicide to combat the buildup
of bacteria in the closed loop, recirculated water system. 



 A maintenance mechanic, seeing that the lenses of the
laser machine were becoming fogged as a result of being excessively cooled by the chilled
water supply, installed a tempering valve in the chilled water piping leading to the laser
machine. The tempering valve mixed the chiller water with hot water from the plants
domestic hot water heater. During normal plant operation, the pressure balance at the
tempering valve was such that the pressure from the chiller circulating pump was
approximately equal to the pressure in the water line from the hot water tank. However,
when the chiller pump required repairs, a temporary pump was installed. The temporary pump
produced 150 psi pressure compared to the 60 psi potable water system pressure. The back
pressure condition resulted in the backflow of the toxic chiller water into the water
heater then into the plant&apos;s potable water system. Yellowish-green water started pouring
out of the drinking fountains and into the washroom outlets

 SUMMARY: The backflow of propane gas into
the city water system occurred when a water connection was left in place following the
purging or a propane tank. 



 DETAILS: 



 Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and
businesses on an August afternoon in a New England town. Fires were reported in two homes
as a result of propane entering the city water system. One five room residence was gutted
by a blaze resulting from propane gas&quot;bubbling and hissing&quot;from a bathroom
toilet. In another home a washing machine explosion blew a woman against a wall. Residents
throughout the area reported hissing, bubbling noises coming from washing machines, sinks
and toilets. Faucets sputtered out small streams of water mixed with gas. 



 Located in the area is a propane plant consisting of 26
sub-surface 30,000 gallon capacity liquid propane storage tanks. City water provides both
fire and domestic water service to the propane plant through an 8-inch combination
service. It supplies two private fire hydrants. 



 The procedure that day was a&quot;purging&quot;of one of
the propane tanks using water from one of the private hydrants located on the propane
plant&apos;s property. There are two common methods for purging liquid propane tanks; using an
inert gas such as carbon dioxide or using water. The use of water is preferred since it is
more positive and will float out any sludge as well as gas vapors. In this case water was
used from one of the private fire hydrants. The tank pressure was 85 to 90 psi and the
city water pressure was 65 to 70 psi. The result was the backflow of the propane gas into
the water main. It was estimated that the gas flowed into the water mains for about 20
minutes and that about 2,000 cubic feet of gas was involved. This was approximately enough
gas to fill one mile of an 8-inch water main.

 SUMMARY: A leaking single check valve
permitted soapy water from a car wash to be pumped into the city water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 17, 1982 the Tacoma Water Department received a
call from a customer stating that his water was foamy and had a motor oil smell and little
white bubbles. The customer had a combination service station, two-bay self-service car
wash, office and residence. 



 During the inspection of the car wash the customer
mentioned that the foamy water problem cleared up when the car wash was shut down. There
was no backflow prevention device on the water line to the car wash. 



 On March 22, the customer advised that his maintenance man
had found a (single) check valve leaking, allowing soapy water to be pumped into the rest
of his domestic water system. 



 The customer was advised that a reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention device must be installed on the water line to the car wash.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of antifreeze from
a hot water heating system occurred during the repair of a water main. 



 DETAILS: 



 A Bangor homeowner placed automobile antifreeze (e.g.
ethylene glycol) in his hot water space heating (hydronic) system. He was heating his home
with wood and feared that freezing would occur in sections of the unused hot water heating
system. 



 Water district workers discovered the antifreeze when they
shut off the water to the house to make repairs to the water main in the street. With the
flow of water cut off, pressure in the lines in the house dropped and the antifreeze
drained out of the heating system, into the water lines in the house, then into the water
main in the street. Green water appeared at the point where the water main was being
repaired. No one ingested the antifreeze. 



 The water connection to the hot water heating boiler was
not equipped with a backflow prevention device.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of carbon dioxide
resulted in approximately 200 people at a football game becoming ill. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 22, 1982 approximately 200 people were
diagnosed as suffering from copper sulfate poisoning after drinking soft drinks at a high
school football game in Monterey Park, California. About 60 of the most seriously ill were
taken from the football stadium by ambulance. Eight hospitals treated the patients for
vomiting, dizziness, numbness and chills. Three patients were hospitalized overnight. 



 Those affected apparently had soft drinks at half time. As
the first victims became ill, the crowd was warned over the public address system not to
drink cola sold at concession stands. 



 The copper contaminant was the result of carbon dioxide
from pressurized containers backflowing into potable copper water tubing.

 SUMMARY: Copper laden water enters a
carbonated beverage machine. possibly a result of drop in line pressure and backsiphonage
of carbonated water into copper pipes. 



 DETAILS: 



 Two employees of a Wrangell restaurant became ill with
nausea and vomiting on January 20, 1982, after consuming carbonated beverages from the
food service beverage dispensing machine. Both reported an unusual taste to the beverages.
The restaurant owner contacted the Ketchikan District Sanitarian for assistance in
identifying the source of illness. Use of the machine was discontinued immediately. 



 Chemical analysis of tap water revealed pH of 6.6, total
hardness of 60 and Ca hardness of 30. City records failed to identify any sudden
fluctuation in chlorine residual concentrations or water pressure. Carbonated beverages
were dispensed from a machine supplied by carbonated water produced in a system adjacent
to the machine. Carbon dioxide gas from a pressurized tank was mixed with water to form
carbonated water used in the soft drink dispenser. No check valve was installed on the
copper line installed five or six years before to replace a leaking plastic line. Syrups,
mixes and city water were sampled for copper levels on January 21. Significantly high
levels were detected in all mixes with values ranging from 16-63 ppm. Syrup and tap water
levels were less than 0.1 ppm. 



 Prior to this incident there was no significant decrease
in water pressure in the City of Wrangell, although there were some breaks in water lines
at individual residences due to unusual cold. Reservoir levels also fluctuated with a drop
in line pressure and backsiphonage of carbon dioxide and carbonated water into the copper
water line supplying the building. As a result, copper could have leached from the potable
water line. When normal pressure was restored, copper laden water could then have entered
the carbonated beverage machine. Copper lines in the machine could have contributed
additional copper to mixes. 



 A check valve was installed on the water supply line, the
drink machine was cleaned and the operator was advised and instructed to replace the
copper line with plastic line immediately. Mixes continued to be sampled until levels were
less than 1.0 ppm.

 SUMMARY: A ship&apos;s salt water fire system
Pumped river water Into a shipyard&apos;s water supply system. 



 DETAILS: 



 Water fountains at an east coast shipyard were posted&quot;No Drinking&quot;as workers flushed the water mains to eliminate raw river water
that had entered the shipyard following contamination from an incorrectly connected water
line between a ship and the shipyard&apos;s fire hydrant. The shipyard trucked in potable water
so the employees could obtain drinking water. However, some third shift employees drank
the river water before the pollution was discovered and later complained of stomach cramps
and diarrhea. Fortunately the contamination was confined to the area of the shipyard
complex and did not enter the adjacent city water system. 



 The cause of the problem was a direct cross connection
between the on board salt water fire protection system on the ship and the domestic water
system on the dock. While the shipyard had been aware of the need for backflow protection
devices at the dockside area, the devices had not been delivered and installed prior to
the time of the incident. As a result of ship&apos;s fire pump being operated at greater
pressure than the potable shipyard system, river water backflowed into the shipyard&apos;s
system.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection in a dental
office resulted in air being pumped through a hand held aspirator into the building&apos;s
domestic water system then into the surrounding neighborhood. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 26, 1983 numerous complaints were received at
the Water Dispatch Center in Vancouver, Washington about air in the water. One lady had
asked if her water had been shut off, all she was getting through the faucet was mostly
air. A water employee was dispatched to the address. After talking to other surrounding
neighbors, it was determined that the same problem existed for other homes. 



 After reviewing the area, no physical outside work by any
contractor was going on. On that same two block area was a church and a dentist office.
The cross connection was determined to have come from the dentist office. Earlier that
morning, the owner had installed a new air compressor. The water pressure was 60 psi, and
their old compressor would shut off at 60 psi. The new air compressor was set to shut off
at 90 psi. The leak was in the line that fed the hand-held aspirator which is used to
rinse and blow out filings from drilled teeth. The hose consisted of a hose inside a hose
designed similar to a single wall heat exchanger. 



 After the owner was notified of the problem his only
remark was&quot;no wonder the air compressor would shut off for short periods&quot;. 



 The owner was requested to install an R.P.B.D. to separate
and protect the water system, the building and his patients from the dental office
equipment.

 SUMMARY: The herbicide Paraquat was
siphoned into the town&apos;s water distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 In June 1983, the water pressure in the Town of Woodsboro
was temporarily reduced due to the failure of a pump in the water system. Coincidentally,
a gate valve between a herbicide holding tank and the town&apos;s water system had been left
open. The cross connection permitted the powerful agricultural herbicide Paraquat to be
siphoned into the water distribution system. Upon restoration of the water pressure, the
herbicide flowed throughout much of the town&apos;s water system. 



 Residents were warned by the fire department not to use
water for cooking, bathing, drinking or any other purpose except for flushing toilets. The
town undertook an extensive program of flushing the water system, water sampling, and
emergency supply of drinking water from tank trucks. 



 No serious illness or loss of life was reported.

 SUMMARY: The back-siphonage of a chemical
in a manufacturing plant resulted in damage to plastic water piping in the plant and to
RPBA isolating the plant. 



 DETAILS: 



 On January 27, 1983 a call was received by the Water
Quality Division from a plumber regarding a chemical back-siphonage at a manufacturing
plant in New Braunfels, Texas. He said they had been contacted to replace the water
softener and plastic water lines because the chemical which was back-siphoned had
dissolved all the plastic with which it came in contact. 



 The plant had a reduced pressure principle backflow
preventer installed on the service. From the description by the plumber, evidently when
the water department lost their water pressure, the #2 check valve failed on the backflow
preventer. This is surmised because the plumber said the water from inside the building
drained out through the relief valve on the RPBA assembly. 



 The plumber was concerned that the chemical had also
dissolved part of the backflow preventer. The plumber was advised to also replace the
plastic and rubber parts within the backflow preventer.

 SUMMARY: An interconnection between the
potable water lines and the fire supply lines in an Oregon plywood mill lead to several
cases of gastrointestinal illness among the mill workers. 



 DETAILS: 



 The manager of a plywood mill requested the county health
department to sample the drinking water of the mill after receiving complaints from
employees about its&quot;milky white&quot;appearance. Working with the city water
department, the county sanitarian collected samples from the mill and another location in
the city. Though the mill receives city water, samples showed a zero chlorine residual. In
contrast, a nearby location in town had clear water with a free chlorine residual of 0.3
mg/L. 



 The following day, an unusually large number of employees
stayed home from work, with a majority reporting similar symptoms of nausea and severe
diarrhea. Bacteriological sample results were reported the day after: five tubes positive
and fecal coliform present in the mill&apos;s water sample, while the sample from the nearby
location in town was negative. 



 In addition to the city water supply, the mill also draws
water from an adjacent river to supply its fire system. Booster pumps maintain the fire
system pressure at about 125 psi. The water from the city enters the mill at about 70 psi. 



 The mill&apos;s maintenance personnel examined the piping
system for a cross connection. Their investigation was hampered by incomplete and inexact
piping system drawings. They located three interconnections between the fire and potable
water systems with the gate valves open. Further investigation found that the mill&apos;s
recent water use had been exceptionally low; 10 cubic feet per month instead of the
7000-9000 used by comparable mills. The conclusion was reached that the mill employees had
been drinking untreated river water via a cross connection. 



 A single check valve was located at the mill&apos;s connection
to the city, it is assumed that this prevented contaminated river water from entering the
city&apos;s mains. Because of the difficulty in locating all possible cross connections, the
mill decided to install all new potable water lines. An approved RPBA was installed on the
water connection to the city system.

 SUMMARY: A domestic hot water system was
contaminated via a cross connection with a solar hot water heating system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 13, 1984 the Oregon Health Division received a
call from a resident of a mobile home park. The resident described his water as having an
oily substance mixed with it. 



 On February 15, the home was visited by a member of the
Health Division. Water from the tap had substantially improved and had no visible
impurities. A sample of tap water was saved by the home owner. The water was cloudy white,
with a layer of yellow oil floating on the surface. Only the hot water tap had produced
such oily water. 



 The operator of the Riverbend Water System reported a few
shut downs of the entire system had occurred in the December to February period because of
freezing weather. 



 The evidence pointed to a problem isolated to the
individual home, not the water system. The hot water tank was drained to observe its
contents. A very slight amount of oily film was present on the surface of the water from
the tank. 



 The home had a solar hot water heater. It was concluded
that this was the probable source of the contaminant. Support for this conclusion was
added when the home owner stated that their solar hot water system had not been operating
properly. 



 On February 17, an employee of a local heating company
inspected the solar hot water system. It had less than 10 percent of its freon charge. The
tank was found to be cracked and the gas line was filled with water. 



 The heat exchanger was of the single wall construction
type. It was a gas system which uses dichloroflouromethane. Mineral oils are used in the
system. Dichloroflouromethane is not considered toxic; however, any chlorinated compound
is suspect from a health standpoint.

 SUMMARY: Air conditioning make up water
containing the corrosion inhibitor Nitrate-Borate was pumped into a high rise office
building&apos;s water system then into the city&apos;s distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 10, 1984 the recirculating pump failed on an
air conditioning unit in a high rise office building in downtown Seattle, Washington. The
building contained a major computer facility. 



 To save valuable computer files, the buildings&apos;s
maintenance staff improvised a water-to-waste air conditioning loop. A 3/8-inch garden
hose was run 50 feet from a hose bib in an adjoining parking area to a drain on the air
conditioning piping. A second hose was run from another drain connection to a convenient
sump, thereby establishing a once-through air conditioning system using Seattle&apos;s cold
domestic water. This improvised system by-passed the reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device installed on the water supply line to the air conditioning system. 



 While the air conditioning unit&apos;s pump was removed for
repairs, a temporary replacement pump of higher horsepower was installed. The drain hose
was removed, but the maintenance staff forgot to remove the 3/8-inch supply hose. The
temporary pump provided a much higher pressure that the Seattle water system, resulting in
the backflow of air conditioning water into the water main in the street. 



 The air conditioning water contained the corrosion
inhibitor Nitrate-Borate. The corrosion inhibitor was detected in the bank building across
the street from the high rise office building. The Seattle Water Department initiated a
water main flushing program and isolated the high rise office building. The water system
contamination was limited to a very small area, but rumors grew and the mayor&apos;s office was
flooded with calls from restaurants, hotels, etc.

 SUMMARY: The temporary shut down of a
water service to a nursing home resulted in the back siphonage of sodium silicate into the
building&apos;s potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On August 4, 1984 the City of Bellevue had to shut down
the water supply to a nursing home as a result of a valve repair. The water main was shut
down about an hour. When water service was resumed, the residents of the nursing home
notified Bellevue Water of burning sensations in their mouths. 



 The temporary pressure loss caused an injector to
introduce a large amount of sodium silicate into the water supply lines, and when pressure
was restored, the high concentration of anti-corrosive in the water was carried throughout
the plumbing system. There was no backflow prevention device on the injection system to
the boiler. 



 The nursing home ceased use of the city water for 3 days,
until after the main and their service were flushed thoroughly, and subsequent samples
proved the water safe to drink. Other than a few temporary upset stomachs and a burning
sensation in their mouths, no one was seriously ill or injured from the experience.
Shortly after a R.P.B.D. was installed upstream of the injection feed system to the
boiler.

 SUMMARY: During the shut down of a water
main to repair a valve, the backflow of water from a nursing home&apos;s boiler caused burns to
a Water Department employee&apos;s hands. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 1, 1984 a 4-inch valve was reported to have
developed a leak. The valve is tapped into a 6-inch main line. It became necessary to
isolate the 4-inch valve in order to replace it. The only means of isolating the valve was
to shut down the 6-inch main at the nearest intersection and go up hill approximately
three blocks to shut off the other end of the 6-inch main. After notifying customers, an
employee working on removing the valve got his hands burnt from hot water running from the
open 4-inch main. 



 After a short length of time, the source of the backflow
had been determined to be a nursing home located approximately 50 feet higher in elevation
than the damaged 4-inch valve. The nursing home had three 250 gallon domestic hot water
boilers. All three of the boilers were used for hot water in the kitchen, showers, etc. 



 After establishing personal contact, the Water Department
sent a letter notifying the owners that the three domestic hot water boilers needed to be
isolated with State approved double check valve assemblies along with new
temperature/pressure relief valves.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of boiler water
containing a chromate anti-corrosive chemical occurred at an elementary school during the
repair of a main break. 



 DETAILS: 



 On January 18, 1989, the Riley County Health Department
was contacted by a school district and requested to sample drinking water at one of their
elementary schools. Reportedly, a backflow of boiler water containing an anti-corrosive
chemical had occurred during the repair of a water main break the previous night. 



 Because of the very cold temperatures, a 4-inch cast iron
water main froze and broke outside the school building. The maintenance crew isolated and
repaired the break. After the water pressure was restored, one of the workmen took a drink
of the water from a drinking fountain and noticed a foul taste. The maintenance crew
realized that contamination of some type had occurred. 



 The maintenance crew determined that boiler water
(maintained at about 12 psi) had backflowed past the pressure regulator into the potable
water system when the water main was shut off to repair the break. At that time, flushing
was begun and continued for several hours until the school opened the next day. Water was
turned off at drinking fountains and students were warned not to drink from sinks. 



 The Kansas Department of Health and Environment determined
that the anti-corrosive chemical was a chromate compound. No one was injured in the
incident. 



 Subsequently, the County Health Officer issued and order
to provide backflow protection at each school in the County. Although all other schools in
the County began corrective action, the school district where the incident occurred issued
a statement that the installation of backflow preventers were an unnecessary requirement
and refused to comply with the order. The local newspaper obtained a copy of this
statement and reported the circumstances. From that point on, compliance was obtained.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of hot water from a
boiler in a building operated by a diaper service resulted in the melting of the
building&apos;s 2-inch polyethylene service line. 



 DETAILS: 



 On August 15, 1983 during the changing of the water
service pipe at a diaper service company, a backflow of hot water occurred while the
service pipe was disconnected. During the course of the investigation, the City of Salem
was informed that the business was in the process of relocating in about 3 or 4 months.
With this condition in mind, the city did not feel it feasible to immediately require the
installation of a backflow prevention device. A device was ordered and installed when the
relocation occurred on or by July, 1984, whichever happened first. 



 On February 15, 1984 the boiler within the facility
overheated, resulting in the backflow of water from the boiler. The control box seal had
leaked, shorting out the controls for the burner element of the boiler. The pressure
relief valve had also failed, allowing the pressure in the boiler to increase to a level
higher than the city&apos;s supply pressure. The high pressure forced hot water backwards into
the water service, causing the polyethylene line to melt and discharging water from both
the city&apos;s main and the boiler. 



 Following the incident, the 2-inch water meter to the
facility was removed and water service was temporarily provided with a hose and a city
supplied 3/4-inch reduced pressure principle assembly. The owners were notified to install
a reduced pressure principle assembly on the service line before the 2-inch service would
be reconnected.

 SUMMARY: A leaking single check valve on
a boiler feed line resulted in a school&apos;s potable water system being contaminated with the
toxic corrosion inhibitor sodium dichromate. 



 DETAILS: 



 The Farmington High School was closed for several days,
when it was noticed by a home economics teacher, that the water in the school was a yellow
color. The teacher covered the school&apos;s drinking fountain with towels before school
started, and notified authorities. 



 The city chemist determined that the water samples taken
in the school contained levels of chromium as high as 700 ppm; the maximum content
contaminant level is 0.05 ppm. The chemical was identified as sodium dichromate, a toxic
form of chromium. 



 No Students or faculty were known to have consumed any of
the contaminated water. 



 Investigation disclosed that the sodium dichromate was
used in the school&apos;s heating system boilers to inhibit corrosion. The superior pressure in
the boiler, combined with a leaking single check valve on the boiler feed line, resulted
in the backflow of the chromate solution into the school&apos;s potable water system.

 SUMMARY: Creosote, backsiphoned through a
3/4-inch hose used to prime a pump, contaminated a section of a municipal water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On November 17, 1984 a wood preservative company in Macon,
Georgia requested the water purveyor to turn off one of their two water service
connections so that repairs could be made to one of their private fire hydrants. Later in
the day, the company requested that the service be resumed. Within two hours, customer
complaints were being received of bad tasting water. 



 The wood preservative company, as part of their operation,
pumped creosote from a collection pit to other parts of their operation. The pump
automatically shuts off when the creosote in the pit is lowered to a predetermined level.
After the creosote returns to a higher level, the pump restarts. This pump, however, often
would lose its prime prior to the pit refilling. To prevent the loss of suction pressure,
the wood preservative company connected a hose from a 3/4-inch hose bib located on the
fire service line to the suction side of the pump. The hose bib remained open continuously
in an effort to keep the pump primed. 



 The request to turn off the water service was necessary to
repair a fire hydrant. To remove the hydrant the fire line was drained. The creosote was
backsiphoned through the 3/4-inch hose connection during the draining of the fire line.
When the fire line was later filled with water, the creosote contaminated water flowed
through the fire system into a section of the municipal water system. 



 The water purveyor flushed the municipal system until
analysis indicated that the water was free of contamination. Residents were notified to
flush their plumbing systems for thirty minutes and that their water bills would be
adjusted accordingly.

 SUMMARY: Three leaking check valves at a
Light Rapid Transit station allowed polypropylene to enter the water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 During the summer of 1984, personnel at a LRT station in
Edmonton, Alberta complained about smelly, grey and bad tasting water. Some people
developed stomach problems. When the Edmonton Water and Sanitation Department was alerted
about the situation, water samples were taken/ The lab results showed a presence of
polypropylene glycol in the water. 



 The investigation of the system showed that the three
check valves installed on the system were all leaking. The installation of the proper
backflow prevention device (double check valve) cleared up the problem.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection with an
irrigation system resulted in the pesticide contamination of a well supplying four
residences. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 5, 1985 a resident of Yakima, Washington notified
the local Health District office that the water system to his house was contaminated with
a pesticide and possibly a fertilizer. The pesticide was thought to be Guthion and the
fertilizer was U.N.-32. 



 The source of water was a well that provides water to four
residences and an orchard operation. Occasionally, the well is used as a back-up
irrigation water source and for spring frost control. 



 A cross connection occurred as a result of chemical
application through overhead sprinklers used to irrigate orchards. Irrigation water comes
from a canal, and the chemicals are added as the water is pressurized. The orchard owner
made an interconnection from the domestic water line from the well to the irrigation
system. The higher pressure from the irrigation pump pushed water through this
interconnection into the domestic water system and then into the well. 



 The orchard owner was ordered not to use water from the
well until the well and domestic water system could be cleaned and retested for
contamination. The interconnection was ordered disconnected.

 SUMMARY: The contamination of an office
building water system with a cleaning compound was the result of a cross connection to an
air conditioning system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On May 29, 1985 a complaint was received from the local
Health District office that water in an office building&apos;s ice machine was&quot;blue and
foaming&quot;. 



 An inspection of the building found a cross connection
between a&quot;dry tank&quot;make-up water tank to the air conditioning system and the
building&apos;s domestic water system. Although the air conditioning system was new
(replacement of an old system), the make-up water connection existed for some time. The
pump on the new air conditioning system was of higher horsepower and provided a higher
pressure than the city water system. The new air conditioning system was being tested with
a cleaning solution containing sodium metasilicate and ethoxylated nonionic surfactant
when the backflow incident occurred. 



 No reports of illness were made to local health officials. 



 The buildings water system was flushed and the cafeteria
where the&quot;blue water&quot;was reported closed and all of its products made with
water discarded.

Magazine&quot;, Vol 6, No 2 



 SUMMARY: A break in a water line caused
the backsiphonage of a mixture of Chlordane, Malathion, Sevin and Diazanon into a portion
of the water system service Arpelar, Oklahoma. 



 DETAILS: 



 On July 12, 1985 a portion of the water lines of Arpelar
Rural Water District No. 7 of Pittsburg County, Oklahoma were contaminated when a water
hose was left inside a 200 gallon tank containing Chlordane, Malathion, Sevin and
Diazanon. While the tank was being filled, a drop in water pressure, due to break in the
line, caused backsiphonage of the chemicals into the line. 



 When health officials were notified on July 13, of the
problem in Arpelar their outlook was grim. Never before had health officials been able to
completely remove Chlordane from a water line. This problem was compounded due to the
requirement that no trace of Chlordane be left in the water because of possible health
effects after prolonged exposure to the pesticide. 



 On July 13, the State Department of Health requested that
the affected homes not use the water for any purpose other than flushing toilets. The
water lines were flushed and samples taken for chemical analysis. The results showed that
pesticides were still present. 



 Between July 17 and 20, Chlorine was injected in the lines
and left for a day, then the water lines and house were flushed. Water samples showed no
signs of any of the chemicals other than Chlordane, of which significant amount still
remained. 



 Between July 25 and 27, a caustic soda treatment was used
followed by flushing. Although each treatment reduced the amount of Chlordane in the
system, traces were still present. 



 On August 3, a detergent used by the dairy industry to
remove milk fat from milk line was added to the system, and the system flushed. The
detergent treatment was repeated three times. On September 16, the water lines were
declared clean. 



 This cross connection cost Arpelar, Oklahoma approximately
$100,000.

 SUMMARY: A direct connection between a
hose bib and a sewer resulted in the backsiphonage of sewer gases/sewage into a single
family residence. 



 DETAILS: 



 Following a break in a water main in a residential
neighborhood, the City of Fife&apos;s Department of Public Works received several complaints
from one resident of bad tasting water. Only one resident in the neighborhood complained
of bad tasting water. 



 The investigation of the complaint found that the owner of
the home had a leaky faucet in the back yard. Instead of fixing the problem, the owner
attached a garden hose to the faucet and drilled a hole in the sewer along the side of his
house and stuffed the hose down the sewer. When the water main broke, backsiphonage
occurred, causing the backflow of sewer gases or sewage through the hose bib and into the
house.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: March, 1985 

 LOCATION: New York 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: &quot;Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report&quot; 



 SUMMARY: The backflow of ethylene glycol
from an air conditioning system into the potable water supply line to a dialysis machine
resulted in the death of a patient. 



 DETAILS: 



 In March 1985, a 52 year old hospitalized woman died one
day after being exposed to ethylene glycol during a session of hemodialysis for chronic
renal failure. Review of the events preceding the accident revealed that the hospital&apos;s
potable water system, which was the source of water used to prepare dialysis fluid, had
been inadvertently contaminated when the air conditioning system was flushed with a
commercial solution that is 95 percent ethylene glycol and contains a marker dye. 



 Contrary to the municipal building code, there was a
direct line connection between the potable water system and the chilled water circuit of
the air conditioning system. This cross connection was open for flushing of the chilled
water circuit when the chilled water pump was activated. A check valve in the line failed
to prevent backflow from the pressurized circuit into the potable water system. Despite
its being detected elsewhere in the hospital, contamination of the potable water went
unrecognized in the dialysis unit. 



 The patient was noted to be somnolent (sleepy) after her
final dialysis session, but ethylene glycol intoxication was not suspected until coma,
metabolic acidosis, and irreversible shock developed 12 hours later. One other patient had
been dialyzed on the same day as the injured patient, but showed no evidence of ethylene
glycol exposure. One hospital worker had taken a sip of contaminated water, but had not
swallowed it because of its taste and obvious discoloration. No other exposures were
reported.

 SUMMARY: The pesticide Malathion used by
a grain elevator to spray grain as it is loaded into ships, was pumped into the public
water system through a faulty check valve. 



 DETAILS: 



 On September 5, 1985 a grain elevator in the Port of
Sacramento was spraying grain as it was being loaded onto a ship with the pesticide
Malathion. The spray was turned off but not the chemical pump, forcing contaminated water
back through the port&apos;s water system and into the East Yolo Community Service District
distribution system. The service district supplies water to nearly 5000 customers in West
Sacramento, Broderick and Bryte. 



 The grain elevator was following a common practice of
obtaining the water for spray application of the pesticide from a fire hydrant. Two check
valves installed to prevent backflow of the mixture apparently failed, allowing an
estimated 2 gallons of the pesticide to enter the potable water system. 



 An inspector at a nearby beverage company noticed that
something was wrong with the water and notified the State Health Department. 



 The Sacramento Port District notified all ships in the
port or that had been in port of the problem and that if any ship took on water, that
their water system could be contaminated. 



 The East Yolo C.S.D. isolated the mains in the area and
began a flushing program to remove the contaminated water. The State Health Department
contacted the local news media to issue a warning to the residents not to drink the water. 



 Samples collected from the distribution system near the
port showed a maximum concentration of Malathion of 16 parts per billion (ppb), well below
the State&apos;s&quot;action level&quot;of 160 ppb.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of xylene and
ethylbenzene from an unknown source resulted in contamination of the water supplied to
several customers of a municipal water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On November 11, 1985 the Environmental Health Dept.
received a telephone call from a propane gas distributor complaining of cloudy water in
their office. Water division personnel collected a water sample and flushed a nearby fire
hydrant for half an hour. The sample was milky white and had an odor similar to paint
thinner. A door-to-door survey was conducted of over 20 businesses in the area. A total of
10 buildings were found to have contaminated water, including one apartment complex.
During the inspection, notices of violation for direct cross connections were issued at
two businesses. 



 The Public Works Dept. began flushing the water in the
affected area. During this time, additional complaints were received from businesses, a
fire station, and a residence in the same vicinity. 



 The Nov. 13, laboratory report identified xylene and
ethylbenzene in the water sample. The lab. later reported the concentrations to be 118 ppm&amp;17 ppm, respectively. Both substances are petroleum derivatives used in paint, glue,
adhesive, and cleaning compounds. Although little data was available on the possible toxic
effects of ingesting either chemical in dilute concentrations, it was believed that the
amount of substances in the water supply would present no danger. The 12 follow-up samples
collected from representative points in the affected area were reported free of the two
substances. The Food&amp;Drug Administration took samples from five food processors in
the area to check for possible contamination of their products. These companies had
voluntarily withheld their products after learning of the problem. The laboratory tests
revealed some contamination of the products sampled at all food processors. Although the
contaminants were in the parts per billion range, all the products were destroyed. 



 In the following two week period, it became evident that
the attempt to identify the source of contamination would be unsuccessful. Following this
incident, it was recommended that the city pursue the initiation of a cross connection
control program.

 SUMMARY: Undersized piping appeared to be
the cause of back-siphonage of anti-freeze from a fire suppression system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On January 8, 1985 the City of Salem inspected a warehouse
because of the change in the business leasing the building. The unheated warehouse
contained an anti-freeze filled fire suppression system supplied by the domestic water
meter. As a result of the inspection, the owners were notified to install a reduced
pressure principle assembly on the fire system. 



 On January 24, two days before the reduced pressure
principle assembly was scheduled to be installed, the owner of the new business was
washing down the parking lot with a garden hose attached to a hose bib located
approximately four feet upstream of the fire system connection. The business owner noticed
green anti-freeze coming out of the hose. He knew the anti-freeze came from the fire
system, hence did not feel it necessary to call the city. On January 26, when the city
inspected the new reduced pressure principle assembly, the business owner informed the
inspector of the backflow incident. 



 The backsiphonage into the garden hose appeared to have
been caused by undersized piping within the building.

 SUMMARY: Approximately 16,000 persons
became ill and two deaths resulted from an&quot;industrial&quot;cross connection that
contaminated milk produced from a dairy in Illinois. 



 DETAILS: 



 The following incident illustrates that cross connections
also occur in industrial operations. Piping systems containing products assumed to pose no
health hazard if found cross connected to the potable water system, may become a health
risk. 



 At least 16,000 people in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota
and Wisconsin are known victims of an outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium spread through
milk from a dairy in Melrose Park, Illinois. One of the microbiological characteristics of
this organism was its resistance to certain antibiotics. 



 The Illinois Department of Health stated the contaminated
milk was the direct cause of the deaths of two persons, and the indirect cause in the
deaths of four, possibly five, people. 



 The source of the contamination was an&quot;industrial&quot;cross connection within the dairy, totally unassociated with the
potable water supply. 



 A two foot section of pipe was found connected between the
piping system carrying unpasteurized milk and the system carrying pasteurized skim milk.
Closed valves at each end of the ten foot pipe section were supposed to prevent
unpasteurized milk from mixing with pasteurized products. The two valves were believed to
have been left open after a cleaning and sanitizing operation.

 SUMMARY: A direct connection between a
water softener drain line and the sewer may have resulted in the contamination of a home&apos;s
drinking water. 



 DETAILS: 



 In April, 1985 a water softener was installed on the water
service to a residence for pre-treatment for water supplied to a kidney dialysis machine.
On July 6, the home experienced a sewer blockage and called a plumber to clean the 4-inch
sewer line. 



 On July 7, after another blockage, the plumber was called
back to clean the line again. The plumber discovered that a hole was drilled in the top of
the sewer line, and the drain line from the softener was inserted through the hole. 



 The homeowner became suspicious that the unusual virus
both he and his son had recently acquired may have been the result of the cross
connection. Both were being treated for a viral infection at the local hospital.

 Vol. 3, No. 4. April, 1986 



 SUMMARY: Two employees of a grain mill
became ill after drinking water contaminated with the pesticide Malathion. 



 DETAILS: 



 Two employees of a grain mill in Bonner Springs, Kansas
were taken to a hospital on January 10, 1986 after they became ill from drinking water
contaminated with the pesticide Malathion. The plant mills various cereal products. The
grain arrives in railroad hopper cars and shipped from the plant in bags and packages. It
is normal procedure to treat all raw grain with a pesticide before other processing is
started. 



 An aspirator device is used to feed a pesticide, such as
Malathion, and dilute it with water to the proper application strength. The aspirator uses
city water pressure. During spraying, the Malathion was drawn into the plant&apos;s plumbing.
The city official that arrived shortly after the backflow incident reported that the
basement floor contained standing water, which suggested a plumbing leak may have caused&quot;irregular&quot;water pressures within the plant&apos;s water piping. City officials
maintained that there was never a drop in pressure within the city&apos;s distribution system.
The city assisted plant personnel in flushing the plumbing system and directed the company
to discontinue use of the aspirator device until protection could be provided to prevent
backflow.

Department 



 SUMMARY: The domestic water system in the
Provincial Museum was contaminated by the backflow of water from an air
conditioning/humidifier unit that contained a corrosion inhibitor. 



 DETAILS: 



 In March, 1986 the City of Victoria Water Department
received a complaint from the Provincial Museum that their water&quot;Smelled of
ether&quot;. The odor was a reoccurring problem, with its strongest level being noticed in
the early morning. 



 The inspection of the museum confirmed the odor. By
following the water system to the area of the strongest odor, it was concluded that the
source was the museum&apos;s air conditioning/humidifier unit installed in the basement. The
make-up water tank for this unit contained a corrosion inhibitor that smelled like ether.
The unit&apos;s pump operated at a higher pressure than the city water pressure. 



 A reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
was ordered installed on the water connection to the air conditioner/humidifier unit and
the water system ordered flushed.

 SUMMARY: The residents of Withrow,
Washington were without water for four days after herbicide 2,4-D was siphoned into the
community&apos;s water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On April 28, 1986 the Withrow water system was
contaminated by a farmer that tried to fill his spray tank with water to dilute the
herbicide 2,4-D. The pressure in the water system at the time was below atmospheric, hence
the contents of the tank was backsiphoned into the water supply system. 



 The owner of the private water system stated that at least
one customer drank the water, but no one became ill. However, one resident reported to the
newspaper that the water caused a burning sensation in her stomach and her daughter got
sores in her mouth after drinking the contaminated water. 



 Lab tests taken by the Chelan-Douglas Health District on
May 2, showed 2,4-D at a level of 16.1 ppm. At the smelling level the 2,4-D was probably
in the parts per million. The customers were requested to use as much water as possible to
flush out the system. 



 The Withrow water system serves less than 100 customers.
The system operator/owner stated that backsiphonage is a common problem in the small
system due to high water demands.

 SUMMARY: Defective operating valves on a
lawn sprinkler system allowed surface water to be siphoned into the water distribution
system resulting in bacteriological contamination. 



 DETAILS: 



 The bacteriological quality of the drinking water in one
of the service areas of the San Luis Obispo County water system did not meet drinking
water standards during the months of April and June. 1986. Investigation by the service
area operators found an underground sprinkler system installed without an approved
backflow prevention device. It was shown by subsequent testing that the operating valves
for the sprinkler system were defective and allowed surface water to be siphoned into the
main distribution system. The water supply to the sprinkler system was turned off and
later tests showed the problem to be solved. 



 The property owner was notified that his service would
remain turned off until a proper backflow prevention device was installed or the lawn
sprinkler system was physically cut off from the main distribution system. 



 The operators of the water service area flushed and
disinfected the water distribution system to restore water quality.

Utility Board 



 SUMMARY: A home owner created a cross
connection that allowed the backflow of testing dye from the residence&apos;s toilet tank
during a high bill investigation. 



 DETAILS: 



 While investigating a high bill complaint, the utility
service man provided the home owner fluorescent dye to be placed in the toilet tank. If a
leak existed in the toilet tank, the dyed water would show up in the bowl indicating a
leak that would not be visible yet would contribute to a high bill. While the home owner
installed the dye in the toilet tank, the service man tuned the water off to replace the
test meter and was left open when the water was turned off to replace the meter. 



 When the water service was restored, fluorescent dye came
out of the hose indicating there had been a cross connection where the home owner had
placed the dye. The home owner would not allow the service man to enter his house to
inspect or check on the cross connection, however, with the help of the City Plumbing
Inspector, the home owner was persuaded to install an approved toilet tank valve that
provided the appropriate air gap.

 SUMMARY: A backflow of carbon dioxide
from a soda dispenser was allowed by a malfunctioning ball-check valve. 



 DETAILS: 



 A local deli called just after noon to say they had
considerable amounts of air in the line. They stated it was also impossible to draw soft
drinks or use the water in the sinks. On arriving, the Water Department Serviceman
witnessed large bursts of&quot;air&quot;from the kitchen sink faucet and&quot;air&quot;in the water samples he took. In tasting the water, he found it to have a bitter
aftertaste. 



 Further investigation found that the carbon dioxide
cylinder was almost empty and the ball-check valve had been fouled, allowing the carbon
dioxide to back up into the plumbing system. 



 When the check valve was replaced the&quot;air&quot;problem was eliminated. Further investigation is taking place at this time to determine a
more acceptable type of backflow device to replace the ball-check commonly installed on
this type of equipment.

 SUMMARY: A water main break caused the
backflow of sodium hydroxide into the public water system, resulting in several customers
receiving caustic chemical burns. 



 DETAILS: 



 On Wednesday, October 8, 1986 an 8-inch water main broke
in Lacey&apos;s Chapel, Alabama. During the main repair one water utility workman suffered leg
burns from some undetermined chemical and required medical treatment. 



 On Wednesday night and early Thursday, several quality
complaints were received from the area of Lacey&apos;s Chapel served by the broken water main.
Water service to the area was shut down at 7 a.m. Thursday and an investigation initiated. 



 One resident entered the shower at 5 a.m. Thursday. When
he got out of the shower his body was covered with tiny red blisters. He and other Lacey&apos;s
Chapel residents received medical treatment Thursday after their water supply was
contaminated by sodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical. About 60 homes in the area received
contaminated water. 



 The source of the contamination was apparently a nearby
chemical company. When the water main broke on Wednesday, a truck driver was adding water
to a tanker truck that had carried sodium hydroxide. Although it was normal procedure to
add water from the top of the tanker, on this occasion the driver was filling the tanker
from a connection at the bottom. When the driver realized that water was no longer going
into the truck due to loss of pressure, he closed the valve. 



 The water utility flushed the water main on Thursday.
health officials made sure all inside pipes were flushed, and then checked the pH level of
the water. Measurements of pH were as high as 13 in some homes. 



 The chemical plant did not have a backflow prevention
device on its water service. The water utility did not have a cross connection control
program in place, although state regulations require public water systems to have a
program. At the time, the city was in the process of writing an ordinance that would set
up a cross connection control policy.

 SUMMARY: The rupture of a transmission
line caused very low or negative pressure throughout a large portion of a municipal water
system resulting in the backflow of both bacterial and chemical contaminants. 



 DETAILS: 



 At 2:30 a.m. on December 11, 1986 a regional water
authority&apos;s 96-inch underwater crossing of Burrard Inlet ruptured. This transmission line
is one of three transmission lines supplying the City of Vancouver from mountain
reservoirs; two underwater crossings and one overland transmission main. At this time, the
overland transmission line supplying the Vancouver region was out of service for
reconstruction of a dam intake structure. The flow of water from the ruptured pipeline was
420 mgd, with approximately 100 mgd from the Vancouver side. The high flows through the
one remaining transmission route resulted in low or negative water pressure (vacuum)
throughout much of Vancouver&apos;s distribution system for a three hour period. The area
affected included the Downtown Business District, adjoining West End highrise apartment
area, and the west side residential districts. Approximately 140,000 of Vancouver&apos;s
430,000 population were without water or supplied downstream from a distribution system
subjected to negative pressure (vacuum) that could permit backsiphonage of contaminants
into the water supply. 



 The number of water quality complaints were too numerous
to record. The high flows through the transmission and distribution system resulted in the
water becoming dark brown in color from the disturbed iron oxide laden sediment in the
predominantly cast iron distribution system. Due to the lack of staff during the
emergency, individual water quality complaints could not be investigated. Typical of the
complaints indicating a possible backflow incident was the&quot;green water&quot;complaint from commercial buildings. 



 Bacteriological samples collected in the late morning of
December 11, following the restoration of the water pressure showed 12 out of 15 samples
from areas with low or negative pressure had positive total coliform counts; two of the 12
positive samples also had positive fecal coliform counts. The source of the bacteria could
have been either backsiphonage through leaks in distribution mains or through cross
connection from within the distribution system or private plumbing systems.

 SUMMARY: Following a water main break,
the pesticides Chlordane and Heptachlor from a tank on a pest control company truck was
backsiphoned into the plumbing system of an office building and out into the municipal
water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On April 17, 1986 employees of a pest control company
working at an office building in Fayetteville, North Carolina were filling one of their
pesticide truck&apos;s tanks with water when a break occurred in a municipal water main. The
contents of the tank being filled were backsiphoned into the building and municipal water
system. 



 Residents in the area reported smelling an odor in their
water. No illness was reported from ingesting the water. 



 The highest contamination level was detected in the office
building: 5.5 parts per billion of the pesticide Heptachlor. The following day, water
samples collected from one fire hydrant near the office building showed 0.07 and 0.04 ppb.
of Chlordane and Heptachlor respectively. 



 After the backflow incident, the office building&apos;s water
supply was shut off to prevent further contamination of the municipal system. The
municipal water system was flushed. Residents in the area were warned not to use the water
for human consumption if they detected an odor like gasoline. They were also urged to
drain then flush their service lines and hot water tank.

permitted the backflow of antifreeze into the potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On July 4, 1986 the City of Winnipeg Backflow office was
asked to investigate a cross connection at a high rise apartment block. It was discovered
that a check valve protecting three heating boilers had failed. The high pressure cold
water pump was found to be fluctuating and when the pressure had dropped, anti-freeze from
the boilers transferred to the potable water system

 SUMMARY: Several employees of an
electroplating plant were admitted to a hospital after drinking water contaminated with a
nickel-based solution siphoned from a plating rinse tank. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 14, 1987 the employees of an electroplating plant
in Kitchener, Ontario noticed the water from one of the plant&apos;s drinking fountains&quot;looked like Kool-Aid&quot;and had a metallic taste. Because of the heat in the
plant the employees were drinking a lot of water. By Friday, June 19, twenty-nine workers
had reported being exposed to nickel contamination. Eleven were in the hospital, and six
others were under observation by their family doctor for symptoms of nickel poisoning.
Ingested nickel could harm the lungs, kidneys, liver and immune system. 



 The nickel solution most likely entered the plant&apos;s water
system by backsiphonage through a submerged inlet (cross connection) to a plating rinse
tank. On Sunday afternoon, the water system was shut down for repair work. The submerged
connection was not protected by a backflow prevention assembly.

 SUMMARY: An employee of a plywood mill
sustained minor chemical burns while washing his hands following the backflow of an
alkaline cleaning compound past two unapproved single check valves into the potable water
system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On August 26, 1987 a complaint was made to the State of
Oregon Health Department by an employee of a plywood mill, that he had received a minor
chemical burn while washing his hands. 



 An inspection of the plumbing arrangement in the mill
revealed that a pulse pump was installed to inject a stock solution of alkaline cleaner
into a potable water line feeding a manifold that supplies several wood dryers. The pump
operates at 250 psi and the potable water line at 72 psi. The purpose of adding the
chemical was to reduce pitch buildup in the dryer. Upstream from the point of injection
were two single check valves (not an approved double check valve assembly). Upstream from
the check valves was the hose the employee used to wash his hands. 



 Approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assemblies were installed on the city water supply line to the mill (8-inch and 3-inch
RPBA). 



 The OSHA&quot;Material Safety Data Sheet&quot;describes
the cleaner as a primary irritant that can cause serious burns to the skin, eyes and body
tissues. 



 The mill&apos;s maintenance supervisor was notified of the
incident on August 25. The potable water line in question was immediately disconnected
from the system by the removal of a section of pipe. 



 A reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly was
ordered installed in place of the two (unapproved) single check valves.

 Vol. 36; No. 36, Sept. 18, 1987 



 SUMMARY: Twenty-nine persons suffered
ethylene glycol intoxication after drinking a beverage contaminated as a result of the
backflow of anti-freeze from a heating system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On the evening of April 12, 1987 two children, four and
seven years of age, were admitted to a rural North Dakota hospital because of the acute
onset of marked somnolence, vomiting, and ataxia (lack of muscle coordination. After
developing hematuria (blood in the urine), the children were transferred to the pediatric
intensive care unit of a Fargo hospital. Urinalysis for each child revealed calcium
oxalate crystals, and toxicologic studies of their urine samples revealed the presence of
ethylene glycol. 



 On the day they became ill, both children had been at a
picnic attended by approximately 400 persons at a fire hall in rural North Dakota. Of the
354 persons interviewed, 29 reported symptoms of ethylene glycol intoxication: excessive
fatigue, excessive sleepiness, unsteadiness when walking, and dizziness. 



 One food item, a non-carbonated soft drink, was strongly
associated with the intoxication. Among those who consumed the soft drink, 18 per cent
became ill. 



 The water used to prepare the powdered beverage had been
drawn from the spigot nearest the firehall&apos;s heating system. The heating system used a
mixture of water and anti-freeze, and was cross connected to the potable water supply. The
cross connection was regulated by a single isolating valve. It was uncertain whether the
valve had been closed during the preparation of the beverage. A water sample taken at the
spigot the evening of the picnic had a glycol concentration of nine percent. 



 Ethylene glycol is a solvent with a sweetish, acrid taste,
best know for its use in anti-freeze solution. Acute poisoning from ingestion can result
in central nervous system depression, vomiting, hypotension, respiratory failure, coma,
convulsions, and renal damage. The fatal dose for ingestion by adults is approximately 100
grams.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of carbon dioxide
from a soft drink machine into the potable water system of a restaurant caused a child to
suffer acute copper toxicity. 



 DETAILS: 



 The Crystal Health Dept. received a call from a woman who
had been to a restaurant in Crystal. Her two boys, ages 2 and five, had drunk water from
the lobby drinking fountain which was posted&quot;Out of Order, Do Not Drink&quot;. The
five year old only took a sip of water, but the two year old drank a large quantity.
Within ten minutes of drinking the water, the two year old vomited three times. The child
apparently suffered from acute copper toxicity. 



 After being notified, the Health Department got the
fountain water shut off and began an investigation. The restaurant is on the municipal
water system. Employees reported that the water tasted like mineral or soda water. The
off-taste had been noticed over a month before. The restaurant owner had a plumber
investigate, but the plumber was unable to identify the problem. 



 The analysis of a water sample collected from the drinking
fountain showed the following: 



 pH 5.6 Copper 50 ppm 

 Nitrate/Nitrogen 1.1 ppm Iron 0.2 ppm 

 Coliform Count 2.2 Psychrophiles 1.0 ppm 

 Standard Plate Count 1.0 



 The pH of the water from all other water taps in the
restaurant ranged from 7.2 to 8.2. 



 The taste, pH and consequent high copper levels of the
drinking fountain water were consistent with a backflow of carbon dioxide. Plumbing
diagrams were reviewed and it was noted that the drinking fountain is the next water use
appliance after the drive-up window soft drink station. The double check valves at the
soft drink station were old and showed signs of deterioration and evidence of failure. 



 The restaurant was ordered to install an approved backflow
prevention assembly.

Burnaby Plumbing Branch 



 SUMMARY: Following the shutdown of a
municipal water main to repair a break, a paperboard plant made a temporary connection
between the plant&apos;s river supplied process water system and domestic water system,
permitting the backflow of river water into the public water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On November 2, 1987 a break occurred on the municipal
water main supplying water to a paperboard plant and other nearby industrial properties in
Burnaby, British Columbia. During the repair work, apparently polluted (dirty) water
discharged from the broken main into the excavation although the isolating valves on the
main were shut off. 



 Upon investigation, it was determined that the backflow of
water was from a paperboard plant located along the Fraser River. The plant&apos;s only source
of potable water, the municipal water main, was disrupted during the main repair, hence
the continuous backflow of water through the plant&apos;s service connection must be from an
auxiliary source of supply. The plant&apos;s service connection did not contain a backflow
prevention assembly for premise isolation. 



 The plant maintained two water systems; a combined fire,
industrial and domestic system supplied from the municipal water main, and a process
system supplied from pumping water from the river. To keep the plant in operation after
the water main break, a fire hose was connected between the two systems. The river water
was pumped into the plant&apos;s domestic water system as well as the isolated portion of the
municipal system. 



 The municipal work crew ordered the fire hose cross
connection removed. The crew flushed and disinfected the municipal water main. The plant
was ordered to immediately flush and disinfect their domestic water system and immediately
install a reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly on their water service connection
to provide premise isolation.

 SUMMARY: A large volume of air was
injected into the water distribution system when mechanics attempted to clear a frozen
water line with compressed air. 



 DETAILS: 



 On December 31, 1987 mechanics in a soft drink bottling
plant maintenance shop connected an air line from a non-approved compressor to a potable
water line in an attempt to dislodge ice which was obstructing the flow of water into the
shop area. This procedure cleared the water line of ice, but a large amount of air was
injected into the water distribution system surrounding the bottling plant. Complaints of
air in the water from neighboring businesses resulted in Water Department maintenance
crews being called on the scene to flush the mains. 



 During an inspection of the premises by cross connection
personnel, the shop foreman indicated that the water line froze often during the winter
and compressed air was used to clear the line, but isolating valves were closed before
doing so and the workmen forgot to close them this time. 



 A reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
was ordered installed in the plant to prevent a recurrence of this problem.

 SUMMARY: Nine homes were contaminated
with the pesticides Heptachlor, Chlordane and Dursban, following a water main break that
allowed the chemicals to be backsiphoned into the public water system through a pest
control company&apos;s service connection. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 24, 1987 water service for 63 homes and businesses
in Fair Lawn and Hawthorne, New Jersey was shut down when three chemicals were siphoned
into the public water system. The backflow incident followed a water main break which
occurred during the construction of a nearby bridge. At the time of the main break, an
employee of a pest control company was rinsing a tanker truck with a weak solution of
Heptachlor and Chlordane, and the hose he was using had Dursban on it. Between one and
three gallons of pesticide entered the water distribution system. 



 After repair of the main, a resident reported that a
milky, white substance was flowing from his kitchen faucet. The water authority
immediately shut the water off again. 



 Sixty-three homes and businesses went without water for
several days. During the water main clean-up, a water supply truck provided water for
cooking and drinking. Arrangements were made to have shower facilities available at the
local high school. 



 The pest control company assumed responsibility for the
pesticide backflow incident and replaced the plumbing at nine locations where the water
pipes were contaminated. At all other locations, where pipes were not replaced, testing
revealed that the chemicals were non-detectable in the water. 



 Several residents drank the contaminated water, and
watered their gardens with it. No deaths occurred from the incident. Twenty-one residents
filed a $21,000,000 lawsuit against the pest control company, claiming the firm
irreparably damaged plumbing fixtures, the residents continue to suffer physical distress,
inconvenience and loss of property value. In addition, the plaintiffs are asking the firm
to pay medical expenses incurred as a result of the incident and to set up and maintain a
health surveillance program for the affected residents. The pest control company was
ordered to cease and desist its operation until a backflow prevention device was installed
on its service.

 SUMMARY: A high water demand caused the
herbicide Roneet to be siphoned into a private water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 In the summer of 1987, a private water system was
contaminated with the herbicide Roneet. The well supplied system was used by a number of
farm families in the Bells Rapid/Hagerman area of Idaho. 



 The incident followed a familiar course, A tanker truck
containing ten gallons of Roneet was being filled with a hose connected into a well house.
As the tanker tuck was being filled, the hose became submerged in the herbicide-water
mixture. The backsiphonage occurred when a water demand was placed on the system by one of
the residents. 



 When the herbicide was discovered in the water system, the
well and pressure pump were shut off. This allowed the contaminated water to enter the
1,000 gallon pressure tank. Check valves prevented herbicide from entering the well. 



 The water system was treated a number of times with
household bleach before test results indicated that the water contained less than one part
per million of the herbicide. The company that manufactured the herbicide was very
cooperative and performed the testing at no charge. 



 On one ingested any of the contaminated water. This was
due to timely notification of the few families that utilized the well. Fortunately, Roneet
has an L.D. 50 of 200 to 4000 mg/kg and is not extremely toxic. 



 The person responsible for contaminating the well system
did not own the well; he was just borrowing some water.

 SUMMARY: A complaint of dirty, metallic
tasting water and air in the lines followed the failure of a ball check valve on a soft
drink dispensing machine that utilized a CO 2 cylinder. 



 DETAILS: 



 On April 18, 1987 the City of Salem received a complaint
from a coffee shop of brownish, metallic tasting water and air in the line. 



 Water samples taken within the building in response to the
complaint showed a pH of 4.6. A control sample taken from a nearby service showed a pH of
6.8, normal for the city&apos;s water. The bitter metallic taste, coupled with the low pH os
typical of a CO 2 backflow incident. 



 The building&apos;s soft drink machine was supplied with CO 2 from a 800 psi cylinder, regulated to 85 psi at the water connection. The soft drink
machine had a stainless steel ball check valve to separate the carbonated water from the
domestic water supply. 



 The soft drink supplier serviced the machine and found
that debris had passed the strainer and was fouling the ball check valve.

 SUMMARY: The water supply to ten
residences and one business were contaminated with the herbicide Lexon DF as a result of
backsiphonage caused by a water main break. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 20, 1987 a resident of Gridley, Kansas returned
home after several days absence and noticed a chemical smell when filling the washing
machine. City officials concluded that the problem was caused by&quot;sludge in the
pipes&quot;that had been flushed out when the water came back on and recommended that the
pipes be flushed for a couple of hours. 



 On July 1, the resident complained that there was still a
problem and that the grass had died where it was watered. City officials then contacted
the State Department of Health and Environment. 



 The State officials took water samples to determine if
there may have been chemical contamination. It was concluded that some water mains were
contaminated with a herbicide, later identified as Lexon DF, following the break in a
water main on June 17. A tank at a nearby feed store which had contained the herbicide was
being filled with water at the time of the water main break and some of the contents of
the tank were siphoned into the water main. 



 The State officials warned the ten residences and one
business supplied by the water main not to use the water for cooking or drinking until
test results showed the water was safe. They also noted that if herbicide was present in
the water, boiling the water would not destroy it.

 SUMMARY: A faulty single hard seated
check valve on a water line supplying boilers in a high rise building causes hot water to
come out of cold water taps. 



 DETAILS: 



 In March, 1987 a maintenance company&apos;s service man
contacted the department expressing concern over hot water coming out of cold water taps
in certain areas of the high rise apartment he was servicing. An investigation of the
water system traced the problem back to a faulty single hard seated check valve in the
water line supplying the boilers. Apparently, the previous maintenance contractor had
trouble keeping chemicals in the heating system, but instead of determining the cause,
they simply added more chemicals. 



 There were no reported cases of anyone becoming ill.
However, since the chemicals had been injected into the drinking water system for quite
some time, one wonders how those chemicals affected the long term health of the tenants. 



 The single check valve was replaced with a reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention device.

 In August, 1987 the staff at one of Edmonton&apos;s
recreational parks called the water department complaining that one of their customers had
taken a drink from a drinking fountain and complained of caustic tasting water which
caused a burning sensation in his throat. The inspector, dispatched to the site, noticed
blue stains in some of the concession stand equipment and air in the water lines. Further
investigation found that the soft drink carbonator dual check valve had failed allowing
the carbon dioxide to enter the water system. 



 Water lines in the facility were flushed and a stainless
steel dual check valve with atmospheric port was installed to replace the faulty device.

copper-containing sediment in water mix tank. 



 DETAILS: 



 Four food service employees at a residence hall at the
University of Michigan, became ill on January 7, 1987, after drinking soda pop from a
dispenser. They were taken to the hospital complaining of bloating, nausea, headache,
dizziness and dry vomiting. All of those ill reported that the soda pop had an unusual
taste, some reported a sludge-like sediment in their glass. 



 A service representative disassembled various parts of the
machine for inspection, including visually inspecting both check valves, visually
inspecting the 100-mesh y-strainer in the water line, also a new rubber seal installed on
the diffuser two days earlier was inspected. All appeared to be in excellent condition.
New check valves were installed as a precaution. 



 Green particles, possibly oxidized copper, were found in
the bottom of the CO 2 water mix tank, the tank was thoroughly flushed. 



 Samples taken from the dispenser before cleaning and
inspection had 24 ppm copper. Sample taken after cleaning showed 0.11 ppm copper. The
background water sample showed 0.01 ppm. 



 The apparent cause of this outbreak was the presence of
copper-containing sediment in the CO 2 water mix tank. The dispenser is standard
design and well maintained, it is not known how the sediment reached the tank, a factor
may be the age of the water system in the university building, old water lines have more
scale and sediment than new water lines, and require more repairs, which can add to the
presence and movement of copper particles within the lines.

 DETAILS: 



 On December 11, 1987 the City of Calgary experienced a
water main break that interrupted the water supply to an elementary school. 



 During the water main break a backflow condition occurred
and backpressure from a hot water heating system forced chemically treated water into the
school&apos;s potable water service supply. When the water main was repaired and the water
pressure restored, the chemically treated water was forced into the school&apos;s distribution
system, supplying contaminated water to drinking fountains and washrooms. These
contaminants showed up in water samples routinely taken after a water main break. The
laboratory identified these contaminants as chromates, a very highly toxic chemical
compound. 



 Fortunately, the children were sent home at the time of
the water main break and did not drink any of the contaminated water. The school remained
closed for several days while the school&apos;s water distribution system was flushed, sampled
and re-flushed until water samples revealed no chemical traces. Backflow protection was
requested by the inspector, and was installed on the water supply to the heating system.

 SUMMARY: The malfunction of a valve at a
paint factory resulted in the backflow of propylene glycol into the factory&apos;s potable
water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On April 29, 1988 the City of Edgewater notified its 5,700
water customers not to use tap water for drinking, cooking or bathing because of a
chemical contamination of the water system. 



 The chemical contaminant was propylene glycol. Propylene
glycol can irritate the eyes and skin on contact. Although it is relatively non-toxic, it
may cause heart and urological damage if consumed in large doses. 



 The chemical was used at a local paint factory to keep
paint from breaking down after being exposed to weather. The contamination occurred when a
valve malfunctioned at the paint factory, causing the chemical to flow into the potable
water system. The pressure at the plant was higher than the city&apos;s water system,
permitting the backflow incident to occur. Because the plant was about 12 years old, the
plant&apos;s plumbing system did not comply with the current plumbing code requirements for
backflow prevention. 



 Although the contamination occurred on Thursday afternoon,
it was not reported until Friday afternoon. The plant&apos;s production manager thought the
contaminant was confined to the plant. He shut off the plant&apos;s water connection to the
city water system and flushed the plant&apos;s system. The Florida Department of Environment
Regulation ordered the ban on water usage throughout the city as a precaution. Tests on
samples collected Friday from the city water system did not show the presence of propylene
glycol. No one sought medical aid from the local hospitals for an illness related to the
consumption of contaminated water. 



 A double check valve assembly was ordered installed on the
plant&apos;s water service connection.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of a dilute water
soluble oil containing toxic chemical additives contaminated the public water main and six
house supplied from the main. 



 DETAILS: 



 On Friday, March 4, 1988 the backflow of a dilute water
soluble oil containing toxic chemical additives contaminated a Cleveland, Ohio water main
and six houses supplied from the main. 



 The oil, used for cooling equipment, was mixed with water
stored in a tank at a local manufacturing plant. The chemical additives, used to prevent
growth of bacteria, were nitro-butyl morpholine and ethylniotro trimethylene. The mixture
is toxic in concentrated form. 



 A single check valve on the water line to the storage tank
malfunctioned after the tank was pressurized, allowing the oil-water mixture to flow into
the city water mains. 



 City employees took water samples from the distribution
system on Saturday after receiving complaints from residents of foul smelling water. An
official warning was issued as soon as the city determined by sight and smell that there
might be a water quality problem. The city flushed the neighborhood fire hydrant on
Saturday. 



 Most of the residents of the area of the manufacturing
plant stopped drinking the water when the smell and taste started bothering them on
Friday. One resident reported drinking the water caused him to vomit. Two families that
stated they were not warned to not drink the water, consumed the water until Monday. One
family reported that their children were feeling nauseous.

 SUMMARY: The inappropriate application of
a backflow prevention assembly resulted in the backflow of a caustic chemical into an
elementary school&apos;s potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 The Fresno Unified District replaced 63 backflow
prevention assemblies on heating and cooling systems throughout the school district after
one backflow prevention assembly failed to prevent the backflow of a caustic chemical in
an air conditioning system from entering the school&apos;s potable water system. 



 On August 11, 1988 the city water system supplying the
Fremont Elementary School lost pressure. Soon after, a teacher noticed that the water had
a pink tint. The chemical added to the chiller water to prevent mineral buildup in the
piping was sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite is a highly caustic chemical that could cause
burns or other irritation. The teachers did not allow the children to consume the water;
no illnesses were reported. 



 The backflow assembly was a pressure vacuum breaker. Its
application on the heating and cooling systems inappropriate, since backpressure could
occur. After the backflow incident, the School District replaced them with reduced
pressure principle assemblies.

 SUMMARY: A naval dockyard&apos;s domestic
water system was contaminated with saltwater, pumped from a ship&apos;s fire protection system
into a dockside fire hydrant. 



 DETAILS: 



 On Sunday, November 6, 1988 a naval ship tied up to a
jetty in the government dockyard and connected its fire protection system to a fire
hydrant. This connection to the fire hydrant would not have occurred under normal
conditions. The ship had six fire pumps on board, but three of the pumps were
malfunctioning at the time. When the fourth pump stopped operating, the ship&apos;s officers
became concerned, and connected the ship&apos;s fire protection system to the dockside fire
hydrant to augment their system. 



 It was assumed that the dockside fire protection system
was a saltwater system. Unfortunately, it was a combined domestic and fire protection
system. When the pressure in the ship&apos;s system increased after connection to the fire
hydrant, it was believed that the pressure from the dockside system would stay high. In
fact, the connection was made late at night when the domestic supply pressure was at its
highest. With the increased demand on the system during the day, the supply pressure
dropped. The higher pressure in the ship&apos;s (saltwater) fire protection system forced the
non-potable sea water into the dockyard&apos;s domestic water system. 



 Tests using silver nitrate indicated that the
contamination was quite extensive, almost to the dockyard service connection to the
municipal water system. Backflow protection assemblies were not present on either the
dockside hydrants or the service connections to the municipal water system. 



 To remove the saltwater and the accompanying bacterial
contaminants, the dockyard water system was flushed and a chlorination system, borrowed
from a swimming pool, was installed to inject 6 ppm chlorine to disinfect the system. The
chlorination continued until November 12th.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of water from a
chemically treated boiler occurred as a result of the failure of an unapproved backflow
prevention assembly consisting of two check valves. 



 DETAILS: 



 On March 31, 1988 superheated water from a boiler located
in a tire retread plant flowed into the plant&apos;s domestic water system then into the water
service connection to the water main on the street. The hot water broke (melted) the
2-inch PVC water service pipe and damaged the water distribution main. The boiler water
contained an unidentified boiler treatment compound. 



 The cold water feed line to the boiler had an unapproved
backflow prevention assembly consisting of two single check valves. Both check valves
failed, allowing the back-pressure backflow incident to occur. No backflow prevention
assembly was installed on the service connection to isolate the premise. 



 The water utility ordered the immediate installation of a
reduced pressure backflow assembly at the meter on the water service connection to isolate
the premise.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of glycol through a
faulty single check valve on a fire sprinkler system resulted in&quot;brown and
smelly&quot;water occurring in a high rise building. 



 DETAILS: 



 On September 7, 1988 a number of tenants in a high rise
building reported&quot;brown and smelly&quot;water in the potable water supply. Several
tenants took samples to the municipality. It was thought that the complaint was the result
of water sitting and collecting sediment on the three day Labor Day weekend. The plumbing
system was flushed and the problem appeared to have been solved. 



 The next morning, the building again experienced foul
smelling water. Several people mentioned that the smell was similar to glycol. Water
samples were collected for laboratory analysis.&quot;Do Not Drink&quot;signs were posted
on all drinking fountains. 



 The source of the contamination proved to be the backflow
from one section of the pressurized (wet) fire sprinkler system in which a single check
valve had failed. The system had a slight glycol residue from the original construction
period. 



 The building code required that fire sprinkler lines
supplied by municipal water mains be equipped with backflow prevention assemblies. This
building was not so equipped. The municipality stated that this code requirement was in
effect in 1979 when the building was constructed, but enforcement was lax and a number of
buildings were erected without backflow prevention on the fire sprinkler system. 



 On September 12, an approved backflow prevention assembly
was installed on the fire sprinkler system.

 SUMMARY: The absence of a backflow
preventer on a boiler resulted in the backflow of ethylene glycol into a school&apos;s potable
water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On the morning of September 9, 1988 a maintenance worker
at an elementary school in DeKalb County, Georgia detected an odor similar to antifreeze
in the water supply in the kitchen. The maintenance supervisor and local health department
staff suspected a problem with a cross connection to the boiler. Instructions were given
immediately to disconnect all drinking fountains in the school and cease preparation of
lunches for the children. 



 Water samples were collected at the hot water heater and
in the kitchen, and the entire water system was flushed for a period of three hours.
Following flushing, a second group of samples were collected. All samples were tested for
the presence of ethylene glycol. 



 The source of the problem was readily identified as the
absence of a backflow preventer on the water line between the hot water heater and the
boiler. The bypass valve to the boiler had been left open and water demand elsewhere in
the building created enough of a pressure differential to allow ethylene glycol from the
boiler to backflow into the potable water line. 



 Laboratory analysis confirmed the presence of ethylene
glycol. Although there is no standard for permissible concentration of ethylene glycol in
drinking water, evaluation of occupational exposure standards resulted in determination of
less than 1 ppm as the level at which the water could be considered safe. Over the three
hour period of flushing, a reduction in concentration was demonstrated from 6 to 4 ppm at
the hot water heater, and 3 to 1 ppm at the cold water tap in the kitchen. Due to these
unsatisfactory results, 24 hours of flushing was initiated on September 12, 1988. 



 A similar incident occurred in the county in 1983. Due to
the occurrence of two similar incidents in schools, the county recommended the inspection
of all boiler rooms in schools, the installation of backflow preventers on all boilers,
and the elimination of any bypass lines.

 SUMMARY: Twelve children suffered from
copper poisoning after drinking water contaminated from a soft drink dispensing machine. 



 DETAILS: 



 A dozen children attending a special show at a theater on
December 31, 1988 suffered copper poisoning after drinking water and soft drinks. The
twelve children were part of a group of 161 from local day-care centers. 



 A backflow preventer on a mixing head attached to a soft
drink tank malfunctioned on December 30. Employees shut the soft drink tap off when the
malfunction occurred, but they did not realize the nature of the malfunction and began
using the machine again the next day. After the backflow of carbon dioxide, carbonated
water remained in the copper piping overnight and leached copper from the pipe. The next
day, copper salts were carried in the water to the drinking fountain about 15 feet away
and then to the soft drink dispensers. The first children to drink the copper contaminated
water became ill, suffering from severe vomiting and cramps. 



 When the first children began vomiting, the quick actions
of the theater manager prevented the other children from having anything to drink. 



 The water department flushed the potable water lines.

 SUMMARY: The failure of a backflow
prevention assembly resulted in the contamination of a school&apos;s drinking water by water
from a boiler that contained a chromium based corrosion inhibitor. 



 DETAILS: 



 Sixty-four students and teachers at a vocational-technical
school were sent to an area hospital for tests after a corrosion inhibitor was detected in
the school&apos;s drinking water. Blood and urine tests were given to check for traces of
chromium, a chemical that in large doses can cause kidney and liver damage. A hospital
spokesman reported that none of those examined appeared to have drunk enough of the
contaminated water to cause any problems. 



 The contamination appeared to have occurred when a
backflow prevention assembly failed at the building&apos;s furnace, allowing boiler water to
enter the drinking water supply. 



 Students were told about 9:30 a.m. not to drink the water.
The campus was closed for the day. Water samples collected in the afternoon showed that
the contamination appeared to have been flushed from the system.

 SUMMARY: A faulty wafer check valve
permitted the backflow of water from a fire sprinkler system into an office building&apos;s
potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 

 In September, 1988 occupants of a high rise office
building in Edmonton, Alberta complained of brown water flowing from the faucets
throughout the building. 



 The Cross Connection Control Inspector found the domestic
water pump had been taken out of service for repairs. The piping between the fire system
and the domestic water supply was arranged in such a way that it allowed either pump to
serve both systems when a bypass valve was turned on. A single wafer check valve failed to
contain the contaminants in the fire system; as a result, the fire system contaminated the
domestic water supply. 



 The inspector recommended that the system be separated and
a double check valve assembly be installed in water lines serving the fire systems and the
high rise&apos;s domestic cold water supply.

pumped into the public water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On August 25, 1988 it was discovered that a water meter
supplying an irrigation system near a decorative lake in an industrial park was running
backwards, indicating that water was backflowing into the public water system. 



 The water in the man made lake was pumped into an
irrigation system that watered a landscaped area along a public road. The irrigation
system was initially being supplied by the public water system. When a pump was installed
to supply the irrigation system, the backflow occurred.

 SUMMARY: The apparent failure of a
reduced pressure principle assembly resulted in a cleaning solution backflowing into a
building water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On April 18, 1988 a maintenance man was performing a
regular chemical cleaning treatment of a&quot;closed water system&quot;. The domestic
water system supplying the closed system was protected by a 3/4-inch reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly. Shortly after the cleaning began, the maintenance
man received a complaint that the water had a funny taste. Upon investigation, the water
was found to have a pink tint. A water sample was collected, and the entire water system
in the building was shut down. 



 The supplier of the cleaning chemical stated that the
chemical only needed to be flushed from the system. To drain and flush that water system,
the RPBA assembly was removed. 



 The RPBA assembly was not tested following the backflow
incident. The RPBA assembly was last tested the previous June. Test records indicated that
the assembly was repaired three times in the last six years. 



 The maintenance man installed a new RPBA assembly after
flushing the system. 



 POSTSCRIPT: 



 Subsequent information indicated that the check valves and
relief valve were plugged with a very fine rust. The rust was so well packed that it held
the relief valve closed. The assembly may not have been maintained even though the records
indicated the assembly was repaired. [Information courtesy of BAVCO]

 SUMMARY: A water main break caused
cleaning solution in a toilet tank to backflow into the residence potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 A home owner called the Cross Connection Control Office
wondering why he had blue water coming out of his taps. The inspector sent to investigate
found that there had been a water main break in the area where the complaint was
registered. An inspection of the residence found the toilet tank had a cleaning dispenser
in it and the ballcock was below the water level. When the water in the street was turned
off to repair the leak a vacuum was created. The ballcock did not have an anti syphon
feature and allowed the water from the tank to be syphoned back into the water system.
When the water was turned back on the blue color from the toilet bowl cleanser alerted the
owner of the problem. An anti-syphon ballcock was installed so that its critical level was
25mm above the overflow tube solved any future contamination problems from this toilet
tank.

 DETAILS: 



 A city worker who died a day after cutting grass near an
airstrip was killed by pesticides, but officials aren&apos;t sure how the poison got into a
bottle of water the man sipped from as he worked. 



 The man got off his riding mower near the grass airstrip
to fill his bottle from a faucet. He drank the water and continued working, but then fell
ill and went to the hospital, where he died the next morning. 



 The Chief Medical Examiner&apos;s report shows&quot;Complications due to insecticide intoxication and chronic alcoholism&quot;killed
the man. The report also shows his blood-alcohol level as 0.23 percent. 



 Water from the faucet used to fill the bottle is often
used to dilute pesticides that are pumped into crop dusting planes, and officials
speculate that insecticides had been sucked into the water line. Samples taken later from
the faucet did not show any trace of pesticide.

 SUMMARY: Illegal private wells are
suspected as source of contamination of arsenic in the city water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 Health officials , puzzled by high levels of arsenic in
the Cave Creek water supply, advised anyone with illegal private wells to disconnect them
from the home and use that water for purposes other than drinking and cooking. 



 Authorities believe that source of the poisoning may be
illegal wells contaminating the system. Through a cross connection, water from private
wells in homes also hooked up to the Cave Creek Water Co.&apos;s municipal system could
infiltrate the city&apos;s supply. 



 The municipal water system cannot manufacture arsenic, it
is suspected that the arsenic usually leaches into a well from naturally occurring
deposits found in rock formations and soil. 



 The arsenic levels in the Cave Creek supply are dangerous
only if ingested over a 20 to 40 year period. State law sets the maximum contaminant level
for the poison at 0.05 mg/l. Cave Creek&apos;s water samples averaged 0.072 mg/l.

 SUMMARY: At least five subdivisions have
dual water systems for culinary and irrigation water creating possible cross connection
health hazards. 



 DETAILS: 



 On a July holiday weekend, the City of West Jordan, Utah,
received a call about a cross connection in a subdivision where homeowners have a dual
irrigation and potable water system. A caller noted the water was cloudy. The Water
Utility put the subdivision on a Boil Water order. The City then flushed all the culinary
water lines through fire hydrants until test samples were clear, then the Boil Water order
was removed but the whole irrigation system was down for an additional four days. 



 At least five West Jordan subdivisions have pressurized
irrigation systems that allow homeowners to use inexpensive irrigation water outdoors
rather than using more expensive treated drinking water. But health problems can result
when lines are cross connected and a pressure imbalance draws raw water into culinary
lines. 



 The City Council voted unanimously to approve an ordinance
that allows the City Manager to shut off all water service to a house that interconnects
potable and non-potable water systems until the irrigation system is permanently
disconnected, in addition, the penalties for cross connecting culinary and irrigation
water lines in West Jordan have been increased to lessen the risk of a health hazard. 



 The new provision that prohibits cross connections also
requires property owners with dual systems to make distinctive color markings on all
exposed portions of the non-potable water systems, install potable and non-potable lines
in separate trenches, place key valves on all hydrants and sprinkler controls so that they
can&apos;t be operated by non-authorized users and keep all non-potable systems outside
buildings except greenhouses and plant and animal production buildings.

 SUMMARY: The cross connection of a
cooling tower reservoir resulted in the supply of non-potable water to an ice making
machine, produce hoses and the employee lunch room in a super market. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 8, 1989 the Keizer Water Department received a
call from a local plumber stating that after he had turned off a super market&apos;s water
service at the meter to make repairs to the plumbing system, the plumbing system remained
pressurized. A Water Department employee responded to the site and confirmed that the
correct water meter had been turned off, since two metered connections served two separate
parts of the building. 



 A trace of the water piping revealed that the water system
was directly connected to a compressor normally supplied by a cooling tower. This cross
connection was made to the compressor in the event that the water from the cooling tower
was unable to cool the compressor. A check of the cooling tower reservoir showed that the
water level had dropped, and was continuing to drop until another valve at the compressor
was closed. 



 The water from the cooling tower contaminated the plumbing
system supplying the super market&apos;s ice making machine, hose bibs in the produce
department and sinks in the employee lunch room. 



 The cross connection supplying backup water to the
compressor/ cooling tower was ordered disconnected. An air gap was ordered installed in
the water pipe supplying the cooling tower reservoir.

compressor was connected to the building&apos;s water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 Starting about 11:30 a.m. on February 16, 1989 the
flushing of toilets and urinals in the King County Courthouse Building resulted in&quot;geysers&quot;erupting. No one admitted being hurt by the unusual blasts, although
several people were apparently badly drenched, or very surprised. 



 The source of the air in the plumbing system was the
errant connection, by construction workers building a bus tunnel, of an air compressor to
a hose bib on the building&apos;s water system. 



 In addition to soaking several people, the blast of air
broke between 20 and 25 porcelain toilets bowls and urinals. 



 After the incident, all restrooms in the 10-story
courthouse were closed for the day and employees had to walk across the street to the
county administration building to use the restrooms. Because of the possibility of
contamination, drinking water was turned off.

 SUMMARY: Eight employees of a high school
reported becoming ill after the backflow of ethylene glycol occurred from the school&apos;s air
conditioning system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On the morning of June 9, 1989 the City of Redmond, Oregon
called the Oregon Health Division to report a backflow incident that happened at a high
school. The central air conditioning system had built up pressure and pushed coolant back
into the school&apos;s drinking water supply. 



 Fortunately, school was out on June 8, for summer break.
However, eight employees that drank water from the teacher&apos;s lounge reported feeling ill
that afternoon and were sent to the hospital. 



 Once the problem was discovered, the air conditioning
system was shut down and drained, and the school was isolated from the rest of the water
system. The city was instructed to collect water samples and then begin flushing the
school&apos;s water lines. 



 The water samples were analyzed that evening. Ethylene
glycol was detected in the school water system and also out in the city water distribution
system. The water sample taken at the teacher&apos;s lounge, the closest point to the cross
connection, contained 9,600 ppm of ethylene glycol. 



 Based on the information that ethylene glycol is easily
removed from a water system through vigorous flushing of water lines, the school officials
were instructed locate every water line and flush it. Also to turn off all drinking water
fountains, post&quot;DO NOT DRINK&quot;notices, and supply bottled water until further
notice from the Oregon Health Division. Once the entire system had been flushed, they
could take down the notice and turn on drinking fountains. 



 The backflow occurred at the connection between the
plumbing system and the air conditioning system which was only separated by a pressure
reducing valve. About 18-inches upstream from the pressure reducing valve was the
connection to the teacher&apos;s lounge. 



 The school was required to install a reduced pressure
backflow prevention assembly on the water connection to the air conditioning system.

cleaning truck into a homeowner&apos;s hot water tank. 



 DETAILS: 



 On July 14, 1989, the City of Kennewick Water Department
received a complaint of&quot;soapy water&quot;. 



 The homeowner informed the Water Department that a carpet
cleaning and dye company had cleaned some carpeting in the house and connected to the
outside hose bib for water to supply the truck. 



 The cleaning equipment included an in-line single check
valve and pressure regulator on the supply line. Both failed, causing the backflow of a&quot;low sudser soap&quot;solution into the homeowner&apos;s hot water heater. The
contamination was confined to the water heater. The water heater was flushed for 90
minutes and a health sample taken. 



 The carpet cleaning company was required to permanently
install a reduced pressure backflow assembly on the water supply line to the truck.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of an
algae-retarding chemical into the drinking water system of a government office building
apparently caused at least 12 illnesses. 



 DETAILS: 



 On July 27, 1989 an algae-retarding chemical detected in
the drinking water system of a government office building apparently caused 12 illnesses.
The Health Commissioner stated that anyone who drank from fountains in the building on
July 27 or 28, 1989 could become ill with diarrhea or vomiting, especially after drinking
alcoholic beverages. The potential illness was not long-term or life-threatening. 



 On July 27, 1989 the Health Commissioners office received
reports of&quot;blue water&quot;from the office building. An investigation found that
the reason for the complaints was a blue liquid, known commercially as Acid Blue 9, used
to prevent algae in the condenser of the building&apos;s air-conditioning system. 



 The cross connection existed between the air-conditioning
and potable water systems. The backflow of the chemical occurred while crews were working
on the air-conditioning system. 



 About 1,000 employees worked in the building, and several
hundred visitors could have passed through the building on the day the contaminant was
detected.

 SUMMARY: A&quot;dirty, black water&quot;complaint alerted the water purveyor to the cross connection of seven water softeners to
the sewer line. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 4, 1989 the City of Kennewick Water Department
received a complaint from a customer concerning&quot;dirty, black water&quot;. The water
department cross connection specialist investigating the complaint determined that the&quot;dirty water&quot;incident was confined to the customer&apos;s house. 



 A water softener was found in a closet off the family
room. The discharge hose was inserted approximately 4-inches into the sewer line. The
black&quot;gunk&quot;found at the end of the discharge hose was recognized by the
homeowner as being like the black stuff that came out of the bath tub faucet. 



 The distributor for the water softener stated that
installation of the softeners is done by independent contractors. The distributor could
only provide a list of softener sales for the last two years. Of the nineteen units sold,
six units were sold to other customers in Kennewick. 



 An inspection was made of these six units. All were cross
connected to a sewer line. At one location the homeowner reported&quot;dirty yellow
smelly water&quot;had occurred in June of 1989. 



 All of the water softeners inspected were by-passed until
their discharge pipe was isolated with an approved air gap.

 SUMMARY: Following a shutdown of a water
main for maintenance, a machine coolant was backsiphoned into the potable water piping in
a manufacturing plant. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 12, 1989 the water department shut down a block of
water main for repair work. All businesses on the block were advised that the shutdown
would take place from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. the following day. On June 13, an employee
of a manufacturing company on the block took a drink of water from a fountain and
immediately vomited. The water was a dark green color and had a bitter taste. 



 A cross connection inspection revealed a tap with a hose
leading into a tank containing a mixture of water and machine coolant. Tests of the
drinking water indicated that the water contained a high level of copper and (likely) the
coolant. It was assumed the tap was open during the period the water was shutoff,
resulting in the backsiphonage of the contaminant into the potable water system. The pink
color coolant, after sitting in the plumbing system for several hours, had reacted with
the copper piping, causing the water to turn a dark green color.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of water through an
alarm check valve on a fire system resulted in the contamination of the water supply in a
department store. 



 DETAILS: 



 In May, 1989 occupants of a department store in one of
Edmonton&apos;s shopping malls complained of brown water coming out of the faucets throughout
the store. 



 The Cross Connection Control Inspector found that the
alarm check valve, in the fire system, had gone off on several occasions when the City
water pressure had been disrupted. 



 Water samples indicated turbidity and iron content higher
than acceptable drinking water standards. Water samples from neighboring stores were
normal. 



 The owner of the building was asked to install a D.C.V.A.
in the water line supplying the fire system.

 SUMMARY: The failure of three wafer check
valves on a fire system permitted the backflow of yellowish, oily water into the potable
water system at a transit station. 



 DETAILS: 



 In July of 1989 a call from one of Edmonton&apos;s light rail
transit stations indicated that a yellowish, oily water was observed in the public
washrooms. 



 It was learned that a maintenance crew had used a fire
hose to flush out a sewer line shortly before the incident occurred. The line to the fire
hose was separated by a 4-inch ULC approved wafer check valve on the fire pipe stand and 2
8-inch ULC approved wafer check valves on the header of the sprinkler system. All three
valves on inspection were found to have deposits which prevented the valves from closing
tight. 



 The inspector recommended a R.P. be installed in the water
line supplying the system as glycol was used in the stand pipe.

 SUMMARY: Each time a fire pump was
tested, the failure of a wafer check valve on a fire system permitted the backflow of
brown water into a print shop. 



 DETAILS: 



 In August of 1989 a printing shop owner complained of
brown water in the washrooms and in the equipment. The owner mentioned that the
contamination appeared each time the tire warehouse next door tested their fire pump. 



 The inspector found that the newly installed fire system
was separated from the potable water by a ULC wafer check valve. The owner was instructed
to install a D.C.V.A. in the water line to the fire system. After the D.C.V.A. was
installed, no further complaints were recorded.

 SUMMARY: Investigation of a water quality
complaint revealed that the water piping to a sink and drinking fountain was connected to
the fire line hose cabinets. 



 DETAILS: 



 In October of 1989 the Edmonton Board of Health and the
Cross Connection Control Office were called to investigate a complaint of contaminated
water supplying a drinking fountain. The inspectors found that black iron pipe had been
piped to supply fire hose cabinets as well as a drinking fountain and a sink. 



 The building where the drinking fountain and sink were
located was used sparingly, causing a build up of contaminants. Plant officials were
requested to re-pipe the domestic water and fixtures with potable water carrying material
to a point upstream of the black iron pipe. A DCVA was also requested on the line
supplying the fire hose cabinets.

 SUMMARY: The shut down of a water main
for the installation of a fire hydrant resulted in the backflow of boiler water into the
potable water system in a community pool building. 



 DETAILS: 



 On November 15, 1989 the Federal Way Water and Sewer
District received a call from a community swimming pool that they had very little water
pressure and hot water was coming out of the cold water tap. 



 An investigation indicated that a contractor installing a
fire hydrant had shut down the main water without notifying the pool. The contractor
thought the water service to the pool was off the water main on another street. 



 Not realizing their water was off, the pool did not shut
down the boiler. The pressure in the boiler caused the boiler water to backflow into the
potable water system and out of the cold water faucets when they were turned on. 



 The boiler had been recently cleaned and no chemicals had
been added after cleaning. 



 The pool was informed that they were required to install a
reduced pressure principle assembly on the boiler feed line.

 SUMMARY: A backflow incident contaminated
the domestic hot water system in a research lab with a growth nutrient for
micro-organisms. 



 DETAILS: 



 On October 25, 1989 the laboratory and offices of a
research facility were shut down after a growth nutrient for micro-organisms backflowed
into a hot water system. 



 A soupy, non-toxic fluid used as a growth nutrient was
being injected into a fermenting vessel. Hot water, used for dilution, was provided by a
direct cross-connection to the fermenting vessel. Because the injecting pressure was&quot;too high&quot;, up to 150 liters of the growth nutrient backflowed into the domestic
hot water system. The backflow incident was detected when staff noticed a smell coming
from the hot water taps in the building. 



 Although the growth nutrient was not considered a health
risk, contamination of the potable water supply could encourage the growth of any small
amount of bacteria in the water supply. 



 The cold and hot water lines in the building were
chlorinated and flushed.

 SUMMARY: An open bypass valve on a
holding tank pump for recycled water allowed&quot;green&quot;water to enter a plastic
manufacturing plant&apos;s potable water. 



 DETAILS: 



 Workers at a plastic manufacturing plant were astonished
to see green water flowing from the cafeteria water taps. They immediately notified the
water department of the problem. 



 The investigator found that a bypass valve connected to
the downstream side of a pump was inadvertently left open. This pump took recycled water
from a holding tank to cool various equipment throughout the plant. Since the pump created
a higher pressure than the City water supply it forced the water from the holding tank
back into the potable water system. Fortunately, the green dye from the plastic
manufacturing process alerted the employees of a problem before anyone drank the water. 



 Water lines were flushed and a reduced pressure principle
backflow preventer, which was not bypassed, was installed in the line to the pump.
Numerous other backflow preventers were also installed after a complete inspection of the
facility was conducted.

 SUMMARY: A vintage two story home, split
into a duplex, was contaminated with&quot;blue colored&quot;tap water. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 30, 1989 the owner of a vintage home that had been
split into a one up, one down duplex, complained of&quot;blue colored&quot;water coming
out of his taps during times of high water usage in the home. Investigation of the
plumbing of the house revealed old galvanized water piping, judging by the investigator&apos;s
experience, by this point in the pipe&apos;s age the pipe would be almost corroded closed. The
following items were also found: 



 1. A flush valve in the water closet tank that fills below
the water level of the tank without an anti-siphon device. This resulted in a cross
connection of the potable water with the water in the water closet tank, which had a blue
bowl cleaner added. 



 2. A boiler hot water heating system was found without any
type of isolation on the cold water feed line. 



 3. A claw foot bath tub on the second floor with a sprayer
hose attached to the below flood rim fill faucets. 



 Pressure taken at the exterior hose bib was 20 p.s.i.g.,
when the second floor sink, tub and lavatory faucets were opened, pressure at the hose bib
dropped to 8 p.s.i.g. After opening these second floor faucets, a negative pressure was
induced which backsiphoned the blue water from the water closet, resulting in&quot;blue
colored&quot;water flowing from the spray hose on the tub faucet. The faucet was then
opened on the first floor sink, pressure at the hose bib then dropped to 2 p.s.i.g.
Opening the downstairs sink faucet induced a backsiphonage from the second floor tub
faucet through the attached sprayer hose and an audible siphonage could be heard in the
water closet. 



 The owner was advised of the necessary devices to
eliminate the problems of backflow and backsiphonage.

 SUMMARY: Propane gas backflows into city
water supply causing three buildings to burn, fixtures to explode and several injuries. 



 DETAILS: 



 Household plumbing fixtures became incendiary bombs after
propane gas from railroad tank cars was accidently placed in a city water system. Three
persons were injured when explosions occurred after they flushed toilets in separate
buildings. Two houses were destroyed and a local business seriously damaged by explosions
and subsequent fires. 



 Investigation revealed an accidental crossover hookup
[cross connection] caused the propane to enter the water system from a pressurized
railroad tank car. 



 The crossover hookup occurred at a company about 500 yards
from the sites of the explosions. The company cleans and refurbishes railroad cars and
routinely works on cars carrying propane, methane and ammonia. When propane is present in
a car, the company bleeds it off, pulls it through a tower and burns it off. Then steam,
water and air is injected into the car to clean it. 



 A tank car at the rear of the plant site containing
pressurized propane was located adjacent to a water line with a quick connect fitting. On
his arrival at the company, the Fire Marshall discovered that a water hose with quick
connect fittings on both ends was connected to the tank car and the water lines on the
company site contained pressurized gas.

 DETAILS: 



 On June 29, 1989 the Salt Lake City Public Utilities
received a complaint from a shopping mall that the water had a sweet smell and taste, and
was foaming. 



 The complex has a combination fire and culinary water
service. The antifreeze system is within 15 feet of the joint service, a check valve
failed during several shutdowns of the fire system to replace sprinkler heads, while water
was continuously being used by the beauty parlor and other tenants. There are seven such
combination systems in this complex. 



 A double check valve assembly was installed ahead of the
problem connection.

 SUMMARY: During the summer of 1990,
approximately 1,100 guests of a racquet and country club became ill with an intestinal
disorder in two mass incidents after consuming the club&apos;s contaminated water supplied from
an auxiliary well. 



 DETAILS: 



 During the summer of 1990, approximately 1,100 guests of a
racquet and country club became ill with an intestinal disorder in two mass incidents
after consuming the club&apos;s contaminated water. The club obtained water from both the
public water system and an unauthorized private well. 



 In 1984 the club informed the city that it had dug an
additional well and connected it to the club&apos;s plumbing to permit the club to operate
completely from the well. A month later the city requested that an approved backflow
preventer be installed on the service line since the club violated state and local health
laws prohibiting cross connections. The city lacked staff to follow up on the request and
never inspected the facilities. 



 In August, 1990 it was discovered by state investigators
that the club&apos;s well was unsealed and located 10 feet from a malfunctioning sewage pumping
station. Club employees reported that a pool of fecal contaminated water between the well
and the sewage pumping station appeared to be sucked into the ground whenever the well&apos;s
pump was activated. 



 The city was alerted that the club was using an auxiliary
water supply by the fact that water bills showed usage fluctuations between zero and
848,000 gallons a month between August 1989 and October 1990. The City of Brentwood was
cited by the State for failing for two years to inspect and monitor any of the 69
locations the city considered as possible sources of contamination to its water supply
(cross connections). The city stated that it lacked sufficient staff to inspect all the
buildings. Instead, the city chose to focus on inspecting newly built structures.

 SUMMARY: A hole in a single wall heat
exchanger, combined with a bypass pipe around a backflow preventer, resulted in a chemical
solvent contaminating a manufacturing building&apos;s water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 On May 9, 1990 about 1,000 employees of a large
manufacturing company went without potable water after chemicals were accidently mixed
into the facility&apos;s water supply. No one reported drinking the contaminated water or
suffering any ill health effects. 



 County health officials stated that the chemical was
confined to one part of a building. The contaminant, a solvent which included aphtha, a
coal derivative, as well as another chemical, had a strong odor. The solvent could cause
nausea if swallowed. 



 The contamination occurred through a heat exchanger. When
a hole opened in the inner solvent line, higher pressure in the solvent line forced the
chemical into the water-filled line. A backflow preventer was in place on the water line
to the heat exchanger. However, a bypass pipe was found installed around the backflow
preventer, allowing the solvent to enter the building&apos;s water supply.

containing the antifreeze ethylene glycol to backflow into the potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On January 30, 1990 eight of the 450 students at a
Brighton middle school were sent to the hospital for treatment for ethylene glycol
poisoning. Blood tests revealed the students had no antifreeze in their bloodstream. 



 During a routine maintenance check of the heating boiler,
a valve was left open allowing the boiler water containing the antifreeze ethylene glycol
to backflow into the potable water system. No backflow prevention assembly was in place on
the feed line to the boiler. The school principle stated that nobody spotted the lack of a
backflow preventer on the boiler for six years the building has been in existence.
Building officials stated they assumed the backflow preventer was installed during
construction of the building.

 SUMMARY: A valve separating the potable
water system and an auxiliary water supply to an irrigation system was accidently opened
by the fire department during a routine inspection, permitting water from a pond to be
pumped into the potable water system at a golf course. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 23, 1990 the Seattle Water Department received
a complaint of discolored water from a customer in a neighboring water system that obtains
its supply from the Seattle system. On February 23 and 24, 1990 positive total coliform
and fecal coliform test results were received from water samples taken from a routine
sample collection site near the point of supply to the neighboring system. 



 An investigation of water service and metering information
revealed the existence of an auxiliary irrigation system supplying a golf and country
club. Fluoride analysis of the water confirmed the existence of the auxiliary supply. 



 The golf course irrigation system was supplied from a pond
on the property. A valve separating the potable water system from the irrigation system
was opened by fire department personnel during a fire system inspection. 



 The cross connection was quickly detected because the
regular sampling location for monitoring bacteriological quality was located at the club
house kitchen. Bacteriological contamination of a water system through a cross connection
is very difficult to trace.

 DETAILS: 



 The drinking water at the main police station in Tucson,
Arizona was contaminated by water from the building&apos;s cooling system. The cross connection
between the potable water system and cooling system was discovered by maintenance workers
trying to determine why the closed cooling system was loosing water. The maintenance
workers added red dye to the water in the cooling system that serves several downtown
buildings. The dye later appeared in the water fountain and toilets in the police station. 



 Signs were posted in the police station warning people not
to drink the water. City staff began the inspection of the plumbing in the 72,000
square-foot new building addition suspected of having the cross connection. 



 No information was given on what chemicals were in the

 DETAILS: 



 Several residents in a community in central Kansas were
experiencing air in the water. The employees of the water department traced the source to
a dentist office. 



 An air compressor supplied 80 psi to the dental equipment.
The water pressure from the city varied from 40 to 45 psi. A solenoid valve which isolates
the sir supply from the water line malfunctioned. The air compressor was&quot;over

 SUMMARY: An unknown quantity of
industrial chemicals is backpressured in the public water supply by a company that
transforms wheat and barley into ethanol. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 27, 1990 a farm owner in Tucumcari recalled
leaving his lawn sprinkler on all night. Stepping outside he noticed the distinctive odor
associated with the nearby ethanol plant. Checking his inside faucets he discovered the
smell came from the water. Samples were taken but not analyzed for specific contaminants
at that time. Later, the farmer&apos;s son-in-law drank some water and became sick to his
stomach, the local doctor could do nothing to ease his discomfort. On the same day, the
town mayor also became very sick after drinking a large amount of water, it took 48 hours
for him to recover. 



 A local grain power company transforms wheat and barley
into ethanol - also called grain alcohol. In the distilling process, it also creates
several toxic by-products and an unmistakable, yeasty, brewery type odor. Between&quot;batches&quot;of ethanol, plant personnel use water to clean scale from the heat
exchanger and distilling equipment. 



 A functional backflow preventer contained most of the
plant&apos;s potable supply. But, an unprotected auxiliary line tapped the distribution main to
supply emergency fire cannons. Plant personnel illegally tapped the auxiliary line at one
fire cannon with a fire hose and connected it to the plant&apos;s flushing system. The hose
remained connected and the valve left open when plant operations resumed. An unknown
quantity of industrial chemicals were backpressured into the public water supply. 



 Water mains in the area were flushed for eight hours to
clear them of contaminants. Water samples for analysis were taken four hours after the
flushing began. Several heavy toxins were found in the water during laboratory analysis
including: toluene, phenol, benzene ethanol, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, octinol,
octanoic acid, heptanoic acid, butanoic acid, silicon, diconic acid and four
trihalomethanes. 



 Fortunately no one died, but this could have turned into a
very tragic event.

 SUMMARY: Excess air pressure causes five
toilets to explode in County Courthouse. 



 DETAILS: 



 In November, 1990 problems started at the Sangamon County
Courthouse Building one morning when a water tank in the sub-basement filled with air. The
air built up excessive pressure, forcing a blast of air into the restroom plumbing. The
force was so great that five toilets were blown to pieces before the 2,000-gallon tank,
which is usually filled equally with water and air, could be filled to its normal level. 



 Fortunately no one was hurt in the blast which witnesses
said sounded like gunfire or a bomb. One woman, waiting to finalize her divorce, heard the
explosion and thought her husband was blowing up the building. 



 This incident had happened in the same building twice
before in the &apos;60s and &apos;70s, both times fixtures were blasted apart. 



 Workers flushed toilets in an effort to relieve the
pressure, as they did so, the toilet in the judge&apos;s private restroom exploded.

chicken house permitted the backflow, into the public water system, of an antibiotic
administered to chickens through the chicken house water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 In response to complaints from a customer on the Casa
water system, it was determined that the water system was contaminated by backflow from a
commercial chicken house. The chicken house had been receiving water from both the public
water system and an auxiliary well connected to the chicken house plumbing. The water
system connected to the chicken house included two single check valves in series for
backflow prevention. The water in the chicken house was being used to administer an
antibiotic solution to the chickens. 



 During the week of June 23, 1991 residents in the area
served by the water main became concerned when the water became noticeably discolored.
When made aware of the problem, the water system manager shut off the water service to the
chicken house and flushed the water line extension servicing the area. The water meter
serving the chicken house was later removed until proper backflow prevention could be
assured. 



 The presence of the antibiotic in the water could have
caused severe effects in humans who were hypersensitive to the drug. Due to these and
other concerns, chicken and brooder houses are considered to be a high health hazard
requiring the installation of a reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly. According
to the Cooperative Extension Service, there are estimated to be at least 12,000 chicken
houses in Arkansas, and it can be assumed that most, if not all of these houses administer
a variety of necessary chemicals to their stock.

 SUMMARY: The backflow of water from an
auxiliary well source resulted in a water main flushing program. 



 DETAILS: 



 On Wednesday, June 2, 1991 the City of Centralia Water
Utility received several calls from residents complaining that their water was a yellowish
color. Additional calls were received the following day. In response the water mains in
the area of the complaints were flushed. 



 On Thursday, in response to more complaints, the water
main flushing was continued. Bacteria and chlorine samples were collected; no chlorine
residual was detected. The customer complaints noted that their water darkened on heating,
clear water turned yellow to orange after standing, stained fixtures, and imparted an oily
residue or slime on the water surface. Later lab results determined that the water was
free of coliform bacteria but contained iron and manganese. 



 The utility notified the customers in the area of the
complaints not to drink the water and then initiated a house-to-house survey to determine
the cause of the contamination. 



 On Monday, June 8, a water utility crew found that a mill
still had water flowing from a hose bib after the city water was turned off. The mill had
a well as an auxiliary water supply. The well supply had just recently been interconnected
with the supply from the City and was being used intermittently for vehicle washing. The
water from the well was high in iron and manganese. 



 The direct cost to the City for the cross connection
investigation, lab testing and water main flushing was approximately $6,000. Approximately
85 persons were affected. Several customers filed claims against the City.

 SUMMARY: The mistaken connection of the
water service for a new house to the reclaimed water distribution line resulted in the
customer being supplied with treated wastewater for domestic consumption. 



 DETAILS: 



 A Saint Petersburg family that drank and bathed for a week
in water that looked and smelled awful, finally figured out the awful truth; their water
service to their new home was&quot;hooked up backward&quot;. The family had been drinking
treated wastewater meant for the lawn. The grass, on the other hand, had been thriving on
the family&apos;s drinking water. 



 The family members stated that the water tasted awful and
smelled bad. 



 State officials stated that the reclaimed water is treated
to kill all viruses and most bacteria, and drinking it should not cause any serious health
problems. The water had a high concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus and salts.

 SUMMARY: A single 8-inch check valve on a
fire system failed and allowed contamination of the potable water supply to the restrooms
in a transit station. 



 DETAILS: 



 In April of 1991 an LRT station experienced problems with
the water in the staff washrooms and in the janitor&apos;s room. Inspection of the facility
found that the fire system header was separated from the domestic water system by a single
check valve. Examination of the check valve found that rust build up kept it 3/4 inch
ajar. 



 Water samples taken to an independent laboratory had the
following results: Fe (mg/L) 0.99, Pb (mg/L) 0.39, P (mg/L) 697.9. 



 Water samples taken from the buildings on either side of
the station were normal. 



 a DCVA was recommended to be installed in the water line
supplying the fire system.

 SUMMARY: About 100 homes were
contaminated after a weed killer was backsiphoned into the public water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 Residents in the northern Utah community of Uintah
Highlands were told not to drink the water after a weed killer, TriMec, was accidentally
sucked into the water lines. The system was contaminated when a grounds keeper at a
cemetery apparently allowed the chemical to be siphoned into the water system. 



 About 100 homes were believed affected, although some of
the chemical may have entered the rest of the system that serves about 2,000 homes. 



 Residents were asked to open water taps for at least 20
minutes. If they notice peculiar smells or color, they were requested to leave the water
running. Residents were urged to seek alternative water sources, such as bottled water.

 SUMMARY: A boiler cleaning compound was
accidently pumped into a school&apos;s water supply instead of the properly protected boiler
system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On December 2, 1991 a boiler technician pumped about 2
gallons of a cleaning compound into what he mistakenly thought was the boiler feed line in
a school. The line was part of the domestic water system in the school. 



 The principle of the school discovered the cross
connection when one of the teachers said that the water tasted soapy. The principle,
knowing the boiler was being cleaned, immediately notified the technician. The water
system in the school was flushed overnight. 



 The boiler was isolated by a reduced pressure principle
assembly. However, the chemical was injected up stream of the assembly. To prevent a
future occurrence, all the piping in the boiler room was marked to show their contents.

 SUMMARY: The failure to properly flush
highly chlorinated water from a new 8-inch pipe before placing it into service resulted in
the water system of a building being polluted. 



 DETAILS: 



 In June, 1991 a water quality complaint was received from
a local college. When the water quality inspector arrived, he noticed a strong chlorine
odor coming from the lawn where a hose had been left running. Two of the water
department&apos;s troublemen had already isolated the area and had taken samples from fire
hydrants on the main water distribution system. These samples were within normal
parameters, indicating that it was an internal problem. Water samples taken inside the
complex showed chlorine levels higher that what the test equipment could measure. 



 Upon investigation it was found that the mechanical
contractor had installed a new eight inch water line to supply the existing building as
well as a new addition. The old service was to be abandoned. The new line was super
chlorinated to disinfect it; then drained using a garden hose connected to a cap at the
end of the line. According to the contractor&apos;s foreman, water samples were taken to a lab
for testing. Apparently, the samples were approved. However, it was not substantiated that
these samples were ever taken. Thereafter, a fire hose was connected from the new system
to the existing water line. The old system was then turned off at the water meter and the
new system turned on. The chlorine in the new water line had not been properly flushed,
resulting in a tremendously high concentration of chlorine. 



 The contractor and staff were instructed to flush every
faucet and outlet in the building. By 6:00 a.m. the next morning, a sample taken to the
water treatment lab showed chlorine concentrations were down to normal, 0.04 mg/L. Twenty
seven other chlorimeter tests on the hot and cold water system, throughout the complex
revealed that the chlorine levels were within acceptable ranges.

 SUMMARY: Faulty check valves on a water
chiller allowed bacterial contamination of an Air Force Base water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 Routine water samples taken at an Air Force Base in early
April, 1991 and then tested by San Antonio Metropolitan Health District showed the
presence of infectious bacteria. 



 The 22,000 workers and residents were ordered to boil
drinking water or get water from substitute supplies until the source of the contamination
was found and cleared up. 



 Investigators pinpointed the source of contamination as
two check valves that had frozen open on a water chiller. The water in the chiller is
exposed to open air and is susceptible to contamination from a variety of sources,
including bird or squirrel droppings. Symptoms of coliform bacteria include diarrhea,
cramps, nausea, headaches and fatigue. However, little increase was noted in the number of
gastrointestinal problems at the base clinic. 



 The faulty check valves were replaced, and the base water
was chlorinated more than usual. Water pipes in the two most severely areas of the base
were flushed.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection between the
air conditioning unit and domestic water line at a college results in ethylene glycol in
the potable water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 On May 1, 1991 complaints of water quality at a community
college in Selden, New York was reported to The Suffolk County Department of Health
Services. The water was reported to taste and smell&quot;unusual&quot;. All the
complaints originated from the school library. 



 Analysis of water samples taken at the library building
confirmed the presence of ethylene glycol concentrations of up to one percent by volume. 



 The large commercial air conditioning system utilizes
cooling towers installed on the exterior of the building. Seasonal freeze protection is
required. Each fall, the library air conditioner is taken off-line by replacing the water
with approximately 55 gallons of ethylene glycol. In the spring, the antifreeze was purged
from the system and replaced with water. The water line to the system was controlled by
standard gate valve and a pressure regulating valve. The gate valve was opened seasonally
providing water and dispensing ethylene glycol to waste. 



 There are two possible reasons why the backflow incident
occurred. The first suggests the water pressure in the building was less than the air
conditioner during expansion and contraction in the coils located in the cooling tower.
The gate valve and pressure regulator failed to prevent backflow resulting in a dilute
solution of ethylene glycol entering the domestic water supply. 



 The second explanation might be attributed to the fact the
local water purveyor had drained the water tower in the vicinity of the library for
maintenance. The reduction of building water pressure was a likely result. 



 All water fixtures on the campus were posted with warning
signs, and the fixtures were flushed for two days. The main domestic water supply to the
campus was fitted with an acceptable backflow prevention assembly.

 SUMMARY: Trichloroethane enters a
municipal water supply due to a cross connection at the newspaper office. Disorganized
flushing by utility personnel scattered the contaminant throughout the distribution
system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On June 18, 1991 the manager of a newspaper office in a&quot;not so small&quot;town in Missouri called the Department of Natural Resources to
complain of a strong solvent odor in the drinking water. Investigation determined the
strong solvent odors were in the municipal water system as the odors were present in fire
hydrants at least one block south and one block west of the newspaper. Samples were
collected from the newspaper office and several locations surrounding that office. During
the sampling it was determined that city staff had flushed water mains in the area to try
to remove the contaminant. 



 Results of samples collected revealed the presence of
1-1-1 trichloroethane. Because of the unstructured way the flushing was done by the city,
samples were collected again on June 24 at locations chosen to define the area of
contamination. Analysis indicated that trichloroethane was present in all samples. The
levels were higher than those samples collected June 18, with the highest level being 420
micrograms per liter, high enough to be alarming, but the locations of the samples with
the highest levels did not make sense. Investigation revealed that city staff had again
flushed the water mains on June 21, in an effort to control the solvent odors. 



 At this point it was difficult to tell whether the
trichloroethane was entering the water mains as a result of cross connection or a spill.
Three businesses in the area used trichloroethane, the newspaper office, a machine shop,
and an automotive garage. The machine shop and garage were ruled out as the cause. 



 A trichloroethane/water solution is pumped onto a portion
of the press at the newspaper office. The water fill line was submerged in the solution
tank. A regular check valve was in the water line to the solution tank. It is believed
that high levels of trichloroethane entered the municipal distribution system due to a
cross connection at the newspaper office. Disorganized flushing scattered the contaminant
throughout the system and hampered the ability to identify and address the problem.

 SUMMARY: Parasitical worms were sucked
into the drinking water after a water main break. 



 DETAILS: 



 Parasitical worms were found in the water at two homes in
Southgate, Michigan on October 1, 1991 after the backflow prevention system on a privately
owned underground sprinkler system malfunctioned coupled with a water main break. 



 The Wayne County Health Department determined that an
atmospheric vacuum breaker had malfunctioned and was stuck in the closed position, there
was a water main break that caused a vacuum in the system. When the water pressure dropped
the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water, but was
only distributed to two homes. 



 One homeowner found the worms swimming around in his
bathtub when he started filling the tub for his child. He was appalled to find the
critters, as well as rust and other debris in his water. He was still finding living
things in his water the following day. 



 The contractor who installed the sprinkler system did not
have a city permit and used a&quot;cheap&quot;atmospheric vacuum breaker. When it
malfunctioned at the same time as the water main break, the nematodes were siphoned into
the system. 



 The resident who owns the sprinkler was cited by the
county for improper installation.

 SUMMARY: Cleaning chemicals, used to
remove grease from a commercial kitchen hood, is backsiphoned into the potable water
system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On February 6, 1992 there was a report that water from the
men&apos;s grill bar sink, situated in a golf club, was burning people&apos;s hands as if it
contained acid. 



 The building superintendent investigated and observed
brownish tainted water at the downstairs bar sink, he cautioned everyone not to use the
water and then checked the upstairs plumbing. He found tainted water in the rest of the
building. 



 The Atlanta Plumbing Department and the Water Bureau were
called to investigate. Water samples taken from several points in the building revealed a
pH level of 10.0, this represented an extremely high alkalinity or caustic level in the
water. 



 Earlier, a hood cleaning company had completed a cleaning
operation on the club&apos;s kitchen hood. The cleaning solution was delivered by a high
pressure spray nozzle to remove grease accumulation. 



 The cleaning chemicals were placed in a tank and mixed
with water supplied by a garden hose from a club house hose bib. The tank with the
solution was then pressurized by a air compressor to 90-100 psi, while maintaining a
continuous&quot;water supply&quot;to the tank. The water system pressure, however, was
only 50-55 psi. Thus part of the solution was forced out of the spray nozzle, and part
into the potable water system. 



 The hood cleaning company stated that no acid was used in
the cleaning mixture and provided the formula - xanthum gum, sodium hydroxide and
isopropyl alcohol. The cleaning equipment did not have a backflow prevention device, nor
did the club&apos;s hose bib supplying water to the equipment. 



 The golf club was required to install backflow prevention
devices.

 SUMMARY: Employees of a plastic
manufacturing company disconnect a vacuum breaker causing backpressure of potassium
hydroxide and calsolene oil into the city system. 



 DETAILS: 



 Edmonton&apos;s water department received a call from a
plastics manufacturing plant complaining of sudsy water in their hot and cold water lines.
Investigation of the facility found that all the equipment, and individual outlets had the
appropriate backflow prevention devices except one hose bib. A hose was connected to this
outlet and attached to the process water pump so that it could be primed. Apparently, a
hose connection vacuum breaker had been installed when the building was under
construction. However, the operators found it a nuisance, as every time the pump was
turned the hose connection vacuum breaker started to spray water from the relief ports. It
seemed reasonable to simply take the hose connection vacuum breaker off and connect the
priming hose directly to the hose bib. This certainly solved the spillage problem but it
also created an unseen hazard. The pressure the pump produced overcame the city water
pressure and forced the process water, which contained potassium hydroxide and calsolene
oil, back into the domestic cold water supply. 



 Employees at the site had been drinking water the day of
the contamination. They complained of raw throats. Fortunately, not enough of the
substance had been consumed to cause any serious health effects. 



 A reduced pressure principle backflow preventer, to the
process area, was installed along with a proper backflow preventer to the process water
line used to prime the pump.

 SUMMARY: A Seniors Residence experiences
intermittent&quot;blue colored&quot;water in taps. 



 DETAILS: 



 It began in April, 1992 when a tenant of a Seniors
Residence complained of periodic&quot;blue colored&quot;water coming from her taps.
Laboratory Services collected cold water samples but no blue coloration was evident and
test results were inconclusive. 



 In July, 1992 the tenant returned from abroad and
complains of&quot;blue&quot;water again. Tenant advises that the blue water condition is
intermittent and usually occurs in the bathroom but has occurred in the kitchen sink.
According to the Chief Maintenance person, this is the only tenant in the complex that has
experienced the blue water problem. 



 The Backflow Prevention Branch of City Health conducted an
investigation and inspection to determine the cause of the blue water. Plumbing system and
heating/cooling system were checked. Suites along the vertical riser plumbing system were
checked for possible backflow/cross connection situations, as well as the main floor
businesses (hair dresser, bakery/restaurant). Water samples were collected from various
locations for analysis. Tenants in three suites above the vertical riser were found to be
using blue toilet bowl disinfectant cleaners in their toilet tanks. Because of the
plumbing deficiencies, blue disinfectant water could possible backflow into the water
system under the right conditions. Plumbing deficiencies were corrected immediately.

 SUMMARY: Backsiphonage resulting from a
venturi effect caused recurring algae problem in public water distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 For some time, the Ritzville public water distribution
system had a recurring problem with cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, a type of algae
dependant on light for photosynthesis. A study of the entire distribution system was
undertaken to determine any possible source of surface water contamination. No creeks,
ponds or other bodies of water were noted. 



 The source of the algae was eventually traced to a new
reservoir. A 16-inch pipe served as both inlet and outlet. The drain from the reservoir
was a 12-inch line that branched from the 16-inch line. The drain line discharged into a
partly submerged sump located approximately four feet in elevation below the reservoir. 



 Algae growth was noted in the drain sump. As the sump was
being observed, it was also noted that water was flowing from the sump into the drain
pipe. The drain line valve could not be closed tight. When water was pumped into the
reservoir, the venturi action past the drain connection syphoned water from the sump. When
the pumps stopped, the siphonage was observed to stop, confirming the venturi effect.

 SUMMARY: A complaint of dirty water at a
restaurant reveals CO 2 backflowed into city water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On August 14, 1992 a cross-connection specialist responded
to a complaint by the owner/manager of a restaurant of dirty water. Upon arrival it was
found the meter was running backwards, the meter was turned off and the service line
ordered to be flushed. 



 When the water was turned on to flush the service line,
the work crew noticed an unusual&quot;blast of air&quot;followed by very black water. 



 Investigation revealed the problem was first noticed when
the drive-through window beverage dispenser quit working and dirty water was noticed in a
nearby sink. 



 A smell that was recognized as CO 2 gas was
coming out of the faucets at the back of the restaurant. Checking the CO 2 tanks, the on line tank contained 500-525 psi. The manager had connected the tank just
prior to the dirty water problem. At that time it was a new, full tank with 800 psi. 



 Now knowing that CO 2 had backflowed into the
water main over coming the city water pressure of 65-70 psi in the 10-inch steel main, the
water main was isolated and systematically flushed to remove any contamination. 



 All three carbonators were checked to determine which had
malfunctioned. 



 The two front counter dispensers had small metal filings
in the dual check valve 0-rings. 



 The drive-through window dispenser was found to have three
small pieces of rust and a spring stuck in the open position. This caused the carbonator
to burn out. 



 After three hours of flushing, laboratory analysis
reported the water to be free of any bacteria. 



 The restaurant was closed until a backflow preventer could
be installed on the water supply to the carbonators.

 SUMMARY: A restaurant&apos;s malfunctioning
soda system caused suction within the piping system forcing a chemical agent into the
potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 On September 2, 1993, the Cross Connection Control Office
in Boston, Massachusetts received a call from the owner of a restaurant, that&quot;blue&quot;water was coming out of the kitchen sink and was also present in the soda
dispensing system. There was also an odor and bad taste to the water. 



 Inspectors found that the dishwashing system had a direct
cross connection present. The blue chemical drying agent was connected to the dishwasher
supply line without backflow protection. The owner was asked to remove the chemical supply
line from the five gallon drum of chemical drying agent, also to thoroughly flush the
water lines and install an approved RPBA device before reconnecting the drying agent to
the dishwashing system. 



 The following day, a licensed plumber, while installing
the RPBA device, found the actual cause of the cross connection. The soda system&apos;s pump
was continuously engaging and creating suction within the internal piping system. During
the night, when there was no water usage, the continuous engaging of the pump caused a
suction within the restaurant piping system. The chemical agent was sucked back into the
dishwasher supply line and from there throughout the restaurant.

 SUMMARY: A cross connection resulted when
a washing machine hose was connected to a hose bib located on both an air conditioner and
a potable water system at a blood bank. 



 DETAILS. 



 On November 16, 1993 the drinking water section of Suffolk
County Department of Health Services was made aware of a serious cross connection hazard
associated with the operation of a large commercial air conditioning system using exterior
mounted cooling towers at a large full service blood bank. The air conditioning system
capacity is approximately 80-90 gallons of ethylene glycol. The mechanical room is located
above the laboratory and it contains condenser/pumps for this system. 



 The domestic water piping was installed through the
mechanical room, close to the condenser/pumps. The cross connection was constructed using
a standard washing machine flex hose connected to a boiler drain type hose bib located on
both the air conditioner distribution loop and the potable water supply. To purge air from
the condensers, maintenance men constructed a bridge between the air conditioning loop and
potable water system and then pressurized the system, air was then vented to the
atmosphere using a second hose bib on the discharge side of the condenser. 



 Staff at the blood bank received complaints about soapy
and sudsy water and the water was colored. The first incident was noted when the main
ice-making machine, located in the laboratory area, would not produce ice. Maintenance men
then recalled the washing machine hose connection, and upon investigation, found the cross
connection still in place, the connection had remained undisturbed, with all valves in an
open position, for an estimated nine or ten days. 



 The volume of ethylene glycol that contaminated the
domestic water supply remains unknown, although conditions were high enough to inhibit ice
production. The fact that no injury resulted from this contamination incident is
remarkable considering the amount of fluids blood donors are required to consume following
donation. 



 As a result of this incident, a reduced pressure assembly
was installed internally on the domestic water line servicing the air conditioning system
and the boiler drain/hose bib was removed.

 SUMMARY: Chemicals from an x-ray
developer were backflowed into the potable water supply of a medical facility. 



 DETAILS: 



 On November 17, 1993 the City of Wilson, NC Water
Distribution Division received a complaint from a medical facility of a strange, bitter
taste and strong chemical odor to their water. 



 Upon investigation, a cross connection was discovered with
a chemical mixer used in x-ray development. The equipment combined water with three part
developer and two part fixer. Water was added to the mixer through an indirect cross
connection with a garden hose and hose bib. The hose bib was not protected with a hose bib
vacuum breaker as required by code, although the device was in installed when the plumbing
and final certificate of occupancy were issued for the building. 



 On the evening of November 15, water distribution
personnel working with a private utility contractor cut a section from the eight-inch
water main in front of this facility to replace a leaking tapping sleeve with a Tee. The
tapping sleeve served a new street where the clinic&apos;s service was located. The work was
done under during evening hours, because it was understood that the clinic would lose
water service temporarily. When this work was done, it apparently created a backsiphonage
on the clinic&apos;s water system. 



 Analysis of water samples taken from the clinic showed no
chlorine residual and a pH of nearly 8.0. These results are consistent with the presence
of sulfate and sulfite, chemicals found in developer and fixer.

 SUMMARY: Blue toilet sanitizer water is
backsiphoned into potable water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 In January, 1993 the Vancouver Health Department received
a complaint from a customer that his hot water was coming out blue and soapy. On
investigation, it was noted that light blue water flowed from the hot water side, while
the cold water appeared clear. 



 On questioning the complainant and reviewing the building
water system, it was determined that the rear outside tap had frozen and sprung a leak
during a recent cold spell. The owner had shut off the main water supply valve and had cut
and capped the water line leading to the outside tap. It was during this event that the
complainant noted blue water for the first time. 



 On further investigation it was noted that the toilet in
the attic bedroom had blue toilet sanitizer in the tank and bowl. The attic washroom had
not been used for a long period of time and the owner had forgotten about the sanitizer. 



 It was concluded that some of the toilet tank water
containing colored sanitizer was drawn into the building&apos;s water distribution system
during the water line break and repair event. A considerable amount of cold water had been

 SUMMARY: Non FDA approved plastic hose
causes bad taste and odor in beverages from a pop machine. 



 DETAILS: 



 A plumbing contractor installed a stainless steel backflow
assembly in a soda pop machine at a deli, the device was tested and there was no problem. 



 A few hours later, the deli owner called the plumber and
complained of a bad taste and odor in the water. The installation of the device was double
checked and it was confirmed there was no brass installed down stream of the device. The
CO 2 service machine was at least 5&apos; away from the device. 



 Further investigation found the problem to be a bad, non
FDA approved, flexible plastic hose. This was replaced with a FDA approved brand. There
were no further complaints.

 SUMMARY: Water from a drainage pond, used
for lawn irrigation, is pumped into potable water supply of a housing development. 



 DETAILS: 



 On a site formerly used by a sewer cleaning company to
dispose of septic tank&quot;pumpings&quot;, a housing development was allowed to be
developed after the site had been covered and compacted. The occupants of one home
installed a pump for irrigation in the ponded drainage flowing from this fill area.
Eventually the pump failed. The wife, noticing the need to irrigate the lawn but aware the
pump was in for repair, connected a hose from the house to the sprinkler system. The
husband returned with the repaired pump, installed it, and turned it on pumping the highly
contaminated drainage water through the hose, and into the water main in the street and
into the elevated storage tank serving their area. 



 Fortunately, a meter reader for the water utility was at
the site and notified his office and the utility was able isolate the contaminated area to
the 7 or 8 homes in the housing development and to the elevated storage tank that served
the development.

 SUMMARY: A defective backflow device in
the water system of the County Courthouse apparently caused sodium nitrate contamination
that sent 19 people to the hospital. 



 DETAILS: 



 A defective backflow device in the water system of the
County Courthouse apparently caused contamination of sodium nitrate that had been used in
the building&apos;s boiler and cooler. 



 On September 29, 1994, nineteen people became sick enough
to require medical attention, all had drunk coffee from the courthouse snack bar. Samples
taken from the coffee urn contained high concentrations of sodium nitrate. 



 Employees of the courthouse had noticed&quot;brown,
rusty&quot;water in the toilets, sinks and drinking fountains that morning, they let the
water flow until it cleared up. However, the proprietor of the snack bar is legally blind
and did not notice the brown water in his sink, and water flowing through the coffee
machine comes directly from the courthouse water system.&quot;Naturally it comes out
brown from the coffee urn&quot;. 



 The backflow valves that may have malfunctioned were
changed or repaired.

 SUMMARY: An 8-inch reduced pressure
principle in the basement of a hospital discharged under backpressure conditions dumping
100,000 gallons of water into the basement. 



 DETAILS: 



 A veterans hospital in Syracuse, New York was closed for
several days in July, 1994 following when it appeared that an 8-inch reduced pressure
principle assembly located in the basement discharged under backpressure conditions. More
than 100,000 gallons of water dumped into the basement filling it to a depth of 8 feet.
Submerged pumps, exchangers, and boilers failed. Domestic water supplies were contaminated
with fouled discharge. 



 The relief valve did not fail. A reduced pressure
principle assembly is designed to prevent backflow under back pressure conditions. If
check valve no, 2 fails, then potentially contaminated backflow is discharged from the
plumbing system to prevent possible contamination of the potable supply. 



 The floor drains did not work properly because the
capacity was not large enough. Possible flow restrictions of dirt, hair, cigarette butts,
and other waste material did not help the matter. 



 The cost of clean up, patient transfer may hit $2,000,000.
This may be a conservative estimate considering today&apos;s litigious society.

 SUMMARY: While working on a chiller unit
of an air conditioning system at a nursing home, a hole in the coil apparently allowed
Freon to enter the circulating water and from there into the city water system. 



 DETAILS: 



 A backflow of Freon into the drinking water supply of
Franklin, Nebraska left residents without water for 6 days. 



 Workers accidently released the chemical refrigerant into
the city water system while repairing a nursing home air conditioning unit. A hole in the
coil of the unit apparently allowed Freon to enter the water that was circulating through
the air conditioner, a city domestic water line was connected to the chiller, which is
common for commercial air conditioning systems. The Freon, which was being pumped in with
about 1,000 pounds of pressure, backed up into the city water main, contaminating the
water. 



 City officials became aware of the problem when the city
residents (pop. 1,100) began complaining of bad tasting water that caused a burning
sensation in the mouth. No one became sick from drinking the water. 



 Residents were without water for six days while the
drinking water system for the town was flushed three times before tests results showed the
system to be free of Freon.

 SUMMARY: The blue tinted water in a pond
at an amusement park backflowed into the city water system and causes colored water to
flow from homeowners faucets. 



 DETAILS: 



 Water that had been dyed blue for dramatic effect in an
amusement park&apos;s bumper-boat ride pond in Carmichael, California, flowed back through an
inlet and into the main domestic water pipe that feeds neighboring houses and businesses.
The water flowed from the faucets the color of Windex, and ice machines churned out blue
ice cubes. 



 The three foot deep pond has a pump that shoots up water
as amusement park boaters bump into each other in the 111,000 square foot lake. The water
pressure in Carmichael is fairly low and the pump pressure was greater than the general
water pressure so it did not take much to pump blue-dyed water into the system without a
backflow preventer. 



 The blue dye was labeled non-toxic and the escaped pond
water was cleansed of harmful bacteria as it mixed with the municipal water supply.
Samples of the dye and pond water were sent for laboratory testing to be absolutely
certain it was safe to drink. 



 The city water system was flushed until the water ran
clear. The amusement park ride was ordered shut down until an approved backflow prevention
device was installed.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: October, 1994 

 LOCATION: Los Angeles, California 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: California-American Water Company 



 SUMMARY: A film company shooting a
commercial for television accidentally introduced a chemical into the potable water
system. 



 DETAILS: 



 A film company was using a ranch in the northeast section
of California-American&apos;s water system for their filming location. In the scene they were
shooting, it was snowing. The film crew was spraying artificial snow from a pressurized
tank for special effects. The artificial snow was generated from a 55 gallon tank of
Macrojet I Concentrate. The water truck that furnished water for this process failed to
work properly. As a result, a special effect&apos;s person connected a garden hose to the house
hose bib. The pressure in the tank forced the chemical into the potable water line when
the hose bib was opened. Approximately 30 gallons of the solution was back-pressured into
the potable water system. 



 Consumers on the affected cul-de-sac street began calling
the water company complaining of brown soapy water coming from their faucets. Water
company employees instructed them to flush both hot and cold faucets until they ran clear.
The water company began flushing the system from a 2&quot;blow-off valve at the end of
the 8&quot;main for several hours until the water ran clear. Bottled water was supplied
to the homes in the area. Flushing was continued for several more hours the next day until
the water was safe to drink. 



 Because this location has been used many times before for
filming, and to avert this problem from recurring, a reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly was required to be installed on the consumers service line.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: April, 1994 

 LOCATION: Des Moines, Iowa 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Department of
Public Health, Iowa 



 SUMMARY: A backflow of water from the
Capitol Building chilled water system contaminates potable water with Freon. 



 DETAILS: 



 On April 20, 1994 the Iowa Department of Public Health
received a complaint of discolored bad tasting water at the Capitol, a sample had been
taken and an undetermined amount of Freon was present. 



 The available information points to a backflow of water
from the Capitol chilled water system to the potable water piping in the area of the
Senate lounge. This apparently occurred in the afternoon or evening of April 18. A
combination of circumstances contributed to the backflow. 



 1. The chilled water system was being filled from the
potable water system on April 18. 



 2. The booster pump used to get added volume to the
chilled water system was being replaced through the day. The chilled system was being
filled with city main pressure water. 



 3. Perhaps because of #2 above, the by-pass gate valve in
the supply line to the chilled water system was left open for at least four hours on April
18. 



 4. The booster pump was operated briefly April 18,
evening, then shut down because a leak was found just downstream of the pump. 



 5. The area where discolored, bad tasting water was found
is immediately downstream of the line serving the chilled water system. 



 The backflow occurred because of an unprotected cross
connection between the chilled water system and the potable water system. This cross
connection has been provided with adequate protection. The building was also provided with
a containment backflow prevention assembly.

 LOCATION: Indiana 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: &quot;Journal and
Courier&quot;Newspaper 



 SUMMARY: Water main break caused a drop
in water pressure allowing anti-freeze from an air conditioning unit to backsiphone into
the potable water supply. 



 DETAILS: 



 Complaints about discolored and bad-tasting water in an
Indiana university building alerted officials to a mechanical malfunction that allowed
anti-freeze to leak into the water supply. 



 Workers are almost certain the ethylene glycol first got
into the building&apos;s drinking water supply sometime after a water main break caused a drop
in pressure which allowed anti-freeze from an air-conditioning unit outside the building
to be siphoned back into the water supply. Officials aren&apos;t sure how much of the
anti-freeze leaked. 



 The water supply is connected to the air conditioning unit
to maintain an adequate mixture of water and anti-freeze. A mechanical check valve
apparently failed. 



 The drinking water supply was shut off for one full day
while plumbers flushed the building&apos;s pipes. Employees were still asked not to drink the
water. Full service of drinking water resumed the following week after tests showed no
trace of contaminant. 



 All workers who drank the contaminated water were examined
by a doctor, no serious illness was reported.

Department 



 SUMMARY: An Ethylene Glycol cooling
system was illegally connected to the domestic water supply at a veterinary hospital. 



 DETAILS: 



 Ethylene Glycol was discovered in the domestic water
supply at a Seattle veterinarian hospital. While looking for a water leak in the cooling
system it was discovered water from a domestic hose faucet was directly connected to the
non-potable cooling system. 



 The building was completely flushed three days in a row.
Hose faucets were removed from the return and supply lines on the cooling system to
eliminate the possibility of domestic water being connected to the hose faucets.

 SUMMARY: An ice machine connected to a
sewer sickened dozens of people attending a convention. 



 DETAILS: 



 In May 1994, more than 1,000 people attended a convention
in Columbus, Ohio. About two weeks after the convention was over, a small number of call
started coming into the health department. All of the callers assumed that they had
contacted food poisoning at restaurants at the convention. Giardia was ultimately
blamed for the illnesses. It has an incubation period of five days to two weeks. Its
symptoms can be subtle, depending upon one&apos;s resistance. Symptoms included diarrhea,
intestinal cramps, and nausea. 



 The health department inspected the restaurants and did
not find any problems. As more calls were received, it was realized that the callers had
all been at the same convention. The health department interviewed the people attending
the convention. The health department mailed 1,200 surveys to those attending the
convention will an itemized list of every food served. When the surveys were returned, a
statistical analysis showed no correlation. 



 The first survey did not include beverages. A second
survey on beverages showed that people who had drinks with ice at one particular cocktail
party were likely to become sick. 



 An inspection found an ice machine. The unit had a
demineralizing filter with a drain hose directly connected into a floor drain.

 LOCATION: New Roads, Louisiana 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Department of
Health, Louisiana 



 SUMMARY: The herbicide Paraquat and
Atrazine was backsiphoned into the city water system after a water line is cut. 



 DETAILS: 



 A work crew accidentally cut the water line on March 21,
1995 while a farmer, some distance away, was diluting several gallons of Paraquat
Dichloride and Atrazine in a 300-gallon spray tank. The break created a siphon that sucked
the pesticides back into the water system through the farmer&apos;s hose. 



 As a result of exposure to contaminated water, some
persons experienced nausea, acute stomach burning and pains, profuse sweating, diarrhea
and shortness of breath. Others suffered lip sores, burning gums and leg cramps. 



 This incident has resulted in a class action lawsuit
seeking unspecified damages for medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, cost
of testing the water and any loss of property values. 



 The lawsuit charged the water company did a poor job of
notifying its customers of the contamination. The suit states&quot;The affected area was
much larger than the area in which the residents were warned by the water company. We know
this because the water turned blue in homes of many of the people who were not warned by
the water company.&quot;Some customers are known to have used the water for three or four
days before either reading about the contamination in the paper or being warned by a
neighbor. 



 The suit faults the water company for failing to warn
customers, failing to test the water after contamination, not decontaminating the water
and not having devices to&quot;prevent contamination by back-flowing water.&quot;

Herald-Republic, August 1, 1995 



 SUMMARY: A cross-connection permitted
untreated irrigation water to flow into domestic water lines causing 11 cases of
giardiasis. 



 DETAILS: 



 Eleven cases of giardiasis were confirmed in a Yakima
neighborhood after a cross-connection permitted untreated irrigation water to flow into
domestic water lines. 



 The contamination is believed to have occurred when a
business tapped into an irrigation line without installing a workable backflow device. The
cross-connection was not discovered until about a month after the incident. 



 Residents in the area began complaining about cloudy water
soon after the cross-connection occurred. Initially the problem was suspected to be a main
line damaged during a construction job. Repairs were made, lines were flushed and the
situation initially appeared to improve. 



 Residents in the area continued to complain about cloudy
water, and an unknown number were stricken with bouts of diarrhea, nausea, cramping and
other problems. 



 Domestic water systems are not typically tested for
Giardia, the parasite that causes giardiasis, a flu-like intestinal ailment sometimes
known as Beaver Fever. 



 Tests for coliform bacteria revealed no problems, those
tests, however, are typically conducted at well heads, not within the distribution system
where the alleged illegal cross-connection occurred.

 SUMMARY: An air compressor connected to
the # 1 test cock of a DCVA on a landscaped irrigation system pumped air into the water
distribution system. 



 DETAILS: 



 To winterize a landscape irrigation system at a fast food
restaurant, a contractor connect an air compressor to test cock #1 of a double check valve
assembly. The contractor thought the irrigation system was isolated by a closed gate valve
upstream from the backflow assembly. The contractor, upon questioning, stated that the
gate valve used to isolate the irrigation system did not close properly. Air was pumped
through the service connection into the utility&apos;s 16-inch water main on the street. The
distribution system pressure was approximately 40 psi. The compressor operated at 120 psi. 



 Several businesses experienced a lack of water and/or air
in the water for periods of time ranging from 20 minutes to 6 hours. Dirty water was also
a problem due to the disturbance of sediment in the water mains. 



 Corrective action consisted of water main flushing through
fire hydrants.

 DATE OF OCCURRENCE: February, 1995 

 LOCATION: Spokane, Washington 

 SOURCE OF INFORMATION: Spokane Water
Department 



 SUMMARY: Pink water was reported in a
high rise multipurpose building; the result of a cross connection with a heating/cooling
system pump. 

 DETAILS: 



 On February 1, 1995, the Spokane Water Department received
a call from a customer stating that the water in the basement and on the 1st floor at the
drinking fountain was pink in color. The customer manages a high rise multipurpose
building. 



 Upon the inspection made of the building, it was noted
that the building had oil cooled pumps for heating and cooling, with a water backup for
emergencies. 



 On this date, a maintenance person operated the valve
which allowed the oil, at the time that the pump was running, to overcome the pressure
inside the building. The building was protected by double check valve assemblies on both
the domestic and the fire service. 



 The customer has since disconnected this water line to the
pump and has installed a reduced pressure backflow assembly in line to the maintenance
facility. 





 Backflow Incident Report Form 



 There are many backflow incidents which occur that are not
reported. This is usually because they are of short duration and are not detected, the
customer is not aware they should be reported, or it may not be known to whom they should
be reported. 



 The PNWS-AWWA Cross Connection Control Committee is making
an effort to bring these incidents to the attention of water purveyors and the public. If
you have any knowledge regarding incidents, please fill out a copy of this form and return
it to the committee, c/o the individual named on the reverse side. In addition, the state
or provincial health agency should be notified.
