PETA vs The Bikers!
 
 Johnstown, PA: Local and state police scoured the hills outside rural Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after reports of three animal rights activists going missing after attempting to protest the wearing of leather at a large motorcycle gang rally this weekend. Two others, previously reported missing, were discovered by fast food workers &quot;duct taped inside several fast food restaurant dumpsters,&quot; according to police officials.

&quot;Something just went wrong,&quot; said a still visibly shaken organizer of the protest. &quot;Something just went horribly, horribly, wrong.&quot;

The organizer said a group of concerned animal rights activist groups, &quot;growing tired of throwing fake blood and shouting profanities at older Women wearing leather or fur coats,&quot; decided to protest the annual motorcycle club event &quot;in a hope to show them our outrage at their wanton use of leather in their clothing and motor bike seats.&quot; &quot;In fact,&quot; said the organizer.. &quot;motorcycle gangs are one of the biggest abusers of wearing Leather, and we decided it was high time that we let them know that we disagree with them using it... Ergo, they should stop.&quot;

According to witnesses, protesters arrived at the event in a vintage 1960&apos;s era Volkswagen van and began to pelt the gang members with balloons filled with red colored water, simulating blood, and shouting &quot;you&apos;re murderers&quot; to passersby.. This, evidently, is when the brouhaha began. &quot;They peed on me!!!&quot; charged one activist. &quot;They grabbed me, said I looked like I was French, started calling me &apos;La Trene&apos;, and duct taped me to a tree so they could pee on me all day!&quot;

&quot;I . . . . I was trying to show my outrage at a man with a heavy leather jacket. And, he. . . . He didn&apos;t even care. I called him a murderer, and all he said was, &apos;You can&apos;t prove that!&apos; Next thing I know is he threatened to force me to ride on the back of his motorcycle all day, and not left me off, because his girl friend was out of town and I was almost a woman.&quot;

Still others claimed they were forced to eat hamburgers and hot dogs under duress. Those who resisted were allegedly held down while several bikers &quot;farted on their heads.&quot; Police officials declined comments on any leads or arrests due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, however, organizers for the motorcycle club rally expressed &quot;surprise&quot; at the allegations.

&quot;That&apos;s preposterous, &quot; said one high ranking member of the biker organizing committee. &quot;We were having a party, and these people showed up and were very rude to us. They threw things at us, called us names, and tried to ruin the entire event. So, what did we do? We invited them to the party! What could be more friendly than that? You know, just because we are all members of motorcycle clubs does not mean we do not care about inclusiveness. Personally, I think it shows a lack of character for them to be saying such nasty things about us after we bent over backwards to make them feel Welcome.&quot;

When confronted with the allegations of force feeding the activists meat, using them as ad hoc latrines, leaving them incapacitated in fast food restaurant dumpsters, and &apos;farting on their heads,&apos; the organizer declined to comment in more detail. &quot;That&apos;s just our secret handshake,&quot; assured the organizer.

I found this article on the Right of Center Blog and had to re-post.....it&apos;s about time that someone took these PETA bastards to task, chalk one up for our leather wearin brothers! Posted by America In Danger at 3:39 PM

Lincoln on Wealth&amp;Government
 “You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it. You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The Government cannot give to anybody anything that the Government does not first take from somebody else. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is surely the end of any nation&apos;s future..&quot; - Abraham Lincoln

The Case Against Barack Obama
 
 David Freddoso exposes the real Obama, and now that he is in the White House, you can see that Mr. Freddoso was right on the mark. You should still take the time to read this book, it is a real eye opener. Learn what kind of a person people elected into the White House. He is proving that he is a major threat to our national security, is working to nationalize the banks and take us into Socialism. Even if you pick it up and only read one chapter, read chapter 10, Abortion: Barack Obama&apos;s America, it will make you sick to your stomach!!

A Tribute To My Very Special Friends
 I have been blessed in my life with many, many close friends, a few of them I have listed here to date. It is said that if a man should have but one close friend in his lifetime, he is blessed, I am truely blessed and very fortunate to have so many close personal friends in my life, without whom, my life would be empty! Oh and just for your information, not all those pictured here share my political views, but they are still my friends and we treat each other as such, with respect!! I will also say that everyone of the people below work hard for what they have, they are not looking for handouts and free rides. This is what America is about, hard work and being a part of the greatest nation on earth, not looking for someone to hand them something for nothing. This is the way our Constitution was designed, and it was done so by many men who did not all have the same political views, who knew that their discussions would require frequent shifting of positions and shifting of minds, but they came together out of respect to write the greatest documnet in history. 
 Also note that not everyone has been added to my list as yet, but be patient, if you are my friend, you will find your way onto my page! I hope I have enough room! God bless you all, and thank you for your friendship! 
 
Two Of My Best Friends
 
 If only they didn&apos;t shed!! 
Daniel Roebuck
 
 Modern day Hollywood is not high on my list these days, but there are a few actors and actresses that I follow and support, this man is one of them, and there are others you will see below who I am proud to support and call my friends. These people are of high class and integrity, and I ask for your support of these fine people. Daniel is a first class family man who cares deeply for his wife and children. He and his wife are very real and concerned parents. They keep tabs on the kids and their upbringing, and have a genuine interest in what they do, a rarity these days. Dan is one fine actor, and I would like to encourage you to follow his work and support him and his projects. There are few people in Hollywood that could light a candle next to this wonderful longtime friend and brother of mine, and I mean that with all sincerity! Click on his picture and it will take you to his website that is full of information and photos from his many years as an actor.

Michael Gregory
 
 I met Michael back in 2000 and I have to say is one heck of a nice guy! I consider Michael to be a great American and I am proud that I got the opportunity to become his friend and brother! I support Michael in his efforts, he is an excellent actor and I encourage you to support him as well. Michael has appeared in over 300 films, TV shows and commercials. Best remembered as the first Dr. Rick Webber from daytime’s General Hospital, he has bounced from one side of the badge to the other playing“heavies”or law enforcement personnel in such films as“Nightbreaker”,“RoboCop”,“Total Recall”, and“Eraser”. You can see him as part of the permanent exhibition at Orlando Universal Studios Jurassic Park ride and you can interact with him as part of the computerized“Talk Radio”exhibit at the“P.O.V. Diner”at the Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance. Click on Micheal and it will take you to his official website where you can hear and see voiceover demos&amp;video clips.....check out the FedEx clip...it&apos;s great!! 
Branscombe Richmond
 
 This is another great friend and brother who spends time in Hollywood. Another excellent and caring family man who has been married as long as I have, and that is a long time! He and I will be, I think it’s 30 this year, isn&apos;t that right BR? He has a wonderful wife and a bunch of great kids and at the risk of making his head swell up, is also an excellent actor. He spends allot of his time touring different countries with his band The Renegade Posse (which is now the Renegade All Stars) among other things. I would also encourage you to follow this man and his accomplishments, and if you ever get a chance to see him in concert, go, he puts on one heck of a show!! Click on his picture to go to his website and see his accomplishments. 
 
Mickey Jones
 
 To not know Mickey Jones by name is understandable, but to not recognize him would be very surprising. Mickey has played hundreds of characters in films and on Television. In his early musical career he played with some of the biggest artists in the industry. Bet you didn&apos;t know he was the drummer for Kenny Rogers and the First Edition! Click on Mickey and go to his website and check out all the projects he has been involved with. Mickey is a really great guy and if I had to catagorize him, I would tell you that he is very much like his character from Tool Time! Thanks for the friendship my brother and your support!

Burney To Drive The #32 Dollar General In 2009
 
 On October 10th 2008 it was announced that Burney Lamar will share the Braun Racing #32 Dollar General Toyota in 2009. The car will be shared by two drivers who are both familiar faces in the yellow and black Dollar General firesuit. Sprint Cup Series driver Brian Vickers who will return to the seat of the #32 for 17 races in 2009 will be sharing the ride with Burney Lamar who drove a Dollar General-sponsored car in the 2006 season. Burneys Uncle Buck and I were long time friends and business associates until his death in December of 2008. We all miss you Mr.C

America, it is time for a change!
 It is time for the American People to wake up to the reality of what is going on with lying, taking advantage of, leading you down the path of socialism government. Our politicians are greedy self serving half witted crackpots that only care about one thing, taking your money and obtaining as much power as they can. I am amazed at how many people are so easily duped into believing that what the government is doing is in the best interest of the American people. Holy cow people, how can you be so blatently out of touch with reality. This country used to operate with people working together, even the two party sides were civil with each other and worked in everyones best interest. I sit and read all the crap that is being slung at each other today, and it makes me sick. Everyone is all fired touchy about their race, color, sexual preference, if anyone calls someone a name they instantly want to sue them. People rob, kill, rape and can&apos;t understand why they go to jail, or why the cops are so eager to watch different groups of people that make them suspicious. It is not that hard people, if you don&apos;t want to go to jail, then stop doing the things that put you in that position. If you don&apos;t like being called a name, stop acting like an idiot. Learn to get along, learn to be brothers and sisters in this world, as you will take nothing with you when you leave it cept for your knowledge, your associations and your good deeds. Everyone has taken God from this country because when people think the are oh so smart, they turn from God and think they are much smarter and know everything there is to know without him. God is the foundation of this country. You would still be sitting under the controlling thumb of England had it not been for the great men under the guiding hand of God who set in motion the escape from living under tyrannistic rule. But it seems that many of you out there want to go back to that way of life, and maybe get lucky enough to have another Hitler take over and rule this country so that you can live as a prisoner, eating rats and bugs to stay alive, and dying from horrible diseases in the process. Too many of you have become complacent in your lives and in what you do and don&apos;t care about. Well I have this to say to you. If you are not willing to fight to bring this country back to being a free nation, eliminating the overshadowing government that is taking control of everyones lives and making it harder and harder to live and get along, then you should pack your bags, move to the middle east and live in a cave for the rest of your life, because that is what it seems like you want, but those of us who are not willing to lay down and die for you or the government will not stand for it, and you can either help us or leave us, make your decission before it is too late for everyone else!! Start reading and studying, and I don&apos;t mean the newspapers. Go the library or go on the internet and study, look up your politicians records and see what they are doing to you. Stop letting them push you around!! 
 God Bless America, and God Help Us In The Coming Years!

 The Constitution of the United States
Preamble Note
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Article I - The Legislative Branch Note
Section 1 - The Legislature

All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.

Section 2 - The House

The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.

No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.

(Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.) (The previous sentence in parentheses was modified by the 14th Amendment, section 2.) The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.

The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, (chosen by the Legislature thereof,) (The preceding words in parentheses superseded by 17th Amendment, section 1.) for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.

Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; (and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.) (The preceding words in parentheses were superseded by the 17th Amendment, section 2.)

No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.

The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.

The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

Section 4 - Elections, Meetings

The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Place of Chusing Senators.

The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall (be on the first Monday in December,) (The preceding words in parentheses were superseded by the 20th Amendment, section 2.) unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.

Section 5 - Membership, Rules, Journals, Adjournment

Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.

Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.

Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.

Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.

Section 6 - Compensation

(The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.) (The preceding words in parentheses were modified by the 27th Amendment.) They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.

Section 7 - Revenue Bills, Legislative Process, Presidential Veto

All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.

Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.

Right To Carry
 
Right-to-Carry 2009
 The Supreme Court, in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), ruled that the Second Amendment protects &quot;the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment.&quot;

Self-defense is a fundamental right. The U.S. constitution, the constitutions of 44 states, common law, and the laws of all states recognize the right to use arms in self-defense. RTC laws respect the right to self-defense by allowing individuals to carry firearms for protection.

There are 40 Right-to-Carry states. Thirty-six have &quot;shall issue&quot; laws, requiring that carry permits be issued to applicants who meet uniform standards established by the state legislature. Three have fairly-administered discretionary-issue carry permit systems. Vermont respects the right to carry without a permit. Alaska, one of the &quot;shall issue&quot; states, has its permit system for the purpose of permit reciprocity1 with other states, and has allowed carrying without a permit since 2003. Of the 10 non-RTC states, eight have restrictively-administered discretionary-issue systems, and two -- Illinois and Wisconsin -- have no permit system and prohibit carrying.

More RTC, less crime: Since 1991, 23 states have adopted RTC laws, replacing laws that prohibited carrying or that issued carry permits on a very restrictive basis; many other federal, state, and local gun control laws have been eliminated or made less restrictive; and the number of privately-owned guns has risen by about 90 million.2 There are more RTC states, gun owners, people carrying firearms for protection, and privately owned firearms than ever before. In the same time frame, the nation&apos;s murder rate has decreased 46 percent to a 43-year low, and the total violent crime rate has decreased 41 percent to a 35-year low.3 RTC states have lower violent crime rates, on average, compared to the rest of the country (total violent crime by 24 percent; murder, 28 percent; robbery, 50 percent; and aggravated assault, 11 percent).4

RTC reduces crime: Studying crime trends in every county in the U.S., John Lott and David Mustard concluded, &quot;allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes. . . . [W]hen state concealed handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent.&quot;5

RTC success: Former Colorado Asst. Atty. Gen. David Kopel: &quot;Whenever a state legislature first considers a concealed carry bill, opponents typically warn of horrible consequences....But within a year of passage, the issue usually drops off the news media&apos;s radar screen, while gun-control advocates in the legislature conclude that the law wasn&apos;t so bad after all.&quot;6 An article on Michigan&apos;s law: &quot;Concerns that permit holders would lose their tempers in traffic accidents have been unfounded. Worries about risks to police officers have also proved unfounded.... National surveys of police show they support concealed handgun laws by a 3-1 margin....There is also not a single academic study that claims Right to Carry laws have increased state crime rates. The debate among academics has been over how large the benefits have been.&quot;7

RTC permit-holders are law-abiding: Florida has issued more carry permits than any state (1.5 million), but revoked only 166 (0.01 percent) due to gun crimes by permit-holders.8

Background: Before 1987 there were 10 RTC states: (Ind. Me., N.H., N.D., S.D. and Wash. had &quot;shall issue&quot; laws. Ala. and Conn. had fairly-administered discretionary-issue systems. Georgia&apos;s &quot;shall issue&quot; law was interpreted as such in some jurisdictions. Vermont allowed carrying without a permit. In 1987, Florida enacted a &quot;shall issue&quot; law, and gun control supporters predicted &quot;Wild West&quot; shootouts would ensue. However, through 1992 Florida&apos;s murder rate decreased 23 percent, while the U.S. rate rose nine percent; thereafter, murder decreased nationally and in Florida.9 Then-Florida Licensing Division Director John Russi noted, &quot;Florida&apos;s concealed weapon law has been very successful. All major law enforcement groups supported the original legislation....[S]ome of the opponents of concealed weapon legislation in 1987 now admit the program has not created the problems many predicted.&quot;10 In a 1995 letter to state officials, Dept. of Law Enforcement Commissioner James T. Moore wrote, &quot;From a law enforcement perspective, the licensing process has not resulted in problems.&quot;

29 RTC states since 1987: 21 had prohibited carrying; nine (*) had restrictive discretionary-issue systems. 1989: Oregon, Penna. (Phila. added in 1995), and West Virginia (in Georgia, a judicial ruling enforced &quot;shall issue&quot; statewide); 1990: Idaho and Mississippi; 1991: Montana; 1994: Alaska, Arizona, Tennessee, and Wyoming; 1995: Arkansas, Nevada*, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah,* and Virginia*; 1996: Kentucky, Louisiana,* and South Carolina*; 2001: Michigan*; 2003: Colorado*; Iowa* (by fairly administering its discretionary system), New Mexico, Minnesota,* and Missouri; 2004: Ohio; 2006: Kansas and Nebraska.

Citizens can defend themselves. Analyzing National Crime Victimization Survey data, criminologist Gary Kleck concluded &quot;robbery and assault victims who used a gun to resist were less likely to be attacked or to suffer an injury than those who used any other methods of self-protection or those who did not resist at all.&quot;11 In the 1990s, Kleck and Marc Gertz found guns were used for self-protection about 2.5 million times annually.12 The late Marvin E. Wolfgang, self-described as &quot;as strong a gun-control advocate as can be found among the criminologists in this country,&quot; said, &quot;The methodological soundness of the current Kleck and Gertz study is clear. I cannot further debate it. . . . I cannot fault their methodology.&quot;13 A study for the Justice Dept. found 34 percent of felons had been &quot;scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an armed victim,&quot; and 40 percent had not committed crimes, fearing victims were armed.14

The right to self-defense has been recognized for centuries. Cicero said 2,000 years ago, &quot;If our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right;&quot; English jurist Sir William Blackstone observed that the English Bill of Rights recognized &quot;the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defense&quot; as intended &quot;to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights,&quot; the first of which is &quot;personal security.&quot;15 Sir Michael Foster, judge of the Court of King&apos;s Bench, wrote in the 18th century, &quot;The right of self-defense . . . is founded in the law of nature, and is not, nor can be, superseded by any law of society.&quot;16

The Supreme Court, in U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876), recognized that the right to arms is an individual right, stating that it &quot;is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.&quot; In Beard v. U.S. (1895), the court approved the common-law rule that a person &quot;may repel force by force&quot; in self-defense, and concluded that, when attacked, a person &quot;was entitled to stand his ground and meet any attack made upon him with a deadly weapon, in such a way and with such force&quot; as needed to prevent &quot;great bodily injury or death.&quot; In the Gun Control Act (1968) and Firearms Owners&apos; Protection Act (1986), Congress stated that it did not intend to &quot;place any undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to . . . personal protection, or any other lawful activity.&quot;

Police aren&apos;t required to protect you. In Warren v. District of Columbia (1981), the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled, &quot;official police personnel and the government employing them are not generally liable to victims of criminal acts for failure to provide adequate police protection . . . a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any particular citizen.&quot; In Bowers v. DeVito (1982), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, &quot;[T]here is no constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen.&quot;

National RTC reciprocity: Sen. John Thune has introduced S. 371 and S. 845, the &quot;Respecting States Rights and Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2009.&quot; Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) has introduced H.R. 197, the &quot;National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2009.&quot; Essentially, these bills propose that a person with any state&apos;s carry permit be allowed to carry in other states.

Nonsense from Brady Campaign (formerly Handgun Control, Inc.): Sarah Brady: &quot;the only reason for guns in civilian hands is for sporting purposes;&quot; former HCI Chair, the late Pete Shields: &quot;put up no defense - give them what they want;&quot; Brady Center&apos;s Dennis Henigan: self-defense is &quot;not a federally guaranteed constitutional right.&quot;17 In 1999, HCI claimed that between 1992-1997 violent crime declined less in RTC states than in other states.18 (HCI previously claimed RTC caused crime to rise.) HCI erred in categorizing 31 states as having RTC during the period, since only 17 of the 31 had RTC in 1992. HCI calculated crime trends from 1992 to under-represent the impact of RTC laws; by 1992 many states had RTC for many years and had already experienced decreases in crime. HCI misclassified Alabama and Connecticut as &quot;restrictive,&quot; and credited restrictive laws for crime decreasing in some states, though states that had restrictive carry laws had had them for many years, and crime did not begin declining in those states until the 1990s, for reasons unrelated to guns.

Nonsense from Violence Policy Center: In 1995, VPC claimed Florida&apos;s RTC law &quot;puts guns into the hands of criminals.&quot;19 The claim was false, since the law permits a person to carry, not acquire, a firearm. VPC claimed &quot;criminals do apply for concealed carry licenses,&quot; without noting that such applications are rejected. Contradicting itself, VPC noted that criminals requested that their rejected applications be reconsidered. &quot;To set the record straight,&quot; Florida Secy. of State, Sandra B. Mortham, said, &quot;As of November 30, 1995, the Department had denied 723 applications due to criminal history. The fact that these 723 individuals did not receive a license clearly indicates that the process is working.&quot; She added, &quot;the majority of concealed weapon or firearm licensees are honest, law-abiding citizens exercising their right to be armed for the purpose of lawful self-defense.&quot;20 In 2001, VPC claimed that there are more women murdered with handguns, than criminals killed in self-defense.21 However, the value of handguns for self-defense is not in how many criminals are killed, but in how often people use handguns to prevent crimes, and how often criminals don&apos;t attack, fearing potential victims are armed. VPC also undercounted the number of criminals killed in self-defense by counting only those noted in police reports, thus excluding defensive homicides later determined to have been justified.

McDowell math: In 1995, anti-gun researcher David McDowell claimed that gun homicide rates increased in Miami, Jacksonville, and Tampa after Florida&apos;s 1987 RTC law.22 But homicide rates fell 10, 18, and 20 percent, respectively, in those metro areas from 1987 until 1993, the most recent data at the time.23 To show an increase, McDowell calculated Jacksonville and Tampa trends from the early 1970s, when rates were lower than in 1993, but calculated Miami&apos;s from 1983, since earlier rates were higher and suggested crime had decreased. None of McDowell&apos;s homicides was committed by a carry permit holder, and he did not indicate which homicides had occurred in situations where a permit would have been required to carry a gun. McDowell once claimed D.C.&apos;s murder rate decreased after its 1977 handgun ban; in fact the rate tripled.24

The 43:1 claim: Based upon a small study of King&apos;s County (Seattle), Washington, gun control supporters claim a gun at home is &quot;43 times more likely&quot; to be used to kill a family member than a criminal.25 To reach that ratio, defensive gun uses are undercounted by counting only cases in which criminals were killed. Most often, when guns are used to defend against criminals, the criminals are only scared off, captured or wounded. Kleck has called the 43:1 ratio and its variants &quot;the most nonsensical statistic in the gun control debate.&quot;26
