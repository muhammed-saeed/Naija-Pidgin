A man must pay over £800 after ignoring a fine for throwing rubbish at a McDonald&apos;s car park in Carmarthenshire.

Council officers say they saw the 43-year-old from Newport drop the litter from his car at the fast food restaurant in Cross Hands.

He was initially issued with a £75 fixed penalty fine.

But Carmarthenshire council said he failed to pay up and magistrates have now fined him £350 with a further £474.71 in costs.

The council, which brought the prosecution, said it hoped it would act as warning to others.

It said environment officers saw the man, who was sitting in a car, open a door and throw&quot;wrappers and packaging&quot;on the floor.

The authority recently ran a county-wide campaign, supported by McDonald&apos;s, to encourage people to dispose of their litter responsibly.

 End Quote Marcus Crossman Spokesman for McDonald&apos;s 
Executive board member environment Philip Hughes said:&quot;We work closely with McDonald&apos;s and other fast food restaurants and we would like to thank them for supporting our campaign.

&quot;The council is determined to clean up the county and prosecute those that break the law, but we cannot do this on our own.&quot;

The case has also been welcomed by the fast food chain.

McDonald&apos;s Wales spokesman Marcus Crossman said:&quot;We share the frustrations of the vast majority of our customers who take pride in their local community and want to see an end to litter in their streets and parks.

&quot;That&apos;s why we send out daily litter patrols to help keep local areas clean and tidy and support a range of initiatives across Carmarthenshire.&quot;
