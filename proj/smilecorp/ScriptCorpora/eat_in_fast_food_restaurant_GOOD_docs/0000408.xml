 SANTA ANA (CBS) — Police on Monday sought the public’s help in finding two suspects in a burglary at an Anaheim fast food restaurant.

On November 22, 2011, at approximately 2:15 in the morning, two suspects broke into a Wienerschnitzel store located in the 2800 block of West La Palma Avenue.

An initial investigation suggested the suspects — who may have entered the restaurant through the drive-thru window — were inside the location long enough to remove the ATM machine using a pallet jack. 
Upon gaining entry, the suspects covered the surveillance cameras with napkins from inside the business.

Sometime during the burglary, a napkin fell from one of the surveillance cameras. As the suspect replaced the napkin, the camera was able to snap a close-up image.

The photographed suspect is described as a black male, 5’7″, medium build with black hair and mustache. He is seen wearing all-black clothing including gloves and a Dickies baseball cap.

The second suspect is described as a black male, also 5’7″, medium build, all-black clothing and gloves.

Anyone with information about this burglary or the identity of the suspects is asked to call Detective Chris Cooper at (714) 765-1185. Share this View Comments More Activity Facebook Activity What&apos;s this? Add to Timeline - What&apos;s This Click &quot;Add to Timeline&quot; to publish

 vick 
and you wonder why we don’t want their kind in the OC
 uhoh

The FBI and DEA fabricate evidence, steal from suspects and use murder to close bad cases.
The FBI and DEA where using corrupt police, gang members and mob to commit murders for them.
Kuklinski, Eppolito and Caracappa where doing their dirty work.
 Villaraigosa is a rat! 
That’s Daedae!
 Villaraigosa is a rat! 
Damn Mexicans! I know they are behind this!

I think the mexicans actually work there, unlike these lazy welfare recepients who would rather steal than work. As long as companies do drug testing prior to hiring these kind of people will never get jobs!

Blacks in the OC, how is that even possible? There’s only Oreos and Twinkies behind the Orange Curtain.

sounds like VICK is a snitch
