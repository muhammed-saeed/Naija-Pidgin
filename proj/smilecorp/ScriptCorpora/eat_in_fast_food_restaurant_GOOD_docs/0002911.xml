 One of the 
 things I get great pleasure from is hearing from all our&quot;extended 
 kitty families,&quot;about how our Abayomi kitties are doing. Below 
 is a sampling of letters and emails we have received over the years.

This first story is about a wonderful couple who were 
 so worried about shipping their kitten in cargo... so they decided 
 to fly up from California and bring him back as carry on.... MUST READ ON... it&apos;s HILARIOUS!!!!! 

 

Hi Tracy, Just had to share....

 TOP 10 REASONS&quot;NIGEL&quot;IS A TYPICAL 
 ABY 

1. He is very intelligent (see number 10).

2. He is people oriented (he is sitting right beside me on a box 
 covered with a soft towel).

3. He loooooves food.

4. uuuuuujjjhyyyy (he loves to use the computer - this is an example/he 
 just walked over the keyboard!)

5. He is very athletic (how does someone so fragile looking jump 
 so high?).

6. He is super affectionate (he&apos;s with me now and hasn&apos;t stopped 
 purring).

7. He loves to be in high places (even tho he&apos;s not allowed really 
 high).

8. He&apos;s full of mischief (also see number 10). He just came down 
 off his little box on my desk and licked me and then chewed on my 
 hand!

9. He is very beautiful (look at those photos you sent!).

10. I didn&apos;t tell you this until now -

 

About 5 minutes into the air, we got him out from 
 under the seat (still in the carrier) and put him on Marty&apos;s lap. 
 The flight attendant (MEAN) came by and said he had to remain under 
 the seat in front of us for the entire flight. We put the carrier 
 under the seat with the ventilation holes toward us so at least 
 he could see us (and the zipper/dragon side toward the front of 
 the plane). He mewed and mewed and we could see the sides of the 
 carrier bulging as he tried to get out. Finally he quieted down. 
 About 50 minutes into the flight - a man behind/across the aisle 
 tapped Marty on the shoulder and said (DEEP BREATH) - YOUR CAT JUST 
 RAN BY!!! WE WERE IN SHOCK - there was no way!!!! We picked up the 
 carrier - IT WAS EMPTY, and the zipper was partially down!!! Marty 
 jumped out of his seat (aisle) and started looking under the seats 
 behind us and went to tell the flight attendants - I jumped out 
 of my seat (window) and started looking under the seats directly 
 in front of us. THANK GOD, he was right there, the little rascal 
 - wandering innocently under people&apos;s feet!!!!

I THOUGHT WE WERE BOTH GOING TO GO INTO CARDIAC ARREST 
 FROM THE FRIGHT. We calmed down (he was fine) and put him back in 
 the carrier. Obviously, this time, we put the carrier with the zipper 
 side towards us and watched in amazement (and amusement, since all 
 was well) as he worked his little paw against the zipper until it 
 started to seperate and open a bit. We clasped the two horseshoes 
 together but we were really upset that this could happen. I am in 
 the process of writing to the company that made the carrier that 
 they need to add some way to secure that zipper!!!
NIGEL&apos;S GREAT ADVENTURE - OMG.

 


(Update) - Hi Tracy,

 Nigel 
 makes us laugh - he does what we call&quot;Halloween cat&quot;, 
 where they arch their back, put a fluffy tail over one side and 
 kind of go sideways? Anyway, he did this to Phoebe a number of times 
 and once he bounced right on top of her. They wrestled a bit but 
 Nigel would bounce back and go after her! HE IS SO INCREDIBLY CONFIDENT 
 AND BRAVE. This was beyond our wildest dreams - Nigel was trilling 
 all night long, I think he was so happy to have a friend! Now they 
 are separated again (so we can get some sleep) and Phoebe is trilling. 
 She even taught him a trick - we have a large ceramic pot/urn which 
 she jumped into - of course he thought that was great fun, so eventually 
 he jumped in and imitated her - one in the pot trying to surprise 
 the one outside of the pot! He kept sneaking up on her - once he 
 jumped right on her back (which put her out a bit but she got over 
 itPhoebe is with me right now and I swear she seems so happy. This 
 is exactly what we wanted - they can be buddies.

 

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR OUR WONDERFUL BABY AND FRIEND 
 FOR OUR FABULOUS PHOEBE. If we had a big house, I think I would 
 fly back to Vancouver and bring home an army of Abayomi kittens.

You are all such a great family, I am so glad we had a chance to 
 visit you in person!

Love from one (now bigger) happy family!

Hello Tracy!

Okay, I&apos;m pretty sure I got the crazy cat out of the litter. What 
 a nutcase Simon is turning out to be! A good nutcase though, don&apos;t 
 worry, I love him to death :-)

Today was a cleaning day for me, which means that Simon had a blast, 
 as usual. Simon is in LOVE with the vacuum cleaner. He likes to 
 ride or hang on to the power head while I vacuum, and he absolutely 
 looooves it when I suction him with the hose/tube part. He especially 
 likes it when I suction his face, and if I hold still he will put 
 his cheeks up the the nozzle himself. I can suction other parts 
 of him too but his favorite is definitely his chin and cheeks. I 
 really should get it on video, you&apos;d die laughing, lol!

 

Simon has recently discovered that we shower and he&apos;s decided that 
 that is just fascinating. We have a cloth shower curtain and a clear 
 liner, so Simon gets between them while we shower and he&quot;plays&quot;with us while we shower, pawing at us and the water. I usually have 
 Simon standing with his 2 front paws on me for about half the time 
 I&apos;m showering. I&apos;m not sure why he likes to lean on me like this, 
 but he seems to like it for some reason. He&apos;s also fallen into the 
 shower on many occasions, or been bumped in by one of the dogs (that&apos;s 
 always funny). He&apos;s not thrilled with the water but it certainly 
 doesn&apos;t scare him away.

Making the bed used to be fun when it was just my other cats in 
 the house, but now that Simon is here it&apos;s turned into an event, 
 lol! I&apos;m at one end trying to put a fitted sheet on, 2 Siamese cats 
 are trying to get under the sheet, and Simon is trying to take off 
 down the hall with the sheet, haha! He&apos;s a riot sometimes. Making 
 a bed takes forever in my house, haha!

Simon eats anything and everything I offer him, it&apos;s pretty impressive 
 actually. When I first got him I fed him wet cat food every day 
 on the kitchen counter. I still give him wet cat food (still on 
 the kitchen counter, lol) because I just don&apos;t have the heart to 
 completely break him of it. He gets so darn excited when you open 
 the&quot;magic cupboard&quot;, and he&apos;s almost ecstatic if he sees 
 you with a can that might be wet cat food. Besides, all the other 
 cats are trained like this now as well, lol!

 

Simon is really good with all the dogs. I&apos;m extra careful now 
 when I meet dogs for the first time because Simon has no fear of 
 strange dogs really. There is a Chihuahua that Simon likes to wrestle 
 with, and a Beagle that he really likes named Hailey. I dogsit Hailey 
 on a regular basis and Simon and Hailey usually race around the 
 house at mach 3, it&apos;s pretty funny (and sometimes dangerous for 
 me!) to see. Mostly though, Simons&apos; best buddy (besides me of course) 
 is Gabriel my 2 year old Seal Point Siamese. Simon has the cleanest 
 ears on the planet thanks to Gabe, haha! Gabe just loves grooming 
 Simon, and he really has a thing for Simons&apos; ears for some reason. 
 Simon just melts while Gabe pins him down for an ear washing, it&apos;s 
 pretty cute. Gabriel likes to bring toys to Simon now instead of 
 me, so I guess I&apos;ve been replaced, lol!

I just wanted to send you another update to let you know what kind 
 of cat Simon is turning out to be, and how much I love him. Yesterday 
 Simon knocked over my oatmeal, fell into the kitchen dish water 
 3 times, and got packing tape stuck to his head. All within 2 minutes. 
 Yep, never a dull moment :-) Simon is awesome, and I&apos;m really glad 
 that I finally decided to get an Abby. I&apos;m also really glad that 
 it turned out to be Simon. He&apos;s a wonderful cat and I wouldn&apos;t trade 
 him for the world!

Hi Tracy, 

Here&apos;s a story you will enjoy.

Yesterday we were returning home from our cabin and we had Indie 
 with us. She is a good little traveler and we never have any trouble 
 with her. Zoie has to stay home because she gets really carsick 
 and does not enjoy car trips.

We were driving a Dodge Dakata pick up and needed gas so we stopped 
 at a gas station. I jumped out without my coat or purse and ran 
 inside to use the rest room. I left my purse in the truck so that 
 I would not be tempted to buy any junk food.

My husband, Charlie got out leaving the keys inside the truck to 
 pump the gas. Indie decides to look out one of the side windows 
 and steps on the electric window lock which is on the arm rest. 
 I come out to find Indie locked in the truck and Charlie pacing 
 around. I tried to get her to step on the unlock button but she 
 just pawed at me through the window like I was playing.

So Charlie gets a screwdriver from the store clerk and prys the 
 sliding rear window open. It&apos;s a really small window and you couldn&apos;t 
 even fit your shoulders inside so I gave him a window squeegee to 
 reach in and unlock the door.

What a relief. I was picturing standing there with no coat for hours 
 while we waited for someone to come and help. Both cell phones were 
 also locked in the truck!

Indie is doing very well and is such a joy to have.

Hi Tracy, 


Edgar is going great! he is such a sweet kitty - almost 
 10 lbs now (!) he&apos;s going to be a big boy I think! His favorite 
 things are 1.Shadows 2. feathers 3. Food. He started this shadow 
 chasing thing about 3 months ago - we thought he&apos;d grow out of it, 
 but not so much. It&apos;s hysterical to watch - anytime there are shadows 
 (like of your feet for instance) he jumps all over the floor like 
 he&apos;s chasing a mouse.

He TOTALLY has a thing for feathers.....any kind. 
 My favorite is when he picks it up in his mouth and carries it around....sometimes 
 even growling at you because it&apos;s&quot;his.&quot;we have a door 
 to our basement area that is closed most times, and he shoves his 
 toys underneath it all the time....so it&apos;s always funny when we 
 first open the door, to see which toys are there....again, mostly 
 feathers and sparkle balls.


He eats EVERYTHING. if we are eating it, then he&apos;s 
 sure it would be good. especially if it&apos;s bread or cheese.......! 
 it&apos;s sometimes comical to watch Chris trying to eat a sandwich when 
 Edgar is pretty sure that he should have a bite. Or the whole sandwich......!

 

His new favorite toy is called&quot;undercover mouse&quot;- it&apos;s a ball, attached to a short pole under a round piece of fabric. 
 when you turn it on it whirls around, moving the fabric so he can 
 chase it. It&apos;s so funny to watch....he&apos;ll keep at it for HOURS if 
 you let him....he walks around and stalks it from different corners

My mom was down from Seattle this weekend and couldn&apos;t believe how 
 cute he was, and so friendly and well-socialized. It&apos;s a credit 
 to you and your family on how well-mannered he is, you can tell 
 he&apos;s been handled since he was small.

(Upade) - Hi Tracy,

I am always thinking about emailing you with stories 
 of our funny boy Edgar, but then I want to send pictures so I wait 
 and never do it. I finally just wrote the email. He is really turned 
 into quite a character, and has even gotten&quot;chatty&quot;with 
 us. Not as chatty as a siamese would be, but definitely chatty for 
 an aby I think!

 

His new favorite thing is to go for walks on a leash around the 
 neighborhood - I usually do it in the evening, as there aren&apos;t as 
 many people (and dogs!) out then. He has a walking jacket (similar 
 to the one I saw on Taiko on your webpage) and when I say&quot;want 
 to go outside&quot;he runs for the front door, meowing the whole 
 way. then he&apos;s usually so excited, I can hardly get the harness 
 on him! I pick him up, open the door, walk out and set him down 
 and BOOM! he&apos;s off like a flash (at least until he runs out of leash..!) 
 he is very speedy, my neighbor who has an old, slow black lab is 
 always impressed with his walking speed, and how well he minds while 
 you are walking. Better than most dogs really! His tail is hysterical, 
 it&apos;s held high in the air like a flag as he trots along. Sometimes 
 it even gets puffy, if a leaf blows by or he hears a dog bark.

He has really brought a lot of joy into our lives, we laugh at 
 him every single day - from rolling his cat-tent over, to carrying 
 feathers around, to hiding sparkle balls in our shoes. He always 
 wants to be wherever you are, and in the middle of everything you 
 are working on (or, attempting to work on!) He LOVES people in his 
 house, when the doorbell rings he runs towards the sidelight window 
 at top speed to see who it is!!!

Hi Tracy, 


We wanted to send you some new pictures of Ronin and 
 share with you just how much we adore him. We are absolutely hooked 
 on Abyssinians! He&apos;s so friendly and affectionate and just sweet 
 all over. A single touch turns his motor to high.
Every night as we go to sleep he comes up for a rubbing, then settles 
 in to sucking his tail in between us until he falls asleep. At some 
 point in the night he goes elsewhere, but about 4:00 he&apos;s back for 
 more rubbings, sucking and sleeping. Frank gets up a bit before 
 me, but every morning when I wake up, Ronin is still sound asleep, 
 tucked right in beside me.

He is so adorable - he loves to have his head rubbed, or his body 
 rubbed and is very tolerant of all the kisses I give him. Even if 
 it doesn&apos;t want to be held, that&apos;s just fine &apos;cause I can hug and 
 kiss him all I want, whatever he&apos;s doing.

 


His appetite is voracious and he&apos;ll eat anything he 
 can steal off the counter: cauliflower, pancakes, bread, yogurt 
 and of course a glass of milk is never safe without some sort of 
 cover on it. His table manners are as bad as always - it doesn&apos;t 
 bother us, but it keeps us on our toes while we&apos;re trying to eat.. 
 One day when I wasn&apos;t paying close attention, I turned around to 
 find several little chunks missing from a bun. HmmI wonder 
 how that happened? One good thing is I think he understands the 
 word&quot;hot&quot;because he keeps his distance from the pans 
 on the stove while he&apos;s investigating what I&apos;m doing in the kitchen. 


One the most entertaining events is in the mornings, 
 when the cats get some wet food as a treat. I think it&apos;s more of 
 a treat for us to watch Ronin perform for his food. He runs in circles 
 from his cathouse, to the kitchen table, through Frank&apos;s legs as 
 he&apos;s opening the can, through the dining room, back in the kitchen, 
 up on the table, to the cathouse, down to the floor, back up on 
 the table, through the legs, to the dining room, over and over again, 
 about 3 or 4 times.


Thanks again for giving us with wonderful creature 
 to brighten our lives!

 Hi 
 Tracy,

Thought wed check in and share some pictures 
 ofOzziewith you. As you can see, hes growing 
 up quickly.what a personality and such a little terror!

He looks very much like his father, Jafari, based on the pictures 
 you have on the website. Hes quite long-legged and his purr 
 is loud enough to hear in another room. Hes quite attached 
 to Melissa and his favorite toys are a tin foil ball, shoe string, 
 and a laundry basket. Hes also quite the lap catespecially 
 when hes tired. Apparently he didnt get thememothat Abys are not lap cats. J

Wishing you and your family a very Merry Christmas. May the new 
 year bring you peace, health and much love.

Happy Holidays,

 Hi 
 Tracy,

Jack and I are having such a happy time with little 
 girl, Chloe. She&apos;s just beginning to know her name, like at feeding 
 times and when bringing attention to toys, especially the feather 
 on a wand that can fit into a ball that spins it around. Of course, 
 she also like the small toy&quot;mousies&quot;and all types of 
 toy balls. I told Jack she smells like a sugar cookie--ginger snap. 
 This morning Eddy gave her&quot;kitty kisses&quot;and later licked 
 her ears. They ate lunch together. It was a joy to find them on 
 this pile of laundered clothes today, cuddled up next to each other 
 and later again near each other.

 

You did such a good job on the carrier, Tracy, installing 
 a water holder and the other extra strapping for safety. We have 
 another larger hard plastic carrier, but this new one is nicer. 
 I put a fitted pillow in when using them.

You were sure right about her being a real sweetie - and a champion 
 purrer! Thank you for being such a good first mommy to her.

 Hi 
 Tracy,

W hat a character Kosey is. Right now I am typing 
 with one hand because he is snuggled up with me.

I have to tell you about last night. I have been working 
 really hard on training him not to jump on the kitchen counters. 
 He just can&apos;t resist people food so I have to make sure that nothing 
 is left out. Fern had just dished up his supper and left the rice 
 on the counter (fortunately it had a lid on it). Anyway Kosey jumped 
 up and I scolded him and chased him off. 5 minutes later I look 
 up and he was flat on the counter, lol, I didn&apos;t think he could 
 lay that flat. Right next to the rice dish. Even his ears were flattened 
 down, lol. I wish I had snapped a picture because it was so plain 
 on his face he knew he was being bad. I am laughing just thinking 
 about it. I couldn&apos;t even scold him, I just put him in another room. 
 We were both laughing so hard. What a card he is. I have never had 
 a cat that had so much personality and such a strong will. I&apos;ll 
 send some pics soon as his whiskers are growing back and he looks 
 so cute.

 

You also would have laughed at him the other night. 
 He has discovered the wonderful world of toilet paper and occasionally 
 unrolls it while playing. Well I finally got a roll of paper towels 
 for the kitchen and couldnt fit it into the dispenser so it 
 was on the counter. He jumped up there and knocked it on the floor 
 and attacked. It is so hard to get mad at him when he is being so 
 cute, lol

 

(Update) Hi Tracy,

You wouldn&apos;t believe the difference in Kosey since 
 Alyssa came to visit. He has calmed right down. She had him running 
 for 3 or 4 hours. He has been sleeping since she went home, lol. 
 When her mom and dad came to pick her up they brought their Dachsund 
 (spelling) cross to visit too and Kosey and Bailey (the dog) chased 
 each other all night back and forth. He is worn out. I can&apos;t believe 
 the difference in him. Did him a world of good. I told Alyssa she 
 would have to come by more often so she can run down his little 
 battery a bit. He followed her around everywhere she went and she 
 was absolutely thrilled. Too funny.

I had to attach a few pictures. This is exactly what I had hoped 
 with the Abby kitten that my grandkids could enjoy him and he is 
 purrfect! Emily is very grateful too, lol.

 :Hello 
 Tracy ,

Happy New Year. I hope you and your family had a nice Christmas. 
 I thought I&apos;d send you these shots of Omari watching the program&quot;Parrots of Telegraph Hill&quot;. He loves watching TV and 
 often sits just below it watching whatever is on. On this particular 
 night he was determined to get those birds on the TV. He is hilarious!! 
 I love him to pieces and he is absolutely the most wonderful, loving 
 cat I have ever had. He and Benny (the 15 yr. Old Himy) are great 
 pals as well as his buddy Oliver. Everyone who meets him wants him 
 -- good luck with that. I have given your name to a couple of people 
 though should they decide they want an Abby.

Once again -- HAPPY NEW YEAR -- AND THANK YOU FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL 
 BOY!! HE CONTINUES TO AMAZE ME.

(Update) :Hi 
 Tracy ,


It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve sent you photos of Omari. 
 The attached weretaken on hisbirthday, November 8, 2009. As you 
 can see he loves to pose for his picture. He is such an amazing 
 cat!!!! He is a real lover and as you thought is truly a&quot;special&quot;cat. Of course he is very busy -- a trait of the breed but he also 
 likes to cuddle, lie on his back and have his tummy rubbed. Definitely 
 a head butter and loves to touch my face with his paws (claws always 
 in).

 

Even friends who dislike cats love him. My brother 
 who has never been a real cat lover adores him and calls him the&quot;Fast Cat&quot;as a nickname. Of course Omari loves everyone 
 so who could resist him?

Thank you so much for a wonderful cat!!!!

 Hi 
 Tracy

This is Kefis favourite toy. it has a long handle 
 that you hold and he chases and plays with the yellow mop end. its 
 hard to get a good photo of him with it as he moves so fast.

No matter where you are in the house upstairs or downstairs he 
 follows you and carries it around in his mouth and drops it at your 
 feet to play with him.

 

I took him to the vet for his final shots and the vet just cant 
 contain her excitement about him. She asked me If I minded that 
 she took some photos of him and then some video to take home and 
 show her children. She is so taken with him. He purrs at the vets 
 and even when she was trying to listen to his heart she couldnt 
 hear because he was purring. In six weeks he will have his neutering 
 done and they will fix his hernia. All the staff at the vets just 
 stop working to admire and ask questions about him. They all think 
 he is the best thing since sliced bread. He is so good in the car 
 on the ride there and back never meows... of course I bring an bag 
 of treats and he seems to get one at every stop light on the way.

 He 
 is so smart and funny. He has a new toy that one of Johns 
 customers... Martha is an older lady and an animal sitter... and 
 she bought a toy for Kefi and he loves it. Its a stick with 
 a long leopard furry tail ending in feathers and one holds the stick 
 and shakes it and it acts like a snakes movements and he tries to 
 catch the feathers at the end and when you get tired of playing 
 and do something else he picks it up in his mouth and drags it around 
 the house himself and has fun with it and then he brings it back 
 to you and drops it at your feet to play some more.

He is very intelligent. And he loves tummy rubs one 
 of the first cats I have had who is content to lie on his back in 
 your arms and let you rub his tummy, Purring all the time.

 

He continues daily to delight us and make us laugh 
 with his antics. He is just the most wonderful little boy and I 
 can see how hard it must have been to let him go.

 

I am so impressed with your breeding line and if I can... will 
 let anyone who asks...know about Abayomi and send them your web 
 address.

Hello Tracy,

Shinzo is growing at his rythm. One things I&apos;ve noticed that is 
 still true today: Shinzo sometimes thinks Medor is his mother and 
 just want to rest on his belly... the minute after, Shinzo is suddently 
 becoming a wild little creature - a vampire I should say! - and 
 stuck his teeth into Medor&apos;s neck. Medor doesn&apos;t feel anything but 
 is just like shocked: (like what is this guy doing to me??) then 
 the cat runs away... then the dog runs after him.

 

Some news about him: he&apos;s having a great time with Medor, no doubt 
 about it. He knows that the dog will not hurt him and he&apos;s becoming 
 very confident. I have to moderate them because they have the tendency 
 to copy each other, and not automatically for the best.

They both play the same game - fetching. No cat&apos;s toy, the dog 
 destroys them all. They also work together, and we need to keep 
 everything tidy: Cat goes on the table, play with everything until 
 it falls on the floor. The dog then grabs it and tears it to pieces... 
 Mark learned how NOT to leave his library card on the counter this 
 way!

Shinzo is delighted to have someone to play non-stop with him... 
 Medor knows he&apos;s bigger and he&apos;s paying attention (even if he can 
 also be a wild whippet sometimes too!) I&apos;m so glad they have almost 
 the same age.

 Here 
 are some interesting pics of shinzo getting trained on the toilet. 
 So far so good! Good thing with abys is that they are so curious 
 they are not afraid of the water (which is great).

I hope all your cats are doing well and that they are keeping 
 you smiling as shinzo does it for us!Thanks again for having raised 
 Shinzo for us. He&apos;s a great companion for Médor and they 
 love each other. They both have changed our lives. He catches the 
 heart of everyone who comes at our house.

 Hi 
 Tracy!

I thought I would send you a little update on my boy. First the 
 name...he never really responded much to Cairo and I think he liked 
 Ramses better (he purrs so loud when I call out Ramses), so needless 
 to say his name is now Ramses Cairo.

I bought him a great big kitty condo/scratching post and he loves 
 it! He actually drags this stuffed animal chicken inside it to snuggle 
 while he sleeps.

At night he jumps up on our bed and does his usual routine of attacking 
 our feet, then soon after that he burrows and pulls at my hair, 
 then snuggles in between my hubby and I and doesn&apos;t budge until 
 we get up in the morning. We did find out if you don&apos;t tire him 
 out just before bed he will attack the feet and hair a little longer 
 than a sleepy person would like:) He is SO snugly too!

I can&apos;t express how happy we are with Ramses! He has the most amazing 
 personality, and is SO beautiful. We have had lots of visitors and 
 he is so curious to meet them all! People are falling in love with 
 him at first sight! 

(Update) - Hi Tracy,

We are SO in love with this kitten, he is so amazing! He continues 
 to be an angel...he&apos;s not as destructive as I thought kittens could 
 be. He still sleeps with us every night and doesn&apos;t get up until 
 we do (all my friends with kids are VERY jealous;) He never leaves 
 my side, no matter what I&apos;m doing he is right there with me...including 
 the shower! He loves running up and down the edge of the tub during 
 a shower....and yes he does fall in once in a while;)

I have also trained him to use the toilet! He is so smart! He was 
 doing his business in the toilet in less than 2 weeks!! I bought 
 the&quot;litter kwitter&quot;device and it works like a charm! 
 The odd time his back leg slips into the water, but I just rinse 
 it off for him:) I&apos;ll get you some pictures soon for you to see 
 how big he is! I&apos;m sure he has doubled in size since we got him!

 

Thanks again for the most amazing kitty! Hope yours are all doing 
 well!

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

Minka is a much-loved feline Enemy of Civilization -- like our 
 9 year-old she has two speeds -- flat out or sound asleep.

She terrorizes potted plants, savages shoes and growls fiercely 
 if ever she gets hold of a piece of ham, but never bites hard when 
 playing...

She also thinks she is a parrot -- spending a lot of time perched 
 on my
shoulder - and only really likes drinking out of a running

 Hi 
 Tracy

We just went sailing for three days. The first day was little rough 
 for her but she is really catching on to life on the boat. While 
 at anchor she ran all over chasing all the lines. She sleeps with 
 us every night, it is quite hilarious, we are like new parents!

Dennis has never had a pet or kids and is spoiling her with love 
 and attention... she sits right on his keyboard when he has to work 
 and he works around her...

Hi Tracy,

Our neighbour took some pictures of rudder I thought I would pass 
 one along. It is spectacular! She is doing so well and we are in 
 cat love, both Dennis and I are like silly new parents. She has 
 gone into the drink 4 times now... sigh all on Dennis&apos;s watch. However 
 the&quot;rudder return&quot;equipment we put together worked beautifully. 
 It is a fish net on a long pole.

Dennis has built 4 little ramps with wall to wall carpet and installed 
 them all around the boat in the event she goes in unannounced. She 
 is a very good swimmer and loves to play on deck with the ropes/lines 
 pools of water etc. She has learned not to leave the boat and continues 
 to be as affectionate as ever. She runs to the bow of the boat anytime 
 someone goes by so she can visit them.

Should you ever find yourself down our way...sight seeing, please 
 call and drop by if only for a few minutes to see her in her environment. 
 Our boat is close to the sea wall and she gives all the wall walkers 
 a show.

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

Well this is just‘the-bestest-kitten’!…He is 
 sooo affectionate and as much of a purr-monster as you promised.

The‘pet taxi’is impressive…he seems as comfortable 
 as ever although no doubt feeling uncertain and displaced from all 
 that was familiar and comfortable. .

 . 
 Thanks also for the kitten pack of food–I did get to the 
 store and bought the recommended food and litter but it was lovely 
 to receive your gift packet.

So without further adieu, I will say“Bye”for now 
 and attach a few of the photos which I have taken. Thanks again 
 Tracy, he is beautiful–coat and eyes and so very well socialized. 
 I will stay in touch….

Take care and all the best to your family.

 Good 
 morning Tracy,

We have been meaning to drop you a line for a while now. Bentley 
 is doing great!! He&apos;s got the best vertical we&apos;ve ever seen, sometimes 
 jumping near 5 feet to chase a shadow on the wall. He is a persistent 
 little boy, and trying to keep him off the counter is a work in 
 progress. Everybody that sees him falls right in love with him, 
 and he likes to carry his favourite toy (a fish on a line - stick 
 dragging!) to whomever he thinks wants to play with him. What a 
 character!

 


We got him neutered a few weeks ago and the vet assistant claimed 
 he would be pretty mundane that night, but NO! he was right back 
 to his normal self, although I think he may be more vocal since 
 then...
Thank you so much for providing us with an amazing animal! We&apos;ll 
 keep you posted and send you some more pictures soon! .

 Hi 
 Tracy..This is Joan, 

 You forgot to tell us about Abyssinians&quot;training 
 people&quot; .....most people train their cat and that 
 is what you expect to do.....not so with Jetz ,he is training us 
 ....He prefers to drink from the sink in the upstairs bathroom,and 
 since we are not usually there&quot;on que&quot;for him, he will 
 attack the hanging toilet roll thereby making lots of noise(not 
 a squeak out of him tho) and you rush to the stairs to&quot;Save&quot;the paper from shredding, before you even get up two steps he steps 
 into the sink with his front feet and looks at you with a&quot;what 
 took you so long?, turn it on please,cat needs a drink&quot;...Believe 
 me I thought the the first time was a accident but after 5 times 
 of this -its no accident,this boy learns fast! 


Also he has tried impersonating a skunk,tho with green stripes....I 
 was painting shelving in the basement ,it was done but still wet 
 underneath ...well you know how cats like to raise their back when 
 you talk to them ,that was not the time to do it when he was walking 
 under that ....all the way from his head to his tail lovely green 
 stripes....now ruddy colour doesn&apos;t go well with green paint,and 
 he was not a happy camper when I got through with him...he prefers 
 to choose the water he will play in .......But Jettie is learning 
 to walk on a leash and stands really still at the door when he knows 
 its the only way he will get out .....that is about the only time 
 he stands still ...He loves it on the farm in New Brunswick when 
 I go over there as he gets to run outside (with a leash) so in the 
 Spring we will be doing that ...he caught his first mouse there 
 and for the rest of the day I couldn&apos;t get him away from the furnace 
 grate ..So thank you for the cat of a different nature and he is 
 really quite affectionate and has learned to give lots of&quot;hollywood 
 kisses&quot;especially when chicken is nearby or the fridge door 
 opens ,our little boy is lots of fun and really loves to play

...I keep telling people he is half dog and half cat but its a 
 good combination ...You done good!!

 Hello 
 Tracy,

Bellen is a real character. Everyone tells me if he disappears he 
 will be at their house. Not to mention the constant amazement of 
 how high he can jump. He is most definitely my cat, or I am his 
 human. He sleeps with me, hangs out with me. Comes running when 
 I come home.

When I open the cat food can he stairs at me and runs around my 
 feet. When I go to set the bowl down in it&apos;s space he stands there 
 watching me with his tail straight up and twitching. 


He finds computer time means being in my lap, on the back of the 
 chair watching me, or sitting in front of the screen.He is sitting 
 in front of the
screen right now. It&apos;s really hard to type around a cat.

He really likes the printer though, it moves, makes noises, and 
 has that really tasty
paper.

I can&apos;t imagine not having him around and am so glad he came to 
 me.

Thank you again.

 Hi 
 Tracy,

I hope you enjoy the photos. Thank you so much for our blue boy,
Benz. We love him to death already. And as you can see, our
other big baby Dre loves him too. I am so surprised that they are
getting along so well so soon. Dre grooms Benz every chance he gets.
Benz has been providing us nonstop entertainment. He is so curious
about everything and goes turbo speed until he crashes and cuddles
up. Mind you, some serious head-butting, rolling around and
face-licking have to take place before he will actually settle down
for a nap. He&apos;s a riot! And boy does he love to eat. He gets
quite demanding when he knows I&apos;m in the kitchen getting food
ready. All in all, he is beautiful and a pleasure to have in our
family.

 

You&apos;ve been so great to deal with and we&apos;re completely happy! The 
 wait was well worth it! Thanks again Tracy!

Hi Tracy,

I haven&apos;t emailed in awhile and just wanted to let you know that 
 Benz is amazing and awesome! Both Josh and I get the biggest kick 
 out of him. When he&apos;s in the mood for love and affection, look out. 
 I have never experienced such intense head-butting in my life! 

He is active and playful and curious and just so much fun to watch 
 and interact with. And he and Dre would be lost without each other. 
 They still sleep together and groom each other. And although it 
 seems to be lessening as Benz gets older, he still kneads and sucks 
 on Dre from time to time. Dre tolerates it like any parent would. 
 They keep each other well amused and tear around the house, taking 
 turns chasing each other and wrestling. I&apos;ve attached a couple photos 
 so you can see how he has grown. I can hardly believe that he is 
 10 months old now. Hope all is well with you and your family (both 
 humans and Abbys) and a big thank you again for our mischief maker.

 Hi 
 Tracy,

Well, Willow comes up with new things to do and try every day. 
 She likes to run at the wall and then jump like she’s trying 
 to climb it (spider kitty?), of course there’s no where to 
 go after she jumps so she just kind of thumps back to the ground.

Willow’s new favorite perch is on someone’s shoulder- 
 if you pick her up, she scrambles up to your shoulder to hang out 
 for a while. She has also figured out how to get up to the cabinets 
 over the fridge and stove- which isn’t surprising and was 
 really only a matter of time- as she loves to be up high and is 
 a clever kitty! We’ve tried her out on a harness and leash- 
 which she hated, but she really wanted to go check out the snow- 
 which she loved! She would scoop up some snow with her paw so it 
 turned into a little ball, then batted it around and would run like 
 crazy after it (with me trying to keep up to her holding the leash 
 so she wouldn’t reach the end of the leash and spring back!). 
 She was so cute out there- but only lasted a few minutes before 
 she got cold!

Oh yah- she plays hockey with my son Max! We have an open design 
 where the kitchen runs into the dining area and then into the living 
 room where Max can take his mini hockey stick and small rubber ball, 
 and runs back and forth hitting the ball with the stick and then 
 chases after. Well, Willow gets right in on the action and runs 
 back and forth with him trying to get the ball away. She definitely 
 keeps us entertained!

Willow has quite the personality- very entertaining but cuddly 
 and sweet too!

 She 
 loves to jump and can get up on the counters- and doesn’t 
 seem to care if we squirt her with water to discourage that behaviour! 
 Speaking of water- I had to give her a bath (we won’t talk 
 about the not flushed toilet that she jumped into requiring the 
 bath!), she just sat there and let me get her wet and lather her 
 up and rinse her of with barely a squirm! She also likes to play 
 with the water if you turn on a little stream in the tub- she’ll 
 bat at it and have a drink. Oh- she loves the toilet paper rolls- 
 she reaches up and wraps both paws around the roll on the wall and 
 hangs there with her back paws off the floor until it starts to 
 unroll. Then, she slides back down to the ground and has toilet 
 paper to play with!

At night she curls up on our bed with us , sometimes snuggling 
 into my neck and shoulder where she’ll purr and lick at me, 
 and sometimes knead into my skin. Willow is turning into a very 
 beautiful cat, I love her coloring, and she is growing so quickly. 
 She loves having the backs of her ears rubbed, and along the bridge 
 of her nose- she just closes her eyes and purrs! She enjoys being 
 around people- when someone is home she is right there with you, 
 and will follow from room to room, and up and down the stairs. Well, 
 I think that is all for now- we’ll keep you up to date with 
 all her antics!

 Hi 
 Tracy,

I&apos;m just emailing to give you a photo update on Cairo, who just
turned one year old the beginning of October. His health is great 
 and
he weighed in at 10.4 lbs at the vets. Most importantly, he is a
treasured member of our small household and the perfect pal and 
 room mate for me.

My daughter (Ava 11yrs) is completely in love with him, and has 
 been since they first met at the Air Cargo terminal at Pearson
International last December.

Thanks again Tracy, it has been a real pleasure dealing with you.
Your commitment to your cats is exceptional and I won&apos;t hesitate 
 to
recommend you to others who may be interested. Who knows, maybe 
 Ava
and I will be looking for a playmate for Cairo some time?

Anyway, I hope this finds you and your family doing well and still
happily bringing Abys into the world to spread their unique brand 
 of joy.

 Hi 
 Tracy,

I actually meant to send you a letter with the card but due to 
 my computer deficiencies I neglected to attach it. I have so much 
 to tell you about Tosca but it would never fit into a letter.

She is a very special cat. She is so big now but still miniature 
 in a way. Very sleek and her coloring is so striking. There are 
 so many endearing things that she does like, sleeping with us 
 every night, ever since the first night. It&apos;s so cute she chases 
 her tail and then sits on it and sucks on the end and kneads her 
 paws. It is quite a phenomenon. I&apos;ve never seen a cat do this 
 before. She seems to enjoy it very much, like she is suckling.

She is also quite the little eater. She has the most voracious 
 appetite and even though she has free range of dry crunchies all 
 the time she absolutely demands Wellness Healthy Indulgence pouches. 
 She eats two pouches a day and seems to enjoy breakfast at the 
 crack of dawn. About 5:30 AM. Ben has grown accustomed to her 
 morning purring, prodding, and bites when her morning feeding 
 is due.

She is fearless and social too. Everyone who has visited or dropped 
 by is melted by her personality and spunk. She really loves people 
 and is not shy at all. My brother lived here and took care of 
 her for a whole week in the summer and there were no problems 
 at all. She actually groomed his head every morning. (He&apos;s balding!)

I hope all is well with you and yours.

I will definitely keep in contact. These cats are addictive. If 
 only I had a ranch. I could have one in every color!

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

Wow, she is growing so fast. I have attached some photos for 
 you to see. One of her in the duvet is when she managed to hop 
 on the bed, put her foot in my coffee cup, and cause me to do 
 another load of laundry. So she then decided to play in the 
 duvet when the cover was in the wash. She is full of energy 
 and loves to explore. Here are her top 5 places to go:

...In the sink
...Up my legs when wearing capris (ouch! did I mention it hurts)
...On the laptop or computer when I am typing
...In the stereo system cabinet
...On the counters when I am making biscotti’s

So overall, she is a handful, but a great one.

When she is not waking me up between 5-6 am, she is very cuddly 
 or racing around the house wanting to play. She is eating well 
 and her fluffy kitten fur is disappearing, showing a great peachy 
 and gray coat. Everyone loves her and she just loves to rub 
 noses...ok, and sometimes bite noses, but we are learning about 
 that.

So overall she is doing great, she runs the place, is growing 
 like a weed and is a happy kitten. I will send more photos soon. 
 Thanks again for such a wonderful addition to the home. Cheers!

Hi Tracy,

Our little blue kitten has a name, Happy! We think this name 
 suits him
because as soon as you even touch or look at him he rolls out 
 his
purrrrr and he looks as if he has a smile.

EveryWhere and Happy are best brothers! They are always together,
following each other and Happy does likes to&quot;copy cat&quot;EveryWhere.
So cute. It is so nice to see them both greet us at the door 
 when we
come home. And boy do they like to play!

It has been almost 2 weeks and we are thrilled to see them 
 both get
along. Oh Happy is such a nice cat!

Thank you for everything!

All the Best to You and Your Family,

 Hi 
 Tracy, I hope you are doing well!

I have taken this picture of Tazu. She IS a kitchen kitty. 
 This time, she slept on the stove, which was heating (I was 
 planning to make cookies). And guess what she stole in my dinner 
 plate yesterday??? An asparagus chunk! She ate it all!

My other female prefers bread. We have to lock it away. She 
 even goes into the pantry to chew off the bread plastic packaging. 
 Then she bites the crust…

These Abys are SOOOOOO greedy!

Have a nice weekend!

 Tracy, 

 We named our boy Keito. My oldest daughter is in a Japanese immersion school and she liked the name. We kind of like the reference to the“Cato”in the Pink Panther movies. You know, Peter Seller’s man-servant Cato that used to jump him at inappropriate times? Well he’s been jumping Mani but Mani is handling it pretty well. And YES he is keeping us busy. We just adore him. He is a love and so gorgeous. He has made himself right at home and has a favorite place to sit on the back of the couch. We can&apos;t get over how adorable he is. He is VERY playful and loves being carried around. He has really brought a lot of joy to our family. 

 Many, many, thanks,

 Hi Tracy, 
 
 Boy 
 is this kitten cute! . She is so delicate looking and utterly 
 fearless. She was not even nervous in the car. As soon as I 
 let her of the kennel she was my pal. She climbed right up my 
 arm and started kissing and head butting most of the way home. 
 She does this all of the time to both my husband and I and we 
 are just amazed at how affectionate she is. We thought that 
 she would be really tired but she seems to have boundless energy 
 and just runs and plays until she finally takes a nap. I bought 
 all new toys for the new kitty so that they wouldn&apos;t smell like 
 any other cat but she found Kali&apos;s stash of mice today and went 
 nuts going inside and getting them one by one. Our living room 
 looks like a disaster area! Thanks 
 for all of the care you took with her. I can really tell that 
 she has been raised with love. She follows me everywhere and 
 if I get out of her sight she calls to me. 
   Several months later, another email :-)... 
 I just 
 wanted to let you know how happy we are with our new 
 kitty whose name is now Zoie. I can&apos;t believe how cute and 
 well behaved she is. We took her to the cabin over Thanksgiving 
 and she had a great time. She is a fabulous traveler and either 
 sleeps or just sits on my lap the entire trip which is 2 1/2 
 hrs. She really liked the cabin and loved looking out 
 of the windows. Thanks 
 again!

 Hello 
 Tracy 
 Just to let you know that Jaluka - or affectionately Jukie, Juju or Luka is doing well. Tamsyn loves him. She absolutely squealed with delight when I brought him home. He settled in nicely, is eating like he knows no tomorrow, you were right - he likes to sleep with Tamsyn or us. He is exceptionally affectionate and likes to &quot;kiss&quot; us all the time. He sits up on his back legs and puts his his front paws on your face and kisses you - its so cute - He is so used to being carried around now - he jumps up into your arms to go for a ride. I understand now what you said about water - he has fallen into the sink - while I was doing some cleaning and has fallen into the bathtub - while my daughter was in it. We&apos;re all being good about trying to keep him out of harms way. 
 Thank 
 you again!   Lyn

 Hi Tracy 

 Eanie is doing great, love her to death. My children keep saying if she was one of them I would have a delinquent on my hands as she is sooo spoilt. I could not have asked for a better pet she is with me all the time with her nose and paws to see what I am up to. I am starting to put my food down a little so no she is not to crazy she is beginning to know when I say enough that I mean it, very very cleaver little cat and learns really fast. Christmas tree of course was put up just for her and she is in it every day re-arranging the decorations, 

 I have just 
 taken some pics of her for you, I am trying to pack a box of goodies 
 to send to my family in SA and all started out neat and tidy but 
 of course nothing in this house can be done without a bit of help 
 and supervision from a 4 pawed monster. She is tearing around 
 like a loony and has me in fits of laughter, keep telling her 
 she will end up in the box and get shipped to South Africa but 
 that ain&apos;t going to stop her. 

 Hubby that 
 was not to sure that another cat was a good idea is the one she 
 really worked her charm on and he is totally enamored by her!My 
 other cat is treating her as though it is her kitten until she 
 tried to suckle from her then she get a swat over the ear, she 
 followed the older cat everywhere and they generally cuddle together 
 when it is sleep time..

 Hi Tracy , 

 We received Sidney&apos;s registration ... filled it out and sent it on its way. He is quite the show-off and loves it when visitors arrive. I think he would have made a handsome showy cat. His coat is turning a rich deep red and he is softer than a Chinchilla. This is our remarkable Abyssinian kitten who fetches wine corks! We find them in the morning on the floor at the bottom of our bed and lined up like little torpedoes! I entered him in the Petcetra picture of the month contest but have not heard anything yet. (He was giving Julian Computer lessons.)

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

Just a note to say that Baxter is doing really well. I have 
 attached a picture of her, in her usual state, of play, attacking, 
 and any other dynamic situation she finds herself in. She 
 has taken a keen liking to the plush toy lobster you see in 
 the photo, something to wrestle with.She is just a powerhouse 
 of energy, always jumping as high as she can get, nothing 
 is free from her reach. As she is still a kitten (at least 
 I try to explain her behavior away with that excuse), we are 
 learning how not to jump up on me from behind, claws out, 
 attaching herself to the small of my back, trying to get my 
 attention and wanting more play time. I assume she will grow 
 out of this (wink) or I will have to toughen up!

Her coat is just gorgeous, the peach underneath is so beautiful 
 and her top coat is coming in nicely. She has a habit of sucking 
 her tail in the morning as she is cuddled up next to me. And 
 of course she manages to hog the bed, always wanting to sleep 
 in the centre at the top, and telling me when it is time to 
 wake up by walking on my face. But so cute she is, it is hard 
 to be upset. She is currently sitting between me and the back 
 of my computer chair, always trying to get involved.

So thanks again for such a wonderful kitten, she has taken 
 over the household but I am very happy. Hope you are having 
 a good fall despite the weather. I saw your new kittens on 
 the site, so cute!!! Take care, Penny and Bax.

 Hi Tracy, 

 We&apos;d be delighted to tell anyone how delighted we are with our kittens and how pleasant it was dealing with you. 

 The boys 
 are doing great, although they do not approve of an all kibble 
 diet. (We quit with the canned food about 2 weeks ago, and they 
 still hope we will relent.) Our Buster never ate canned food 
 and showed no interest in people food except for occasionally 
 licking the butter. These guys are on a mission to find better 
 eats. About once a day, I catch one with his head down the disposal 
 checking to see if there is anything interesting. 

 I&apos;m 
 so happy we have them both. Leo is gorgeous (they have both 
 doubled in size now) but unclear on how to be lovable. When 
 he decides it&apos;s time, he&apos;ll climb my chest, roll around, rub 
 my face, etc.. Max will sleep on Andy&apos;s chest and purr for 30 
 minutes at a time. He is very sweet. We love them both. 

 They have 
 the run of the house now, except for the sewing room, and are 
 getting along well with Sadie. Now that they are big enough 
 that we don&apos;t worry about her stepping on them, we can relax 
 and enjoy the interaction. They definitely like her tail and 
 are very tolerant of her nuzzling them. I think it will work 
 out well. 

 I 
 saw a sign at the pet store: Dogs have owners; cats have 
 staff...The staff are enjoying themselves.

 Hi

 All is well here. Kayli is growing slowly and is very lively, affectionate and happy. 

 

 Her colouring is much more ticked now. Beautiful coat! 

 

 Getting along well with Mochi. The two just race around here.

 Hi Tracy, 

 Yes, Bella is just beautiful and we love her dearly. And, yes, she is crazy as a loon. She runs full-tilt around the house and loves to jump onto, under and over everything in sight. She is a very affectionate cat but is not always too tolerant of visitors to her house! She, of course, loves the Christmas tree - even to the extent of climbing it periodically!

 Hi 
 Tracy,

I know that you are still in Kelowna at this time but I am 
 just so excited to report to you that Rusty is doing fine. First 
 things first, when we left your place I took him out of the 
 bag and he just stayed in my arms and chest the entire time 
 until it was time to leave for the airport. He did okay with 
 the flight, had the tiniest meow at times but generally was 
 pretty calm the whole time.
He is just one adorable, frisky and affectionate purring machine. 
 Total opposite of Mickey. Mickey is so cool and calm. My husband 
 was so amazed he calls Rusty fast forward while Mickey is slow 
 motion. Mickey, on the other hand has been such a very good 
 cat. He has not shown any agression towards Rusty from the get 
 go. He just followed Rusty everywhere he went. Mickey looks 
 like he is baby sitting Rusty.

A few weeks later...
Rusty and Mickey are already the best of friends now. They chase 
 each other and play a lot now. Although Rusty tends to favor 
 human company more. Mickey has remained gentle with Rusty. There 
 are times when I see Mickey wanting to pounce at Rusty or slap 
 him when he is being naughty but he just doesn&apos;t. Also, Mickey 
 tends to groom Rusty - licking him everywhere like he&apos;s the 
 mom. Is that normal? Never seen that before.
I will send you photos once he is a little bit older.

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

 Zippy&amp;Cricket love Indie in their own different ways. Cricket 
 likes to chase her about once a day&amp;always stops if 
 yells or turns on her. Cricket is very gentle. Zippy on the 
 other hand, would like her from head to toe. Indie doesn&apos;t 
 seem to mind most of the time. And when the puppies are sleeping, 
 it&apos;s Zippy she likes to pounce on&amp;bite. And it&apos;s Zippy 
 she likes to sleep beside (if she&apos;s not on my neck that is). 
 I think her&amp;Zippy are two of a kind. They both know 
 what they want&amp;that they want it right now. I like to 
 see her out smart Zippy&amp;have him looking&amp;looking 
 for her, while she&apos;s standing right behind him. Zippy&apos;s latest 
 thing is barking non stop when one of the kittens have a poop&amp;he barks till I clean it out of the litter. I hope he 
 will knock it off soon. Indie has learned how to get up on 
 the kitchen counter. She&apos;s too little to jump all the way, 
 so she goes to the stove&amp;jumps up&amp;then grabs the 
 over door handle&amp;pulls herself up. She&apos;s done it about 
 a dozen times now. Very smart. Cricket&amp;Twiggy are both 
 more lady like, although Twiggy is still a kitten&amp;she 
 really likes to play with Indie. Twiggy is very quiet compared 
 to Indie, who loves to talk&amp;squeak (she sounds like 
 a wookie from Star Wars). Twiggy is so quiet that I&apos;ve locked 
 her in rooms&amp;cupboards numerous times, only to go searching 
 for her. The last time I thought she must be in the fridge 
 cause I couldn&apos;t find her anywhere and she never meows. Now 
 if Indie was locked in somewhere, she will squeak&amp;squeak 
 till the cows come home. What a family.
Well, I&apos;ve rattled on enough (I occasionally try to think 
 that I won&apos;t talk about my furry kids for one day&amp;give 
 my friends a break, but I haven&apos;t been able to do it yet). 
 Talk to you later.
Here is a photo of Indie stealing a cherry&amp;carrying 
 it around by the stem (no, she didn&apos;t want to eat it).

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

 Sorry 
 that it has taken me so long to send you pictures of Jasmine. 
 Anyway, she has settled right in and is now running the household. 
 She has completed her series of vaccinations and will be going 
 in for her spaying soon. Hope this reassures you that she 
 has come to a good home. 

 Take 
 care!

 Hi 
 Tracy

Just thought I would drop you a line and send you a few pictures 
 of our darling Phoebe. She is so amazing and surprises us 
 with something new every day. She loves to play fetch and 
 will play till your arm falls off. Her favourite things to 
 fetch are the little foam golf balls (helps Dad with his putting 
 practice), hair ties, and make up sponges, the last item she 
 steals from the bathroom, it is hilarious.

I took her in to be spayed and everything went really well. 
 She had her check up appointment today to make sure that all 
 was well and our vet said that it looks perfect. She was such 
 a good girl. He was quite taken with her and said she was 
 the most exquisite little kitten he had ever seen. He just 
 fell in love with her as did all the girls in the office.

Well, I should go for now, Phoebe and I have a snuggle date 
 in front of the tv, she sits beside me in the chair and loves 
 to watch hockey or golf.

 Hi 
 Tracy!

Hope all is well with you and your family. I just wanted to 
 touch base and let you know that Lexi is doing just wonderful. 
 She loves to lay by the fireplace in all kinds of contorted 
 ways... warming every part of her body. Benson just rolls 
 his eyes at her.

She also has her favorite windows basket to watch the birdies. 
 She was a little angry at Tracy for waking her up to take 
 the photo :)

Anything new with you ?

 Hi 
 Tracy! 

He&apos;s funny all the time. I call him my flying Aby--I can&apos;t 
 believe how high he can jump! He was really funny at one of 
 the cat shows--one of the judges made a joke out of it, and 
 later said he was a brat (to me). Actually, I&apos;m thinking that 
 wasn&apos;t exactly a good thing, but I like him that way :)
And yes, he is still a little purr-box. We just love him.
He also wakes me up by purring if he thinks I am sleeping 
 in too long :)! He&apos;s the best--an absolute love bug. Hope 
 all is well with you and yours!

 Hi 
 Tracy

All is well with our new baby. He is a bundle of joy. Once 
 he is awake look out.
However I do get the privilege of him sleeping under the covers 
 next to me in the evening and lots of cuddles and a face exfoliation 
 in the morning. He gets along great with our 4 year old cat. 
 ( he is totally fearless)
I can&apos;t believe it we finally have a name. Because he is fearless 
 brave and handsome we called him&quot;Titas&quot;.
He gets along wonderfully in our home.
When he slows down enough... I&apos;ll send pictures.

 

 

We love him.... Thanks Tracy!

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

 Well 
 we&apos;ve finally named the baby. His name is Fig (suggested by 
 a friend as he saw&quot;Fig the Pig&quot;inhale his dinner). 
 He&apos;s also known as Fig Newton, Mr Figglesworth and Wiggy Figgy. 
 We can&apos;t get over what a funny crybaby he is when he wants 
 to be fed...and how persistent he is when he spots human food. 
 We even have to hide our chocolate cake and tea as he&apos;s fond 
 of both! He had a nice swim in the bathtub today. He jumped 
 in the other day when the water was draining and I thought 
 that was funny. According to Jesse he did a full on cannonball 
 into the drink this morning and swam around for a wee bit. 
 As you can see from the attached pictures, Cielo has now adapted 
 to having Fig around. Bubby still licks him every chance he 
 can get. Thanks for our little nutter..we love him.

 Hi 
 Tracy, 

 I 
 thought you would want to know how Asia was after her day 
 of traveling, a new house, new voices so much strangeness.
She&apos;s a pro!! She shot out of the carrying cage as if from 
 a canon. In ten minutes she had toured the house and every 
 corner, ledge and crevice all at this whirlwind pace.&quot;What 
 is THIS&quot;, I wondered.
Well, after the whirlwind tour she settled down to a more 
 leisurely exploration which gave way to~ what have you got 
 to amuse me? Play time I think it&apos;s called.
And now , tonight she seems relaxed curled up on the chair 
 beside me perhaps ready to sleep.
I am enchanted . . delighted . . so very happy to have her.
I shall stay in touch and I hope you will visit the next time 
 you are over. I&apos;m about 7 minutes from the ferry.
For now, much gratitude for Asia, blessings to you,

 Hi 
 Tracy. 
 
I hope everything is well with you. Our Kitty is doing 
 great by the way. Her official name is Cleopatra, but we 
 call her Squiggly most of the time. She&apos;s always squirming 
 around the houe doing her patrols, plays fetch with just 
 about anything that&apos;ll fit in her mouth and loves our company. 
 I attached a couple of pics for you.

 Hi

I thought I&apos;d send you a few photos of CynMin. He is 
 doing great!

He is definitely the happiest cat I&apos;ve ever had. He regularly 
 goes on little rampages of loving, purring and face rubbing. 
 Min and Max are getting along famously as you can definitely 
 tell by the pictures.

Cheers!

 Hi 
 Tracy,

 Jalabert 
 is SO wonderful and feels like he has been in our home 
 forever, we love him so much!!! He is the sweetest most 
 affectionate and playful cat. With our twins toys around 
 he is never wanting for anything to play with! He has 
 adopted a couple of the very small stuffed animals, and 
 to see him walking around with a miniature lion in his 
 mouth is too much. He is really growing fast! 

He is so affectionate and is so full of 
 purrs.

Your friend, Susan

 Tracy, 

Romeo is certainly my baby. Every night he nestles 
 into my neck, licks my face and pushed his rump against 
 my husband until I can&apos;t stand it anymore and have 
 to lock him out of the bedroom. He was neutered last 
 month and everything went well. He is so loved in 
 our house and I&apos;m so glad I found the breed.

I thought you might like to see a picture of my little 
 boy with his lovely little toes.
We have called him Romeo because he is such a lover.
I can&apos;t begin to tell you what a joy he is. Our family 
 adores him.

Enjoy the picture.

 Hi 
 Tracy.
 
The kittens arrived in great form and ready to party!
The fawn is a real party
girl and the ruddy more of a lap cuddler but for the 
 most part, both are full of fun, curiosity, mischief, 
 purrs and more mischief. Julia says they were well 
 chosen as a pair and complement each other well. Kitten 
 proofing the house is a continuous ongoing affair. 
 It is slowly being stripped of all it&apos;s large beautiful 
 plants and interesting little (breakable) art and 
 glass items which simply makes everything else game 
 for fun. They are finding places to squeeze into and 
 explore that we didn&apos;t even know existed! It&apos;s tricky 
 to get photos but here&apos;s a couple.

Julia has named them Sadie and Lula.

Kind regards.

 Hi 
 Tracy,
 
Just wanted to give you an update on my little 
 boy, also known as, the Hurricane. Wow!! What a 
 personality! When I took him for his booster shots 
 the vet described him as one of the most&quot;intense&quot;cats she has ever seen. He&apos;s just so busy! I&apos;d call 
 him nosy but it&apos;s more curiosity. He isn&apos;t really 
 afraid of anything, just very intrigued. Everything 
 is a new discovery for him and his reaction is so 
 different for everything.

He has three favorite toys and believe it or not, 
 none of them cost me a dime. The toy he plays with 
 the most is his tail. It&apos;s so long and if you watch 
 it, it almost seems like it has a mind of it&apos;s own. 
 It&apos;s hilarious watching him because he&apos;s so excited, 
 he&apos;ll do flips to try and catch it. His second favorite 
 is this gigantic bag I got from the Sony Store. 
 It&apos;s stiff so he can&apos;t get trapped in it but what 
 he does is dive into it and sends it and himself 
 flying across the carpet. And his third favorite 
 is my roommate&apos;s cat, Polo. He&apos;s constantly chasing 
 Polo around the house, making him mad. The more 
 ticked off Polo is, the more fun Irkyn&apos;s having!

He likes to headbutt and is constantly trying to 
 catch me off guard so he can nibble on my earrings. 
 And boy is he a show-off! Anytime there is company 
 over, he is instantly the center of attention and 
 will do anything he can to stay that way. Little 
 stinker!

 Hi 
 Tracy,

Thought you might like an update on 
 the baby and her new family. All us girls are doing 
 well.

Zahara is eating ve0ry well, now that I’ve 
 figured out what she likes best. She sends her love 
 (see the 0 from her in the middle of&quot;very&quot;). 
 She is exceptionally busy, providing endless entertainment 
 for both Chaela and me. She is also very fast and 
 has learned about the hall - which is located just 
 on the other side of that door with the alarm which 
 Mom has to struggle with when she arrives home. 
 She is good natured and friendly and smart, all 
 traits that have served her well in worming her 
 way into 4Chaela’s soft heart. (another love 
 note from Z) They play tag and chase and hunt together 
 and they have both been sleeping on top of me in 
 the evening in between bouts of franticness.

Zahara loves all the toys without 
 exception and scatters them with gay abandon throughout 
 the house. Who knew it was possible for such a small 
 creature to tote a 2-foot-long soft sausage toy 
 up onto the chesterfield! She sometimes needs to 
 be reminded to slow down and eat or sleep or pee, 
 so many fun things to do, so much energy to burn, 
 so many new hiding places to explore. I couldn’t 
 have hoped for a smoother transition.

She’s a wonderful addition to our family.

Hi Tracy

She&apos;s a&quot;solid&quot;girl with a fabulous 
 head of hair. Everyone remarks on her colouring 
 and markings. She loves toys - anything and everything. 
 Her favourite toys at the moment are shadows on 
 the wall. My bedroom wall has kittymarks where she 
 has flung herself repeatedly at shadows made by 
 the leaves on a tree outside the window. She&apos;s quite 
 boisterous - lots of head bunts and&quot;kneads&quot;before she settles down for a lap nap. Her favourite 
 places are the shelf above the washing machine where 
 the towels live, and the ironing board and the stove 
 when they&apos;re still warm from recent use.
All in all, she&apos;s a wonderful addition to our family 
 and I wonder how we ever got along without her.

 Tracy,

We just got Kira. She is absolutely beautiful! Just gorgeous! 
 Her coloring is so impeccable. We had seen Abyssinian kittens 
 here a few months ago and she blows them away. I am so happy 
 we chose to wait and get her from you. I&apos;m also happy we chose 
 to get Kyo from you also!!!!!!!!!

 Hi 
 Tracy, 
 
 Desi 
 is getting so big and he is so full of energy. He sleeps with 
 us every night and purrs in our ear every morning. He has 
 learned how to felt and Shannon plays with him for hours. 
 We are so thrilled with him we are thinking about getting 
 another one. Do you have available? We sure loved getting 
 all the photos every couple of weeks as he continued to grow 
 and change and we often look back on them and smile. You have 
 been so wonderful! 

 We’ll 
 send some more photos soon.

 Hi 
 Tracy 

 

 They 
 have just arrived and we are so thrilled! The flight was a 
 little delayed, but the kittens were just fine. They were 
 so excited to see us and purred all they way home. Sam was 
 not to sure about seeing 2 furry felines in his home, but 
 he’ll get used to them. The kittens are not scared of 
 him at all. We haven’t decided on any names yet, but 
 we’ll let you know. Tracy, thank you for all you’ve 
 done, you have been a delight to deal with! Thank 
 You! We’ll keep you posted. 

 

 Take 
 care

Hi Tracy,

Zephyr has been purring so hard her whole body was vibrating. 
 (She goes throught the house more like a hurricane than a 
 gentle breeze.) Fearless would seem to be a really good word 
 to describe them.
What is this business of dipping the paw in the water and 
 then shaking it and drinking the drops off the floor? I tried 
 putting a placemat under the water, and the next time I went 
 in the room the dish was empty and the placemat was soaked.. 
 Kittens 1, Denise 0.
They are just so cute. Also, they don&apos;t mind trying to steal 
 my breakfast, and they both like Greek yogurt!…Kittens 
 2, me 0!
I just thought I would give you a progress report on the teeny-tinies, 
 AKA the demonettes, AKA the bottomless pits. They&apos;re still 
 growing in front of our eyes, although Luna remains the&quot;sleeker&quot;of the two, and Zephyr is smaller and skinnier. They are little 
 lovers. I think Luna gets carried back to infancy, because 
 when she is really happy she nuzzles and kneads. It can get 
 very tickly. We love them to death.... Denise

...Well, Tracy, the girls have figured out how to get onto 
 the kitchen counter, so the last safe haven is gone. Last 
 night they knocked my son&apos;s box of donettes onto the floor, 
 and were discovered amidst little donuts and powdered sugar, 
 happily munching away. The night before last, they stuck their 
 heads into a bag of flour, and I had Kabuki kitties! It&apos;s 
 a darn good thing they&apos;re so cute.
The next night, Luna got a corn cob out of the trash and ran 
 around the house with it, putting it down now and then to 
 growl fiercely at it.... Denise
