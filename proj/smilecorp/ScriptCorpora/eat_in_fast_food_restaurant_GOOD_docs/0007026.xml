 Smart Grid, Utilities, and Internet Protocols 
 Apr 16, 2010 10:20 AM 
Google Tech Talk April 14, 2010 ABSTRACT Presented by Erich W. Gunther. The smart grid is a big topic these days, but before there was a smart grid newspaper headline, the utilities have been experimenting with TCP/IP in the backend networks for a while now. Erich Gunther of enernex (www.enernex.com) will present a reference model and concept of network operations for the power industry including how Internet Protocols fit in that space. Along the way he will touch on what has worked, what hasn&apos;t and some of the security issues along the way. Erich W. Gunther is the co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer for EnerNex Corporation - an electric power research, engineering, and consulting firm - located in Knoxville Tennessee. With 30 years of experience in the electric power industry, Erich is no stranger to smart grid - he has been involved in defining what smart grid is before the term itself was coined.

 Apr 14, 2009 8:18 AM

It resulted from easy credit. First it was chiefly through credit cards. Then it was by refinancing home mortgages and through home equity loans; this was possible during a period of rising home values, which itself was driven by making money for mortgages far too easy. More mortgages, more borrowing ...

 Tac Thunderbox AMP 28r GUTIARMANIA - Amp for Guitar Hero or Rock Band 
 Feb 8, 2009 5:04 PM 
So I was meandering around Circuit City this afternoon looking at all the 30-50% off items before their final closing of their doors, and I found this little amplifier sitting on the bottom of the shelf in the store...

What is this thing but some goofey waste of an Amplifier created in attempt to market to people who play Guitar Hero or Rock Band. They basically stuck a pair of RCA audio inputs on a basic guitar/bass practice amp and called it a &quot;gamer amp&quot; or something like that.

Despite the apparently cheap quality of this amplifier, it actually sounds pretty good, even through a cheap $9 microphone like I&apos;m using here to record it. My Zune also does not sound too bad through this thing either.
