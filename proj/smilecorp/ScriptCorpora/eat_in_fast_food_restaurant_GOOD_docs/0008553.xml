 Thanks for visiting today,
 
 
 Large-scale municipal landfills
are a relatively new invention. The first modern sanitary landfill was
created in Fresno, California in 1937 [ ref ].
Today there are thousands of active landfills all over the United
States. Each American creates approximately 4.4 pounds of trash every
day, and a majority of it ends up being buried in a landfill somewhere. 

 We pay for all those landfills
through our property taxes. A typical landfill costs $20 million or
more to build, plus millions of dollars per year to operate. In most
cases, all of that money comes from local taxpayers. 

 You can see the effects that
landfills have on our thinking nearly everywhere you go. For example,
if you buy a pancake breakfast at McDonald&apos;s, you will throw away: 

 the top and bottom of the Styrofoam container that holds the pancakes a plastic syrup container and its foil top a plastic butter container and its plastic top a paper cup a plastic lid a plastic straw a plastic fork a plastic knife a plastic bag that held the fork and knife some used napkins the paper tray liner. 
 That&apos;s one meal for one person,
and it all ends up in the landfill. Everything from disposable diapers
to plastic soda bottles ends up there as well. 
 Here is one way to look at a
landfill: A landfill is a place where we dump the trash we create as we
live our lives. Here is another way: Landfills are a form of corporate
welfare. Think about it -- Nearly every single product that ends up in
a landfill comes from a corporation. A corporation makes a product, and
then &quot;society&quot; pays for the end-cycle cost of the product by building a
public landfill. Landfills take corporate disposal costs away from
corporations and transfer them to &quot;society&quot;. 

 Here&apos;s the important question we
will explore today: What if we eliminate landfills and make
corporations pay for the end-cycle cost of all the products they
create? None of us wants landfills scattered all over the countryside.
Every time a municipality tries to site a new landfill it is a major
problem because no one wants to live near one. Landfills look bad, they
smell bad and they are time bombs. Many landfills will create gigantic
clean-up problems in the future as they start to leak toxic waste (oil,
mercury, lead, cadmium, etc.) into groundwater. &quot;Society&quot; will end up
paying cleanup costs as we do with many other SuperFund sites. There is
no reason to keep creating these toxic time bombs. 

 Changing the Rules 

 What if we simply change the
rules? What would happen if we say to corporations, &quot;There will be no
new landfills -- it is time for each corporation to clean up its own
mess.&quot;? 

 Things would change in the
marketplace very quickly. Prices in stores would need to reflect the
full lifecycle costs of each product, so products would be redesigned
with the thought of complete recycling in mind. In the process, many
products would actually get cheaper. Right now, corporations design
their products knowing that they are headed for the landfill. Under the
new rules, corporations would focus their efforts on designing for
recyclability and they would find ways to make recycling inexpensive or
even profitable. Over the course of five to ten years, the marketplace
would sort out the winners and losers and we would have a recyclable,
landfill-free society. All by changing one rule. 

 Consider this example. Right
now, most fast food restaurants design all of their packaging knowing
that it will go to a landfill. Employees at fast food restaurants carry
millions of bags of trash out to the dumpster every year for the trash
truck to pick up. In a landfill-free society, the bags of trash would
all be reprocessed instead. Fast food restaurants would take this new
reality into account and they would design their packaging knowing that
it will be reprocessed. The restaurants would pay for the reprocessing. 

 In the grand scheme of things,
what difference does it make to fast food restaurant whether the trash
goes to a landfill or a reprocessing center? To the fast food
restaurant it means nothing. But to the community it means a lot. It
means there is no need to have a landfill. 

 It is possible that reprocessing
a restaurant&apos;s trash will be more expensive than sending the trash to a
landfill. In that case, the price of a hamburger goes up a penny. It is
possible that reprocessing costs less because all the new packaging can
use the reprocessed materials. In that case, the price of a hamburger
drops a penny. It would make absolutely no difference to anyone, and we
would be rid of all the trash that fast food restaurants dump into
landfills today. 

 Or consider disposable diapers.
They actually have a lot of benefits. When you compare disposable
diapers to cloth diapers, disposables use less energy because you have
to heat water and drive motors to wash a cloth diaper. Less energy
means less air pollution from a power plant. Disposable diapers also
use much less water, and they produce less sewage. [ ref ]
Overall, disposable diapers would be a win if it were not for the
landfill space they consume -- The U.S. generates something like 350
million tons of used disposable diapers every year. [ ref ] 

 If the rule were &quot;No landfills,&quot;
the disposable diaper manufacturers would have to come up with a
solution for the end-cycle. For example, they might make their diapers
completely compostable. Then they would create a company that collects
the compostable diapers in each community, composts them and sells the
compost to greenhouses and gardeners. This company would probably make
a profit. By eliminating the crutch that landfills create for
corporations, they might actually start making money off of all the stuff we dump into landfills today. 


 If corporations had to pay for
handling the trash that they create, then the end-cycle costs of
products would be embedded into the product price. Suddenly, the
cleanest companies would win in the marketplace because they would have
the lowest prices. 
 The part that is most
interesting about a landfill-free society is the effect it would have
on the corporate mindset. Right now, with free landfills handling all
of the end-cycle costs for their products, corporations try to move as
many of their costs as possible to the end-cycle. What this means is
that the dirtiest companies win . If corporations had to pay for
handling the trash that they create, then the end-cycle costs of
products would be embedded into the product price. Suddenly, the cleanest companies would win in the marketplace because they would have the lowest prices. 

 When a consumer is through with
a product, be it a milk jug, a battery, a disposable diaper, a car, a
tire, a computer, shingles on the roof, carpet on the floor -- any
product -- it should be the manufacturer&apos;s responsibility to recycle
it. This would force corporations to design their products around the
total lifecycle cost rather than simply the creation cost.
