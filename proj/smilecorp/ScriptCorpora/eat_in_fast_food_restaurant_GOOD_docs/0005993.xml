 How to avoid memory leak from delegates? Hi, 
 
 I have a window application which required to add controls on runtime. I have also assigned event handlers to them 
 
 For e.g. 
 
 foreach(DataRow dr in dtTable.Rows) 
 { 
 
 CheckBox chk = new CheckBox (); 
 chk.Name = dr[&quot;ID&quot;].ToString(); 
 chk.Text = dr[&quot;Name&quot;].ToString(); 
 
 chk.Click += delegate (System. Object o, System. EventArgs e) 
 { 
 
 if (chk.Checked == true ) 
 
 SetCheckListCheckStatus(( GroupBox )chk.Parent, chk); 
 }; 
 
 this.Controls.Add(chk); 
 } 
 
 The function containing this loop is executed serveral times. 
 
 I have read that the memory of delegates (added at runtime) is cannot be collected by garbage collector. 
 
 Then what should I done to free up the memory used by delegates on unloading of the form. Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 Remove a strange character from a string \0 represents the null character, and it shouldn&apos;t be visible when displaying the string to the user. If it does show up, then what is likely truly in the stirng is \\0. Regardless, you can remove it with replace easily enough stringName = stringName.Replace(&quot;\0&quot;,&quot;&quot;); should do it, as would stringName = stringName.Remove(stringName.Length-1); Remember, these string functions actually return new strings, so you need to assign them back to the variable (like I&apos;ve done above) if you actually want the variable to change Of course this changes depending on if it&apos;s \0 or \\0 Anyway. good luck, -mwalts Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 Thread Two options as I see it: 
 
 You can consider using a background thread by setting the IsBackGround property to true for the serverThread but then you need to use invoke marshalling when getting/setting control properties 
 When using .NET 2.0 always hook to the Form events FormClosing and FormClosed and no longer use the Closing and Closed events. This guarantees that when the application domain is being shutdown that this events will be raised. Thus ServerForm_FormClosing() 
 Tips: 
 
 There are patterns for what you are trying to do (see Enterprise Integration Patterns) 
 consider adding a Thread.Sleep(50) in your while(true) loop this is make other applications responsive as well (context switching) Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 High performance parsing of string messages What is your final goal Why manually parse the string when you could use a regex language which is designed to be a high performance parser in any language Let the parser worry about the memory contraints, there are a whole cadre of MS developers worried about that product I am sure.&lt;g&gt;For example one could create a parser to extract out your example items and place them in groups: Regex parse = new Regex(@&quot;(&lt;Text&gt;\w{1,5})(&lt;Value&gt;\d*)&quot;, RegexOptions.Compiled); MatchCollection mc = parse.Matches(&quot;Omega1256&quot;); if (mc.Count&gt;0) Console.WriteLine(&quot;Text ({0}) Value ({1})&quot;, mc[0].Groups[&quot;Text&quot;].Value, mc[0].Groups[&quot;Value&quot;].Value); Console Output Text (Omega) Value (1256) Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 static list The best solution is a singleton pattern 
 public class Class1 
 { 
 static private List&lt;string&gt;data ; 
 
 static public List&lt;string&gt;Data 
 { 
 get { return data; } 
 set { data = value ; } 
 }

 Memory Leak Thanks for your answer. I&apos;ve already tried GC.Collect() and GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers() with no luck. I wouldn&apos;t know how to use MemoryFailPoint, since memory is available almost all the time (it takes more than 7 hours to run out of memory) It seems to me like Garbage Collector is blocked for some reason.

 Dynamic Thread Creation Hello Paul, Thanks for the reply. I&apos;ll check your solutions in my project. I believe the Delegate.CreateDelegate function is what I am looking for. I cannot use the second method you posted, because I don&apos;t know which Interface method is going to be set with the UseInSeparateThreadAttribute - thus the need of creating a delegate dynamically. It could have been the&quot;Render&quot;method, for instance. A solution would be testing the method name against a switch block, but since I have extensibility in mind, I&apos;d prefer not to have built-in strings for the Interface definition. i.e.: (pseudocode) switch (MethodName) case&quot;Render&quot;: thread = new Thread(plugin.Render); case&quot;Update&quot;: thread = new Thread(plugin.Update); and so on. I&apos;ll be posting my results as soon as possible, thanks again. Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 Please Explain the code Also, it only hides it when viewed as a VijilCache type. For example: 
 
 
 
 Code Snippet 
 NameValueCollection collection = new VijilCache(); 
 Console.WriteLine(collection.Keys.Count);// this will call NameValueCollection.Keys, not VijilCache.Keys. 
 
 
 
 Since NameValueCollection.Keys is virtual what you probably want is the override keyword, not the new keyword so you override the Keys property, not just hide it. Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 Synchronized anonymous method I understand why you say &apos;don&apos;t use a background worker&apos;. I would answer the same if I didn&apos;t know the context. So I&apos;ll to explain why I want to do this. The application I build is workflow based and each workflow consists of a couple of (configurable) steps: Workflow - Import - ImageProcessing - OCR - Format (write pdf, ascii files etc) - Export (export data to databases, send email etc) The workflow executes each step in a backgroundworker, which works fine for each step, except the OCR step, because it requires me to use the ActiveX dll. Unfortunaly I can&apos;t use a background worker for some steps and no backgroundworker for other steps. Hope you understand what I mean. Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 Calling a button_click What&apos;s with all the graphics stuff 
 Deleted all graphics - just need to get text into a textbox. 
 This one seems to work, twice. Then quits responding. 
 
 I added a listbox to keep track of inputs. 
 I can get 2 entries, then program pukes. 
 
 All I want to do is send a texbBox entry to another computer, and have it print the string to a listBox (for now). 
 The catch is, the listener has to sit there ACTIVELY listening. 
 Once a string is sent, it has to write it to the listBox, and then keep ACTIVELY listening for the next string. 
 
 Basically, I need to write my own HyperTerminal in C#, to listen to the network port, then print out what comes in. Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 Convert string to operation The first one would be the best, unfortunately I don&apos;t have the time to write that. The second one is good enough but I&apos;m interested in the third the most. So how do you assign the string as a result of a calculation to a variable If I try for example: 
 int Result = OperationInString; 
 then there is no way I can assign (or convert) the string so I get a calculated result. I&apos;m confused here, sorry. 
 And if I use the static method, that wont work with a variable. If I set a double return type, it won&apos;t let me return the OperationInString variable. Could you explain to me in detail Tag: Visual C# General MTU Receiver Visual C#

 AOP in C# - Aspect Oriented Programming - Which Framework should I use? Thomas Koelle wrote: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A few years back aspect oriented programming was a big hype. 
 
 People even build compilers to support it. 
 
 Then came .Net and Java 1.5. Today aspect oriented programming works with annotations in java and attributes in .Net 
 
 So in C# you can use attributes and reflective programming to achive some of the same issues (e.g. security) 
 
 
 Not really. Attributes don&apos;t come anywhere near the capabilities that true AOP would provide. For instance, just trying to get each method / constructor of concern to debug-log its input argument values on entry, and its return value / exception on exit would be a challenge (nay, not possible) to do with lowly attributes. So instead, developers are forced to manually weave in these&quot;aspects&quot;by writing the same kind of code (no matter how simple it may be, having to remember to write the code nonetheless instead of having true AOP handle it for you) in the methods.

 Place Spaces In ProperCase Words Here are two methods, one uses strings manipulation and Insert method for inserting space within string, and second uses StringBuilder to avoid string instances whenever you add a space. You will use first one when you have strings with several words like near 5, and use second one with stringbuilder when you have string with much more words to be able to gain performace from StringBuilder: 
 public static string SplitWords( string input) 
 { 
 string lower = input.ToLower(); 
 string result = input; 
 for ( int i = input.Length - 1; i&gt;= 1; i--) 
 { 
 if (input[ i ] != lower[ i ]) 
 { 
 result = result.Insert(i,&quot;&quot;); 
 } 
 } 
 return result; 
 } 
 
 public static string SplitWords1( string input) 
 { 
 string lower = input.ToLower(); 
 int j = 0; 
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder (); 
 for ( int i = 1; i&lt;input.Length; i++) 
 { 
 if (input[ i ] != lower[ i ]) 
 { 
 sb.Append(input.Substring(j, i - j)); 
 sb.Append( &apos; &apos; ); 
 j = i; 
 } 
 } 
 sb.Append(input.Substring(j, input.Length - j)); 
 return sb.ToString();

 I will explain you with an example. 
 
 try 
 { 
 open database connection 
 
 database operation 
 
 other operation 
 
 } 
 catch 
 { 
 } 
 finally 
 { 
 close connection 
 } 
 
 
 Even if you get some error in other operation then too you want to close connection 
 and if no error occured then too you want to close connection. 
 
 i.e. In finally you write that cleanup code or code which you want to execute even in case of error.

 Do you not know how the MTU connects to your computer I assume you mean Mobile Transmitter Unit... It would depend on the unit it how it would interact with the computer; without detail like that we&apos;d just be randomly guessing.

Re: Visual C# General MTU Receiver
 Peter Ritchie

You&apos;ll have to contact the manufacturer to get that sort of information. The MTU on that product is used to communicate with the display unit. In all likelihood that communication is on a vendor- or class-specific channel that is not compatible with standard computer-connected receivers and probably uses proprietary communication protocols.
