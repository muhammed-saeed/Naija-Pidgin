 Drive thru&apos;s...are they quicker than going inside?

 So tonight I went to KFC. The drive thru was crowded, but I went in it anyway. I beeped my husband through our 2-way phones to let him know that the drive thru was packed and that it would take me at least 20 minutes to get the food. He didn&apos;t believe me. He thought I was being sarcastic. LOL So I told him I&apos;d beep him back right AFTER I got our food. It had indeed taken 20+ minutes. He STILL couldn&apos;t believe it, but he was amazed that it took so long. By the way there were about 10 vehicles in front of me at the drive thru. Talk about being crowded!

So, do you think it&apos;s quicker to go inside a fast food restaurant or to go through their drive thru?

 Since drive thru&apos;s have become so popular they may not be quicker. But they definately are more convenient and many people would prefer to wait in line at the drive thru than to have to get out of their car even if it would be quicker.

 I totally agree with you on that. However, I feel that sitting in a drivethru line uses up precious gas.

 There have been a few times that I&apos;ve passed up the drive-thru at the bank because I could tell it would be faster to go inside. My son and I tested it one time by remembering what cars were in line when I went in and who was still there when I came out - I would have been waiting 4 more cars at the drive-thru.

McDonalds is often the same way but we haven&apos;t tested that one - yet!

 Nowadays most people go through the drive thru because they think it&apos;s faster and they don&apos;t have to leave their car. But that&apos;s the reason drivethrus are getting more crowded lately. I like to go in and pickup my order. In most circumstances going in would be better than to go through the drivethru.

 Well in reality, I think it&apos;s usually faster to go inside! But for me, with 4 kids, I will never go in unless I have to! ;) But generally speaking, I see people coming in and out faster than I get thru the drive thru lines. Sometimes those lines are so ridiculous, they can be backed up so far! It stinks! I wish I had some KFC now, yum!

 If I saw a crowd like the what you described, I will park my car and go inside even if I have my girls with me. Although, I haven&apos;t encountered a huge crowd yet. I usually go to drive through at a late hours of the night.

 I think it all has to do with who is working there. There are some who move slow and take longer, and then there are some who are quick and respect your time. I always have to check the food before I leave, there seems to be something missing all the time.
