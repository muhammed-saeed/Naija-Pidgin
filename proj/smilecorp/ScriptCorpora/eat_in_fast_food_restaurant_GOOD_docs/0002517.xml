Lite Infrastructure Means Lower Setup Cost and Easier Installation

CCS doesn&apos;t require a server until more than 4 stations are being used. For most coffee shops this is fine, because they only have from 1 to 3 terminals. This will significantly reduce the cost of a network solution. One terminal can act as the server. Or use an office computer.This takes away the required sophistication of a Windows Server, and leaves you with a manageable point of sale system for your coffee shop.
