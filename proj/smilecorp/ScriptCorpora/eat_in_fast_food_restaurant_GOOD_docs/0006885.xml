 Sun-Dried Tomato Dip 
 
 

This recipe makes a great vegetable party dip. I normally set out assorted bell peppers, sugar snap peas, baby carrots, and celery. Tortilla chips could also be used here, but the vegetable assortment is always popular and looks great on the table. If you are making party dips, make sure everything served at the party is gluten-free so there are no cross-contamination issues.

SUN-DRIED TOMATO DIP

8 ounces cream cheese, softened

1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1/2 cup sour cream

1 green onion green and white parts, chopped

1 1/2 teaspoons Frank’s Hot Sauce (gluten-free at time of post-always check)

3/4 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon pepper

DIRECTIONS:

Combine all ingredients in a food processor and process until pureed. Chill, covered until serving time. Bring to room temperature before serving. The dip can be made up to two days ahead of time.

Makes 2 cups.

** I got this recipe from a co-worker a few years back. Not sure where she got the recipe, but it has been altered to suit my tastes over the years**
