Does Kevin Trudeau&apos;s &quot;Weight Loss Cure&quot; Burn Fat or Money?
 
Losing Weight or Money?
 
Do an internet search on&quot;Kevin Trudeau Weight Loss Cure&quot;and you&apos;re liable to end up more confused than when you started. There&apos;s enough propaganda out there to whip an large army into a frenzy, and enough skepticism to start a revolution. But before you get up in arms yourself, take a minute to review the following information, and make your own decision.

 Here are the facts: 
 
Conflicting Consumer Reports
 
Visit one of Kevin Trudeau&apos;s many websites, and you&apos;ll read customer testimonials like the following:

 &quot;When I used the weight loss cure protocol the pounds just flew off! I lost 51 pounds and have kept if off for over two years without any effort.&quot;- C.L., North Carolina

 &quot;When I started using the weight loss cure protocol I noticed my food cravings going away. I used to have certain comfort foods; chocolate, ice cream, Starbucks coffee with extra caramel. I was obsessed by these foods and loved them. I have always been a yo-yo dieter, an emotional eater, and a binge eater. These techniques are a Godsend.&quot;- F.K., California

 &quot;I am a past success story of the weight loss cure protocol. I lost over 75 pounds about 12 years ago.&quot;- S.M., Washington

Visit ConsumerAffairs.com, and you get a different story:
 Kevin Trudeau is raking in the profits... but are you reaping the rewards? 


 I was given the book&quot;What They Don&apos;t Want You To Know&quot;by Kevin Trudeau. All of the health remedies seemed to be only available on his website. I ordered the weight loss CD and subscribed to the website for $9.95/mo. The CD was sent in a tiny mailer and cost $9.95 for shipping, which I didn&apos;t appreciate. I asked two questions on the website and they said it would take up to 8 weeks for a response because they were just getting things set up. No one ever responded, so fed up I tried to cancel. But that was impossible. I sent them the cancellation notice on August 3rd 2006 and yet they continue to bill my American Express card each month for $9.95. - Darlene, CA

 Mr. Trudeau is very persuasive on TV that his book will set you on a path to some arcane lost info that he recently found. The clinic that does the work in Europe is valued and effective in its work. Mr. Trudeau FAILS to let you know in the TV infomercial that you cannot get this protocol in the USA. Of course you don&apos;t know this until you read his 3rd Chapter. - Marie, CA

 I ordered the natural cures book and never got them and I&apos;m being charged $5.95 a month for a news letter i cannot cancel. So far the total amount of money stolen from me is $49.95. - Robert, IN

 I bought the book,The Weight Loss Cure by Kevin Trudeau. On page 93 he instructs us to take an injection of 125-200 units of hcg (human chorionic gonadotrophin). I went on line and look it up since I had never heard of it. Well----it is used in fertility treatment. The side effects can be very serious. I do not intend to follow the diet because nothing that I have read so far has the slightest bit of common sense. The man is a maniac. - Margie, CA

A Man with a Past
 
Just as you&apos;re starting to get the picture of how close you came to being scammed, you find out, low and behold, that Kevin Trudeau also has a criminal record. In the 1990&apos;s, he defrauded several credit card companies out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Due to some streak of marketing genius, and an undeniable charisma, Trudeau bounced back to make millions with his infomercials for Nutrition For Life, International products, only to be charged with misrepresentation, and ordered to pay reparations to stockholders, as well as cease making false claims in his marketing materials. He violated the judgement, launching several direct mail campaigns and perpetrating another scam on home shoppers, resulting Trudeau being banned from advertising via infomercials.

Why, then, can you find this man touting his&quot;Weight Loss Cure&quot;on late-night tv? The Federal Trade Commission&apos;s ban holds no sway over the marketing of books, which are protected under the right to free speech. This Kevin Trudeau is a tricky character, you&apos;re starting to think. But until you watch the video below, you don&apos;t know the half.
 
20/20 Investigates Kevin Trudeau
 
From His Own Mouth
 
Kevin Trudeau&apos;s&quot;Weight Loss Cure&quot;has upwards of half a dozen different websites devoted to its promotion. On one of these, in tiny print at the very bottom of the page, I found the following disclaimer: 

 Note that this book does not contain any specific cures for any specific diseases. It is also not a substitute for any medication you may be taking or medical advice given to you by your doctor. Information contained in Kevin Trudeau&apos;s book is general in nature and speaks more in terms of the regulation present in the health industry and living an overall healthy lifestyle. Therefore, please be aware that you may or may not find the information in the book helpful for your specific situation. This book is to be accepted and used for informational purposes only. By purchasing the book, you are acknowledging that you are aware and acknowledge these facts. 

I&apos;d say that about sums it up.

I agree that he may be in it for the money. But a lot of what he writes about in this book is truly accurate. I&apos;m on the fence because of that. Great article though! He himself is making money off of the discoveries of someone else. Research HCG weight loss on youtube. People have had gret success.

That disclaimer is required by the FDA since he is promoting supplements. You revealed yourself as incompetent or a propogandist by including this as supporting evidence.
 
 Success in Weight loss  9 months ago
 
I was very skeptical but my boyfriend was doing this diet and he lost 25 lbs. and is keeping it off for eight months now eating normally, but healthfully. He moderatly exercises and is 46 years old. I am 5&apos;7&quot; and on Monday, weighed 165 lbs. (the day I started Phase II of the weight loss cure). Well, today is Friday and I weighed in at 158!!! That&apos;s seven pounds in four days. The weight came from all areas of my body, I lost it evenly, and my clothes fit me again! I intend to drop another 10 before I&quot;m done. I feel light on my feet, alert, sleep like a ROCK, and my sugar cravings are nearly gone completely. I have not had one hunger pain at all. I am surprised that it&apos;s working, but it is, and I&apos;m so glad to see the scale drop each morning when I wake up!!!!! I&apos;m so happy.

Well this topic has certainly put the cat amongst the pigeons!Hey Joanna -- America is certainly not the only country struggling with weight issues -- in the UK it is estimated that 1 in 5 adults is now obese and childhood obesity is at its highest ever levels. Adult diabetes numbers are rocketing into orbit and the government here is freaking because we have a national health system!! Obesity is going to bankrupt the UK economy unless someone finds a solution. Currently the NHS is providing gastric banding as its best option.. worse and worse!

I think what he does is...

Kevin Trudeau uses the information of whats half right to make people buy in to what he says

Example, he says in of his commercials that Vitamin D can cure Cancer

I did some reseach of my own I found vitamin D can only fight against cancer not cure it

Kevin Trudeau has been the victim of massive character assassination by the media. A good example is that video posted on this site. Anytime you sell millions of anything you are going to have idiots who misunderstood the product and so are angry. I deal with that just selling a few products on ebay and amazon. People don&apos;t read descriptions and directions and then blame the seller for their own stupidity. If you look at all the products Kevin has sold they actually are HELPING people. He uses the same methods himself before selling them. That is how he comes up with ideas of what to sell. He goes with what he finds works for him. I find it amazing that people like Kevin Trudeau get accused of being a fraud just for promoting natural health products meanwhile drug companies make blatantly misleading commercials everyday with products THEY KNOW are dangerous and almost no one is saying anything about that.

I agree that he doesn&apos;t back up what he says all the time, but when I think of the &quot;granolas&quot; i know that only eat organic and that take time to give their bodies the best, those are the ones that never go to the doctor and who never struggle with obesity.

I agree with Claudio, every person has a different body and situation. Different diets work for different people. And if a certain diet is not working for you take a step back, take the parts which does work best and only focus on those.

Google Dr. Simeon the weight loss cure. You can find the entire text of his book written 50 years ago. It is priceless. You must read it in it&apos;s entirety. The alldaychemist.com is a good place to purchase Hcg in powder form, you mix it yourselg. If you check around, there may be a person in your local area who can assist you with this diet. It really is amazing.

I have read Kevin&apos;s books, applied some of the suggestions and I tell you, they work! I am not even talking about losing weight but by living healthy, eating healthy/organic and eliminating the harmful chemicals we put on our skin(our biggest organ). In less than a month my boyfriend and I lost weight, have smoother skin and more energy. My bf was skeptical at first but after seeing the results he is a believer now. Then the other day he was out with his friend and decided to have a burger from a fast food restaurant for lunch and guess what? He felt sick coz his body is already used to eating healthy that when he ate that crap he felt sick! Kevin was right, read and know what you put in your mouth &quot;If you can&apos;t read/pronounce it don&apos;t eat it, and if you can&apos;t eat it don&apos;t put it in your skin&quot;. If I may suggest to the people who read this: please do your research, read at least the first book before you judge. Don&apos;t just believe the people who comments here (including me) because you don&apos;t know who they are, they just might be people who are being paid to say bad things about Kevin to discredit him. You never know. So be responsible and read because you yourself is responsible for your own health or lack of it...

wow all you guys against him are so ignorant. do u really think drug companies are trying to help you? if they tried to cure all your diseases theyd loose money cuz everyone would be cured. THINK ABOUT IT. the people in the video are prob paid by the fda and ftc to say those things and seriously after watching that video i didnt actually get swayed at all, like they didnt actually show proof against him. wow that he used to sell other stuff on tv and got banned? how does that have anything to do with natural cures? why dont you brain-washed ignorant QUACKS read the books yourself before you let the media tell you what to think.

Funny.... I have a friend who actually bought the weight loss book. Without going onto the drugs, paying for sauna&apos;s, and just simply eating organic and cleansing, she lost a lot of weight.

My mom then decided to try it. And guess what? She lost a lot of weight. This guy used to be a Doctor, and yet his books are at risk for being banned. Why? Because if we know the truth, that&apos;s less money for the diry, scheaming, idiotic American Govornment. You do know that it is illegal to treat someone who has cancer unless it is strickly kemotherapy? Meaning if you are a doctor, and you have cancer yet don&apos;t want Kemo for whatever reason, you&apos;re just going to die. Sorry. America wants the exspensive route.

It&apos;s screwed up, it really is. And honestly, I&apos;ve taken natural cures myself for other things. (Not really from this man&apos;s book, but from information other people have given me.) And you know, those worked too.

I&apos;d rather be willing to give this a try, rather than put my life at risk because the f*cking govornment wants more money. (And this is how it has always been. They don&apos;t care about us.) There are a lot of medications from around the world that are illegal and banned from America. Why? Because the treatments work. (And I am serious on that. There are plenty of medicine in other countries that work better than the ones here. And like Trudeau&apos;s book is about it be, they are banned. Because they work.

So as you can see, I was more than willing to buy his Natural Cures book to see what the hype is about. If the oh so fearless America, ready to jump in wars we don&apos;t even belong in, is so terrified of this man, it has to be for a reason.

And I can assure you, if it did not work, they would not be trying to ban his books.

For the sole reason that I&apos;ve read other similar books, and they are out there, and they are NOT getting banned. Because those ones are FULL of scams. So why won&apos;t those ones bite the dust?

.... Oh! because they want us to spend money on stuff that does not work.

God forbid the truth be told.

I agree with mistique1

you americans aren&apos;t very bright. you believe everything the government and the FDA says, when really, they are the bad guys! Kevin&apos;s discoveries actually work, and he is one of the biggest threats (money-wise) towards these big industries such as the medical and food fields. They bag on Kevin and twist up everything so people like you believe them, just cause it&apos;s millions vs him.

The government doesn&apos;t give a crap about you, only your money and keeping these secrets secret.

Kevin cares about these secrets and thinks it&apos;s wrong to keep them from clueless people like yourselves.

DID YOU KNOW only in America all this good stuff is illegal? because only America is this corrupt. AMERICA is the only real place that has huge problems with weight.

THE FOOD INDUSTRY adds all sorts of super unhealthy things to your food, getting you addicted and wanting more.

THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY only gives you treatments that help with symptoms, not the actual disease, never actually getting rid of it FOREVER.

JUST THINK! what if, hypothetically (not really), the cure for breast cancer was FOUND? and just think of all the money that foundation recieves? TONS of money. at first, years ago, that was actually formed in trying to find the cure, but they FINALLY ACTUALLY DID FIND A CURE!

just think back to when smallpox was all the hype. they had a foundation searching for it&apos;s cure, they got tons of money, finally found it, and now, they dont get paid because the cure is found, no need for the donations to be given.

same thing here, but now they have learned their lesson. the medical and food industries are so corrupt now, they are thinking, &quot;hey, lets keep acting like we havent found the cure and keep getting more money.&quot;

Kevin is only a &quot;criminal&quot; because these industries are trying to do everything possible to stop him from spreading the truth by locking him up, finding the tiniest loop holes in the law, and like i said before, twisting up the story and facts to make him look like the bad guy, when it&apos;s really the FDA and government that are the bad guys, only interseted in your money.

Trudeau is not a doctor but he plays one on television! Check out his past!! ANYTHING connected with Trudeau is a scam and NEVER give him your credit or debit card number!! Trudeau is a sociopath without a shred of remorse for his many crimes.

Last year I was sick with candida and low thyroid. I bought his book and followed many of the sugestions. The candida is gone thanks to a perscription plus the Bragg apple cider vinager. I also use HCG for weight loss. At first I was injecting it into my leg and now take it sublingualy. I have lost weight and the HCG is working. There is nothing wrong with his book. And there is nothing wrong with selling a book for $14.95 or $19.95. Kevin Trudeau does not claim to be a doctor of any sorts. The HCG diet is from Dr. Seimon. Dr. Seimon wrote the book &quot;Pounds and Inches&quot;. Suzane Somers has great books too. She did her research and has great suggestions.

Thankyou for the positive info on hcg! My Naturpathic doctor, after much research, has endorsed the use of hcg. I tried other weight loss regimens and nothing has worked for us with our ages and theslower metabolism that comes with it. (even exercise didn&apos;t do it). I trust my doctors&apos; knowledge. He is &quot;tried and true&quot; with my husband and I. He has helped us with every health issue we&apos;ve had over the past 20 years. My condition was one no other doctor had been able to help me with. I&apos;m so much better now;just overweight! My point is, if he has decided to endorse the hcg hormone in a small, safe dosage, I am going to trust him and try it. I&apos;m very anxious and excited to get started soon!! I hope many people are helped, as it is no fun being helplessly overweight and not feeling your best because of it.

Bottom line...Kevin Trudeau is no more CROOKED than the next man!! So what he has a past!! no ones PERFECT!! how many of you guys past is clean?!?!?! The fact is that, they are AFRAID that he&apos;s out to expose them!! As he has stated before, he has &quot;DEATH THREATS&quot; on his life. Do you really believe that he would jeopardize his life, knowing that at any corner he turns...his life could be over in an INSTANCE?!?!?! come on already!! I believe him...and there is proof that there are those of us who have found some of his methods beneficial...regardless of his pass. THEY ARE OUT TO GET HIM!! PERIOD!! Let someone threaten to take away your bread and butter...then we can talk!

I heard about Kevin over a year or so ago. At first I thought the government was trying to mess him up. Then I realized that it had more to do with his product than anything else and people were saying there was no advice in there that they couldn&apos;t have gotten other places. Additionally, another person told me that some of his recommendations are actually dangerous and she hoped people wouldn&apos;t actually endanger their lives by attempting to a do a few things in the book. I have no idea what they were, as I didn&apos;t ask at the time. He is a dangerous individual and he should be stopped altogether because the sad truth is one IS born every minute, but they shouldn&apos;t have to die because of it.

Thanks for playing a part in outing this jackass.

Some people have no respect for their fellow human beings.

It&apos;s sad...

&quot;Weight Loss Cure&quot;.

What is that... a cure for weight loss?

So weight loss is a disease now?

The title of his book doesn&apos;t make any sense.

I have to laugh that John Stossel gets an assignment to discredit Trudeau by his corporate-owned media employees. Why?

Certainly Trudeau&apos;s &quot;crimes,&quot; should they be authentic or not, aren&apos;t any greater than all those stupid pills guys can buy to get their penises to grow a couple of inches. Except maybe the ripping off of peoples&apos; credit cards, a situation I personally know nothing about and a situation his critics surely have heard only 1 side to.

Again, given the criminal activities of our banking institutions and politicians and how the media covers up for them, I can&apos;t help but wonder why the government (the vehicle by which the wealthy corporations and bankers maintain their monopoly of power) and the corporate-owned media is so committed to condemning Trudeau. Kind of makes me like him.

some people have no scruples - men like kevin need lots of jail time

Without knowing Kevin personally, I can offer these comments:

His recommendation for rebounding - NASA research lists its amazing benefits, and one of them, the ability to pump lymph, is key to healing in any dangerous condition like cancer. In fact, a study showed that people with cancer who engaged in a rebounding program after chemo had MUCH better outcomes than those who did not do the rebounding program. This makes sense because both chemo and whatever irritants led to the cancer in the first place depend on the lymphatic system to be eliminated from the body. And, as I know people who naturally healed their cancer - I KNOW it can be done. Rebounding is being used in Germany to correct osteoporosis successfully, as well.

Memory System? It only works if YOU work it. I know two people who have studied and applied the system. One used to in order to complete an accredited 4-year baccalaureate degree in 6 months for less than $5,000. He created a schedule of knocking out one course every 3 weeks or so, and the memory techniques helped him do that AND retain better than he did before the course. The other person used it to remember the names of hundreds and hundreds of patrons at the bar he worked at, helping ensure its success. He uses it now, and easily learned the names of over 40 new people at a new job in just a day or so.

As for the Hcg protocol - that has been around, stood the test of time, and the doses are so small that they don&apos;t have untoward effects. As Trudeau points out, our food supply is different now than when the protocol was first created, so it isn&apos;t a permanent solution if you don&apos;t change your food drastically while trying to maintain.

As for Stephen Barrett of quackwatch, he has NO credibility.

 http://www.quackpotwatch.org/quackpots/quackpots/b 

The article includes this....

In a Canadian lawsuit (see below) Barrett admitted to the following:

&quot;The sole purpose of the activities of Barrett&amp;Baratz are to discredit and cause damage and harm to health care practitioners, businesses that make alternative health therapies or products available, and advocates of non-allopathic therapies and health freedom.&quot;

I won&apos;t say that everyone who works for drug companies or for the FDA is plotting to keep people sick: they wouldn&apos;t last if they didn&apos;t hire people that &quot;believed in the product&quot; as it were, because most people can smell a phony.&quot; I&apos;ve experienced the lack of integrity of the drug company-to-drug rep-to-doc-to-nurse-to patient first hand, and the lies told and believed can and do have serious effects on real people. That&apos;s why we have so many drug lawsuits.

Can you explain why clinics and hospitals wanted absolutely nothing to do with a supplement - even offered for free - in the hopes that a local study would be done? The product had already been shown to lower HIV counts and increase weight on wasting people in a third world country. As one nurse put it, a product like that would leave thousands of people homeless there in San Francisco alone.

Do drug companies want a cure for diabetes? I don&apos;t think so. It is their daily bread and butter.

Did drug companies want anything to do with using phosphilipids to clear arteries safely? No, because a phospholipid isn&apos;t patentable.

Do they want to advance research on the cures achieved by the Italian M.D. who cured cancer with bicarbonate? Baking soda! No, of course not. It isn&apos;t patentable, so they don&apos;t even want you to KNOW about something that cures cancer when they have poured billions into developing cancer drugs that they need to sell.

Kevin comes on as a bit paranoid, sure, but there is good reason to understand why he feels that way when you know where he has been in his life. I feel a bit of righteous anger myself when yet another person I know and care about submits to what I believe now to be dangerous and unnecessary treatments by doctors who don&apos;t know or care to know about alternatives - and when I personally know people who solved those same problems naturally.

As I&apos;ve explored the different things that Kevin recommends, I can see that he doesn&apos;t recommend anything that doesn&apos;t have some sort of track record, and often some scientific basis. He can&apos;t give the reader everything they need to know about curing their own condition because his books would be banned if he did. And the information needed wouldn&apos;t fit into one book anyway, not for every possible reader.

I understand people being disillusioned if they expected a miracle cure to every situation by simply buying the book, and never researching the suggestions for themselves to see which if any had any substance, and which might work for them. If the overwhelming majority of customers are that ignorant then he needs to rework his advertising. But I didn&apos;t find his advertising confusing, and I have been researching many things both before and since reading his books, and I consider his books to be an excellent place to get started on your own health journey if you are clueless about what to start learning about. Since their publication, more has been learned, and in some areas, better products are available, as well.

Until M.D.&apos;s add natural cures to their curriculum in a serious way - because they can and do work, I have seen it, as have many others - or until we have access to other practitioners - we have to figure it out for ourselves, unless we want to trust doctors who tell us &quot;you&apos;ll have to take medication forever, most likely.&quot; Some people are happy to relinquish responsibility for their health like that. Docs like Gabriel Cousins, M.D. are in short supply - and he has supervised cures from diabetes Type 1 for pity&apos;s sake and I don&apos;t hear anything in the press about it! And since I witnessed the identical process in someone I know, and totally get the chemistry, I don&apos;t understand why every doctor in the nation isn&apos;t trying to get their patients to try this protocol and see whether they can reduce or eliminate their insulin! Insulin is responsible for so many of the horrible side effects that afflict diabetics as they get older! Is it blissful ignorance? Is it lack of exposure because the media isn&apos;t carrying the message? I hardly think a drug company would spend any money sharing this information, it would be a crime against their shareholders. And for the doctors that do hear about it, is the social pressure just too much to try it?

I think Kevin&apos;s previous criminal life has little to do with who he is now, and if doctors profit insanely while endangering our lives (4th leading cause of death, I believe), why are you bashing Kevin for making a living, even a good one, by providing information they cannot get from their trusted doctors and nurses?

When I think of the hours spent in research, that $29.95 - in some places, worth an hour of a nurse&apos;s time - just to figure out WHAT to research - is worth it. Unless you want to begrudge J.K.Rowling her millions, I don&apos;t see any sense in begrudging Kevin for bringing his research to us - and he brought it to us at a much higher cost to himself than JK ever had to endure. So he&apos;s human. You need to look closer at the information, and don&apos;t judge it by what doctors and reporters say.

I am not sure about Kevin, but I am sure about the HCG protocol laid out by Dr. Simeon. It works. The dosage amount for weight loss, using HCG is about 125-200 iu. As compared to 10,000 iu&apos;s for fertility and steriod usage. I lost fat, not muscle, and once that fat was gone it did not return. It is very strict but you see results immediately! Seeing the initial weight loss only motivated me to get off my butt and do something!

I think people have to stop looking into the past on Kevin Trudeau. No one is perfect, we all make mistakes. Just because he has a criminal record, doesn&apos;t mean he can&apos;t change. There is alot of criminals out there that just havn&apos;t got caught. For example, I think the real criminals are the ones who put chemicals in the food we eat and say that it is good for you such as diet sodas, aspartame, MSG. You don&apos;t think these people are crooks. Like...HELLO!! I do beleive alot of what Kevin says. And I am going to stick by him. People got to stop believing rumors and gossip. Dont nock something unless you try it. I think that is what is wrong with our society today. People do not fully search out the truth. They believe on here say, instead of facts. Or one person is out to get someong so they tell lies anbout or half truths about a person to make themselves look better. I am a firm believer that people can change. He is brave to be able to tell us the truth about what these chemicals in our food our doing to us. The government is greedy and wants him to stop because they will lose money. If no one can see that there is a problem.

Just read trudeau&apos;s book. It&apos;s long, repetitive and written in teeny print! It is written in an easy to understand prose, however. Kevin is clearly a wronged man wishing to gain retribution on his accusers. He is bringing the public in along for his vengeance ride and hopeing to justify his cause by introducing the public to the absolute filth and corruption that goes on within the governmental structure.

There are many areas of his &quot;personal opinions&quot; that are funny in an unbelievable way. Sometimes I fell asleep giggling. Some of his Conspiracy theories are far fetched but, if they are remotely true then, we as consumers are brainwashed and in trouble. It is extremely easy to brainwash and train a person no matter what thier age. Money or quality of life are good enhancers to quicken the brainwash effect. Trudeaux is in a battle and he himself, I believe, is also a puppeteer just like the FDA and FTC. They now have competition and while I don&apos;t back Kevin blindly, his book is well worth the small price for an interesting view that has quite a bit of realism and possible alternative health benefits. Pharmaceutical company income is at an all time high compared to gross national revenue and they control more of your thoughts and opinions than you may imagine. Some people are followers and blind believers and some will decipher the truth from the lies.

Always remember the country that followed it&apos;s governmental leader and his ideals and how convincing he must have been. For the people thought they were above many other peoples and they were in the right. Let&apos;s not be blind. Trudeaux is trying to help himself and YOU.

Kelley Eidem, you are retarded and should be put in jail for the crap you write. You self-diagnosed yourself with stage 4 cancer that appeared in a matter of 24 hours and then cured yourself within 5 days. I know you probably believe your delusions, but you could seriously injure people who can&apos;t see through your stupidity.

You are the epitome of the pot calling the kettle black.

There are so many comments, I don&apos;t know if someone has already posted this, but I have read so many blogs from people who are still being&quot;bled&quot;every month, and they don&apos;t know how to make it stop. Simple! Call your bank or credit card company, tell them to cancel your card and send a new one. End of monthly charges!

This hub confurms what I thought about Kevin Trudeau! Great hub! I browsed through one of his books once, and in it, he says that he has lists of all kinds of resources, including natural medicine doctors, and that one can subscribe to his newsletter. And he says that &apos;It&apos;s not about the money, I just want to help people!&quot;He says this several times. Yet, go to his website and you&apos;ll find that to get any kind of information at all, you have to pay for it! So much for &apos;helping people! And, he, too, is not really a doctor, as far as I know. I certainly would not trust him or buy anything from him. Thanks for letting people know what Kevin Trudeau and his hype are really about.

Again, great hub!

HCG is by far the BEST THING that has ever happened to me. I started on hcg therapy in a local doctors office in Oct. 2007, but check the web, you can get it int the USA. I was wearing a size 16 and I am only 5&apos;4&quot;, and was very depressed with my weight. I started losing weight right away, averaging 4-5 pounds of weight loss each week. I went from a size 16 down to an 8-10 after just a couple of months of following the hcg hormone therapy diet. It was the easiest diet to follow. HCG is a hormone the body produces during pregnancy, the body produces 300,000 units a day during pregnancy, but for weight loss you take an injection of 125-200 units a day, its just like giving yourself an insulin shot. The diet is very easy to follow because you have very little hunger, your body will release 2500 calories a day from the abnormal fat storage. Other health benefits I saw were, my hypothyroid condition is improving, my doctor has reduced my dose of snythroid from 112 mcg down to 100 mcg. This is the first time I have ever had any improvement in my hypothyroid condition during the last 15 year I have been on medication. My cholesterol also dropped from 272 to 194 with just a couple of months on hcg. I lost inches from all the abnormal fat storage problem areas, I lost 7 inches from my abdomen. I am 42 years old and I have never felt better or had more energy that I do now after hcg. The only reason you hear so much negative press on hcg is because there is a huge cover up of the truth on just how effective hcg really is. The medical community wants to keep you sick and fat so you will need high cholestorol medicine and develop diabetes, heart disease etc. so you will continue to take lots of prescription medicine. I have been married for 13 years, and believe me my husband is beyond thrilled with the results of my weight loss. It feels just like we are newlyweds again, and I feel so much more confident and attractive now, I could never express my thanks enough to kevin trudueau for bringing this to the public. I have spent the past 12 years overweight, and depressed about my size 14-16 clothing size. I have missed weddings and funerals because I was too ashamed for old friends to see how fat I had gotten. I have so very few pictures of myself from the last 12 years, I would not let family members take a fat picture of me. I now feel AWESOME, I am wearing my size 8 jeans today, the last time I was in a size 8 was 1996. I also am able to maintain my weight loss, I eat whatever I feel like and I dont gain a pound. I will repeat the program soon to lose my last few pounds to get back into the size 6 I wore 20 years ago. THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART KEVIN TRUDEAU FOR TELLING ME ABOUT HCG, I COULD NEVER THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR HOW IF HAS CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just use common sense people. Don&apos;t believe everything you read and hear. Why do we always have to blame someeone else for all our wrong doings. Take responsibility for your own actions, he didn&apos;t force you to do anything. If you don&apos;t like the book, return it. He&apos;s only giving you informative information, you do what you want with it. And, quit POINTING FINGERS!!! Most people are fat because they don&apos;t exercise and they eat out all the time. Stay home and cook from scratch. And remove your child from the tv, video games, and cell phones and make them play outside, that&apos;s what I did to my children when they were growing up and none of them are overweight. Read your labels, if you can&apos;t pronounce them, don&apos;t buy them. Make good choices and quit blaming.

One time I saw a Trudeau commercial on TV offering to eliminate stress and anxiety by the application of a method to eliminate stress, not manage, but eliminate. I went to an As Seen On TV shop to check out the product which had a booklet describing the technique/method. It came down to one word in the end. Breathe.

just a thought, remember that all this talk about him being a crook or a savior is giving him exactly what he wants, he is still selling books faster than anyone and the more that people speak ill of him the more popular he will become. so maybe the best way to stop him is just to forget about him, and when you hear something about him or another person, just step back and listen to your intuition it will tell you what you should do. And most importantly the books work if you true believe that they do, you just have to convince your mind that it will work and everything will follow

CM Sir,

When you are 50 lbs + overweight and feel miserable, and then come upon a way to finally shed this weight after years of frustration from failed mainstream diets (&quot;Go Low Fat&quot;!), trust me, it is at least&quot;Bible-Like&quot;! ;-)

I found Kevin&apos;s book interesting and in some ways useful. But come on people, it&apos;s not a holy bible, you need to do your research and stop looking for miracle cures, because there aren&apos;t any. After reading this and other sources, I started taking certain vitamins, eating all organic food, and getting in my outdoors exercise, and it&apos;s done wonders for me. I do think people should read Kevin&apos;s book, because he lays out the truth about prescription and over the counter drugs. I&apos;ve seen many people, not just me, enjoy a better life WITHOUT these drugs, using natural remedies without side effects.

Kevin Trudeau: love him or hate him. It does not matter when you get the results I did from his book&quot;the Weight Loss Cure They don&apos;t want you to know about&quot;. As noted by others above, this is NOT his protocol, he is writing about Dr. Simeons work in the 1950&apos;s called&quot;Pounds and Inches&quot;(Just&quot;google&quot;it!) and updates it with benefits of Organic foods.

This HCG protocol IS available all over the U.S. and you can see countless examples of success on Youtube (Search&quot;HCG Protocol&quot;,&quot;Kevin Trudeau&quot;, etc). But nothing is more convincing than my own personal success.

I had been on Atkins since 1998 when I was 220 lbs. I then lost about 20 lbs and slowly over the last 10 years watched my weight on low carb climb to 250 lbs. Though I always exercise, I wrote it off to going from early 40&apos;s to early 50&apos;s with a slowing metabolism. I felt doomed to an unhealthy overweight body only to get worse as I aged. But I refused to be defeated and believed there had to be something out there to help.

I came across Kevin Trudeau&apos;s&quot;Weight Loss Cure&quot;book and now am on my secong round of HCG. In the first round, I lost 35 lbs. I am 1/2 way into my second round (all rounds/phases explained in the book) and lost 12 more pounds and almost at my goal of 195 lbs.

I can only rave about the success if you follow Dr. Simeon&apos;s medically proven HCG protocol. I have never felt better, fitting into cloths again I had refused to throw away knowing I would someday find a way to fit in them again. It is all about your attitude. You can&quot;naysay&quot;it to death, discredit Trudeau himself and stay fat. Or educate yourself and find your own way to weighloss success like I did.

I recieved two of his books for fee with shipping and handling and brought the weight lose cure book. It took forever to receive the books. Once I got the books I opened them up to find the same information in all three books. Kevin does make some valid points but you have to remember when you read something that makes sense it can sometimes outweigh the BS if your not quick with your senses. I used the Organic virgin coconut oil and NO I didn&apos;t lose any weight. I brought the organic tea, the organic vinager but nothing yet. Okay maybe I wasn&apos;t faithful to the products but he did state after three days, my pants should be falling.

Cleansing is a good call. Everything cost a pretty penny but I guess that&apos;s how it goes to stay healthy. Foods that are cheap and canned are full of toxins. To me he still make a lot of valid points. I cut out the pork and all shelled fishes. You have to read in-between the lines to understand which way to go and what products to purchase.

I say he has a list of valid point and references to back it up. No he doesn&apos;t give you the direct answer to the questions you are searching for but you have to search for the answer within the book. The answer is there.

I read the&quot;Matural Cures...&quot;book and found it very interesting. I believe Trudeau is on to something and believe every bit about the pharmaceutical companies/ government/insurance companies scam. You don&apos;t need to read a book to know that the U.S. health care system is totally screwed. I also truly believe the FDA story about the&quot;weight loss bread&quot;. Big business doesn&apos;t like being hurt so the FDA will be used to shut down small businesses with big and healthy ideas. God forbid Wonder Bread goes down.

The problem with Trudeau is that he&apos;s trying to make a buck on every little bit of info. He comes off like a con artist or common thief. His approach to trying to&quot;help&quot;others is sickening. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s making a ton of money and living it up while being healthy. All his health knowledge won&apos;t stop a bullet though.

There are at least 2 places in the USA that will send you the HCG and monitor you online. The bloodwork was very expensive but the HCG was about $200 for a two month supply. I stuck to the diet and lost 25 pounds in 40 days. I won&apos;t lie to you it was a difficult plan and it took research to find the meds, but the diet isn&apos;t new, The Spa Diet has been around for decades. You can find the original clinical trails online.
 
 Misleading Article  4 years ago
 
I have 5 friends who have lost huge amounts of weight, all using the trudeau method. Readers should note that the majority of complaints written in this article are about postage fees, websites and not being able to find HCG in the USA - not about the diet itself. (Obviously it is possible). Also there&apos;s all the alleged &apos;dangers&apos; of HCG, but this is just scare tactics - there&apos;s more dangers from taking asprin. People love to pick on this guy, but he gets results. Kevin has the balls to stand up to big-pharma, and they fight back with slander campaigns. So don&apos;t believe everything you read abou him! Ask the people who tried his diet - they&apos;re happy!

I so agree with JOReilly. I remember picking up one of Trudeau&apos;s book after hearing all the controversy and being angry that this is the kind of stuff that turns more people against &apos;natural&apos; remedies&apos;.

I suppose he appeals to a certain audience and that my anger was misplaced. There are people who won&apos;t search out the information on their own - obviously, as his books sell very well.

The thing is that there&apos;s nothing in any of Trudeau&apos;s books that couldn&apos;t be gleaned from the internet/common sense. I&apos;ve read a little bit of his stuff (borrowed from friends, thankfully) and its stuff that you can find out with a visit to any local Whole Foods store or on health sites on the internet for free. He keeps saying&quot;THEY&quot;don&apos;t want us to know the stuff he&apos;s telling us. So why are&quot;THEY&quot;marketing the crap out of organic foods and vitamins in stores like Whole Foods then?

Nice job of research MR. It would be great if facts and warnings had the impact to help all those who read your solid advice. However, in my experience it will always be an unreasonable expectation to hope that logic will impact the role emotions play when human beings make decisions about weight loss products and their claims. I, for one, trust you&apos;ll keep producing these excellent articles. Thanks a millon!!

I too was skeptical of the diet. I was not terribly over weight. Only 15 lbs. I Lost 12 lbs. and the fat in the places that I wanted gone. I did order from outside the U.S. Oh well...no side effects and I feel great. Maybe this is not for everyone, but it worked for me

Maybe this has already been said, I stopped reading about two thirds of the way down, but it seems as if most people are concerned with the scam aspect. I purchased a copy of&quot;wieght loss&quot;from Amazon.com for five dollars. The organic food, the supplements, the teas and other stuff recommended I buy locally. Kevin Trudeau never sees a dime of what I&apos;ve spent. I also make it a point not to patronize the sites and companies listed in the book. That&apos;s almost like following his advice in the book about large corporations. In the end, at most, I&apos;m out five bucks for the book, of which no part goes to Kevin. I&apos;ll be the first to admit he&apos;s basically a late night info-mmercial hack. Memory to weight loss to golf? His credentials are certainly suspect as is his past. But I think in this instance he maybe plagiarist, an alarmist and a conspiracy theorist but when you weed out the self promotion and the redundancy in the book, there is some good information to be had. As far Hcg... I don&apos;t know... I was prescribed by a physician, whom I have known for a very long time and have great trust in. I think worst it could be a placebo. At best it does what they say. I&apos;ve heard from government sources that it could be dangerous, but have seen no specifics.&quot;Because I said so&quot;, wasn&apos;t acceptable when I was a child and is certainly not good enough now. Anyway, I&apos;ll go beck and read the rest and look forward to see what comes after...

Something to note for those who are&quot;pro&quot;Trudeau: Some of what he espouses in his books and on his infomercials is true, but that does not mean he isn&apos;t an opportunistic crook. Kevin Trudeau is NOT the only person to point out flaws in government agencies and the pharmaceutical companies. He is just using nuggets of truth to market other false claims or to sell services that are too good to be true. He is your classic snake oil salesman of old, and he is slick enough to slip out of sticky legal situations.

There are many people and organizations out there, such as consumer watchdog groups, journalists and university researchers who are dedicated to researching and promulgating truths about the food, pesticide, pharmaceutical and any number of other industries. They just aren&apos;t marketing themselves the way Kevin Trudeau is, in slick paid programming, pretending that he knows secrets unavailable to the rest of us. The information IS available to the rest of us - IN THE LIBRARY, in Barnes&amp;Noble, in Coles or Chapters, in your local mom and pop book store (if such a thing can still exist). There is also a ton of legitimate information available for free on the Internet; you just have to choose your information providers with a little bit of care. Look for credentials and an affiliation with well known and well RESPECTED institutions.

If you find information that makes sense, like buying and eating organic, incorporate it into your daily life and share the information with your friends, but don&apos;t think for even a moment that it was Kevin Trudeau who came up with the information all on his own. He doesn&apos;t even claim to have come up with the information; he&apos;s just repackaging and selling kernels of truth, hoping that you&apos;ll sign up for his Internet scam, and then you&apos;re really stuck.

I have read Trudeau&apos;s books. I find what he has to say to be interesting. I now eat organic food, don&apos;t use sweetners, i also did the cleanses. I am 28 yo&amp;it grosses me out to think of all the carcinogens I have put in&amp;on my body that the pharmacutical co, fda assured were safe. Do research on the artificial sweetner Splenda!! Research about pestisides that were deemed unsafe&amp;sold to other countries to use only to be brought back into the US by importing contaminated food! And&quot;they&quot;knew exactly what was going on. I do believe in what he has to say but he is a lil extreme! although, he is very much like the companies he tries to condem in his books!

Old saying, buyer beware. I was first introduced to Kevin Trudeau with Nutrition For Life about 14 years ago. I have his book. Read about 100 pages, haven&apos;t touched it since. It is a 400 page sales letter to his website.

Now there is no doubt that there are legions of fans for this man.

However all people should do due diligence when doing business with someone. The internet is an amazing tool for that. A simple Google search will help you decide whether you should do business with someone or not.

Here are my search results on Kevin Trudeau scams.

Eat less! Only that helps.

You simply can&apos;t loose weight, if you intake more(energy) than you use it.

It is so simple...just eat less and don&apos;t poison yourself with any additional chemicals

I tried to cancel my newsletter. This was a year ago, and I&apos;m still being billed. I am about to cancel my credit card for the sole purpose of stopping this $10.00/month charge. I wish I had found this sight before I got scammed. Thank you for setting up this page.

Hello,

I have three of his books and just finished the third book weight loss cure. All three books have what I would call 75% nothing and should be removed with only 5% of actuall info that might be usefull. I have been to several seminars where they are trying to sell you something and most of the info is just hipping you up so you will buy their service. Reading his books are the exact same thing all hipe. My suggestion is if you want his book buy it on amazon through the used book sections or through ebay. This way you can read it for yourself and make your own judgments and kevin t never recieves any money from your purchase. I do believe that some of the things mentioned are correct and should be followed. I am still researching this HCG. I would really like to talk to several people who have actually tried this injection either for the full 6 weeks or partial because of problems.

Trudeau is, of course, less than meets the eye. Since that has been made abundantly clear, let me focus instead on two more people who fit the same definition or worse.

The first is Dr. Stephen Barrett. A judge in California ruled that this quack of all quacks was a biased witness nor was he an expert as he had claimed.

Barrett, who made his living by suing innovative physicians and getting them to settle out of court, recently got another judge to clobber him in his home town no less.

Among other things, Barrett claimed he was a legal expert, although he has never been to law school let alone never passed the bar in any state.

The man operated his bogus quackwatch organization, which is in the process of going belly up to pay off judgments against it, out of the basement of his home. Years ago, when he was in his heyday, I called his office and guess who ansered the phone...he did. The guy apparently doesn&apos;t even have a secretary or a receptionist. Yet he has caused more harm with his particular brand of quackery than any single person in the US.

The next person whose record is less than stellar is jnohn Stossel himself. He did a report on organic food claining it was no different than food grown using pesticides, etc.

An organic food organization sued. They sued because the basis for the report was non existent. ABCNEWS in a decision that is unprecedented in network television, aired a 7 minute apology on four separate occasions on 20/20!

It&apos;s clear that ABCNews realized that they would lose the case in a huge way or they never would have used 28 minutes of their valuable air time to correct the bogus Stossel report.

In the end, we have three kettles and pots with Trudeau, Barrett and Stossel.

The best to you.

I bought the book as it contained info on Autism and diets. Well, Autistic children don&apos;t eat all kinds of foods and I could see I was going to have a problem so I tried several times to contact the Dr listed in the book about how to get through this, no reply. Didn&apos;t bode well with me.

I have read three of Kevin&apos;s books, and they seem prety logical to me. In fact, some of the information that I&apos;ve been reading on these books seems to be ahead of it&apos;s time. There has already been on the news and newspaper covers and magazines information that he published in his book months and almost years before! People don&apos;t dislike him because of his background, people dislike him because he is telling us information that we seemed to believe for years, nobody likes to be told that all of the lectures that they got in college or from a doctor are wrong. Food can cure, and so can natural alternatives.

I too fell into his propaganda and bought his book thinking I would find out all of these secrets, apply them to my life and my families. UGH! It&apos;s all BS. If I remember correctly one part of the book he recommends getting 15 clonics in 15 days. Now I was very interested in this because I have a strong tie to colon cancer in my family. So I set up an appointment to have this done. When I waws leaving I asked to set up another appointment the next day. The lady who administered the colonic told me a person should only get them every couple months because it&apos;s possible to OVER-hydrate your body causing possible heart problems (if anyone could confirm this ..thanks). So yeah, Kevin Trudeau could have killed me.

Whatever the case, Kevin makes valid points about the gov. I&apos;m not sure about area 51, but I do believe in the things that are being put in our food. People you can be naive if you want but, keep eating Mc Donalds and see what happens.

I used Kevin Trudeau&apos;s methods and lost 10 pounds. A faster way to loose weight is to eat raw fruits and veggies, when you cook food you loose enzymes, that is why kevin says to take enzyme pills, they help your food break down. Want to know what works the best is to become a Vegan. Quit eating animal products, they make you sick-

Hello,

I read his book, some if it is good, some of it is questionable, and some of it is bull. But, that is by my rating system. Other may find it horrible or wonderful. I think people need to think and not expect others to think for them. On the whole his books have done far more good than bad.

The sad thing is that he is a prediator to people who may have serious issues about dieting. We regulate the drug makers but allow this type of fraud to continue. Hoepfully someone will stop this guy.

I cannot believe the negativity around this book either. Use your heads people. Some of the information in the book is common sense. Some of it is a bit of a stretch. Americans need to take responsibility for their own thoughts and not be relying on anyone to do the thinking for them. This is pathetic.

Didn&apos;t he claim to find a cure three for four books ago. I brought his first book and it&apos;s on the shelf collecting dust. It was so complicated and hard to rmember. He claims to have the cure to weight loss, ADD and many other things and then jumps ship and goes a different direction in each book. Stop looking for a quick fix and just accept yourself the way you are or cut down. There is no magic. You know what you eat is not good for you if you eat too much. He has the power from people who are weak and looking for someone to guide them, look within and have a little talk with God. He always has the answers. He made you look like that for a reason. Deal with it.

This is a great source to inform would-be customers to watch out. I was tempted to buy this guy&apos;s book and even knew he was considered a&quot;crook&quot;already - he&apos;s just that good of a marketer. While some of his messages might be sound, I choose not to do business with people I don&apos;t trust.

This is a classic case of&quot;don&apos;t shoot the messenger, burn him instead&quot;! All he does is go out and grab well known information and then wrap it up into a wold goose chase. He is like a free porn banner that just keeps taking you on a ride ( whoops, I mean that is what i&apos;ve heard about free porn ads). There is no secret to weight loss. Energy out must exceed energy in for weight loss. That is it. Exercise increases energy out, Whoppers increase energy in. Water...water water water!
 
 quotations   4 years ago from Canada Level 2 Commenter 
 
Weightloss or preventing weight gain is not difficult: just don&apos;t eat too much, and exercise enough so that you burn more calories than you take in. That&apos;s it.

Anyone who tries to sell you a magic bullet saying that you can kill fat with a pill or a secret ingredient is appealing to our lazy side that hopes we can be skinny and still eat what we want and sit in front of the tv all day. It doesnt work that way.

Beware of all infomercial cures for being overweight, not just this one. Instead, if you want to lose weight you will have to work at it: get active, eat right.

No one got fat in a few days, and no one who is overweight will lose the weight in a few days. It takes time. If anyone tries to sell you anything, even if it&apos;s a prescription, let alone a product from somebody with no medical degree, -- run!

hey john, could you please give me some details about this diet proposed by simeon? i would really appreciate it. or just tell me where i can read about it for myself. thanks so much
 
 John  4 years ago
 
Dr. Simeon wrote an article in 1954 called&quot;Pounds and Inches.&quot;This article formed the basis of Trudeau&apos;s book. All he did was add unnecessary bells and whistles. The original Simeon protocol works, and it works just exactly the way Simeon says it does. You can in fact lose a pound a day on the diet. I know, I tried it and it worked, just exactly the way Simeon said it would. Furthermore the weight does not come back. I suppose you could force it back but eating normally, the weight will stay gone.

Trudeau has a very checkered past. I have no idea where he learned of Simeon&apos;s work, but regardless of Trudeau&apos;s questionable character, the real asset is Simeon&apos;s protocol. Do not throw the baby out with the bath water. The Simeon protocol is worth all the trouble you might spend to do it. I recommend you do not follow the foolish additions that Trudeau added to the protocol.

Hi Maddie, First it is Wu-Yi tea simply a variety of green tea called oolong tea served in many chinese restaurants. Wu-Yi tea is just a scam as your hub page is full with comments. Some how Kevin Trudeau is still in business even he is convicted scam artist. Your hub is very interesting, well written&amp;I am sure many people will benefit from this hub. Hope to see more hubs from you.

Wow! He has provided a lot of information. As with all things, scrutinize the remedies he offers as with the US legal and medical establishments, and use remedies that will benefit you. I will support freedom of choice and the Trudeau&apos;s of the world right to present information when compared to our legal and medical establishments that suppress and intimidate to prevent freedom of choice.

I&apos;m sure that Mr. Trudeau makes a ton of money. If that is the yard stick by which we condem, what about your last Dr visit when you were told to go home and drink lots of fluids you probably have a bug $200+ for 5 minutes (if your lucky). Or, I think your abdominal pain or headache is of the xyz variety or a syndrome (meaning not a clue what the problem is) so I want you to try this prescription. $200-thousands depending on the procedures and tests. Ever ask your doctor why the drug if the cause is not known or understood? Read the warnings on the Rx-talk about problems!

Bottomline-in the US our access to alternative legal and medical practices leave us shackled and obliged to be subjected often without choice. You may want to open your eyes and understand that more sickness, cancer etc generates billions of dollars, the same applies to conflict and the legal system. You will pay, if you can afford it and will be certain of the following:

1. You will not be guaranteed a successful outcome

2. You will pay an outrages bill, die or suffer because you can&apos;t or be bankrupt!

My vote is the American dream (dream only!) to have a freedom of choice and punish the criminal minds that violate and deceive at all levels of society.

If you believe you have a choice check out the AMA, Bar Associations and others that have created the&quot;unauthorized practice&quot;law sanctions that eliminate our freedom of choice and have silenced many!

My advice to you is take nothing for granted and make choices based on the best information you can find, research for yourself. Studies and opinions verify that support can be established for pro and con on almost every issue!!!!!!!

YOUR SUCCESSES WILL BE A RESULT OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL VIGILENCE.

Another great hub. It sounds like the guy&apos;s just a shady marketer preying on one of the largest groups of desperate people seeking a miracle fix ... the easiest people on the planet to sell to.

He probably didn&apos;t even author the materials. And with such a huge market and low product cost, he knows that even if 90% of buyers request a refund, he&apos;ll still be raking in the cash.

But in reality, for one reason or another, most disappointed consumers never ask for a refund. Make them jump through a few hurdles to get one, and many who intended to get a refund let it slip until they realize they&apos;re out of time.

In response to&quot;Jerry&apos;s&quot;comment 3 months ago. I also received a letter for an absolutely FREE Membership Invitation Form as I am so special to receive a 56-page booklet containing 2300 yr old secrets of the Nouveau Tech Manuscript. Regarding me becoming a member of a&quot;Secret Society,&quot;and that he endorces it because he too is a member. Where&quot;they guarantee the deliverance of great amounts of success&amp;wealth, large amounts of money, absolute love, sincere happiness, and the best of health.&quot;

The letter sounded as if it where a special cult Society. It was really stranged when he along with the 4 page letter related to 2300 year old information that are contained in a special manuscript, so I immediately destroyed the information. I hope he is not mixed up in cult activities. Trudeau sounds so sincere. Be very careful readers.

I bought the book last night and actually bought several of the items mentioned in Phase I. When I called my doctor this morning ( I go to a Naturopathic doctor) and he said he would not prescribe hCG to anyone. He told me it was against his ethics and morally wrong. When he explained to me what the hCG is, it made me sick to my stomach. And it really made me sick to think that Kevin Trudeau is out walking the streets. He is a big time fraud and should be banned from T.V. AND publishing. I read about 1/2 of the book last night and I didn&apos;t get anything out of it except that he lost weight and could all he wants now. So What!!! Does the man have a conscience at all. I guess not after reading all that I have today about him. What is wrong with our country that we let frauds like him make millions of hard earned dollars while telling a lie to make that money? Personally I am going to call everyone I know (including all the local bookstores) and tell them NOT TO PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!!

Lots of good comments here. I have been associated with the wellness and nutrition industry long enough to know many of Kevin&apos;s comments and suggestions about food choices and much of what&quot;ails&quot;America are supported by other credible sources. That advice alone would help anyone to lose weight and feel better. We do eat too much food with sugars and other things (antibiotics, growth hormones, etc) that are not healthy.

The hcg stuff is scary for me. I would have to know a lot more before I started that protocol. I do not question the potential conspiracy theories, but due to the way kevin seems to operate the cloud of suspicion over him is no better... adding great suspicion to his suggestions as well.

A dear friend has followed the food advice and lost a lot of weight WITHOUT the hcg. As one person said, if we all made better food choices, exercised and also addressed our emotional needs, we would all be healthier and thinner.

By the way, you can either buy HCG online, or talk to your doctor about the diet and he/she can give you a prescription for it if they will help you monitor your progress.

I agree with Marko, you have to realize that these products are not Kevin Trudeau&apos;s. They are just products that he promotes. He has never said that HE came up with the answer. He has just compiled the answeres together. Don&apos;t put so much weight and importance on one man. Do your own research to find out if what he says is true. He&apos;s the first to tell you that he&apos;s an entreupenuer and wants to make money, but he doesn&apos;t have to lie to do it. He&apos;s not hurting anyone. Don&apos;t be so ignorant. . . . do your OWN research. You really don&apos;t have to pay him to do it for you. If he&apos;s taking your money, that&apos;s on you.

 Gabriel  4 years ago
 
Hey Jove, do you know how many people have been led down by their insurance company? Do you know how many people suffered from this. Most people see Kevin as an evil character that takes all of your money, in reality&quot;all of these people that are getting their money taken from their credit cards&quot;are a very small number of people. You can not acuse Kevin of a thief because of technical difficulties.

Even though I belive that people should not bee seen as a number, and that Kevin&apos;s company should get away with missing money, it is not fair to acuse him as a thief from such a small number of mistakes to success.

I think reading my comment will be very helpful to all individuals although they are mainly my personal and not professional viewpoints.

People either like or hate Kevin Trudeau that’s a fact, he spends his time smashing the drug companies and the whole system. This is why I like him! He is like another Michael Moore trying to expose truths. Don’t stop reading now…I’m not all for him! Do I think the information he provides is 100 % accurate? NO. Do I think his studies are 100 % proven? NO. So then why do I still partially support him if he is a fraud? The reason for this is that many of his clams are accurate. The drug companies are out to make money and make people sicker. At the same time herbal remedies can cure any disease, if you deny this then you’re an idiot. The reason for this is because herbal remedies come from the earth. Humans don’t even know the potential of most of the plants on the earth. One can cure cancer while another can cure aids. The point is some herbal remedies work but in a different way than drugs, maybe they don’t work for all individuals but for some they will work. At the same time Drugs can be beneficial as well at times of need. Without many of these drugs we could not survive. Case in point: You should not choose a side whether you like or hate Kevin Trudeau or the drug companies. The fact is they are both out to make money. Take the time to educate yourself and others of things that do work. Don’t be brain washed by anyone 20/20, Kevin Trudeau, or anyone else, THINK FOR YOURSELF! Don’t feel like you can’t read his books, just take peoples advice at face value. Try and test out everything for yourself and stay educated. Many calms Kevin Trudeau makes are proven to work for some but wont for others. Testimonials will always differ due to individual circumstances. Don’t hate people for trying even if they are getting rich off of it. Put yourself in his position, If you had a health potion would you just promote it because you’re a nice person, or also because you want to gain from it personally. Don’t answer that! We all want some gain from it whether you can admit it or not. Once again the point is to Take the time and educate yourself and stop choosing sides only then will you learn that both natural medicine and regular drugs can be beneficial. I hope this article was helpful to you! Sorry about my poor style of writing!

I bought the book nd it is a waste of money. After reading the things you should do 30 days before the diet, I thought to myself, there is no possible way to get this accomplished. It mentioned getting a colen cleansing every day, drinking certain teas, No tap water? etc. There are 40 something different things that it says to do(most of them daily) for the first 30 days. The shots alone are enought to cause concern. I read most of the book the first night I got it and decided the next day to return it...I hope I get my money back from their&quot;money-back guarantee&quot;.

Being healthy is not just about who goes to the doctor the most, or who takes the most vitamins to stay&quot;healthy&quot;. It&apos;s also about mind wellness, and mental health. Kevin educates you with facts and backs them up. He is not a crook, nor a thief he es enforcing his right of free speech.

If you arn&apos;t interested don&apos;t buy. Just like a car do a little research!!! A friend of mind recently started the program - not all of his advice but most i.e. no trans fats, no artificial sweeteners, plenty of water, no fast foods etc etc etc. He has lost 65 pounds in 6 weeks our busy life-style restricts us from doing every thing in the book but, we used a little common sense and it&apos;s working.

I was just watching his infomercotial on his weight loss book also. I got interested and decided to check the all reliable internet for info on him and his books. Although in the past I order his Natural Cures book. I think a lot in that book does help. We have tried many things and have seen a difference in health. Anyway, I have heard so much on this site about people losing so much money to his books and newsletter. You know what? I bought his book on ebay, an ebook but still everything in the hard cover version. I paid $1.00 for it and it contains everthing you all have paid much more for. So buyer beware. If you don&apos;t want to spend so much money on something, then do a little research and you can find it cheaper every time. If I want to read his weight loss book without having to spend two hours in a book store, again I&apos;ll probably go on ebay and buy it for $1.00

I made the mistake of ordering one of his books using my credit card, and they took my credit card information and started sending me the &quot;Natural Cures Newsletter.&quot; I wrote to them telling them to not send it any more but my request was ignored.  The newsletter continued to come.  They would charge me every month for $9.95.  Then they charged me with an amount of $21.00 and I don&apos;t know what that was for.  It was impossible to get in touch with them.  I tried many numbers but they lead to voicemail recordings or they did not answer.  I told my bank about it and I had to cancel my credit card/change the number, because they told me that they had no control over that company charging bills to me, and that they could not block it.  Whoever it is that is running that company, is a crook.  They are doing it on purpose, I think, to see how much money they can accumulate dishonestly....possibly to pay his millions in debts?

I have read two of Kevin&apos;s books, and recently, like many others have been, was interested in this weight loss cure. I read through some of his book at the store and what concerns me, is not whether or not his cure is true, but that he completely misrepresented this weight loss &apos;protocal&apos;. He states in his infomercial things like exersize is not necessary for the weight loss...that the protocal is &apos;easy&apos;, &apos;simple&apos;....the list goes on. If you read the protocal, it is anything but easy...it is anything but cheap, not to mention that he has exersize inculded in the protocal. I guess I am not totally discounting some of his points, but I have to take serious pause when someone so blatently mis markets his product. What he should have said is &apos;here is the research that I have to back this up. You are going to have to fork out the cash, change every habit you currently have, and it is going to be damn hard...but this is what I think works.&apos; That is honesty, and I appreciate honesty..but it is rare to find that in someone who is selling something, isn&apos;t it?

You know what? Most of us on here reading these posts are sitting at our computers (probably with a snack) when we should be out on a bike ride or going for a walk! Myself included. There is a lot of crap available in the US -- we have more books, CDs, DVDs, fitness gyms, diets, etc, etc, etc than any other country&amp;we continue to have the most obese people in our country. The problem is that we have all gotten used to convenience&amp;quick fixes. We all really know what we NEED to do = eat right&amp;exercise. There isn&apos;t any quick fix that will work for everyone. We need to do a self-examination&amp;find where we can improve personally. For me, I want to become the kind of person who does what is good for me, not just what is easy. I want to be a healthy woman, a good example for my daughters&amp;have the satisfaction of knowing that I am those things because I decided to be a better person&amp;do what I NEED to do, not just what I want to do. I have struggled with being overweight my whole life&amp;I can blame all kinds of things, but the truth is I am the only one responsible to change MY habits. I suggest, instead of spending our money on Kevin&apos;s books (even if they do have some good info in them), try doing some research on personal growth. Find out, for yourself, what you need to do to become better ... not better than anyone else, just better than you were yesterday. Make better choices, set a good example for whoever may be watching you (children, friends, spouse, etc.)&amp;stop looking for the miracle cure. YOU are your own cure! I am tired of my children paying the price for my procrastination. I do want to be thinner&amp;I want to set a healthy example for my girls ... but that is up to ME, not Kevin Trudeau. I hope my thoughts can make someone out there decide to be a better YOU. I&apos;m going to take my 4 year old for a bike ride! Enjoy your day&amp;make good choices!

Kevin is trying to alert the public that the government doesn&apos;t want you to know the truth. Weight loss is only one subject, there are many more subjects to also be concerned about such as all the additives to foods and Gmo products that will forever change our bodies if we do not pay attention. These additives make americans fatter not thinner and increase cravings for foods, increase cancer risks and decrease the bodies immunity towards disease. Read the book seeds of deception by Jeffery M.Smith for a better understanding of what we are facing as a nation and as a people.The FDA is supposed to protect the public however they are in league with the food and drug companies, it is all about money. I myself have lost weight on Kevin&apos;s recommendations. Go Kevin go! Character assination is a sure sign that you are on the right track. Detoxing one&apos;s body is away to return to health.

I Belive that Kevin Tradeu is protected by the first amandment. There is no reason for him to be locked up, for he is only exprecing his opinion. He even says in the begining of his book that all of the cures in his book are not his, they are only the research reports gathered over a period of time.

Every one in this life has the will to make money we can not critisize an individual on just the information that it&apos;s provided here, I belive that in order of having a good case against Kevin you have to learn more about his background, but not only the bad and red information, in my opinion in order for you to relly know him is by buying his book, or at least go through it a little bit at a book store.

The bottom line is... if you think he&apos;s only into your money and he is rotting in fortune, why don&apos;t you take a look at a owner of an aspirine company... Kevin will look like an ant in comparison of the guy with the aspirine.

I think Trudeau should be locked up. Yes, maybe some of the stuff he mentions works, but you could have gotten the same info from someone else and not had to pay anything. If his&quot;cure&quot;works, then why won&apos;t any of the&quot;believers&quot;or his website give you the information, why do you have to buy the book? After reading the comments of people from 4 different websites and now watching the video, I will never buy any of his products and I will continue to spread the word to others NOT TO BUY THIS MAN&apos;S BOGUS PRODUCTS!!

How stupid can I be, huh? I&apos;ve got an M.A. in Education. I bought Trudeau&apos;s&quot;Natural Cures&quot;book and agree 100000% with those on this post who say the book didn&apos;t have ANY info in it. It didn&apos;t. I read it cover to cover and kept thinking, wait, he said the book would have the cures in it. It did not...I want to lose some weight so late last night, while channel surfing, I landed on his weight loss cure infomercial and wanted to buy the book today. So I ask again, how stupid can I be?!?!?!? LOL. I already have a book by him that&apos;s not worth the paper it&apos;s printed on. Like the 20/20 video clip you have on this topic, 10% of the book is common sense and the other 90% is pure quackery.

Well, I&apos;m not going to buy his weight loss cure book and maybe I&apos;m not that stupid after all. I knew enough to google him and his weight loss cure before buying it and smart enough to land on several web pages, including this one, so that now I can make my informed decision: The man is a quack and as a writer myself I&apos;m almost sorry the freedom of speech thing doesn&apos;t apply to books written by crooks like him.

However, a lot of what is in the book is actually very helpful and works. I have lost weight and I do lead a healthier life because of the information in his book. The info made me reevaluate some of my eating habits and lifestyle decisions. If you research a lot of the things the book recommends, they do make sense and lead to a healthier lifestyle. I did not sign up for his website, but I did buy his second book and found that to be a HUGE disappointment. I would recommend his first book to any of my family and friends, but I would also say not to buy anything from him or sign-up for his website because I believe them to be just another sales tactic for him to make more money.

Trudeau&apos;s advocacy of hCG on healthy humans is grounds for criminal conspiracy prosecution. As a physician specializing in sports medicine, in my practice I have noted its abuse in conjunction with anabolic steroid programs as a counter to AAS depletion (and to effect restoration) of testosterone. Prolonged hCG use, especially in uncontrolled doses, results in spurious increases in natural testosterone, thereby inhibiting its own production via negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, with potentially unsafe and possibly life-threatening results. There&apos;s a reason the US has banned hCG ... so be safe and eat fewer calories (and spend more through exercise) to lose and maintain body weight. (Anonymous MD)

Kevins weight loss book is based on a proticol by Dr Simeon, he has written a report called Pounds and Inches and this can be found and read for free on the internet. The science behind this proticol is real and does work. However it is not simple or easy it address a real problem with people who have real trouble loosing weight due to larged stored fat reserves and sluggish metabolisms. If you have weight to loose and have tried and failed many times this may work for you. It does require dedication and hard work but it is different then most weight loss programs that can not address the real problems many of us face with the way our bodies metabolize fat. It is not true you can not find it in the US I am currently attending a clinic in Souther California who follows the proticol. There are doctors and clinics you can search them out on the internet. Also the HCG can be bought and used at home you need to do your research. I think the people who say trhis is a scam are mad because they wanted it to be easier pop a pill and thats it. Read Dr simeons proticol and then decide. Finding this , from Kevins book was the best thing I could have done for myself I hope many other find sucess as well.

Look at the history of Kevin&apos;s infomercials ...first he lost his weight with natural remedies...then he pushed high protien low carb claimed that&apos;s how he lost weight, now the&quot;CURE&quot;. Which is it Kevin? I wish there was a magic potion but come on how much to do have to spend in Bull to wake up. Find a doctor you can trust and follow a sensible program.

Excuse me for being blond....but if this is such great info and works so well then how come none of&quot;YOU believers&quot;posted the secret???? Is this what this country has come too? We have to pay for the secrets??? Did you all charge your friends in the third grade to hear your secrets???? My feelings are that if I came across a sure fire cure for weight loss or cancer I wouldn&apos;t charge people to find out that drinking a glass of prune juice (or whatever these houshold remedies are) to get the cure. we have corrupted America. EVERY TIME WE PAY FOR COMMON KNOWLEDGE WE LET THE BAD GUYS WIN...WE GO BROKE AND THEY GET RICH...When are WE going to stop the cycle????

Great article. I&apos;ve got to say that everything has to be taken with a grain of salt. I enjoyed some of his other books, some ideas there were valid, some other ones were a bit too much. I definitely have to say that his books are a marketing tool to get you to sign up for his other stuff that generates&quot;residual&quot;income for him, like the website etc. So get what you can out of it, but please, please, please everyone, don&apos;t take everything you read, hear or see as a FACT. :)

I almost go sucked into his propaganda until I did some on-line research. The criminal background and federal investigations, etc. His conspiracy theories are compelling, but a bit of research punches holes in those theories....kinda like FDR knowing about and allowing Pearl Harbor to happen just to get us into WWII.

Hi, the ONLY way to lose weight is to eat a bowl of healthy cereal for breakfast and a glass of juice, eat a wholewheat tuna or salmon sandwich with very little mayo for lunch, and eat a normal meat and vegatable supper with a glass of juice or milk and don&apos;t eat at night unless it&apos;s a little amount of unbuttered popcorn or a few crackers. If you get hungry in between meals, eat raw veggies. Walk or exercise every day or at least 5 days a week and you will almost see the weight come off. I did it for 6 months and I lost 50 lbs, that was 15 years ago, and I still have the weight off. After a while your metabalism sets itself up so that the weight stays off but you must exercise for 1/2 hour a day at least. Can&apos;t ya all find 1/2 hour out of your 24 hour day to take time for yourself by exercising. That&apos;s very simple, didn&apos;t cost me a dime and it works.

like the majority of the people who responded i am thankful for this website. I was convinced the diet would be my cure until I read this page. I do wonder at times if the government wants him to stop for any wrong reasons. Nah- He seems shady and if this is true, what goes around hopefully will come around to him one day.

Tomcat if you ever write a book I will buy it!

this is not the kiss my ass guy (lol). i just wanted to say that i saw one of Kevin&apos;s infomercials for his weight loss&quot;cure&quot;book and he had me convinced... until i did some research and saw his criminal record stuff on wikipedia. thank god i read this before i went out and bought the book. this guy is a crook. i&apos;m not saying that his stuff doesn&apos;t work, i&apos;m saying that he is shady and falsely advertises. he makes his program sound easy and permanent, but reasearch says that colonics, illegal injections, and 100% organic foods are necessary. all of those things are very expensive and impractical for regular people. hell, i watched the youtube video on this page and they caught him in a blatant lie. so, from this information i have learned that i cannot trust kevin trudeau as far as i can throw him. i guess i&apos;ll have to stick to what i&apos;m currently doing- eating better and exercising. thanks for the article!

Just read what he says in the weight loss cure book. I am not from this country but in my first month living in the USA I gain 25 pounds. What he says in his book about the food that is been sold in the USA is truth. Just read it, It does make sense.

Thank you for saving me from a very well orchestrated scam!

I was starting to buy into it all when Kevin made the claim of losing a pound a day! Even if some readers did lose so quickly, this is in no way healthy, and very risky to say the least. The only thing Kevin&apos;s protocol will cure is HIS financial worries, they will no longer exist, if people continue to be dupped!

Remeber the old saying&quot;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!&quot;

Thank you for saving me time and money, I won&apos;t waste my money or my time reading such garbage!

Kieth:

HCG has dangerous side effects, and should NEVER be taken without a prescription, which is what you are suggesting. Importing from Canada is illegal, and dangerous. Please read my hub on prescription weight loss medications:

I can&apos;t believe all the negativity around his products. Have you tried any of his cures? I have. I also have his newest book&quot;the weight loss cure&quot;and it DOES work. You CAN get HCG if you just do a little research hmmm... a canadian website maybe? hint, hint.....

I like a lot of what topcat says but not all cravings are psychological. Some are physical which clear with detoxing and or simple fasts. I did not like his first book because it was promising so much and never seemed to give an answer. It was very confusing and no specific herb or solution was offered for each condition. I know that the drug companies are corupt and make the cigarrette companies look like amatures. Don&apos;t take me wrong some drugs save peoples lives daily but corruption and misinformation is rampant in this area. I may just spend a short amount of time reading his book at the store to see if it is worth it.

The truth about being overweight, for everyone, is a disconnection between what we eat, how we feel about ourselves, and how much exercise we get. What makes the problem so difficult is that everyone&apos;s body is different and so it&apos;s a problem that issolates us. Kevin Trudeau feeds off everyone&apos;s need to belong to a well-defined group that has this problem so that he makes people believe that one cure fits all! And, ladies, we all know that just like pantyhose, one size never fits all. If you&apos;re overweight, don&apos;t look at it from the perspective of&quot;it&apos;s not my fault&quot;because sweetheart, you own it regardless. Take the opportunity to launch a process of self-discovery and be honest with yourself. Look at the stress factors in your life. See if you can link the irritation of those factors to overeating. If so, address the cause and gain control over the stressor. Be honest about the food choices you make and your grocery buying practices. If you surround yourself with food that is contributing to your weight, then eliminate those foods, but replace them with things that go&quot;crunch&quot;or things that make you say&quot;mmmmmm&quot;but are healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables fit this catetgory. When you start putting vitamins and fibre from these items back into your diet, then your hypothalmus, Trudeau&apos;s appetite stimulating gland, then your body begins to&quot;heal!&quot;Never rob yourself of calories. Girls, all our body can handle is 500 calories in one meal. The rest gets stored. Don&apos;t miss a meal and make sure your breakfast has close to the 500. Robbing the body alerts the hypothalmus and away it goes. Last comment here....Trudeau talks about non-stop gnawing hunger. He lies about that, for sure. When you have gnawing hunger accompanied by a churning stomach, and perhaps a feeling of nausea, your body is telling you to replenish because your running on&quot;fumes!&quot;Other times that you feel&quot;hungry,&quot;stop and do a systems check to see if it really is the genuine hunger or is it a different sensation centred in your abdominal area that says&quot;I need something to eat!&quot;This is a feeling that is different from hunger. I&apos;ve asked myself about this feeling. It sends me off to the kitchen to see if I can find something&quot;good&quot;to eat. I honestly believe that this&quot;I need something to eat&quot;is linked to human&apos;s need for oral stimulation which, in our mother&apos;s arms, we learned that our problelms were remedied by oral stimulation be it a bottle of milk, our mother&apos;s breast, or a soother shoved in our mouth to stop us from fussing. Why else would we eat an entire box of cookies or chips? Again, those stressors cause us to be uncomfortable and this discomfort needs attention. Our body is trying to help by making us feel&quot;the need&quot;and so we comfort it with oral stimulation. I&apos;ve struggled all my life having been a fat toddler, fat adolescent, fat teenager, and fat adult. I&apos;ve weighed as much as 300 lbs, but I have learned to respect my body, get in touch with it, listen to what it&apos;s saying, and challenge the truthfulness of what I think it means. Keep at it folks, you&apos;re worth it and deserve to have the life you want. There are no quick fixes and Kevin Trudeau and others like him will feel off of you just as surely as he is accusing drug companies, pharmaceutical companies, and governments.

I ALWAYS knew Trudeau was a lying bastard !!! Just look at this scumbags eyes in the informercial he is LYING !!!!! And making millions doing it .. Our gov. sucks to not stop this criminal bastard !!

Could Trudeau be banned and talked against because he is actually telling the truth? I am not for or against him at this time. I trying to read all I can and make an educated decision. I recently purchased the diet cure book, but after looking ahead a little bit, I am discouraged from reading it all. How do you get the HCG in this country? What and where do you get some of the treatments? Who can afford all the massages he wants you to get. Again, its for the rich man. If you are not rich, you don&apos;t get to benefit.

 Maddie Ruud   5 years ago from Oakland, CA Hub Author 
 
James: I&apos;m sorry you feel the need to insult... whoever it was you were trying to insult, be it myself or the others who commented here.  I am truly glad you feel &quot;better,&quot; but I stand by my recommendation that readers steer clear of Trudeau products, if for no other reason than false advertising:

The book claims to contain cures, when in fact it recommends products made by the company, and requires that you sign up for his website for &quot;full access, and that, upon doing so, the site bills you recurrently for a newsletter that&apos;s virtually impossible to cancel.

Kiss my ass. I got cured with his advice. Results are all that matter, not who&apos;s theory make more sence

I had my doubts when I saw him on a different infomercial selling a different product - in no way health related. I figured he was a saleman and nothing more. Certainly not a health expert.

I saw a huge stack of his books at the local bookstore, like it was selling like hotcakes. I did a similar search and found out he&apos;s a crook.
