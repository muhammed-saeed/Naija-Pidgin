View Full Version : Not 3% or 5% but now 1% Cashback Mastercard 
 
 Pages : [ 1 ] 2 3 batcave Jan 4th, 2006, 12:32 AM I was in Dragon Centre (?) at the southwest corner of Dundas and Spadina in the post office picking up an online purchase this evening. While leaving I noticed a Canadian Tire Mastercard display. It didn&apos;t say much but as I was walking by, I heard one of the salespeople pitching a 4% cashback Mastercard - that made me stop.

I don&apos;t know if it was true because they didn&apos;t have any marketing materials in English - they were all in Chinese! I can speak but not read.

If this is true, it sounds like it would be a good deal!

I&apos;m going to phone the customer centre tomorrow and I&apos;ll post what I find here.

Update 1.4.06 6pm: Okay, I called CT customer service today to inquire if the cashback Mastercard is a legitimate offering. The operator didn&apos;t have any details about it and went and asked a supervisor. When she came back, she said it is called the Cash Advantage Mastercard and it is a cashback card. She nor the supervisor had any details about the card and said it would be available in the next month or so.

Update 2.13.06: The original 4% offer was a scam. However, as someone mentioned in this thread, the offer is a 3% cashback Mastercard. The details are:

In a billing month, if you spend:
$1500 or more, you get 3%
$500-$1499.99, you get 1%
Less than $500, you get 0.5%

Also purchases at CT stores and online, CT gas bars and Mark&apos;s Work Wearhouse stores, you receive double the value on your purchases towards the reward. It&apos;s paid quartely in January, April, July and October. There is a limit of $1000 for the reward in a year, so the maximum spend on this card is about $30,000.

Right now, it only available in Whitby, Oshawa, Pickering (ON) and Red Deer (AB) as a pilot. It will be generally available later this year.

Update 3.7.06: I managed to get my hands on an application a few weeks back. Apparently it doesn&apos;t matter where you live. They are only giving out the applications in stores in the areas listed above. I received my card in the mail today!

For the first month after activation, I&apos;m guaranteed 3% cash back (even if you spend less than $1,500). After that, the regular rules apply (see update 2.13.06). I acually got 3% cash back for about 5 weeks because I activated the card on the 8th of the month I received it and the billing period was on the 15th. So for the first week and the next month I was a guaranteed 3% cash back, regardless of how much I spent. The following billing period, the regular rules (update 2.13.06) apply.

Update 5.2.06: Someone had some questions about the card.

There is no fee for this card.

The cash back amount is calculated for a billing period (mine ends on the 15th of the month) and is paid out four timex per year in Jan, April, July and October. It&apos;s paid out as a credit on the statement.

Here&apos;s a image of the brochure courtesy of crxmugen: Cash Advantage MC (http://www.geocities.com/crxmugen2000/advcash1.JPG)

Update 5.11.06 Application Link: http://www.ctfs.com/english/cashadvantage/index.html

A Platinum Cash Advantage Card is also available for a $99 annual fee. The reward structure of this card is:

In a billing month, if you spend:
$3,000 or more you get 5%
$1500-2,999.99, you get 3%
$500-$1499.99, you get 1%
Less than $500, you get 0.5%

Update 9.27.06

It&apos;s been reported (http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=238544&amp;page=109&amp;pp=15) that CT is no longer offering (temporarily?) this card to new applicants. Stay tuned...

Update 10.12.06

Cardholders can now check their balance and transactions online! :D

Update 3.22.07

The program lives on! I received my renewal card recently; it expires in 2009.

Update 4.03.07

As told by LeafsRBest (http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4893097&amp;postcount=1950)...

Buh bye 3%!

Starting May 16th, the maximum cash back is 1%.
This great card now becomes another crappy card.
I&apos;m not sure if the Platinum card is affected.

New rewards schedule:

$1000 or more: 1%
$250 to $999.99: 0.5%
$0 to $249.99: 0.25%

:cry:

Update 4.04.07

As reported by zhewie (http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4899239&amp;postcount=2021), the 5% platinum MC is now 1% also. :cry: anandwww Jan 4th, 2006, 12:34 AM No. For that matter i have not seen any cash back card in canada (capital one offers something but its not valid in quebec though) Sash[DSL] Jan 4th, 2006, 12:38 AM I highly doubt it. At best it is 4% cashback in Canadian tire money. Most likely something like 1% cashback on first 2000, 2% on 3000 after that, 3% on 5000 beyond that and anything beyond 10000 gross purchases gets you the 4% in canadian tire coupons.

She said it was a straight 4% cash back. It might be the same as the Gas Advantage card where you spend $1000 in a month and the next you get $0.10 off per litre of gas the next month.

Maybe I have to spend $1000 in a month (which is every month for me) and I will get 4% of my purchases in the following month. I&apos;m expecting some sort of sliding scale - ie. spend $500 per month, get 2% back, etc. anandwww Jan 4th, 2006, 12:47 AM Cashback card have been in Canada for years.

i guess if you&apos;re a Canadian PR or citizen, it&apos;s easier to track you down and get back the money if you don&apos;t pay your bills (or sue you), guess they assume you&apos;ll be stuck living here (hm... or can they somehow be entitled to your gst credits until your debt is paid off or you die? :lol: )

if you&apos;re not, i guess they&apos;re afraid you&apos;ll rack up a lot of debt then flee the country and it&apos;s harder to track you down

try this Credit Card Cashback Calculator by CalgaryBen, you can see you spent 35000 on Dividend last year. So if you want to earn more this year, apply Amex Costco Platinum 1.5% in top tier or Ultimar Mastercard 1.25% like gman suggested. Amex Gold with cash back. 2% in top tier is not currently available to the public...

CIBC offers a 2% card for ~$40-50/year IIRC. Sounds like it&apos;d be worth it for you. I explored the option when choosing a card, but settled with the one I think you have. (1% sliding scale, no fee) Neil Jan 4th, 2006, 04:42 AM 4% straight cashback doesn&apos;t sound possible and would be pretty amazing. There has to be more to the offer...?

I wonder if it could be 4% in store credits? When you consider store credit might cost CT perhaps half of cash value that&apos;s still a 2% cashback equivalent. 2% cashback would be pretty aggressive compared to the others on CalgaryBen&apos;s list.

If I had to guess, I&apos;d say the 4% must be tiered or capped, say 4% on the first $1000, then lower above that? 4% on the first $1000 is $40 which is a believable amount for an incentive. madman604 Jan 4th, 2006, 04:50 AM i have had the CT card for years now, so far these ar ethe things I have gotten FREE (cad tire $)

I LOVE CT :D mahjongmaniac Jan 4th, 2006, 05:30 AM It says that, but consider this, I&apos;m a student and I have a 10k limit gold visa and a 20k limit unsecured line of credit with TD, and it&apos;s all under my name, nothing joint, and I&apos;m far from loaded, I&apos;m just a couple k over debt free and I&apos;ve always paid my bills on time

So it&apos;s no surprise the guy got it without much questions about his income

:eek:

$30k credit limit ... what?

had u not said u were only a couple k from debt free, i would&apos;ve thought u were $$$loaded$$$... lol

hm... are ur parents loaded or something? :) The Hobo Jan 4th, 2006, 09:05 AM I&apos;m a co-op student at UW in comp eng, and I&apos;m barely hanging in, heh

My parents are FAR from loaded, combined they barely made more than what the average person their age makes, plus it doesn&apos;t matter because everything I do is under my name, I don&apos;t do anything joint

The only thing I&apos;ve ever done is as soon as I turned 18 I got my first 500$ credit card from RBC and I&apos;ve ALWAYS paid my bill in full, the only time I &apos;missed&apos; a payment was when there was a mistake with the website and my actual statement and I was like 3 days late (it was between a move, if you&apos;re a UW co-op student you move every 4 months)

For the curious, I asked RBC if the one late payment would show up on my record and they said they don&apos;t report it to Equifax etc unless you&apos;re more than 90 days late, it just stays internal for 7 years

They also looked at my record and refunded the interest charge

I&apos;ve always been meaning to get my credit report just to see what it says, but you have to mail in a request and stuff and it&apos;s trouble if you move a lot, blah

and I&apos;m not paying 15$

It&apos;s so stupid, if you want your report right away, you can pay and most checks are waived, but if you want it free, which they must give to you by law, you have to do it by mail and provide like n pieces of ID

Edit: actually, on a funny sidenote, I was done with TD cause they screwed up my normal account a long time ago (gave me an adult account with service fees when I was clearly under 19, I was 16) but when I saw the free shuffle thing here on RFD I called PC and opened a 2nd chequing account, and then &apos;switched&apos; my old one, and while I was doing that in branch the woman says&quot;your credit must be good because you&apos;re eligible for a 10 000$ gold visa or line of credit&quot;, so I took them up on the visa. I was only 19 at the time. Only recently did my mother say for some reason TD offered her a ridiculous amount for a LOC for a person with her modest income, so for fun I went in a branch and asked if I was preapproved for anything and he said yeah, a 20k LOC, so I took them up on that, and by now I was/am 20

I&apos;ll never ever use that much, but I figure it can only go up, so I want to see just how far I can take it :twisted:

On a funny note, I was recently at the Casino De Hull (aka Casino du Lac Leamy) in Hull/Gatineau and I thought hmm, I could withdraw the 20k since it&apos;s unsecured and put it all on black and either walk out with 40k or be financially ruined, haha BinaryJay Jan 4th, 2006, 09:43 AM Having a lot of credit is not always a good or wise thing. I have specifically kept my limits low within reasonable use. Having a huge credit limit both puts you at greater risk for fraud headaches as well as increases your calculated credit score due to a greater debt ratio (score is calculated assuming all credit is maxed out).

I would advise anybody to simply obtain the credit they need and not much more. Shifty Jan 4th, 2006, 09:53 AM &apos;(score is calculated assuming all credit is maxed out).&apos;

Not true, unless you are applying for a Leon&apos;s or Futureshop card. I have over $100k in credit limits, with zero balance, and it has never affected my ability to apply for more credit. Debt ratio is based on monthly minimum payments, not limits, by the vast majority of lenders. bacid1 Jan 4th, 2006, 10:05 AM if i call AMEX can i change my current AIR MILES card to the GOLD CASHBACK???

You should check into the CIBC Gold Dividend card. At $33,000, you would probably would have come out ahead. A friend and I did the math on the reg vs gold dividend card a while back.

I have also heard that having a high credit limit affects your ability in getting a mortgage. Shifty Jan 4th, 2006, 11:45 AM Mortgages are based mainly on two things, Total Debt to Service Ratio, and Gross Debt to Service Ratio, both of which factor in payments, not available credit.

They&apos;re not alone, TD had a double rewards promo on their Gold cards for the last quarter upto Dec. 31, but it only applied to new customers.

There are some companies that actually give their existing customers a bonus now and then. Citi and MBNA had promo&apos;s where they gave an extra 1% cash back (or 1% more rebate) for existing customers though... djjosee Jan 4th, 2006, 12:51 PM How do you get invited to the American Express Gold Credit Card?

My mother said the following, and she&apos;s bought a LOT of houses (she just keeps moving...): The only caveat to having an unsecured line of credit is that when you goto apply for a mortgage, since you have this unsecured money available to you, they assume it is maxed out when calculating your debt


Since I won&apos;t be getting a mortgage for a while, I have nothing to worry about Azenha Jan 4th, 2006, 01:02 PM I just called CT and asked them about this 4% cash back offer and they told me that it might only be for new customers. I don&apos;t like this at all since I&apos;ve been with CT for over 5 years now.

I was just on the CT web site and I cannot find any reference to 4% cash-back. In fact, I cannot find any details as to what percentage one gets back in CT in-store money with purchases - both at CT stores and other retailers.

The web site lists the general benefits but offer no particulars (could be 0.1% benefit or 3% benefit, or...). There is simply no detail listed. Very odd... jeeva86 Jan 4th, 2006, 01:14 PM I got the Citi Enrich with 1% CB but with $500 limit as I am a student, do you there&apos;d be anyway I could increase that limit now?

Is there any better card out there without any fees that is better than the Enrich Card? Shifty Jan 4th, 2006, 01:25 PM Hobo - one of my friends is a mortgage broker, and he thinks your mother is wrong on this one. @hmad Jan 4th, 2006, 01:40 PM Yes the Canadian Tire Mastercard does give you Canadian Tire money which you can spend at any Canadian Tire store. My dad has been using it for ages and pays bills with it (usually large ones at 3000+ a month) and he gets quite a bit of Canadian tire money with it. It takes a few months for him to make $200+ in CT money. I don&apos;t think he has actually paid for anything over there after this :lol: gman Jan 4th, 2006, 01:40 PM How do you get invited to the American Express Gold Credit Card?

Since I was already PM&apos;ed by 2 persons regarding Amex Gold invitation, I may as well post it here.

1. It is a no fee card.
2. I believe I was invited by random. Amex may not know I already have other Amex cards. They send the invitation to my office. My Amex address is my home. I don&apos;t think I inform them my office address. If they invite me because I am an old Amex customer, they should have send the mail to my home instead.
3. How did they find me? I assume may be some marketing firm selected me somehow because of subscription, trade show, or whatever. I really don&apos;t know. gimmegimme Jan 4th, 2006, 02:06 PM I was just on the CT web site and I cannot find any reference to 4% cash-back.

I read somewhere (http://home.cogeco.ca/~lotterybuddy/cantire.htm) that the CT money calculation is done like this:
For a purchase between $2.00 and $5.98, you will earn 5 cents (0.8%-2.5%). For every additional $5.99 you spend you will earn an additional 10 cents (0.84%- 1.67%).

That is the calculation for paying by cash/debit/GC/CTM. So if you pay using the CT MasterCard, you&apos;d get 20% more than that.

For purchases using the card besides at Canadian Tire, you get 1% in CT money. alexkidd Jan 4th, 2006, 02:20 PM I have also heard that having a high credit limit affects your ability in getting a mortgage.

I just refinanced my home as I went through a divorce. I have a high credit limit (around $50k in a few cards) and it made no difference at all to the bank. I even asked them if it had any effect and they said no. This was Royal Bank of Canada. bitbrain Jan 4th, 2006, 03:09 PM Since I was already PM&apos;ed by 2 persons regarding Amex Gold invitation, I may as well post it here.

I think that I&apos;ll stick with my CitiBank Master card which gives me 2% cash-back towards the purchase of any vehicle. This can be used towards any new or used vehicle, private sale or retail sale, and it can be any make, model, etc. All I had to do is show a sales receipt and I get a cheque written up for whatever cash back has accumulated over the years.

In fact Redflagdeals recommends it as the best cash-back, non-vendor specific, credit card in the Articles section. csaapproved Jan 4th, 2006, 04:17 PM I&apos;ve completed the info here

The BMO Mosaic card allows you to add the CDW onto your card for an additional fee.

LarryLat Jan 4th, 2006, 04:20 PM CalgaryBen, on you page you&apos;re missing President&apos;s Choice MasterCard / PetroCanada / Sears combination which gives you 6% rewards on gasoline purchases and 2% on everything else that can be paid for with a MasterCard

I did the same and they mentioned the same. I already spent more than 50K on my airmiles card over the last year. Thinking about the $1000 lost because I didn&apos;t have the cash back card is really annoying.

That&apos;s because the President&apos;s Choice / PetroCanada / Sears combination isn&apos;t&quot;cash&quot;back.

Here&apos;s how it works:

Apply for both the Petro-Points membership and Sears credit card.
Link your Sears Card to your PETRO-POINTS membership. Always use your Sears Card to pay for Petro-Canada purchases, and youll automatically earn points in both programs on the same purchase.
Exchange all your PC Points into Petro-Points, then exchange all your Petro-Points into Sears Club points.
Redeem 15,000 Sears Club point for $600 in Sears gift certificates.
Excluding PC Points and other purchases, it will take you at least $10,000 (15,000 / (1 + 10/20)) in gas purchases to get $600 back in rewards. This is a reward ratio of 6%.
You should therefore use your Sears Card wherever you can, e.g., Ontario Place, Bell, IBM, Roots and Coldwell Banker. Excluding Petro-Canada, it will take you $15,000 in Sears Card purchases to earn the $600 gift certificates, for a reward ratio of 4%.
For companies that don&apos;t accept Sears Card, use a President&apos;s Choice MasterCard. You earn 10 PC points for every dollar purchased, which can eventually be converted to Sears Club points, for a reward ratio of 2% ($600 / $30,000).

in a couple of words

1. accumulate PC Points with PC Mastercard on everyday purchases
2. get Petro-Points member card
3. get Sears credit card
4. link Sears card to Petro-Points membership
5. use Sears card to buy gas at Petro-Canada. You&apos;ll get 4% from Sears card and 2% from Petro-Points membership
6. When you have enough PC points transfer them to Petro-Points (1 = 1)
7. then transfer combined Petro-Points to Sears Club points (20 = 1)
8. redeem 15,000 Sears Club points for $600 of Sears Gift Certificates

example:
spend on gas $2,000 and get 2000 Sears Club Points plus 20,000 Petro-Points.
spend $24,000 on everyday stuff and bills with PC MasterCard and get 240,000 PC Points
tranfser 240,000 PC Points into 240,000 Petro-Points
transfer 260,000 Petro-Points into 13,000 Sears Club Points
redeem $600 in certificates.

Total spend $26,000 for $600 in reward value. What in Canada can beat this program? fisheyes Jan 4th, 2006, 05:19 PM re post lovefreefood Jan 4th, 2006, 05:21 PM 4% cash back would be sweet. But the best cash back card I&apos;ve seen so far is 2%. But you are required to pay a yearly fee. Even if there&apos;s a fee associated with getting the 4% cash back card, it would still be worth it (especially if you&apos;re a RFD member). You&apos;ll easily rack up your cc. :D Shifty Jan 4th, 2006, 05:24 PM Thanks for explaining that, both of you.

The problem I have with point rewards is that I always find they keep jacking the required points to get stuff, eroding the value. That, and they can be complex, like this one.

It does sound good, but I think I&apos;ll stick with the cold hard cash(back)! hoob Jan 4th, 2006, 06:10 PM I just refinanced my home as I went through a divorce.

My experience with RBC is that if you hold enough financial product with them (CC, student loan, accounts, etc) with good history in their own records, they don&apos;t even bother looking at credit reports.

When I arranged my mortgage through RBC, there was no Equifax/TransUnion verification done, according to the hard/soft query history section in each of those credit reports. As far as they know, they only looked at my customer history with RBC, and letter of income/employment from my company. flaming homer Jan 4th, 2006, 06:15 PM Total spend $26,000 for $600 in reward value.

All depends if you like to fly or not...

Here is an interesting award for those of you that loves train travel. Spend 20K on MBNA SPG Card, transfer the 20K SPG points to Continental Airlines Onepass, Tranfer that to Amtrak Guest Rewards, redeem for a one-way one-zone bedroom trip, say:

Miami - Boston - family of 3 (superliner cars don&apos;t have family bedrooms)
Seattle - Sacramento - Denver - family of 4 (This trip is 60 hours and costs over US$2500) malaca Jan 4th, 2006, 06:28 PM This thread is for cashback cards. That 6% is not for real money it&apos;s for Sears gift certificates. But Sears can overcharge for most items it sells, so you don&apos;t really get 6% back unless you would have shopped at Sears without the certificates. If the same item can be bought somewhere else for half the price then you really only got 3%&apos;s worth. That&apos;s why 1$ hard cash is better than 1$ gift certificate that forces you to shop at a specific store.

It&apos;s the same thing with that&quot;6%&quot;hotel card. Suppose Sheraton rooms costs around 120$ per night, and a Motel 6 in ON or Auberge des Gouverneurs (Montreal south shore) in QC is like 60$. So if all you need is a bed to sleep and you&apos;re driving on the next day maybe 80$ hard cash is better than that free Hilton night at Dorval airport.

The other thing is how much time you wait until you get your reward. With cash back it&apos;s once a year, with rewards its several years (for most of us) until you&apos;re eligible to get the optimal 6% reward (if it still exists). If you&apos;d get the money faster you could even earn some interest on it instead of giving it to the points company. Also if you cancel the card you lose the points. And with the points you&apos;re forced to get something from their list, if you don&apos;t need anything there though luck. superbb78 Jan 4th, 2006, 07:05 PM in a couple of words

One thing I have to mention is Sears Card is not Sears Master Card. That is what I mixed up before. Only Sears Card reward $600 Sears Gift Cert. Sears Master Card reward other thing. So there is a limitation of using Sears Card. Only PC, Petro, Sears.
To me, Aeroplan Gold card is the best. Although it has $115 annual fee, but it has 9 subsituted cards. My whole family using the AE to get point faster than any other credit cards. Also, if you use more than certain amount, they will honour you $1 for 1.3 point. And sometimes they have special point program. gman Jan 4th, 2006, 07:11 PM This thread is for cashback cards.

Moreoever, they can change the program.

Airmiles changed their exchange rate to GC.
GM Visa changed their rules to buy a car.
SDM changed their rate.
If one of these PCF-&gt;Petro-&gt;Sear link is broken or exchange rate adjusted, it changes the deal ... before you can really use it. batcave Jan 4th, 2006, 07:26 PM Update: The cashback Mastercard does exist!

I have an American Cashback card too. I got it like 6 months ago and I&apos;m already at about $500 in rebate credit (you can&quot;check out&quot;anytime you&apos;d like).
use the dividend platinum card for 2% back. there is an annual fee though. rag Jan 4th, 2006, 09:38 PM I alreay have a CT mastercard, and you need to do some real number crunching to figure out if there is any extra benfit to having this card versus the regular one.

Sidebar note though, that supposedly as a card holder you are &apos;guaranteed the best rate&apos; of gas discount - they had better change that too....although it is already sort of a lie as they sometimes only offer 7x whereas the free calendar has coupons in it for 8x use any time. batcave Jan 4th, 2006, 10:03 PM just called @ 6:34. the gentleman was very helpful

Yes, I know about Gas Advantage card (exists only in southwestern Ontario for now). Actually, it&apos;s for up to $0.10 per litre of gas when you spend $1000 in the prior month. 4% would only be about $0.04 per litre.

Hi, I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re addressing me as I started this thread. I&apos;m not talking about the GAS Advantage card that gives you a discount on gas.

The computer will give you(between $2,000 to $12,000). the most common i&apos;ve noticed among people i&apos;ve helped is $4,000. YOU CAN DO THIS EVERY 90 DAYS.

whatever you enter as income does not have to match your job. what is more important is how clean your payment history with CIBC and your other creditors has been, and how long you have had the card. Nammo Jan 5th, 2006, 01:13 AM Since I was already PM&apos;ed by 2 persons regarding Amex Gold invitation, I may as well post it here.

1. It is a no fee card.
2. I believe I was invited by random. Amex may not know I already have other Amex cards. They send the invitation to my office. My Amex address is my home. I don&apos;t think I inform them my office address. If they invite me because I am an old Amex customer, they should have send the mail to my home instead.
3. How did they find me? I assume may be some marketing firm selected me somehow because of subscription, trade show, or whatever. I really don&apos;t know.

When did you sign up for your card (approx year)?

Back in 1999, the Amex Gold cash back card was available for signing up - but it had an annual fee of $75. I&apos;ve held that card since and have been paying the annual fee...when did they do away with it? Boy, talk about being on the shaft end of grand-fathered. I&apos;ll have to call them up tomorrow!! eliteblaze Jan 5th, 2006, 01:17 AM yah I don&apos;t know why people have more than a handful of cards. can you actually carry/use them on a monthly basis? Any advantage to having so many?

As for 4% that&apos;s unreal. You probably have to carry a balance t oget 4% as transcation fees are like 2.3% now a days. Any job blow who signs up for a merchant account tho costco (yah I know.. costco LOL) can take CC transcations for less than 3% st7860 Jan 5th, 2006, 01:27 AM yah I don&apos;t know why people have more than a handful of cards. can you actually carry/use them on a monthly basis? Any advantage to having so many?



There are many reasons, among them, being a good credit history.

For example, if you have three cards, with $2,000 limits, but during one month for whatever reason you buy a $1800 tv set, and even if you pay off the card within the due date in full, that will mess up your credit report because one of your cards has reached more than about 50% of its credit limit. Having several cards along with higher limits on each allows you to spend money without worrying about reducing your score. One of the factors in calculating a credit score is the ratio of outstanding balance to the credit limit. Also, having many open accounts, and the older they are, raises your score.

And besides, if the bank will give you a card with no fee, take it. By the time you really &apos;need&apos; the credit, the bank won&apos;t give you anything at all. eliteblaze Jan 5th, 2006, 01:45 AM yah your creidt history drops for like 1, 2 months. Hardly significant. Plus the more card you have the higher chance that&apos;ll occur since you can&apos;t have like 20K limits on ALL of them. I know like Amex looks at the other CL of the cards and if you&apos;re stretched out they&apos;ll issue the next card with a $500 limit.

If you have like 2,3 cards with 10-20K I can&apos;t see anyone really requiring much more credit. If you do the amex will let you spend 99,000 without too much fuss if you can support that kind of spending st7860 Jan 5th, 2006, 02:03 AM if AMEX gives you a card with a $500 limit that means something is WRONG with your credit history:


either
a) you have a collection item
b) your balances are too close to the limits
c) your credit cards are too new
d) you have too many finance company accounts
e) you pay late
f) your employment hasn&apos;t been long enough
g) your annual income isnt high enough

The operator didn&apos;t have any details about it and went and asked a supervisor. When she came back, she said it is called the Cash Advantage Mastercard and it is a cashback card. She nor the supervisor had any details about the card and said it would be available in the next month or so.

still hangin back in time, eh? ;) mahjongmaniac Jan 5th, 2006, 03:41 AM just called @ 6:34. the gentleman was very helpful

this is not a CASH Advantage it is GAS Advantage credit card it is 4% back at any CANADIAN TIRE gas booth, (he boasts that that rate will always be better than the options card (4x, 8x, etc) rewards)

and he just gave me a website so read all about it :D

i remember that... it&apos;s been mentioned b4 somewhere here on RFD...

thanks


Not only that, but every time there&apos;s a credit check, it can affect your rating too. IE., if you apply for 3 or 4 credit cards they&apos;ll see the other credit card co&apos;s doing a check on you... which would leave them wondering why you&apos;re applying for so many cards, etc. That&apos;s what my financial advisor had told me.. dmpP Jan 5th, 2006, 08:58 AM For example, if you have three cards, with $2,000 limits, but during one month for whatever reason you buy a $1800 tv set, and even if you pay off the card within the due date in full, that will mess up your credit report because one of your cards has reached more than about 50% of its credit limit.

I&apos;m going to disagree with you on this point... I have had quite a high limit on my cc for quite some time, because I use it for business and personal purposes, I&apos;m usually over my 50%. However, I have always paid the statement balance before the due date. It has never affected my credit rating, or getting a balance increase from my bank. Also, it&apos;s a cash-back card, from TD (TD Gold Elite) and I have NEVER paid the annual fee. I&apos;ve had the card for around 5 years now (don&apos;t recall when I actually got it). Shifty Jan 5th, 2006, 10:43 AM &apos;Btw can anyone tell me if my credit rating gets affected if a credit card issues rejects my application???&apos;

No, the only thing that will show up is an inquiry on your credit report.

I also disagree about the having over 50% on your card statement, no way that will affect your credit score. akito925 Jan 5th, 2006, 11:39 AM i&apos;ll wait till the card is out next month, an I&apos;ll jump on it! and reasearch more info on with the card too. gman Jan 5th, 2006, 11:59 AM I&apos;m going to disagree with you on this point...

You paid the fee through your reward, right? If yes, that means you did pay the annual fee by getting less reward back ... comparing with other cash reward card. dmpP Jan 5th, 2006, 12:07 PM No...

I think he meant
- no annual fee b/c he has TD Select Service
or - no annual fee b/c TD likes him and gives him that

Cashback shows up as a credit on the CC, not sure what his case is, it could be the situation you mentioned. got $99 cashback to pay the $99 annual fee JB4 Jan 5th, 2006, 12:57 PM re post.. sorry LarryLat Jan 5th, 2006, 01:15 PM This thread is for cashback cards. That 6% is not for real money it&apos;s for Sears gift certificates. But Sears can overcharge for most items it sells, so you don&apos;t really get 6% back unless you would have shopped at Sears without the certificates. If the same item can be bought somewhere else for half the price then you really only got 3%&apos;s worth. That&apos;s why 1$ hard cash is better than 1$ gift certificate that forces you to shop at a specific store.

It&apos;s the same thing with that&quot;6%&quot;hotel card. Suppose Sheraton rooms costs around 120$ per night, and a Motel 6 in ON or Auberge des Gouverneurs (Montreal south shore) in QC is like 60$. So if all you need is a bed to sleep and you&apos;re driving on the next day maybe 80$ hard cash is better than that free Hilton night at Dorval airport.

The other thing is how much time you wait until you get your reward. With cash back it&apos;s once a year, with rewards its several years (for most of us) until you&apos;re eligible to get the optimal 6% reward (if it still exists). If you&apos;d get the money faster you could even earn some interest on it instead of giving it to the points company. Also if you cancel the card you lose the points. And with the points you&apos;re forced to get something from their list, if you don&apos;t need anything there though luck.

That&apos;s true what you say about getting back the cold cash instead of limited gift certificates. However, I must say that I have been quite happy with this deal for the past two years. In this period of time we have already redeemed $1,200 in gift certificates, and already have more than enough points for another $600. Not reedeming it quite yet because we want to get more points for another $600.

I think about all those people I know who have been using their Airmiles/points credit cards with annual fees for ages and still can&apos;t easily redeem for plane tickets for their families to fly overseas.

I think that by the end of summer we&apos;ll be able to get another $600 worth of gift cards, and get an LCD TV for our bedroom. MiniDV Camcoder, top-of-the-line vacuum cleaner, LCD TV - all free - not too bad for just using a credit card instead of Interac for three years.

Sears have enough products to choose from. I always do my homework before buying high-ticket items, and Sears will price-match stuff, so I have no worries about that. Besides there are sales, additional coupons, promo points events at Petro-Canada and PC Points stores.

Plus PC MasterCard has a few freebies too:

If there&apos;s no Canadian Tire gas in your area, try the CITI. it gives you 2 cents off Petro Canada Gas, plus you earn petro points with everything you buy. NO annual fee. and you can exchange petro points with Superstore points and vice versa(and possibly exchange sears points as well) FAQ Jan 5th, 2006, 02:10 PM in a couple of words

1. accumulate PC Points with PC Mastercard on everyday purchases
2. get Petro-Points member card
3. get Sears credit card
4. link Sears card to Petro-Points membership
5. use Sears card to buy gas at Petro-Canada. You&apos;ll get 4% from Sears card and 2% from Petro-Points membership
6. When you have enough PC points transfer them to Petro-Points (1 = 1)
7. then transfer combined Petro-Points to Sears Club points (20 = 1)
8. redeem 15,000 Sears Club points for $600 of Sears Gift Certificates

example:
spend on gas $2,000 and get 2000 Sears Club Points plus 20,000 Petro-Points.
spend $24,000 on everyday stuff and bills with PC MasterCard and get 240,000 PC Points
tranfser 240,000 PC Points into 240,000 Petro-Points
transfer 260,000 Petro-Points into 13,000 Sears Club Points
redeem $600 in certificates.

Total spend $26,000 for $600 in reward value. What in Canada can beat this program?

sorry I am a bit confused. Is 600/26000 = 2.3% so the return rate is 2.3% right ? If so , you better off getting AmericanExpress Gold no fee 2% if you can.

How much do spend in a year to get that much back? I took a glance at the PC masterdard and you get 10 points for 1$ spent. Looking at what you can get, 1000 point is basically worth 1$ (50,000 points needed to get a 50$ gift card). That makes it a 1% return on your purchase... Which is not much better than my CIBC dividend.

I want to ditch my CIBC dividend to get something better, but don&apos;t drive a lot so no need for one that gives discount on gas. LarryLat Jan 5th, 2006, 02:28 PM sorry I am a bit confused.

How&apos;s is that AmEx better if it cannot be used for many daily purchases? AmEx is not accepted everywhere. For me a great rewards program must have following conditions:


not being limited to specific places where I have to shop
high-percent of reward value
ability to accumulate points quickly without jumping though hoops
wide range of reward products without inflated prices


I have tons of Petro-Canada gas stations where I live, so I don&apos;t have to drive any extra.
6% at the pump with at least 2% everywhere else - that&apos;s tough to beat
I shop at the same stores where I used to go before using PC MasterCard and Sears Card. I get $600 in gift certificates every 9 to 11 months.

The best point is that I did not change my spending habits, don&apos;t have to worry about membership fee, or membership programs with restrictions and questionable ethical norms. LarryLat Jan 5th, 2006, 02:32 PM How much do spend in a year to get that much back?

I answered that question before. We spend between $25,000 to max of $30,000 to get $600 in Sears Gift Certificates.

$25,000 is a lot for a student budget. But it&apos;s just average for an annual family budget with bills to pay. gman Jan 5th, 2006, 02:56 PM sorry I am a bit confused. Is 600/26000 = 2.3% so the return rate is 2.3% right ? If so , you better off getting AmericanExpress Gold no fee 2% if you can.

they will ask for copy of the insurance and the bill of sale.

They can make you to consider that as a discount but you don&apos;t have to tell him. You can say no in the beginning and then say yes when the deal is sealed.

The GM Visa credit does not hurt his bottom line at all. Actually, it is a bonus if one compares that with credit card deposite because there is no merchant fee.

talk about wandering off topic

I&apos;ve never found Sears particularly enticing. I guess if I could save up $1200 worth of free Sears gift cards I could get a LCD TV .. but that&apos;s a long shot.

For people frustrated by Sears points expiring .. just convert them to PetroCanada points before they expire (no points expiry in PetroPoints)

I usually just transfer all points to President&apos;s Choice and spend them on groceries. Less than maximum payback .. but is for items that I would buy anyway (ie food). treasureseeker Jan 6th, 2006, 03:07 PM Well, but can you buy gift cards by the sears credit card?

If you Sears credit card is one of those (not to be confused with the Sears store card which you can also get to charge Sears purchases), you&apos;re in business mattm Jan 7th, 2006, 12:45 AM I think that I&apos;ll stick with my CitiBank Master card which gives me 2% cash-back towards the purchase of any vehicle. This can be used towards any new or used vehicle, private sale or retail sale, and it can be any make, model, etc. All I had to do is show a sales receipt and I get a cheque written up for whatever cash back has accumulated over the years.

In fact Redflagdeals recommends it as the best cash-back, non-vendor specific, credit card in the Articles section.

That&apos;s the card I have... already $700 racked.

The money does expire within 5 years though, but most people would buy a new vehicle before then. gman Jan 7th, 2006, 12:49 AM That&apos;s the card I have... already $700 racked.

My dad has an AVION cad, he puts all sorts of crap on there. It was due to expire, he told them that if they didn&apos;t drop the annual fee he would go to American Express. They dropped the fee, and he now has a no fee avion card.

You can do the same thing with the interest rates if you (god forbid) carry a balance. You may even have more leverage in this case. You can just say,&quot;lower my rate, or I am going to do a balance transfer to another card&quot;They want to keep earning some interest from you, even if it is significantly lower than their posted rate. gman Jan 7th, 2006, 01:29 AM PC Financial also has a Mastercard that is basically cashback.

There are 2 major difference between point and cash card.

1. cash dividend can be used anywhere.
2. the point vendor can change their point exchange rate when they see fit. red_dealz Jan 7th, 2006, 01:50 AM My apologies. I had to dust off my old calculator, and go through some of the previos responses, but I get it now.

6% is at the petro canada pump if you use your sears credit card - from the combination of the sears points and the petro points.

2% is from the President&apos;s choice master card when you use it to buy everything else

This is all in terms of sears gift cards though.

I think it&apos;s great! Will start doing this tomorrow :)

They&apos;re not gift cards but gift certificates that will expire in 12 months from the date of issue.

Also, you need to buy more than $600 at one time to enjoy the best redemption ratio. LarryLat Jan 9th, 2006, 02:01 PM They&apos;re not gift cards but gift certificates that will expire in 12 months from the date of issue.

True, however, one does not have to redeem $600 in Gift Certificates as soon as points are accumulated. They can stay on the account, until the need for GC arises. It can take up to two weeks to receive GC in the mail once points are redeemed.


Also, you need to buy more than $600 at one time to enjoy the best redemption ratio.
NOT true. GC are send in $100 and $50 denominations (2 x $100, 8 x $50). Therefore the minimum combined purchase at Sears has to be $50. No change is given, and balance over GC amount MUST go on your Sears card. Even with this limitations it&apos;s not much of a hassle, and totally worth it. iExcel Jan 9th, 2006, 02:07 PM NOT true.

Points can only be redeemed in certain increments, let&apos;s say you can get a 50$ certificate for every 1000$&apos;s worth of spending that would make is a so-called &apos;5% reward&apos;. Well if you spend 1400$ you&apos;re not going to get 5% back, you have to wait until you spend another 600$ to make it to 2000$, or settle for some lower-value reward.
So it&apos;s only a &apos;5% reward&apos; if you happen to spend exactly the amount required to get the highest-paying bonus.

A cashback card on the other hand gives you the full % of money for every dollar spend.

Those restrictions cost you money so you rarely get the theoretical maximum reward. You can beat the system sometimes but you have to really do your homework or be really lucky. stooples_employee Jan 13th, 2006, 07:23 AM if any of you have a CIBC Visa(any type)

(you DO NOT have to speak to a real person)
1. push 1
2. push 1
3. enter your credit card number
4. enter your month and year of birth
5. push 2
6. then might ask for your credit card CV number
7. then it&apos;ll ask you how much of an increase you want, and your annual income. enter $150,000 for annual income and $20,000 for increase. The computer will give you(between $2,000 to $12,000). the most common i&apos;ve noticed among people i&apos;ve helped is $4,000. YOU CAN DO THIS EVERY 90 DAYS.

whatever you enter as income does not have to match your job. what is more important is how clean your payment history with CIBC and your other creditors has been, and how long you have had the card.

I need a new credit card, I canceled my CIBC dividend Visa yesterday. After using it for 5 years with an average balance of +1000$ a month (always paid on time), I made one mistake with the CIBC banking payment: I wanted to enter a payment a few days earlier and have it process automatically. I f&apos;d up somewhere and it did not work so I politely called CIBC Visa and ask them to remove the 55$ interest charges as soon as I got my bill (ie, ~8 days after due date). They did not want to credit that 55$ (It was my first time and an error, I had no problem with Mastercard doing that ~8 years ago) so I told them to cancel the card on the spot. F them, it&apos;s their loss not mine. They make so much money off me with the 2-3% that the stores give them off my purchases that the least they could have done was credit that 55$. Oh well. Smoothie Jan 25th, 2006, 11:19 AM Ditto, I need a new cc to get rid of my CT Options mc. I use it for business too, so I put on about 1-2k a month easy, but never carrying a balance.

I use my President&apos;s Choice card most often because it has good points back and we shop at PC anyway. I don&apos;t use a GM card even though it has better return, because there is slim chance I won&apos;t ever use the rewards.

I think that is the key: you get better returns with vendor specific points back programs, so if you can find a points system for a store you shop at anyways, go for that.

I would suggest you read this article: http://www.redflagdeals.com/deals/main.php/articles/credit6

As you can see, the CT Options card gives you 1% anywhere and 1.85% at CT.

Whether you know it or not, you&apos;re agreeing with me. Since I don&apos;t find much I want at Sears, I redeem my PC points at a PC grocery store .. essential getting 1% return instead of possibly 2% return (if I save up enough points and convert them all at once) because I can:
1. get stuff I want
2. get it whenever I want

and TO ME, it is one of the two best returns available. I haven&apos;t seen any cash back card that gives even 1% for ALL purchase. Usually the 1% only applies to purchases after $1000 has already been made that month

You could argue that the 3% back on the GM VISA is the best payback .. but that is only true if you use the points and for most people, that cash in will only happen once every few years. I can cash in every month with either the CT card or the PC card = cash in hand instead of accrued (possibly never used) value = better for cash flow

$3,001 to $6,000 0.75%
$6,001 and over 1.25%

It&apos;s not really tiered in the sense that other cards are, once you cross the $6k mark, every dollar of that original $6k earns the 1.25% cashback.

Here&apos;s the example that proves that from the Ultramar card site;

&apos;Here is an example of savings made possible with your Ultramar MasterCard. By charging your gasoline purchases at Ultramar on your Ultramar MasterCard, you enjoy a rebate that could reach up to 2.5% annually. If, for example, you spend $40 on gasoline each week, this rebate represents savings of $52 per year. Also, if you charge all current purchases made elsewhere than at Ultramar to your Ultramar MasterCard, you enjoy real savings thanks to the annual rebate which could reach up to 1.25%. For example, by charging these average weekly purchases to your Ultramar MasterCard, you get back $94.25 per year:

Groceries: $75

Hardware: $20

Pharmacy: $20

Restaurants: $30

The total rebate awarded to you is $146.25.&apos;

There had been a huge discussion about this in another thread and people in the other thread have come to the conclusion that if you spend at least 6000, then ALL your purchases are rebated at 1.25%, not just the balance after 6000.

So I think that the NBC ultramar card is the way to go then. If you spend more than 6k in a year you get 1.25% on everything... that&apos;s better than the enrich.

I spend 30$ a week on gas on average so that&apos;s not much.. and I won&apos;t make a detour to go to ultramar / shell / petro can, I&apos;ll put gas when I need it so I don&apos;t really care about the&quot;ultramar&quot;part of that card.

Shifty Jan 25th, 2006, 04:14 PM Bonzo - they started me with a low limit ($2000) as well, despite my perfect credit, no debt, and good job. I dealt with it the first month by making payments every week, but it started to piss me off, so I called them and pleaded my case. I had to actually fax them a statement from my investment portfolio before they would increase it! Very conservative lender, I guess.

Yes. Occasionally it won&apos;t even &apos;try&apos; to give you anything. Maybe your card is too fresh or your credit history is too fresh. There can be a variety of causes. But generally, most CIBC visa customers can do that every 90 days, and you don&apos;t have to have the embarassment of being rejected by a person, simply push the buttons on the computer 18004654653. TheHans Jan 27th, 2006, 06:53 PM i have had the CT card for years now, so far these ar ethe things I have gotten FREE (cad tire $)

$80 - 5 drawr toolbox on casters
$140 - 4 snow tires
$200 - Ingersol rand impact gun
$50 - camping heater
$40 - Stanley tripod flashlight
$30 - Maglites
$230 - mini freezer

TONS of other knicknacks like motor oil or filters.

I LOVE CT :D

Hi,

I agree re: the Canadian Tire MasterCard! Really a great one. If you don&apos;t hold a balance, of course. That CT Money on the card really adds up. And 3% in CT money on the card on purchases made at Canadian Tire. Although, I must admit, we haven&apos;t held on long enough for a $230 mini freezer. :-)

The Hans felix Feb 6th, 2006, 05:01 PM Are you saying link the Sears point to Petro Points, pay by GC and you still can get 6% (+ 20% in GC + other credit card reward for buying the GC)?
Yes. 20% off gas if you use the Petro Canada, Canadian Tire, Home Hardware gift cards to pay for gas. Plus the 1-2% from your credit card used to pay for these GCs. I&apos;m not too sure about the linking of Sears&amp;Petro points though (i have mine linked but i don&apos;t think i&apos;m actually getting more Sears points?) but yes you can use your Petro Points card when paying with gift cards. micronta Feb 6th, 2006, 06:37 PM Anybody knows if I can use Sears card for non-gasoline purchases at Petro Canada - lottery tickets for example?

As a university student who has never had a credit card before, is it advisable to apply for the NBC Ultramar CC? I have held summer jobs before and am currently employed as a work study student (obviously its more important for the experience than the meagre pay :) )

I&apos;m assuming my yearly tuition fees will push me over $6001 every year if i pay using the CC to qualify for the 1.25% cash back, even if I dont use my CC for anything else. But I&apos;m not sure whether applying now is worth it for the fear that a rejection will worsen my credit rating.

Any suggestions folks? Drew_W Feb 7th, 2006, 01:45 PM Hi,

UofT told me no cc.

You think all that cashback is free? Merchants pay 2.5%++ of every transaction as an expense of taking credit cards... felix Feb 11th, 2006, 03:16 AM I remember Athabasca University took credit cards as payment. It&apos;s a long distance university so most of the students take their courses through correspondence. It&apos;s the only one i know of that takes credit cards I guess because it&apos;s easier for the long distance students. I&apos;m sure if there are any problems with chargeback, they will simply just take back the credit/degree. Drew_W Feb 11th, 2006, 03:23 AM And they have probably hiked their tuition rates to cover the cost of the merchant fees. Siefer999 Feb 11th, 2006, 03:36 AM UofT told me no cc.

yup. mau108 Feb 12th, 2006, 05:22 PM ok this post has gone from 4% cashback ct cards to talking about all other credit cards but the CT one.

So where can I apply for the CT card. It&apos;s much better then my BMO mosaik which only has .5% cashback :P and I do buy stuff for my car at CT (oil and what not).

Citibank Petro card is the one I use alot and I havent paid for a car wash in a while lol. But wanna get rid of my mosaik and get a CT.

Will this affect my credit rating, cancelling one card and adding another in a short period of time?

I have 4000 limit on citibank petro, I believe rbc upped my visa to 2k and same with mosaik. file888 Feb 12th, 2006, 06:11 PM Yes. 20% off gas if you use the Petro Canada, Canadian Tire, Home Hardware gift cards to pay for gas.

$1500 or more, you get 3%
$500-$1499.99, you get 1%
Less than $500, you get 0.5%

spending 499.99 @ 0.5% cash back
from 500-1499.99 @ 1% cash back
1500+ @ 3% cash back...

for monthly spending over 1500, you are looking at a formula of ...
499.99 * 0.005 + 1000 * 0.01 + (amount in a total month spent - 1499.99) * 0.03% cash back...

Spend 2500 per month, you are getting $42.50 back... which equals about 1.7%..
Spend 5000 per month, you are getting $117.50 back.. which equals about 2.35%

Anyone else get the same numbers? That is assuming their tiered system works the same as the others do... as such...
the first $499.99 earns 0.5%
the next $1000 earns 1%
everything after earns 3%

Since it is calcuated per month, you should not use it unless you know you are going to spend over $5000 in that month. Of course, that assumes you have a credit limit&gt;= $5000. I would say this is a pretty useless card unless you have a monthly planner for your purchase. The_Madz Feb 14th, 2006, 10:55 AM I saw a few weeks ago something similar in a canadian tire store in st. catharines.. also a pilot program in that region.

however, it was based on getting money off your gas purchase depending on how much you spent a month on the card.

it was something to the likes of 5 cents a litre off max. i can&apos;t recall the exact numbers now but i will see if i can find the flyer batcave Feb 14th, 2006, 10:59 AM for monthly spending over 1500, you are looking at a formula of ...

Hi, this formula isn&apos;t correct.

If you spend&gt;$1500 in a month you get 3% back for that. However, if you spend $500-$1500, you get 1% for that month and 0.5% rebate if you spend $2000/ month on my CC so I should be able to get $750 back in a year.

Think I&apos;ll have to drop by the local CT this week and see if they have a stand with some more details...You get double the credit towards purchases made at CT, CT Gas and Marks Work Wearhouse.

http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=92936 batcave Mar 7th, 2006, 08:36 PM The 3% card exists! I got mine in the mail today! (I updated post #1) joflynn Mar 8th, 2006, 04:34 AM The way to get this card is to call CT and ask them to mail you an application form for the new&quot;Cash Advantage&quot;card. Many of the sales reps are just learning about this card, so you may have to ask a few different reps. This card is only being promoted in a few select cities so you won&apos;t find anything about it on the internet etc. However, you don&apos;t have to be in one of those cities to get the card if you proactively request an application form!

I have sent in my application and am eagerly awaiting the card!

In my opinion, this card is probably THE BEST card for those higher spending individuals/families who&quot;like clockwork&quot;charge over $1,500 per month on their credit cards. If you do, you get 3% cash back credited to your account every 4 months.

HOWEVER, you only get 1% if you dip below $1,500 ($500-1,499) so that is not the greatest. You are also limited to a maximum of $1,000 in cash back a year so that would cap your 3% cash back spending limit at $33,333 per annum. (~$2,800 per month).

To get an idea if this card is good for you, I suggest you look at all your credit card statements over the last 6 months and if you have hit $1,500+ total spending in 5 of those 6 months then you should seriously consider switching and consolidating all your credit card purchases on this one card. There are no annual fees and supplementary cards are free. One downside is there is no free purchase or warranty insurance. CT offers this type of insurance for $3.95 a month. I have never used any of these insurances before, so I will probably take my chances without it. It sounds like CT will roll out this card to everyone sometime this year. Another small concern is that since it appears CT is&quot;test marketing&quot;this card, there is a higher chance than normal this card could be cancelled in the near future.

I plan on switching all my spending from the Citibank Drivers Edge (2% reward) to the CT cash advantage card as soon as I get it.

Kudos to BATCAVE for the great find!

Consider you are lucky because you could get another $5 signup bonus again.
Why would they want to do a credit check if the income is 0? Credit check costs time and money. If there is one mistake, there can be more mistakes in the application anyway. wild Mar 8th, 2006, 01:29 PM Consider you are lucky because you could get another $5 signup bonus again.

Okay, but for me, it is the same. There is no reason Amex should double check if the income is wrong. It costs time and money.

In a month, if you spend:
$1500 or more, you get 3%
$500-$1499.99, you get 1%
Less than $500, you get 0.5%So in order to get back 1% exactly, you have to spend at least $500 each month. If you want more than 1%, then you need to spend more than $1500 at least one month of the year.

It is my understanding that the reward is not tiered, so if you spent $1500 you would get back 3% of the entire amount, not 3% of the amount over $1500. Someone correct me if I&apos;m wrong. rain Mar 22nd, 2006, 04:49 PM as previously mentioned. Its not tiered. You&apos;re tiering it.... taile Mar 22nd, 2006, 04:51 PM as previously mentioned. Its not tiered. You&apos;re tiering it....
God, I forget it!
That means if I can spend $500/month, then I will get 1% back for the whole amount?! That&apos;s much better! :-0 Xiggy Mar 22nd, 2006, 05:06 PM That means if I can spend $500/month, then I will get 1% back for the whole amount?! That&apos;s much better! :-0
And if this is the case, then just get the Ultramar M/C which gives you 1.25% back for the entire amount you spend over $6000/yr. Since you&apos;re thinking about $500/month, it works out to be over $6000 in a yr. For most ppl, $6000/yr is nothing. rain Mar 22nd, 2006, 05:23 PM ops sorry....I guess u need invite for the American Express

$1500 or more, you get 3%
$500-$1499.99, you get 1%
Less than $500, you get 0.5%

This is not clear.

If I spend 2000$ in a month, do I get:
3% on the full amount = 60$ ?
or
3% on the amount over 1500$ + 12.50$ for the first 1500$ = 27.50$ ? ZenOps Mar 22nd, 2006, 08:38 PM Wow, thats a good question, im curious too.

There are plenty of credit cards that are tiered (EG: first $1000 at 0.5 percent, 1 percent for every dollar over $1000) burnaby Mar 22nd, 2006, 08:41 PM Several poster mentioned it&apos;s not tiered thus for monthly
If one spend 2000$ in a month, one gets:
3% on the full amount = 60$

Catch seems to be the % calculated over the entire amount is based on the amount thus if you&apos;re just shy of the next bracket too bad!

This is not clear.

If I spend 2000$ in a month, do I get:

none of them listed on the website Bigmouth Mar 22nd, 2006, 10:53 PM MBNA offers online access to your account and statements at http://www.mbna.com/canada/

Or another URL you can use is: https://www.onlineaccess.ca joflynn Mar 23rd, 2006, 12:43 AM I called in and asked if they could mail the application form to me. Apparently they might not be doing this anymore.


where did you get yours? Xiggy Mar 24th, 2006, 03:53 AM Someone near one of these test/pilot areas should grab a bunch of application forms. I&apos;m willing to pay $5 for someone to mail me one. I&apos;m sure a bunch of RFD&apos;ers will want an application too. b0ne Mar 24th, 2006, 07:37 AM cant someone just scan a copy? :) ditto Mar 24th, 2006, 09:58 AM i managed to get one app form in scarborough and have already submitted it. I went into a CT store one day and was stopped by a guy standing near the entrance and promoting CT CC, I asked if they have Cash Advantage application form. He told me he did but it was not allowed to distribute other than testing areas. But finally he agreed to bring me one the other day so I am hoping to get mine soon...someone said the application will be turned down if the address is out of their testing areas...

so just ask your local store and wish you luck batcave Mar 25th, 2006, 09:20 AM ...someone said the application will be turned down if the address is out of their testing areas...I don&apos;t live in the area and I&apos;ve got mine! Fill it out and mail it in! You&apos;ve got nothing to lose and a 3% cash back MC to gain! :cheesygri

They extended the bonus 3% rebate (without spending $1500) to the second month. I&apos;m going to spend over $1500 anyway, so it doesn&apos;t matter to me. GoodDeal Mar 25th, 2006, 09:25 AM I want one also... Can someone that has the application scan it? joflynn Mar 25th, 2006, 04:41 PM Here are the CT numbers for the Cash Advantage Card:

1-866-846-5853 Card Activation Line (if you hit 0 and # a couple of time you should get transferred to an operator)
1-800-450-7745 Customer Service

This card is the BOMB if you spend AT LEAST $1,500 a month. If you do, you get a full 3% cash back on all your purchases as a credit on your card 4 times per year! No credit card on the market comes close to that.

You can talk about Airmiles, Aeroplan, Avion, TD Flight points etc. etc. but if you do the calculations you are normally only really receiving between 1-2% back in value. You also have to factor into your reward % calculations the costs of the annual fee. There are some exceptions where the flight value might reach 3-5% if you fly from a very remote region to remote region or fly to exotic&quot;non-standard&quot;locations where the normal cost of the ticket is very, very high. Now if you don&apos;t normally fly and want to redeem your points for non-flight rewards such as merchandise or gift certificates, you&apos;ll find that the reward value is typically 1% or LESS!

Unless you take advantage of the flight exceptions, why bother yourself with all these complicated points programs?

I am simplifying and getting rid of all these point programs and going straight for the cash, particularly when you can get a 3% reward with ZERO annual fee, and you don&apos;t have to wait, they&apos;ll give it to you every quarter as a credit on your account (instead of every year, or when you buy a car).

I had called CT 4 weeks ago and asked them to mail the application to me and they did, but it appears since then a whole bunch of RFD&apos;ers have been calling them and it appears they have put a new policy into place of not mailing them. (Anyone had success recently?)

Someone in the test area should pick up a stack of these application forms and offer to mail them to RFD&apos;ers who want them for a small convenience fee. If I didn&apos;t get the application form mailed to me, I would have gladly paid $10 for one. I&apos;d get that back on my first $333 in spending. burnaby Mar 25th, 2006, 04:50 PM Seems to be the only complaint is as OP posted:
There is a limit of $1000 for the reward in a year, so the maximum spend on this card is about $30,000.

More specifically for those with over $33,333 annual spending need to switch to another card. Compare to my Costco AE had to spend ~$37K to get $500. This is more than double.

Yes, that is a caveat, you should have another backup card ready once you hit the $1,000 yearly cash limit ie. once you have spent $33,333. Remember that purchases at CT and CT Gas, CT Online/catalogue and Mark&apos;s Work Warehouse are doubled up (i.e. spend $500, you get $1,000 credit - so in essence you can get 6% rebate for those purchases) so that would reduce the annual spending required.

Once I hit the $1,000 limit (if I do), I am planning on using my Citibank Drivers Edge card as the backup (2% reward). This was the card I was using before switching to the CT Cash Advantage.

Wording:
&quot;You can earn a maximum of $1,000 in cash rewards each program year (a program year is considered to be 12 consecutive billing periods staring in January of any year and ending January of the following year).&quot; GoodDeal Mar 25th, 2006, 04:59 PM Here are the CT numbers for the Cash Advantage Card:

They pay the credit in April, July, October and January for the previous 3 months spending. Right now we are in the January 2006 - January 2007 period. My interpretation is that you would be able to start earning again the day after the closing date of your January 2007 statement. crxmugen Mar 25th, 2006, 10:12 PM They pay the credit in April, July, October and January for the previous 3 months spending.

Well, spending $30K is easy IMO if you just use your CC for recurring montly expenses / purchases etc. I&apos;m single and between groceries, gas, mobile phone, personal care, etc...I&apos;m at about $600+. Add on&quot;non-essential&quot;purchases and $1500/mo is quite achievable, especially if you&apos;ve got a spouse. charger Mar 31st, 2006, 06:09 PM This is going to be bitching for my lifestyle/galleria membership:) zrex Mar 31st, 2006, 08:17 PM Still looking for a scanned copy of the application.

It says you are guaranteed 3% for the first 30 days... meaning you don&apos;t need to spend the required $1500 to qualify for 3% for your 1st month.

Afterwards, it will be 3% only if you can manage to spend at least $1500 each month. tjuzer Apr 1st, 2006, 05:26 AM How about edmonton Jetran Apr 1st, 2006, 08:19 AM Seems like a great deal! Time to call in :) HappyPanda Apr 1st, 2006, 11:08 AM Thanks OP. Called in... They are mailing it to me.

From your previous posts on that other infamous thread you must be jumping with joy at the prospect of 3% off.

CARDMEMBER AGREEMENT
Changing these Terms and Conditions
These Terms and Conditions are subject to change without notice.

Cancellation of cash rewards program
The Cash Advantage MasterCard cash rewards program is subject to cancellation on 60 days notice, given in accordance with your Cardmember Agreement.

In other words, CT can reduce the level of cash rewards anytime without notice. I.E. You can receive your monthly statement and read a friendly reminder letting you know that&quot;by the way&quot;CT has reduced the maximum annual rebate to $100 or the maximum cash rewards percentage is now .5% or you have to spend $10,000 a month to get 3% cash rewards etc. etc.

If CT wants to completely cancel the cash rewards program they will give 60 days notice.

BOTTOM LINE: The deal is only good as long as CT wants it to last. With credit card companies it is really a one way contract - they control the show. Look at what happened with CIBC FORD VISA, GM VISA, MBNA Ebay Points, and other programs that have come and gone or changed for the worse.

They will make their money off people who don&apos;t pay their balances off every month. That is how most CC companies make the bulk of their money.

In my opinion people in general are way too irresponsible with the credit they are given, and they are given way too much of it. Xiggy Apr 7th, 2006, 03:28 PM They are betting on many ppl who want to reach the 3% threshold by spending at least $1500 each month but then can&apos;t pay the entire balance so they carry a balance. What&apos;s the interest rate? 28.8% ? They make the bulk of their revenue via interest not the 3% from merchants.

This is why it&apos;s a test/pilot program right now. If it proves successful for them, they&apos;ll think about rolling it out nation-wide. chococrazy Apr 7th, 2006, 03:35 PM Thanks OP... they&apos;re mailing me an application too!

Sweet deal
You get 1% CT money for each purchase you make for amount under $10, outside of CT store. But you will only get 1% for each whole $10 you buy over $10, for each purchase. It does not accumulate all purchases each month like Presidet Choice M/C. I.e. If you buy something for $10, you wil get $0.10 CT Money. But if you buy $19.99, you will still get $0.10 CT money only. But if you buy $20.01, then you will get $0.20 CT money. So if you want to buy 2 items costing $9.99 each, pay them in 2 separate transactions, then you will get $0.18 CT money, instead of pay for them in one trannsaction of $19.98 total because you will only get $0.10 CT money. burnaby Apr 9th, 2006, 11:31 PM CC companies loves clients like yourself with balance owing. I never look at the APR cause it doesn&apos;t matter with no balance owing. Do the math to discover owing a balance wipes out any kickbacks.

Hey Guys, Just wondering??? how many Canadian tire money rewards do you get per dollar on the OPTIONS MC?

Got the brochure fromlocal CA, but no where does it mention ??


But I did recently signedup for the capitlalone platinum card with 6.9% APR :)

$1600? So, if you are not careful and over charge your card, they can ding you $25 for over the limit charge. If you too conservation and not charge at least $1500, you won&apos;t get 3% Cashback. Sneaky! crxmugen Apr 12th, 2006, 09:15 PM got mine too, takes almost a month
4000 limit for me, not much but okey, ask them raise up after half yr
should be np for more, will use a lot, and will pay all on time

too bad cannot check balance online, hope they&apos;ll do it soon like options mc nopn Apr 12th, 2006, 09:20 PM Is it only for new customer ?

I have over $3000 couple month ago with this card, all I have is 1% ?

:( recordman Apr 12th, 2006, 09:33 PM If you&apos;re going to buy something big, prepay first to raise the limit temporarily. The interest you would lose is gained back many folds by the cashback.

i&apos;m not sure, but i dont&apos; think so
if your limit is 2000
prepay $1000, your CC may show your balance is -$1000, if you spent 1000, you dont&apos; have to pay it
but your limit still show you 2000, won&apos;t go up automatilly to 3000

3 piece 1000, separate bills may be fine
but 1 piece 3000? i&apos;m not sure nopn Apr 12th, 2006, 11:24 PM i&apos;m not sure, but i dont&apos; think so

Is that mean if i have 1 piece for $3000 right away on $2000 limit, they will going to charge me overlimit fees???
, even I am not really over limit in my account since I already have a negative balance for -$1000. taile Apr 12th, 2006, 11:53 PM I just notice that on the welcome letter, it says the admin. fee is $10 when the card is inactive for the previous 12 months!
Does any other cards have similar term? :confused: recordman Apr 13th, 2006, 01:34 AM I don&apos;t have any cards that has that restriction.

Anyway, is that a problem? Just buy something cheap once a while to avoid the inactivity fee.

I think MBNA charges this kind of fee as well if you don&apos;t use your card, however it&apos;s not that big of a deal, most people can buy at least one thing on their card per year.

Many cards in the US also have this fee. Joseph88 Apr 13th, 2006, 08:11 AM Is this Cashback card an MBNA card? If so, can you access your statement/activities online through mbna.ca?

First, I don&apos;t think balance transfer will give you any reward.

sounds like a really bad idea to me too. May not be bad for your actual credit rating but lenders will be wary of anyone with that sheer number of cards issued to them showing up on the report.

I got the application today but they did not send any information about the reward program. It send me a covering letter, an application and a booklet about privacy. The covering letter asks me to read the &apos;reward program&apos; which was not enclosed.

I called them and told me about the program and asked me to check the web site ... which does not exist. :mad: cnlc Apr 18th, 2006, 10:34 PM I also received my application today, BUT the application is for the Gas Advantage Mastercard and says nothing about the 3% cashback.

The covering letter only talks about savings for gas purchases.

Is this the same card or did they send me a different application form? chococrazy Apr 18th, 2006, 11:02 PM cnlc: I think you got the wrong application. I received mine today and it does not mention gas advantage.

My covering letter says 3% guaranteed cash back for the first 30 days.

The app is one of the most poorly written forms I&apos;ve seen from a financial company (not to mention the missing document).

And to whoever asked about the bank associated with it, that would be&quot;Canadian Tire Financial Services Ltd&quot;. ikeandtike Apr 19th, 2006, 07:58 AM I just got off the phone with them, and they said&quot;THe Test Is Over&quot;

hmm...are you sure? try calling again. would seem odd that they would stop it since it is going so well. if it is then that would suck

Same Response! jackboot Apr 19th, 2006, 07:34 PM I just got my application. I phoned for it on 3 April.

The only thing that sucks about this card is that it doesn&apos;t offer extended warranty like my CIBC Dividend. However, I&apos;ve never used the extended warranty feature from my Visa anyway, but it potentially could save big $$$.

I phoned customer service to double-check that there is in fact no extended warranty coverage included at all and they confirmed that one needs to buy the&quot;product protector&quot;for $3.95/month to have this feature. I will note that my Visa only doubles the warranty to a maximum of 1 year additional warranty. This MC doubles the warranty up to 2 additional years for a maximum total of 7 years of warranty (for goods with manufacturers warranty of 5 years). That is really quite good especially for all the electronics and computer shite I buy.

One could get free product protection by signing up for the $3.95/mo service and then paying off the monthly balance to $0 every month before the statement is printed. This would be kind of a hassle...do you think it would be worth it? cko64 Apr 19th, 2006, 08:40 PM I finally got my application. I called in March 31.

If they are anything like National Bank (NBC) Ultramar, they&apos;ll raise the limit by a measly $1000.

I have been using Costco AE for about 3 years. I have averaged about $150 in cashback from them. I&apos;ll continue to use my AE till end of this year.

Oh, I use Citibank FULL 1% back M/C as well when places don&apos;t accept AE burnaby May 1st, 2006, 11:31 AM Why would you use AE with 1.5% kickback in Jan 2007 instead of CT 3.0% in three months? Of course thanks to the crappy low CT limits AE sees all the over the top spending.

Anyone with over $4K limit? Can&apos;t believe Xig only got $3.3k given his rebates were in that neighbourhood in a previously post.

I&apos;m new to this, so how do they give you the cashback? each quarter they credit the amount in your CC statement? or do you get some crummy CT money?

btw, where in pickering can one pick up an application? I guess their CT stores, haha. batcave May 2nd, 2006, 09:34 AM I&apos;m still monitoring the thread. I&apos;ll update the first post tonight. crxmugen May 2nd, 2006, 09:44 AM drove to pick, whitby again
no more application form in CT, not this one cash advantage, only 10% gas advantage left (it&apos;s everywhere) crxmugen May 2nd, 2006, 10:03 AM here&apos;s the scan of those 2 different CT MC

don&apos;t pm me, i dont&apos; have any cash app form left, i wish burnaby May 2nd, 2006, 12:27 PM Seems this deal is dead with CT no longer handing out any application in person or by mail. CT message in recent weeks is they&apos;re not accepting any more applications for the pilot project and will reevaluate in six? months. ilya May 2nd, 2006, 07:47 PM Seems this deal is dead with CT no longer handing out any application in person or by mail.

Wow, so even if I can get an application, when I send it in it&apos;ll be refused? burnaby May 2nd, 2006, 07:52 PM Should have said application form request.

Wow, so even if I can get an application, when I send it in it&apos;ll be refused? ilya May 2nd, 2006, 08:51 PM Oh ok, thank you for the quick reply...

Well in that case, if someone has an application form, would you be kind enough to send it to me please? I would be very appreciative. I&apos;d reimburse shipping, and I would add a gift :)

Let me know by PM,
Ilya GoodDeal May 2nd, 2006, 09:00 PM By the way, I called and there is no online account available for this card (to check transactions/balance or download statements). batcave May 2nd, 2006, 09:13 PM here&apos;s the scan of those 2 different CT MC

Okay folks, I updated the first post (http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=238544). Let me know if you want to see anything else there.

crx, here&apos;s the thread for the Gas Advantage MC:
http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=269548

Basically, if you spend more than $1,000 in month A, in the following month, month B, you will get the priviledge of buying gas at $0.10 off per litre. Actually, there&apos;s more to it than this. Check the thread for the real deal.

Good if you drive lots, I guess. ericc May 2nd, 2006, 10:45 PM I received this application. I will apply for it next month cause currently I am using Starwood Mastercard to collect some SPG points for my summer vacation. Wish this application is still valid next month. Artimus May 3rd, 2006, 10:20 AM Anyone with over $4K limit? Can&apos;t believe Xig only got $3.3k given his rebates were in that neighbourhood in a previously post.

FYI,
I have seen a persons limit over 10K with this Cash Advantage MC. Not sure what it would take to qualify for this though. burnaby May 3rd, 2006, 12:00 PM Did they have one of the other CT CCs? CSR asked if we have any CT CCs or credit history with them and with the no answer said they can only increase after a good track record.

FYI,
I have seen a persons limit over 10K with this Cash Advantage MC. Not sure what it would take to qualify for this though. Artimus May 3rd, 2006, 12:53 PM No other CT MC. He had 1 Ebay MC (MBNA I think) 1 Visa&amp;1 AMEX crxmugen May 3rd, 2006, 01:03 PM i have CT Options for a while, over 2 yrs, perfect record
still only 4k on cash 3% :(
my friend got 13k, but he&apos;s older and much richer of course

let&apos;s hope they&apos;ll raise up after half yr for me...
spent all limit, pay full amount on time every month, should be okey... crxmugen May 3rd, 2006, 01:14 PM oh, and that 10cents gas,
point 1, need to spent 1000, which is no reward on that 1000
point 2, if you wanna save as much $ as you could, you have to buy as much gas as you could, that&apos;s not easy for normal people, even i drive cargo van, still cannot save a lot $ (compare to other CC, and GC of course)
point 3, i believe there&apos;s no CT money on that 10cents gas, only CT options, cash, debit, gift card, not any other CC

this 10 cents gas isn&apos;t even close to 3% cashback, thanks bat again :D burnaby May 3rd, 2006, 01:30 PM Isn&apos;t it best to use this CC to buy the CT and PC GCs to get effective 22.4% off your gas.

Last year was great for PC points. I transfer 75k from PC to Presidence choice for the Weber BabyQ (75k points for a $270 BBQ). Then the 1100 bonus per each $10 minimum purchase. So yeah hang on to them PC points in case another great deal comes up.

Too bad no CT gas stations in GVA.

I mean c&apos;mon! recordman May 4th, 2006, 10:17 PM How many other cards do you have? When I signed up for the CT Options card, they gave me a stingy $2.5k limit.

I called to increase my limit, but the CSR said the limit is really doesn&apos;t matter. There is no $25 penalty if I overcharge the card&apos;s limit like Avion Visa or MBNA M/C. She said CT doesn&apos;t believe in penalties.

Also, if you charge your card in any of CT retailers like Mark&apos;s Work Warehouse or Gas Bar, you get double the Cash back bonus. Here are the exact wordings:

&quot;Canadian Tire purchase Bonus

Your purchases at Canadian Tires Stores, Canadian Tire Gas Bars, Mark&apos;s Work Warehouse/L&apos;Equipeur Stores, Canadian catalogue and Canadian Tire Online will be doubled for the purpose of calculating your cash rewards. For example, if your purchases at these retailers in any billing period totalled $450, it is the same as if you spent $900.&quot; champ91 May 10th, 2006, 09:23 PM i must say the card is very plain....not flashy at all alanbrenton May 11th, 2006, 01:21 AM For those whose applications were approved,

On the application form, it says 4-6 weeks. I just sent in yesterday. :) cko64 May 11th, 2006, 01:48 AM On the application form, it says 4-6 weeks. I just sent in yesterday. :)
I mailed in my application on April 20th. I received my card on May 10th. About three weeks. bloodline May 11th, 2006, 02:27 AM Hey Folks:


Been looking briefly at the thread and noticed that apps are only available in selected stores. Is there anyone out there that may be willing to grab some apps for some Red Flaggers?

I am sure something can be worked out if it&apos;s a special trip.

I live near London, ON so it&apos;d be a bit of a drive just for the app.


b. schweendborscht May 11th, 2006, 03:10 AM I received my Cash Advantage card today. $11,000 limit.
I live in BC, outside the test market area. I had initially called and the CSR refused to send me an application form. I tried again, no problem, they sent the form. About 3 weeks after sending in the application, I got the card. I kept a copy of the application form before I filled in the info. tjuzer May 11th, 2006, 03:30 AM i must say the card is very plain....not flashy at all

How does it look like :?: burnaby May 11th, 2006, 01:02 PM Silver in color with the word Cash advantage on top left that covers about 1/5 of the card, lower 4/5 has a web grid. Yes, very plain.

How does it look like :?: burnaby May 11th, 2006, 01:06 PM Since it&apos;s serialized expect CT to accept only original applications. Has anyone try sending in a photocopied form?

3 week sounds right unless they lose your application, they had to send me another application.

$11k, that&apos;s not bad, anyone figure out how CT determine limits, seem to be all over place.

5% cash back for the big spenders (&gt;$3000 spending / month) is HOT!! Not only that, you get 10% cash back everytime you go to Canadian Tire stores/Cash bar!

My Avion Visa statement for this month is $12,096. :)

I just called, CT can not simply switch over the card. I have to apply for the Platinum online again. ericc May 11th, 2006, 02:27 PM This thread is getting hotter and hotter!!! jackboot May 11th, 2006, 02:44 PM Wow...that Platinum card is super hot for people spending *just over* $3k a month! If you spend much more than that, it would make sense to get a card that doesn&apos;t limit the yearly reward you can get though...

As for me, I spend ~$2k / month on my credit card right now, so the regular Cash Advantage card is ideal for me! recordman May 11th, 2006, 02:49 PM It&apos;s a&quot;Platinum&quot;card. I&apos;ve never heard of such card with&lt;$5k limit. :) In the application it says that if one is not qualified for the Platinum card, the normal Cash Advantage one may be granted.

No no, I think he means that if you *spend* that much in a month as outlined on the CT website, once you hit $3000 you&apos;ll get the 5% bonus so as long as you spend at least $3000 you&apos;ll get the max cashback. Shojin May 11th, 2006, 03:07 PM Dang. I called this morning and found out I was approved for the regular 3% card and it&apos;s on it&apos;s way in the mail. I haven&apos;t even received it yet and then they bring out this 5% card!

I now want to cancel this 3% and apply for the 5% card. But that may appear as too many inquiries/credit requests in a short time... might lower credit score?

The irony is... the 3% cashback card apps are hard to get whereas the 5% card can be applied for right online! jackboot May 11th, 2006, 03:17 PM (cut)The irony is... the 3% cashback card apps are hard to get whereas the 5% card can be applied for right online!

Only as of yesterday. The online site was not up before then. I applied for the 3% card via paper app, which was the only way to do it before. If you read the last few pages you&apos;ll see others begging for spare apps. pluto May 11th, 2006, 04:00 PM Wow...that Platinum card is super hot for people spending *just over* $3k a month! If you spend much more than that, it would make sense to get a card that doesn&apos;t limit the yearly reward you can get though...

any examples?



I just called, CT can not simply switch over the card. I have to apply for the Platinum online again.

Are you talking about switching from the regular Cash Advantage card or the CT Options card ?


By my math, you&apos;d have to spend at least $3000 at least 3 months in a year just to pay back the annual fee... based upon the bonus payout of 2% on the $1500 difference in spending. Any spending above and beyond $3K would be gravy.


Edit: can anyone see on the site if they charge anything extra for supplementary cards on the platinum one? burnaby May 11th, 2006, 04:17 PM Only have to spend $5k in one month to break even.
$5k = $250 back at 5% vs. $150 @ 3%.

Of course any charges for supp card is not included.

Edit: can anyone see on the site if they charge anything extra for supplementary cards on the platinum one? burnaby May 11th, 2006, 04:20 PM Thus far CT limits are not norm by any measure. Many of us used to getting cards with over 10K limits are getting only $3k (which brings back memories of long pasted student days)

It&apos;s a&quot;Platinum&quot;card. I&apos;ve never heard of such card with&lt;$5k limit. :) In the application it says that if one is not qualified for the Platinum card, the normal Cash Advantage one may be granted. crxmugen May 11th, 2006, 04:25 PM WOWOWOWOWOW :!: :!: :!: :!: :!:

if apply one more tonight, then i&apos;ll have... ahh...... 16CC? (may be, dont&apos; even remember... :lol: )

don&apos;t have to cancel 3%, 5% reward is max 2000 only, after get 2000 back then switch to use 3% (ya, spent $ won&apos;t be a problem)

spent 3000 a month and get 150... sweet :lol: burnaby May 11th, 2006, 04:32 PM Have to spend $40K with $3K min each month to max out $2k cashback. WOW, why is anyone with more disposible income after $40k in CCs wasting their time on 2 bits savings in RFD (GCs resellers excluded). Remember not paying in full will wipe out any savings.

Just get another 36 CCs to replace your deck of cards.

b. digdoug May 11th, 2006, 05:13 PM according to the website, the card only has travel insurance and no product protection insurance (e.g. doubling warranty, damage/theft within first 60 days, etc.). the product protection is available as an extra fee-based option though. otherwise, the card would rock. cko64 May 11th, 2006, 06:25 PM I enquired about the CT Cash Advantage card&apos;s online statement and when it will be available. I was told it would be ready this summer. I also asked if the transactions will be posted immediately as in MBNA MC or three days later like Avion Visa. The CSR said it will be somewhere in between. batcave May 11th, 2006, 06:53 PM I added the application link and platinum card info to the first post.

Let me know if there is more!

More power (and money) to you if you can spend&gt;$3,000/month on your card! bloodline May 11th, 2006, 07:10 PM Since I am&quot;self employed&quot;there is no way for them to tell what the purchases are used for.

Between Gas, Meals and other expenses (cell phone etc..) $3000 a month should be well within reach.

I can see them putting restrictions on businesses participating, but really since it&apos;s capped at $2000 per year pay out, that should be the only restriction.

It&apos;ll be interesting to see at what level I qualify at and how it works out.


Can&apos;t hurt to try anyhow.

How would they be able to tell if your purchases are&quot;business&quot;purchases anyway? It seems to me that it would be very difficult for them to prove... jackboot May 11th, 2006, 07:46 PM any examples?

No examples for cashback cards - I was referring to other cards that just let you rack up&quot;points&quot;etc nicolaim May 11th, 2006, 07:58 PM These cards sound good, EXCEPT FOR THIS:

- No frills such as extended warranty, online statements, etc.
- Foreign currency exchange rate might suck.&quot;All advances of money, all payments made and all credits for returns for transactions made in a foreign currency will be converted to Canadian currency at the then current MasterCard conversion rate PLUS 2.5%.&quot;For big eBay shoppers and/or travelers this could make the cards much less attractive. burnaby May 11th, 2006, 08:01 PM Certainly don&apos;t plan to do any PAYPAL payment with this card until their policy like chargeback is well known. AE has been excellent thus far.

Hellfire May 11th, 2006, 08:19 PM Spend $3025 a month = $36,300 a year x 0.05 = $1815 - $99 = $1716 Cash back per year. Not bad.

- Foreign currency exchange rate might suck.&quot;All advances of money, all payments made and all credits for returns for transactions made in a foreign currency will be converted to Canadian currency at the then current MasterCard conversion rate PLUS 2.5%.&quot;For big eBay shoppers and/or travelers this could make the cards much less attractive.
- most ppl here will use the card to buy GC&apos;s @ 20% off and then use the GC&apos;s to make their purchases... so extended warranty doesn&apos;t apply anyway.
- online statements, as stated earlier, will be available in the summer... besides, you can just call the automated number. Even if it doesn&apos;t have any way to check on your account, it doesn&apos;t make this card any less attractive.
- foreign currency conversion rate is crappy for most, if not all, credit cards anyway. what&apos;s your point? jackboot May 11th, 2006, 09:14 PM You can add the optional product protector plan and not pay for it by simply making sure that you pay off your monthly balance before the statement is printed. So long as you have less than a $5 balance, they don&apos;t charge you for the product protector plan. That is what I intend to do. cactus May 11th, 2006, 09:32 PM PC charges the same conversion rate plus 2.5%, at least it was when I checked a couple of months ago, and I think CIBC Dividends charges conversion + 2.75%...

and I believe that they convert whatever currency it is to USD, then again to Canadian.

Hellfire May 11th, 2006, 09:34 PM Just finished applying for the Platinum card. Since they give you the full 5% on your $3000 purchase it will be really, really easy to get the $2000 per year back.

Except with the regular card you are limited to $1000 cash back. Oh and you would have to spend $2800 a month @ 3% cash back = $84 x 12 = $1008, but of course you only get $1000.

Over the year you would have to spend $33,600

With the Platinum card you get $2000 cash back, and you would only have to spend $3340 a month @ 5% cash back = $167 x 12 = $2004. Net is $1901 if you take into account the fee.

Thus over the year you would have to spend $40,080. cko64 May 11th, 2006, 10:25 PM Except with the regular card you are limited to $1000 cash back. Oh and you would have to spend $2800 a month @ 3% cash back = $84 x 12 = $1008, but of course you only get $1000.

Spending is not a problem with me. It&apos;s the rewards that I care.

It only took me 3 months to max out the MBNA award ($30,000) or $120,000 Avion points in nine months ($1 per point). Of course I have other CC like Amex etc...There is a reason why I am addicted to RDF. I am a shopperholic. I need help :lol: Hellfire May 11th, 2006, 10:27 PM Spending is not a problem with me.

If spending isn&apos;t an issue you should have went with the 5% card since you get $901 more. treasureseeker May 11th, 2006, 10:30 PM There is a $99 annual fee for the 5% platimum cash back card...which negate all the saving unless u are spending&gt;10000...


From my calculations, there is a sudden jump in cashback of the platinum over the standard when you average over $3000 per month (which is just after the standard hits it&apos;s max cashback and the 5% kicks in for the platinum) cko64 May 11th, 2006, 10:30 PM If spending isn&apos;t an issue you should have went with the 5% card since you get $901 more.
You are right. That way, I could get $2,000 cashback for me and $1,000 for her. But I hate to pay for annual fee. I am too cheap. Hellfire May 11th, 2006, 10:34 PM You are right. That way, I could get $2,000 cashback for me and $1,000 for her. But I hate to pay for annual fee. I am too cheap.

yes you are right, I wasn&apos;t giving it much thoughts before, realistically I spend ~1500/mth, so with

18000*0.05-99=801
18000*0.03=540

the platimum card still come out ahead. but I am still a student so I probably won&apos;t be able to get this card :( Hellfire May 11th, 2006, 10:45 PM yes you are right, I wasn&apos;t giving it much thoughts before, realistically I spend ~1500/mth, so with

Must spend over $3000 a month with the 5% card to get the 5%, spending at $1500 a month only gets you 3%. So you should go with the 3% card. cactus May 12th, 2006, 12:29 AM YOur income must be over $40,000 a year to get the plantinum card.

Why is it a scam? Actually, it seems quite good: doubles the original warranty up to 2 years (max 7 years total) and protects a purchase from loss, damage, or theft for 90 days.

If I buy an electronics product (say, a hard drive) with a 5 year original warranty, the product&apos;s warranty will have an additional 2 years of coverage for a total of 7 years of warranty.

Further, like I mentioned, if I pay off my balance each month before the statement is printed, I pay nothing for the product protector.

Sure if you don&apos;t mind paying $3.95 + tax a month for it. If you pay off your balance each month before the statement is printed you may get away with it for free, but I suspect they will have some tricky of calculating your&quot;outstanding balance&quot;so they can charge you anyway. But let me know how it goes, if it works out props to you. Oh and keep in mind your statement doesn&apos;t get printed on the same day each month, it can change on a montly basis, eg) My PC Mastercard statement date has been the 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 before. tkyoshi May 12th, 2006, 03:23 AM Sure if you don&apos;t mind paying $3.95 + tax a month for it.

Exactly, they can also take an average daily balance and apply it to your account that way as well or even charge it right when you purchase something. Therefore the only way to avoid the fee is to return the item and get a credit back to your card, then they will refund the corresponding amount. They could also choose to apply the payment after the statement is sent out so you would get charged anyway. It might work for a couple months but I&apos;m sure they would catch on pretty quickly. jackboot May 12th, 2006, 11:45 AM Exactly, they can also take an average daily balance and apply it to your account that way as well or even charge it right when you purchase something.

I would pay $4/mo for the service anyway since it is considerably better than a regular (included) product protector plan like on my CIBC Dividend card. So I&apos;ll try doing the method I mentioned earlier to see if I can get it for free each month and report back. There is no reason in my mind that it won&apos;t work - all that is needed to obtain it for free is for a less than $5 balance to be on the card at the time the statement is printed. That just requires some organisation each month.

Wish me luck:) Shojin May 12th, 2006, 07:49 PM w00t!

Got my 3% card today! 15k limit! Took 3 weeks.

Now I&apos;m comtemplating serious cancelling it and going for the 5% card. :cheesygri

It really sucks you can&apos;t upgrade. recordman May 12th, 2006, 08:12 PM How they determine the limit is mind-blogging. Are you making over $100k?
I only have a 4.4k limit for this card, and 2.5k for the Options card. For Citibank I get 10k, and for PCF 15k. I have over 10 cc&apos;s. I know a guy who got 3.3k for the 3% card, but he only has a few cc&apos;s. We work in the same type of job and I think our salaries are similar.

When you applied, did you enter a recent year for your car? Do you have a mortgage? Do you pay rent? Did you enter your SIN? Let&apos;s figure out how CT assigns the limits. :lol:

I&apos;d also be interested in how others filled out the application and what their limits ended up as.

I haven&apos;t received my card yet and I&apos;ve very curious what kind of limit they will give me... Shojin May 12th, 2006, 09:19 PM 10 CCs are way too much! Do you carry balances on these? I have 4 CCs.. well, 5 now. Two I rarely use, the other two I carry small balances if any.

I think they look at your current debt to credit ratio. Paying off your balances probably helps.

For my app, I did list my SIN, I do have a mortgage, no rent and I have a year 2002 vehicle. All of my accounts are R1 (ie. no late payments) which is probably a big factor. Almost all creditors consider your ability to pay, and history of payments.

Despite a relatively high limit, I will likely never make use of it - I just need enough to make the 3% boundary up to the $1000 limit, which is $2800/mtn. You don&apos;t need more than this if your payments are about the same each month.

Actually, NO. Not with this card. I&apos;ve tried it and you can&apos;t. With all my other cards, I can.

If you want 5% on $15,000 of purchases with a $5000 credit limit, you will have to do the following: Make a purchase of $5000, pay into the card $5000, wait until the charge is POSTED, then make another $5000 purchase.

Thanks Xiggy - geez - that sucks....

This means that if I buy a $5000 item on Monday, and pay it off Monday night, I may get NO cash back if the transaction doesn&apos;t occur until Tuesday! Seems like too much work - wondering if this is really worth the hassle.

Anyone else tried&quot;putting cash&quot;onto the card to get more cash back/month? batcave May 13th, 2006, 05:32 AM Hey, you folks should read the fine print,

...Based on the level of net new purchases (purchases less credits) that are posted to your account in a monthly billing period, you will earn cash rewards equal to the percentage of such purchases set out beside the particular level. For example, if your net new purchases in a billing period are $2,500, you will earn a cash reward at the rate of 3% ($75). If, however, credits exceed your purchases in a billing period, your cash rewards balance will be reduced by an amount determined by multiplying the amount of that excess by the applicable cash rewards percentage above, which could result in a negative balance. From the terms and conditions link on this page: http://www.ctfs.com/english/cashadvantage/features.html

:idea: Best way to find out is if someone isn&apos;t planning on spending $1,500 in a month: buy something small and pay off the balance before the statement is issued and see how much reward you receive. (I think zero) :confused:

Personally, I don&apos;t think you can make more than 3/5% of your monthly limit of the card. It just says credit; it doesn&apos;t specify return or payment. If you could, what is stopping someone from buying something and returning it several times?

If you warrant an increased limit, they will give it to you. Xiggy May 13th, 2006, 07:07 AM This means that if I buy a $5000 item on Monday, and pay it off Monday night, I may get NO cash back if the transaction doesn&apos;t occur until Tuesday! Seems like too much work - wondering if this is really worth the hassle.I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. In this situation, you will get 5% back. Cash back is given every 3 months.



Anyone else tried&quot;putting cash&quot;onto the card to get more cash back/month?Like I said previously, you can&apos;t&quot;put cash&quot;onto the card in advance to artificially increase your credit limit... but once you put a charge onto it AND after it is POSTED, you can pay it off (before your statement date) and your credit limit will come back up. You can then put more charges onto your card, pay it off again, etc... this will allow you to &apos;get more cash back/month&apos;. See example in the next post.



Personally, I don&apos;t think you can make more than 3/5% of your monthly limit of the card. It just says credit; it doesn&apos;t specify return or payment.Credits do NOT equal payments. Read my preceding comment to RayzorC. Again, see example in the next post.



If you could, what is stopping someone from buying something and returning it several times?If you bought something at the end of March, you will get the cash back on your April statement. BUT if you then returned that item in April, they will take back the &apos;cash back&apos; in your July statement. (ie: cash back is given Jan, Apr, July, Oct) Xiggy May 13th, 2006, 07:08 AM Here&apos;s a complete example of how it works (as I understand it) for someone with a Credit Limit of $3000. I&apos;m using a low limit to illustrate how one might go about &apos;artificially&apos; increasing his or her credit limit. If you had a high limit (ie:&gt;$10,000) you wouldn&apos;t care about this too much.

For most (if not all) other credit cards, you can just &apos;pay into&apos; your card in advance. So if you paid $5000 onto your card, you would be able to make an $8000 purchase, no problem. BUT this doesn&apos;t work with this 3%/5% CT card.

----------------------

May 1st:
Balance = $0
Authorized Charges = $0 (ie: not yet posted purchases)
Available Credit = $3000

- make a purchase of $3000

Balance = $0
Authorized Charges = $3000
Available Credit = $0

- make a payment onto the card for $3000




May 2:
Balance = -$3000&lt;---- Yes, payment has gone thru...
Authorized Charges = $3000
Available Credit = $0&lt;----- BUT notice it&apos;s still $0 here... this is what sucks! You&apos;ve paid into your account but you can&apos;t use it to buy anything!


- wait, wait, wait... (literally)




May 4:
- your purchase on May 1 is finally POSTED late in the day



May 5:
Balance = $0&lt;---- correct because you&apos;ve made a purchase and paid it off.
Authorized Charges = $0&lt;---- Purchase is now posted.
Available Credit = $3000&lt;---- You can now buy more stuff! Finally!

- now you can just repeat the process... so make another purchase of $3000

Balance = $0
Authorized Charges = $3000
Available Credit = $0

etc.........


-------------------------

Now, if you repeated twice (ie: made 3 x $3000 purchases), you will get 5% of $9000. Thus, for us GC resellers that get a low credit limit, it will take about 4 or 5 separate orders spanning a whole month in order to max out 3 accounts (1 account of each AH/LR/G).


FYI:
Balance = [POSTED charges (purchases)] - [credits (returns)] - [payments].
Authorized Charges = [UNPOSTED charges].
Available Credit = [your credit limit] - [All Charges (posted&amp;unposted)] + [credits] + [payments]. ***BUT will NEVER be greater then [your credit limit] (ie: it&apos;s Capped)*** alanbrenton May 13th, 2006, 11:56 AM Also - can someone explain whether you NEED to spend&gt;3K EVERY month in order to get 5%? What if 2/3 months I spend&gt;3K, but the third month I spend nothing - would I still get the cash back for that quarter period at 5%.

For people who have been extended high credit limits, would it be possible to purchase $40,000 (hypothetically, seeing how many people here in RFD were given such a low credit limit) in one month and expect to get back $2,000 cashback at quarter end?

Or will they have to split their purchases up to about $10,000/month? RayzorC May 13th, 2006, 12:45 PM Like I said previously, you can&apos;t&quot;put cash&quot;onto the card in advance to artificially increase your credit limit... but once you put a charge onto it AND after it is POSTED, you can pay it off (before your statement date) and your credit limit will come back up. You can then put more charges onto your card, pay it off again, etc... this will allow you to &apos;get more cash back/month&apos;. See example in the next post.

Thanks Xiggy

Just confirmed with a CSR who appeared to know what she was talking about - the other 2 CSRs just said&quot;sure, you can put money onto it and make a bigger purchase&quot;. I just kept calling until I found a CSR who would confirm what I DIDN&apos;T want to hear.... so for all those interested:

you are NOT able to put money onto the card in advance in order to make larger purchases that month. You have to pay it off, and wait for that payment to be posted, before using the credit card again that same month.

See Xiggy&apos;s excellent example a few messages previous to this. Thanks! cko64 May 13th, 2006, 12:55 PM HOLY CRAP! :D



wow, I think that would piss me off bigtime. Sounds to other as if creditors are hounding you.
What creditors. I have zero debt? I payoff my credit card every months, even if it is $20,000. I hate to pay interest. cko64 May 13th, 2006, 01:01 PM You mentioned you own a home with no mortage. a mortgage balance does show up on your credit report, so that doesn&apos;t really matter. How much do you spend on your other cards? do you sometimes spend over 50% of the credit limit in one month?
Combined, I spent about $20,000 last month (Purchased windows for my home last month.) On average, I spent about $10,000 per month combined on my credit cards. But I always pay off my credit card. I never ever pay any interest for my credit card.

What I am saying is CT is too stingy in term of their credit limits. Why don&apos;t they check my credit rating to see if I ever have any outstanding debts unpaid and than determine if I should have $13K limit like the other posters. $5,000 credit limit is a joke. burnaby May 13th, 2006, 01:17 PM You&apos;re absolutely right in CT&apos;s inconsistent pattern of credit limits. Many have reported getting less than 4K who are debt free home owners with other cards over $20k. The students who reported getting 10k are suspicious :?:

The only way to know for sure is for someone to try it.

No, No, you&apos;ve got it wrong. CT will of course accept all your payments. However they will not increase your available credit above the preset amount as a result of the payment. jackboot May 13th, 2006, 02:41 PM The strange credit limits being granted almost make me think that they are granting higher limits to those that they think are morel likely to carry a balance (ie: students) and lower limits to those that are just using the card to get cashback and never pay interest.... joflynn May 13th, 2006, 03:03 PM Ok, let&apos;s say you have a credit limit of $2,000 and your statement comes in and you owe $2,000. So you pay $5,000. According to what CT told you, your available credit remains at $2,000 not $5,000. But what happens to the $3,000 overpayment? You obviously don&apos;t lose it. I just can&apos;t see how CT&apos;s computers would not allow you to make additional purchases that month if you eventually spent (in regular purchases i.e. not one large purchase) over $2,000. They have to give you credit for your overpayment at some point.

Your balance becomes -3000 and your available credit remains at 2000. seshwan May 13th, 2006, 05:04 PM I feel sorry for the people actually reading through this nonsense about the available balance. Your maximum credit available will be the lesser of:

a.) Your credit limit

or

b.) Your credit limit minus your balance owing.

It&apos;s not that bloody hard to comprehend. If you want to make a large purchase greater than your credit limit, make a payment to your card 2 days before and have it charged in 2 lump sums. The only people waiting the 2 days in between purchases are idiots. RayzorC May 13th, 2006, 06:09 PM I feel sorry for the people actually reading through this nonsense about the available balance.

I should clarify - it is possible to make a larger purchase by making a pre-payment to your card... the issue is that you will NOT receive 5% cash back on any purchases BEYOND your credit limit. I confirmed this with CSR.

And seshwan - no need to be cruel, everyone is just looking for confirmation since their terms aren&apos;t completely clear. burnaby May 13th, 2006, 06:16 PM Your post was definitely nonsense as it missed the critical core of the thread being getting the 5% cashback without which many other cards can be used and many of us have CCs over 20k in limit.

I just use my tire money balance for CT purchases anyway as they are so overpriced. HOWEVER, it may be then that these other offers are changing/reducing soon too. SuperAho May 15th, 2006, 06:36 PM Interesting thought..... but anyone know if I do cash advance on this card, does it go towards the 5% cash back?

(say if I move 10k cash advance, then fill it back up the same day?), if so, thats like free money, since the 19 -20% cash advance interest is per month, a couple of hours wont be near 5% burnaby May 15th, 2006, 06:53 PM NO, purchases only.

Typically, credit cards do not give rewards on cash advances. embguy May 15th, 2006, 09:49 PM Combined, I spent about $20,000 last month (Purchased windows for my home last month.)

Credit card company always gives you $5000 to start with especially you have lots of credit cards with good credit report. One has to live with it for 3 - 6 months and request to increase the limit. But if you consistantly use up to your limits every months and NOT over, they will increase your limit without asking. Credit card company makes money from the transaction fee and the interest if not pay off every month. The reward program hopes you uses their card and not their competitors&apos; card. The more you use it, the more transaction fee they will collect.

But the credit card company only charges the merchants 3 - 4% tranaction fee. CT is losing money on the 5% rebate. I do not understand why they open for business to lose money! May be they want lots of card holders ASAP... CT may adjust the rebate formula after they reach a certain number of card holders...

I had the CIBC Platimum Dividend VISA card since the beginning. Two years ago, CIBC changed the rebate formula to reduce the payout. I am not happy with it... But not until now... It is plain simple. I will use the card that gives the best reward.

I don&apos;t think everyone can afford to spend about $3000 a month. That is quite a lot to buy for $3000. Although, I do not get how they make money, but from the website, I found out that their interest rate is 18.9%/a, which is 1.575%/month on full balance. If you do not pay you bills on time, you pay around $47.25 of interest, and also get the 5% cash back.

BTW, not every merchant has to pay the 3% fee, I heard some are as low as 0.25%. There is a big loophole in the 5% program. Even if the cashback is up to $2000 per year, I would like to know how CT operates. Maybe Canadian Tires financial is trying to boost its cash volume so they could attract more potential investor to its stock. cko64 May 15th, 2006, 10:49 PM Credit card company always gives you $5000 to start with especially you have lots of credit cards with good credit report.

Maybe they can tell us how many credit cards they have in their back pockets? burnaby May 16th, 2006, 12:24 AM Is this speculation or can you back up this stmt.

I think that&apos;s exactly why CT has been very random with the credit limits, they probably are giving the students high limits hoping they charge it up and carry a balance which many students do, enticing them with the reward since most other student cards offer little rewards in comparison.

Then the people with excellent credit are getting smaller limits to probably prevent you from maxing out the reward right away and also since you probably a&quot;deadbeat&quot;, they don&apos;t get any interest moola from you. embguy May 16th, 2006, 02:23 AM Is this speculation or can you back up this stmt. From personal experience $5k is the min and over $10k is the norm.

Since I got my MBNA card with $47,000 limit, most of my new cards that I applied are $5000 limit initially. For example, my CIBC Platinum Dividend started at $5000. CIBC gradually increased my limited to $22,000. My Bank of Montreal Master Card has a $25,000 limit. The trick is to spend close to the limit and NOT over the limit. Pay it off every month. They will raise your limit.

My credit card bill average around $3000 every month. I pay them off every month. I use my card to pay cellphone bill, car insurance, house insurance, life insurance, grocery, eBay purchases, airline tickets, daily newspapers, hotel, gas for my cars etc... may be use it to buy new car... It is easier to use credit card than writing a cheque. I receive itemize lists every month.

I do not use my MBNA card for purchases. I locked it in my safety deposit box at the bank. MBNA always has crazy low interest short term cash advance like 3.99% that I currently have. I transfer my unsecured line of credit balance to MBNA for 6 months at low interest. After 6 months, I transfer back to my line of credit. Then MBNA CSR calls me again to beg me to use their low interest cash advance. They always want to charge the one time 1% cash advance fee. But everytime, I refuse to pay. The CSR always waived the cash advance fee. A word of caution, if you do not have a low interest loan to transfer the loan back to after 6 months, DO NOT use the MBNA low interest cash advance because the interest rate goes back up to the nornmal card interest rate (in my case, it is 10.95%).

I do not pay interest unless they are for investment and tax deductable. The way to create wealth is to use other people&apos;s money with little or no interest and getting some money back while you are using their money.

I have quite a few high limit credit cards and line of credits. When the credit card company review my credit report, they see I have huge amount of (investment) loans in the form of line of credits or MBNA loan. On top of it, I have high limit credit cards. But they do not want to refuse my application, just give me $5000 to start with... The bank manager does not like to give high limit to individual that has lots of credits. They do not want to become the night manager of a 7/11 because of the bad loan that they approved with large limits.

As soon as I receive my CT card, I will stop using my CIBC platimum dividend card... This is how I collect all these high limit credit cards over time... Sometime, I say to myself&quot;These banks are giving me a very long rope to hang myself&quot;... if I am not careful...

I like the holiday cancellation/interruption feature that the CT card has. embguy May 16th, 2006, 02:39 AM I agree with Burnaby.

I do not agree with your term&quot;deadbeat&quot;. I call it money management.
1. Get some money back while you are using other people&apos;s money for a month.
2. Keep your money at the ING Direct daily saving account that give you 3% interest until you receive the credit card statement.

Yep. My friend told me that most North Americans spend $1.10 when they have $1.00 in their pocket. burnaby May 16th, 2006, 02:58 AM Your previous stmt makes sense now given it&apos;s from the perspective of a cardholder with lots of existing credit limit. It&apos;s understandable most creditor wouldn&apos;t want to extend excessive credit.

Personally I prefer to concentrate on one card given the best kickbacks are often tiered. The rest I cancel, phone to ask for credit reduction or let it expire. That way when new cards like these comes along my overall credit is not excessive thus initial credit limit is typically over 10K.

What about for those who purchase a lot since this card is capped at $40,000 per year? (eg. $250,000 per year)

I don&apos;t know where you got that, but this is from the FAQ on CT:

Is there a maximum reward that I can earn with the Cash Advantage Platinum MasterCard and Cash Advantage MasterCard?
Yes, once you have reached $2,000 in rewards for the Cash Advantage Platinum Card or $1000 in rewards for Cash Advantage MasterCard within the program year, you will no longer earn additional rewards until the following program year. A program year is considered to be 12 consecutive billing periods starting in January and ending in January of the following year

Max of $2000 per year, that means $40,000 max purchases at 5% ...

Edit: Nevermind I get it now :P You&apos;re saying the purchases are capped at $40,000. Ok. weebg May 16th, 2006, 10:57 AM It would depend on what kind of reward you wanted. I think all cash-back cards have a cap (can someone verify this?).

Edit: I just looked at the Ultramar MC card and can&apos;t find a cap on the cash-back amount anywhere. Does anyone know this off-hand?

A lot of RFDers like the Starwood MBNA cc, but I guess you have to want to spend lots of time in hotels to make it worthwhile.

It your personal preference, really.

If you spend $250k on your credit card/year, I would think a credit card that rewards airmiles or aeroplan points would be best. If you&apos;re considering Aeroplan, I would suggest the Aeroplan Plus (http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/page/0,1641,19913,00.asp) or Platinum (http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/page/0,1641,19915,00.asp?) from American Express. They give bonus points on top of the 1:1 after you reach certain spending milestones.

each $1 spent = 1 sears club point + 10 petro points
$30000 spent = 30000 sears club point + 300000 petro points

15000 sears club points = $600 sears gift card
15000 sears club points = 300000 petro points

$30000 spent = 30000 sears club point + 300000 petro points
= 15000 sears club point + 15000 sears club points + 15000 sears club points
= $600 sears gift card + $600 sears gift card + $600 sears gift card
= $1800 sears gift card
= 6% reward for using this card

is my calculations correct?

= $1800 sears gift card
= 6% reward for using this card

is my calculations correct?

Your calculation is correct if you make all your $30000 purchases at PetroCanada gas stations.

I believe you can also convert your PC points to Petro points at par value, and you get PC points at a 1% rate with the PC mastercard. There are several threads that discuss this, I think. treasureseeker May 16th, 2006, 01:35 PM Your calculation is correct if you make all your $30000 purchases at PetroCanada gas stations.

Agreed. Otherwise, there wouldn&apos;t be any point having 2 products at the same time. tkyoshi May 16th, 2006, 07:17 PM Hey, did any of you guys put that you are a student on the application form? I just got word that i was declined on the sole reason that I am a student. I&apos;m kind of annoyed at this decision, I also put my part time job on the application but they said they don&apos;t care because i&apos;m a student. :confused:

I just don&apos;t agree with the decision because their reason doesn&apos;t seem to be very justified. I have 3 other credit cards that are non student CC&apos;s.

Edit: Ah well, i talked to another CSR that was more friendly, she just mentioned that they said not approved but she didnt&apos; know the specific reason. Unfortunately she mentioned there&apos;s nothing i can do to change the decision other than try applying again in 6 months or go with the options MC.

I checked my Credit Report and there doesn&apos;t seem to be any problem there either. I guess i&apos;m the only one who got declined :( chococrazy May 17th, 2006, 11:42 AM Finally got my cash advantage card... $3900 limit.

Shojin May 17th, 2006, 01:49 PM Not to sound like I&apos;m bragging, but am I the only one on RFD to get more than a 12K limit? (15K to be precise)

I do have other cards with high limits (18k, 30k, 15k) but I carry almost no balance on those. Maybe CT weights debt-to-credit ratios more heavily that other lenders. It&apos;s better to have your debt spread out amongst several accounts rather than one CC/LOC.

And no, I&apos;m not a student....

With the CT Platinum card, If I spend $3500 in a given month, is the cash back calculated as follows:

first $500 (.5%) = $2.50
next $1000 (1%) = $10
next $1500 (3%) = $45
final $500 (5%) = $25

Total = $82.50

or is it calculated as follows:

$3500 (5%) = $175 HappyPanda May 19th, 2006, 09:21 AM not sure if this has been asked, but here goes.

Does it mean this card is still under its Trial period? cactus May 19th, 2006, 11:46 AM That&apos;s what I&apos;m thinking, easier for them to pull out if they decide not to do it anymore after a year or change the %.

YES. dogbolter May 19th, 2006, 06:18 PM I don&apos;t want to take this thread too far off topic but I thought I should point something out.

DO NOT use your SIN for anything other than employment!

This part of the CTC application is totally wrong and misleading...


I understand that credit bureau records use a social insurance number as a unique identifier. I understand that provision of my social insurance number to you is optional; however, I acknowledge that refusal to provide it may affect approval of my application and/or the credit limit I receive. I also agree that you may obtain, use and share personal information about me as necessary to administer my account and benefits.

Both of Canada&apos;s major credit bureaus, Equifax and Trans Union, have THEIR OWN unique identifiers. The SIN is a possible field on your credit bureau but it is not required to locate your credit bureau. Name, address and DOB are all they need. If you have a credit bureau and they cannot find it with this information then you should provide an existing credit card number.

No data base is secure, your SIN can be used for identity theft by any number of people who process applications or otherwise have access to customer information.

Many government agencies (excluding CRA, CSL etc.) are forbidden from collecting or using SIN information. The private sector is SUPPOSED to be doing the same thing.

See this article (http://www.privcom.gc.ca/fs-fi/02_05_d_02_e.asp)


Under the new law, organizations like banks, telecommunications companies and airlines cannot require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information unless it is required for a specific and legitimate purpose. burnaby May 19th, 2006, 06:39 PM Good point, employment can be extended to any source of income (as in you have to provide you SIN to banks for opening a savings account who than sends your annual interest income amount to CCRA).

DO NOT use your SIN for anything other than employment! sdw May 23rd, 2006, 11:58 PM No doubt the 1 year expiry is clear indication of pilot/trial period. Cards usually expires in 3-5 years.

Are we talking the same cash advantage CT mastercard? If so you continue to get 3% back as long as you spend over $1500.00.

I just got my card yesterday and it expires in MAY 2007. Bullseye May 24th, 2006, 01:22 PM Does the expiry really matter, though? If CT decides to end the program, they are free to anytime, regardless of expiry dates. sdw May 24th, 2006, 02:00 PM When did you apply? What limit did you get?

I think I applied on May 13 (give or take a day or two), received the card yesterday (May 23).

I only got a $4000 limit. I&apos;m an engineer with&gt;$10k limit on my other credit card, own a house, newish car, good credit history, decent salary.

It is going to be somewhat difficult to spend between $3000 and $4000 to maximum the cashback. I will probably make payments mid-month to get around this. I have spent $10k a month before on my VISA.

Even with the hassle of a $4000 limit, the 5% cashback makes it worthwhile for me. hotfishy May 24th, 2006, 05:02 PM it seems a bit shabby....5% cash back..hmm.. Ubershopper May 25th, 2006, 11:27 AM Thanks OP,

After about an hour and a half of reading through 41 forum pages, I&apos;ve applied for this. Spoke to a nice CSR, then applied online.

Ubershopper burnaby May 25th, 2006, 12:41 PM To all the ask first, read later folks learn from Ubershopper to read first, then ask. And BTW welcome to RFD.

Ubershopper alanbrenton May 25th, 2006, 12:57 PM I actually applied for the 5% platinum mastercard only to have been approved for the 3% card. The CSR I spoke with last week told me she sent it back for reprocessing.

Did any of you get the same experience? I called their customer service number today but the reply I got was that they had no way of figuring out what the applicant criteria for the 5% card was. Obviously, I make slightly more than the minimum income they have established.

Strange, for most card companies I have dealt with, so long as you meet the income requirement for a particular card (i.e. gold or platinum) and have a good credit history, they will not withhold approving you for the better card. burnaby May 25th, 2006, 01:08 PM They lost my April app, resend about 3 weeks ago but also applied for the plat last week.

Well i&apos;m in a slightly different situation but similar case. I was rejected outright by the computer because i put on the form that i was a student. They didn&apos;t even look at my application, and i confirmed it with a 2 CSRs when i called in. Though i&apos;m kind of suspicious because it does NOT say anywhere that students are not allowed to apply. However i did apply online so that can also mean that no physical person every looked at my application because it was declined really really fast (pretty much within 24 hours).

I do have a job and i hold other credit cards with limits up to $8,500 and i know i don&apos;t have bad credit because TD Visa and BMO Mosaik keep offering credit limit increases every few months. Furthermore i don&apos;t have any balances on my cards, i always pay them off. In fact, I just opened a BMO bank account as well which you can consent to for credit check (for holds and withdrawl limits) and the rep was surprised because she was going to put me on the standard student limit (I think 5 day hold and up to $3000 out per day or something) but the system bumped me up to no holds and some high withdrawl limit. So my credit is definately not an issue for CT.

I did confirm by pulling my credit report from equifax a few weeks after i got rejected and confirmed they didn&apos;t even make an inquiry (the BMO i opened the week before showed up but no CT inquiry).

However in your case at least they will look at your application again because i&apos;m a student *sigh*. I should have just put my job only on there or maybe that they are now manually processing I would have had a shot at least.

Any other students put student on the form and got rejected flat out too? ertman May 25th, 2006, 04:36 PM The rewards chart seems to say that you can actually get 10% cash back if you shop at Canadian Tire/Marks Work Warehouse.

Either this is the best deal ever, or their example is wrong. recordman May 25th, 2006, 04:55 PM The example is correct.

10% cash back is nice when shopping at CT and related stores, but you can also buy 20% off CT gift cards (for more info. read the AtHome thread) and get another 5% off through the cash rebate. Essentially, you&apos;re getting 24% off after all is said and done.

Superaho - When I spoke to the CSR, she was of the opinion that the online account information should be available some time this summer. I didn&apos;t ask her where this came from (eg - rumour/speculation or something in writing). She was wrong about some things like the ability to apply for the regular card so I don&apos;t know how reliable it is...

They never called or anything, but just today I got an envelope in the mail with the card. It says it has a $3000 credit limit.. not bad.

I&apos;m just curious .. I noticed on my online banking system (thru ScotiaBank) you can apply for ePost, where they send you an electronic letter through your online bank rather than a phyical letter in the mail. I&apos;m currently doing this with Bell right now, but I find that it&apos;s sort of a problem that I don&apos;t get a physical letter, because I have no idea what I&apos;m being billed for. For example, every month my bill is $20.97 except this month, it&apos;s $35.03. I don&apos;t remember making any long distance calls, but there&apos;s gotta be some because my bill is always exactly the same.

Anywho, my point is, if I apply for ePost for the CT MasterCard, they would stop mailing me a phyical letter right? Then how the heck am I supposed to know what I&apos;m being billed for? I think it would be a bit strange not to be able to see your purchases... ever. Or is there another way to check this online?

Did that post make sense?

I&apos;m sure that they have can deny anyone they want so you will have a tough time claiming that you have a&quot;right&quot;to a card. Just try phoning different CSRs and see if they can patch you through to someone that can give you a firm answer as to why you haven&apos;t been approved... tkyoshi May 27th, 2006, 04:53 PM my credit score it above 700 but don&apos;t know why when i try to apply for the 3% i didn&apos;t get approve

Yup, if you read earlier i got rejected too for being a&quot;Student&quot;, they didn&apos;t even check my credit report, it was flat out rejected on the spot when i applied (said rejected within 24 hours).


Their credit department could be smoking pot while processing all our applications for all we know. Students getting higher credit limits than those of us who are employed full-time.

Wouldn&apos;t be surprised ;)


I applied over 2 weeks ago as I wanted to use the card to buy the soccer world cup tickets. After many phone calls, I was told today that I got rejected.
The CSR did not know the reason but thought it might have something to do with my credit score.
I got my FICO score throught equifax right before I apllied and it&apos;s over 720 and should not have changed in 2 weeks.
I make 40% more than the $40,000 requirement to get the Platinum card.
The CSR suggested I try again in 6 months but I really feel that this is not right.
Is there anything that can be done to challange their decision?

That&apos;s what they told me, my score is around the same as yours too (732). I called them back a few times but they won&apos;t budge on the decision, they won&apos;t let you talk to the processing department. First they told me it might be my credit score, then i told them i just checked it and they didn&apos;t even make an inquiry, then she&apos;s like then it&apos;s cause you&apos;re a student. So maybe i should have just put my job on there instead.

I phoned 3 times, the first person was *very* rude and just said you&apos;re rejected ok? bye, and the other two said different things but none of them would let me talk to a supervisor or the processing department. The second one said i can try applying for the options MC and the third said not to bother trying cause they will reject me again, who knows. batcave May 28th, 2006, 03:09 AM One reason why they are giving accounts to students and not people with jobs is most likely the debt you might already be carrying. It could be that their criteria are based on how much of a debt load you are carrying. If all of the card holders paid off their balances in full each month, these cards would not earn CT any income; in fact, they would lose money. To make money, they need to give out cards to people that have no or little debt load and can possibly take on some or more debt load. It&apos;s part of their objectives, from the 2005 annual report:


Increase Financial Services credit card receivables by increasing the number of accounts that have balances by three percent to four percent and, by increasing average balances.

I have about 10 active credit card accounts, but don&apos;t have any significant debt (my mortgage will be paid off in two years), yet credit card companies are still happy to give me new cards. I&apos;d be willing to bet that I could apply (and be accepted) for a cash advantage platinum card along with my regular cash advantage card and my Option MC (which is unused now) because I have no debt other than my mortgage. alanbrenton May 28th, 2006, 09:03 AM Would this statement actually run counter to xiggy&apos;s example? If I only had a $1,800 credit limit, does that mean that the most I can get for the month is 3% (I only have the 3% mc) x $1,800 = $54? Could someone please confirm. Thanks in advance.


I should clarify - it is possible to make a larger purchase by making a pre-payment to your card... the issue is that you will NOT receive 5% cash back on any purchases BEYOND your credit limit. I confirmed this with CSR.

And seshwan - no need to be cruel, everyone is just looking for confirmation since their terms aren&apos;t completely clear. mrG May 28th, 2006, 10:53 AM Would this statement actually run counter to xiggy&apos;s example?

It IS definitely possible. As the other posts state, just spend $1800, pay it off, spend $1800 again, pay it off, etc, multiple times a month. For example: If you do this, say, 3 times a month, you can charge a total of $1800x3 = $5400 and get $162 (3%) back. trolldealhunter May 28th, 2006, 10:54 AM Would this statement actually run counter to xiggy&apos;s example?

no, the credit limit is what you are allowed to buy at any given time. However in my experience one can call his/her CC company and get the limit risen (if you wanted to buy a new fridge for example). burnaby May 28th, 2006, 01:11 PM CT isn&apos;t like most with their inconsistent approval of applications and granting of limits. Thus far all have posted their refusal to increase limits and to try again in several (six) months.

CT does not seem to be following any financial institution patterns in granting their CC. If one had to bet it&apos;d be against them issuing all three CCs to same individual on the same basis of their inconsistent limits setting.

When eventually they start their banking service I certainly wouldn&apos;t immediately trust them with my money. Thus far CT seems VERY incompetent.

$0.00? dasteve May 28th, 2006, 03:28 PM It IS definitely possible. As the other posts state, just spend $1800, pay it off, spend $1800 again, pay it off, etc, multiple times a month.

If you&apos;re going to be spending over $5400, you may aswell go for the 5% card ...

3% card: $5400 @ 3% = $162 reward
5% card: $5400 @ 5% = $270 reward - $99 annual fee = $171 reward AND further spending is now up to 5% ... tkyoshi May 28th, 2006, 03:32 PM Your theory is not consistent with the many students who reported rejection.

Yeah i agree, there theory doesn&apos;t apply to me as I pay my off my cards in full. The point I want to make again is they did NOT even look at my credit report, they just rejected me on the spot.

Other card companies are happy to give me credit as well, in fact TD and BMO just bumped my limit recently without asking. Hellfire May 28th, 2006, 04:06 PM $0

What information do they ask when granting supplementary cards? Will they ask about the ages of the supplementary card holders? How strict are they when it comes to these since the primary cardholder is on the hook anyway.

Thanks. recordman May 28th, 2006, 05:47 PM Check the application: https://www.ctfs.com/english/cashadvantage/omr_apply_page02.html

Only the name and relationship of the supplemental holder are required. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s strict at all. I&apos;ve never been denied a supplement card--tried it with two CT cards, plus a PCF MC.

Thanks. burnaby May 28th, 2006, 05:56 PM Both online and paper apps only ask for Name and relationship. They not strict at all cause it&apos;s stated the primary cardholder is responsible for all transactions. Should try to get one for my cat to see if it&apos;ll work.

I&apos;m not sure I want to know what you will put for relationship... j/k! :lol: Tuppin May 29th, 2006, 07:50 AM Not sure if people are aware of this or not. If you call the number on the back of the card you can then punch in your card number and get a report on how much you have put on your card and the credit limit remaining. Just keep in mind that if you have transactions pending then they will be deducted from your credit limit but not show up as purchases yet.
Example.....if your credit limit is $4000 the report might say you have $2000 on your card with a credit limit remaining of $1000. That is because you made a purchase of $1000 that shows up but hasn&apos;t officially gone through yet. burnaby May 29th, 2006, 01:02 PM Paper apps has&quot;other&quot;, online has&quot;significant other&quot;; isn&apos;t the significant part implied as opposed to&quot;insignificant&quot;other :)

I&apos;m not sure I want to know what you will put for relationship... j/k! :lol: burnaby May 29th, 2006, 01:05 PM It&apos;s been mentioned several times now buried in this ever growing thread. Payment from electronic banking seems to take around 2 business days to show up.

Called up CTF and they said they are right in the middle of reviewing it, is that code for rejected? TanGU May 29th, 2006, 09:41 PM hi guys,

I read the post..

Last week i just applied on the web for the regular Canadian Tire&quot;Options&quot;Mastercard (http://www.ctfs.com/english/optionsmastercard/offers.html). Arghhh didn&apos;t know they have a platinum !!

At the time, i was looking for how much percentage they give... couldn&apos;t find it anywhere on the web site? (on the regular card i mean)

1.
Should i cancel my other application and apply to the Platinum one instead? If yes, how do i cancel it to apply on the new one?

2.
With the platinum card, can we see how much point we earn directly at the cashier of Canadian Tire? Let say the cashier said that i have 30$ in the card, then subtract that amount from my actual item i want to buy?

-TanGU. recordman May 29th, 2006, 09:43 PM No. When I applied for the 3% card, I waited 3 weeks with no news. I called them up and they said my application was just being worked on. 10 days later I received the card.

Option card is another card. It is not the 3% card. Option card gives you CT money. The cash advantage card gives you 3% (max) cash reward. The cash advantage platnium gives you 5% (max) cash reward.

-TanGU.

First, it is not a point card.
Second, no. They give you reward every 3 months.
Third, it does not really matter because if your credit card has a positive balance (from the reward), substraction is automatic. The cashier knows nothing about your credit card&quot;money&quot;balance. Remember this one is not the Option card.

BTW, CT has Option card, Cash advantage card, Gas advantage and one more (I think). You need to know which one you are talking about. Madwand May 29th, 2006, 09:53 PM It was a full 9 business days to receive my card in the mail.

I have a perfect A1 credit payment history, although I have a fair amount of available credit out there to use up.

I was not given the Platinum, instead the lousy 3% with a $2700 limit.

I have a $13,000 purchase to make. I&apos;ll put a credit on the account first and then go shopping. After that I&apos;ll write a stern complaint letter to them to try and get my extra 2%. It&apos;s not my fault, it seems as if they are pushing the regular card more often.

I am in the same boat as you are. I received a 3% card with $2500 limit today. I have good credit rating but with a few credit cards with huge limits ($47000, $22000, $25000, $7000&amp;$5000 = $106,000 total). Yes, I have a good payment history. But the credit manager does not like to give high limit to individual that has lots of credits. In the past, I was able to request for credit increase after a few months by max out my card limits every month.

Some post said CT makes money when the card holder carries a balance. CT does not make any money off people like you and me who pays off their credit card every month. burnaby May 30th, 2006, 12:03 AM Read this thread to realize CT does not seem to care much about your A1 credit history nor your $85k income. As a business they have full right to grant you whatever limits they wish so complaint away.

Yes, they do. burnaby May 30th, 2006, 01:23 PM CT is obviously targetting similar structure to PC financials with upcoming CT Bank services. Apparently they want to play with the big boys instead of being a department store. Note back of card states it&apos;s from&quot;Canadian Tire Bank&quot;.

Has any student had any success getting that? I&apos;ve been too lazy to try.

if you have had a credit card for a year, you can still try applying for the Enrich card.

For those of you that have a VERY clean credit history, you could open a MasterCard/Visa Merchant Account with a bank, that gives you the ability to charge people&apos;s credit cards.

after 40k, use a capital one no annual fee 1% cash back card. no tiers.

or simply get your spouse to apply for another canadian tire card then use another 40k. a_1_a Jun 3rd, 2006, 02:13 AM and for those of you that are not citizens of canada. don&apos;t worry about that. the hardest part is getting your first credit card, after that, you can apply for several more easily. the credit card company won&apos;t ask to see your passport.

I don&apos;t think the Paypal acct. way would make economic sense because Mastercard charges 2.5% for currency conversion. Also Paypal&apos;s conversion rate for US$ to CDN$ is very low. You would loose about 3% to convert US$ back to CDN$ in Paypal. So you would loose 2.5% + 3% to use Paypal with your Mastercard. st7860 Jun 3rd, 2006, 02:16 AM I don&apos;t think the Paypal acct. way would make economic sense because Mastercard charges 2.5% for currency conversion.

See, that&apos;s illegal. Using your own merchant account to give yourself cash advances is against ANY merchant account regulations.

Not to mention, to sign up for a merchant account, you need to actually have a registered business (they make you forward all your registration papers along with sample marketing materials and a void check from a BUSINESS checking account).

The PayPal method also doesn&apos;t work - they have anti-cash advance mechanisms in place that will also prevent you from doing what you suggest.

Stop trying to scam the system. It really isn&apos;t going to work. st7860 Jun 3rd, 2006, 11:13 AM so what? then pay $100 or whatever it costs to do a name search and register yourself as a propietorship. If you&apos;re so concerned about a cash advance then get your friend to apply for that credit card then charge him $40,000 for services.

Most merchant accounts cost about 3% to use so after paying alll of the fees, you&apos;ll end up with around a $700 profit for a few weeks of work.

If you&apos;re so concerned about a cash advance then get your friend to apply for that credit card then charge him $40,000 for services.

Once you register, you then have to start filing GST and RST returns. The government will become suspicious when you have no sales and no income to report on those, but you&apos;re processing tens of thousands of dollars on credit cards. Really, they aren&apos;t stupid. Nor are the merchant providers.

Getting Revenue Canada on your ***** probably isn&apos;t a good idea. Screwing with the system by intentionally doing cash advances and stuff probably isn&apos;t wise either lest it affect your credit rating once the banks/Visa/MC catch onto your stupid little scheme.

Thanks for that, genius. However, you forgot to add that for services rendred for $40,000 because you&apos;re registered for GST and PST (as you MUST be to register a merchant account), you&apos;re going to be liable for remitting ~$6000 in sales/service taxes on thsoe $40,000 you charged to&quot;your client&quot;.

You know, I get the sense that you have huge balls to screw with the system. I&apos;ve read some of your other posts in which you suggest:

1) Lying about your income and putting a bogus but credible employer in order to get a credit card (in this thread).

2) Grossly lying about your income (how many people make $95,000?) in order to get a credit limit increase (in the CIBC Dividends thread).

I do hope you STOP sharing this stupid advice with the RFD community - blowing your credit rating and screwing with Revenue Canada on your own is one thing - suggesting others do it is BEYOND stupid. Drew_W Jun 3rd, 2006, 11:29 AM What you say is what you are

In fact, that bracket is $30,000. Anually. So your scheme only works to $29,999.99 PER YEAR. You walk away with $600 on which you pay maybe 30% tax, so that&apos;s what $420?

Well $45,000 is a lot of credit. If you were to apply for a mortgage now, you&apos;d probably be rejected until you cancel some of those credit cards.

Not really. I can just pick out 3 of my credit cards and it would reach that much. Unless your income/credit score is really marginal, $45K is not a big deal in a $200K mortgage. If your credit is really marginal, $5K may be too much already.

BTW, my Airmiles Amex (one of my 3 Amex) has just send me a mail offering me to have&quot;lower interest rate&quot;12.99% but I need to get $20K limit. That card already has the credit limit of $12K. Since I don&apos;t use that card anymore and don&apos;t consider 12.99% is low and I don&apos;t really need even more credit, I teared it up and threw it away. batcave Jun 4th, 2006, 01:28 AM Well $45,000 is a lot of credit.

Not really. I can just pick out 3 of my credit cards and it would reach that much. Unless your income/credit score is really marginal, $45K is not a big deal in a $200K mortgage. If your credit is really marginal, $5K may be too much already.

BTW, my Airmiles Amex (one of my 3 Amex) has just send me a mail offering me to have&quot;lower interest rate&quot;12.99% but I need to get $20K limit. That card already has the credit limit of $12K. Since I don&apos;t use that card anymore and don&apos;t consider 12.99% is low and I don&apos;t really need even more credit, I teared it up and threw it away.
I&apos;m not sure that the available credit has anything to do with being approved for a mortgage or not. I think it&apos;s up to the individual mortgage officer. I recently got a new mortgage at a bank. The person was surprised by the number of credit cards and available credit on them, but suggested I close some of the accounts and I got the mortgage anyway.

I think if you have more equity in your home/investements than debt + available credit, then they don&apos;t care how many credit cards or credit products you have.

I had about 10 CC accounts, most of them had a minimum $10K limit, some has $20K limits. But I only used two cards (Visa&amp;Amex) on a regular basis. I also have two LOC accounts that equal the same amount of credit of all of my CCs. I think I&apos;m just an average person. There are others out there with more credit and money than I. It&apos;s a fine line. batcave Jun 4th, 2006, 01:40 AM For many it&apos;s what card to use after $40k.
Use the Platinum Cashback MC for the first $40,000 ($2,000) and the regular Cashback MC for the next $33,333.33 ($1,000). :)

That&apos;s $73,333.33 spent on credit cards in a year. If you can do that, you might not care about $3,000 cash back. burnaby Jun 4th, 2006, 01:42 AM I use my 5% CC to buy MWI GCs.

I meant to say for using CC to buy GCs instore then using these GCs wouldn&apos;t have additional benefits. There are stores that give you store benefits when you buy their GCs instore and once again when you pay for merchandise with the GCs (thus the double dip). In all cases the cash kickback from the CC is independent. Sorry for any confusion.

I am talking about the CT mastercard 3% cash reward. Not the CT money. The reward from the card (as Mastercard) instead of the reward from the store.

Are you saying if I use CT 3% card to buy CT GC, I will not get any reward (because it is CT gift card)?
But if I use it to buy (say) Futureshop GC, I will?
If this is the case, how does the CT mastercard know what I buy? It should just know I have a transaction of $N in CT without knowing the detail.

BTW, I was using my Amex Gold (2%) to buy CT GC and I get my reward. I wonder if I should use this card (3%) to do the same thing from now on. burnaby Jun 4th, 2006, 01:47 AM Those with $73k annual disposible income (DI) probably are just as thrifty as most, RDFers always the exception.

Thinking more for the family with say $50k annual CC spending is it worth it to get a second 5% card (bet many here are in that situation).

Use the Platinum Cashback MC for the first $40,000 ($2,000) and the regular Cashback MC for the next $33,333.33 ($1,000). :)

That&apos;s $73,333.33 spent on credit cards in a year. If you can do that, you might not care about $3,000 cash back. Bullseye Jun 4th, 2006, 07:21 AM My mortgage consultant told me that lenders don&apos;t care about your available credit, only what your monthly payment obligations are (ie. if you carry a balance on that credit). That agrees with my situation, my wife and I have about $150k in available credit, and it&apos;s never prevented us getting a mortgage. burnaby Jun 4th, 2006, 01:39 PM Isn&apos;t your max monthly payment obligation tied to your credit limit. Say you LOC and CC requires 5% min monthly payment. In your case min monthly payment is $7.5k if you max out your credits of $150k. Would a Lender want to grant you more credits that&apos;ll increase you max monthly payment.

We have zero balance on that credit, so no payment obligations, which is why I assumeit has no effect. burnaby Jun 4th, 2006, 01:53 PM There is a potential liability in that you could do max cash advance on every card the day after mortgage is approved with no ability to pay min monthly payment based on income.

True, and I&apos;ve heard that some department store lenders factor this in, but they don&apos;t for mortgages, apparently.

I believe that a credit score in the 800&apos;s isn&apos;t good because it shows that although you have a great credit history, you don&apos;t really use the credit. They probably figure why give a $10K limit to someone who&apos;s only ever going to use $3K? recordman Jun 5th, 2006, 03:55 PM It seems a too good of a credit history is actually bad for getting cards like this. If they didn&apos;t think they&apos;ll make any money from you, they may just not give you the card. Hence, they don&apos;t want to tell you the real reason.

LoL oh I use my credit all the time, 15 - 20K on my credit cards every month, but I pay them off.

The poster below you is right, the higher your credit score the less likely you are to get the better card and a high limit because the likelihood of you being delinquent on your account and paying interest and such is slim to none. Drew_W Jun 5th, 2006, 04:19 PM its not a game with the Canada Revenue Agency, you simply get a merchant account, charge yourself a total of around $40,000, and report whatever income you make from the rewards on your annual income tax return

I&apos;m going to say it one last time:

1) To get a merchant account, you have to be a registered business (meaning you collect sales tax either provincially or both prov/federally).

2) If you charge someone $40,000, you are assumed to be selling something to an end user, and must charge them sales tax of 15% since $40,000 is greater than the $30,000 annual threshold above which you MUST register for GST.

It&apos;s really quite simple. 15% you remit to the government in PST/GST&gt;5% you get via cash back, thus you lose money.

You appear to be an average working person with plenty of credit. worst case all you&apos;ll see on the report is a slightly negative report saying you&apos;re seeking credit, but given your status, your score will likely be far over 700 anyway.

IMPROVING YOUR CREDIT SCORES

While we are told by Fair Isaac and others that the sure way to a good Credit Score is paying your bills on time, THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE!

8) The ratio of outstanding debt to total available revolving credit is EXTREMELY important.

If your cards are maxed out, your scores will be significantly lower.

Be aware that when PAYING DOWN debt, it might take up to 3 months to show up on your credit and the scores are based on your credit report. baomin Jun 5th, 2006, 05:16 PM Cash Advantage Platinum MasterCard andCash Advantage MasterCard are not available in Quebec. burnaby Jun 5th, 2006, 05:17 PM Most of us do our best to stay under the CCRA audit radar through reasonable tax returns.

Mortgages usually will not show up on your www.equifax.ca credit report. You may see a remark that a mortgage or finance company checked your credit, but the report won&apos;t show your mortgage balance. So for the purposes of credit/debt ratio, you have no debt to the automated system, although a loans officer at a BANK may ask you if you have a mortgage and what the balance is.

So in other words, you in theory should be good to go on the credit application with a nice JUICY limit. Jack up your income as much as you ethically can, such as include spouses income under the household section and so on.

You don&apos;t need soley employment to get a platinum card. You also need a beacon of around 700 or higher, otherwise you&apos;ll be relegated to the ranks of subprime lenders such as MBNA nolookingca Jun 6th, 2006, 04:43 PM &quot;Platinum&quot;may bring status in some situations, but the issuer&quot;Crappy Tire&quot;kills any of it. :lol:

all credit card companies in Canada offer a 1-800 or 1-877 number with which to check your balance. you could also simply walk into ANY BANK that issues mastercard and pay your(ANY BANKs) mastercard bill early without waiting for the bill to arrive if needed. nolookingca Jun 6th, 2006, 05:03 PM So how do you pay your bill with this card?

CIBC or TDBANK tend to be not as cranky with randomly stopping cards like that.

also only Rogers and Fido have the requirement for the CVV code on the back of your card for bill payments. most online bill payments such as Telus, Telus Mobility, Shaw cable, and so on do not require the CVV code. besides, its just a phone bill, something they(the credit card company)can easily recover with a charge back, its not like a plasma tv or something. cactus Jun 7th, 2006, 11:13 AM Called today to inquire about Foreign Currency Exchange&quot;fee&quot;. It is between 1.8% - 2.5% for most major credit cards. 2.5% for both the CT CA/CA Platinum. So you end up not having to&quot;pay&quot;that fee, assuming you get at least 3% back (although it is an opportunity cost). Still better than using other reward cards I guess? burnaby Jun 7th, 2006, 11:17 AM For sure better. As you stated all banks charges the premium with diff of best/worst being 0.7% thus unless you can find a card with 4.3% cashback and 1.8% prem CT still rules.

Personal gut feeling is the 5% card won&apos;t last once CT has establised clientelle. It&apos;ll be crawl back so enjoy while it last. combined with GCs the deal is wicky.

When asked why they didn&apos;t call me prior to the&quot;not approve&quot;the CSR didn&apos;t give a straight answer but rather a call them for any exception. Teething pains for sure. Too bad once the kinks are out so are the perks.

http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=92936


The GCs are 20% off + 5% cashback with this C/C giving a net discount of 24% off.

For example,
- buy a $100 GC
- you charge $80 onto your C/C. (20% off $100)
- you get $4 cashback (5% of $80)
- your net cost is $76
- your net discount is $24
- $24 / $100 = 24% off. burnaby Jun 7th, 2006, 05:03 PM NOOB are those who don&apos;t ask good questions. That XIGGY is quick.

Bet you most PLAT cardholders didn&apos;t know about the no bonus.

It says right on their website that there is no bonus for the 5% card. Bullseye Jun 14th, 2006, 01:05 PM One of my clients is a company that has employees travelling all the time, I sent the app link to all of them a while back, they will all easily max out the $2000 per year limit. I&apos;m looking so good for that one right now, so thanks, RFD! Drew_W Jun 14th, 2006, 02:58 PM I can&apos;t see how 5% cash back is sustainable. If a person has a merchant friend, he/she could just ring the card through their machine to maximize the 5% back. It only costs a merchant an average of 2% to run credit card transactions.

We discussed this for PAGES on end earlier in the thread. Doing cash advances like that is against merchant policy, not to mention ringing through $40,000 in the event of an audit will cause problems because that&apos;s&quot;business income&quot;you didn&apos;t charge sales tax on.

Bottom line = not worth the hassle/risk to a business.

And the average is actually around 3-3.5%. You have to be fairly large to get merchant rates down to 2%.

CT is betting on the allure of cashback causing you to spend more and carrying a balance on the card so they earn interest income. This explains the rather inconsistent pattern of approvals/denials/platinum card approvals/credit limits/etc. Dynomite2910 Jun 14th, 2006, 03:48 PM One of my clients is a company that has employees travelling all the time, I sent the app link to all of them a while back, they will all easily max out the $2000 per year limit.

Interesting that it you have to agree to the following statement right on the application form:

I agree that I will not use the card for or in connection with any business.

I can&apos;t imagine they would hassle anyone who is simply billing expenses for their job that they are paid back for but they might give someone a hassle if they are charging tons of stuff for their own business.

I think for flights they can&apos;t really hassle you, but i guess if you were purchasing things from say distributors it would be easy to tell you are using it for business cause normal people aren&apos;t able to buy from them.

It&apos;s flights, hotels, rentals, etc, and the employees get reimbursed for it all.

It does look like we&apos;re outta luck on the activation bonus (for Platinum)...Here&apos;s from the CT Advantage website.

Actually, FAQ says that you should get at least 30 days of 3% rebate bonus after your activation. I called CT CSR and she said I should get the bonus until July 15 because my statement day is on the 15th of each month and I received&amp;activated my card on May 29. So my next stament day is Jun. 15. So that is less than 30 days. So my bonus will run until my second statement day of July 15.
Can anyone call CSR and verify that is true for everyone?

Actuall It says on the FAQ:

Is the Maximum Activation Bonus (only available with the Cash Advantage MasterCard) a one-time earning or earnings throughout the current month?

You will be entitled to the Maximum Activation Bonus of 3% cash back for a minimum of 30 days from the day you activate and use the card for the first time.
For example, if you activate and use the card on November 23rd and your first statement period runs from November 23rd to December 15th, you will enjoy the activation bonus from November 23rd to December 23rd (the guaranteed 30 days). PLUS, as an added bonus, we are extending your 3% activation bonus for the remainder of the next statement period (December 24th to January 15th). burnaby Jun 14th, 2006, 07:11 PM Following the letters of the rules it&apos;s not legit though realistically they&apos;ll look the other way for some business use unless it&apos;s obvious like booking tickets/room for everyone on same card.

kind of confusing but I&apos;ll give an example..

My limit is 3k. After the first two weeks I charge up 2.8k, then pay 1k, then charge up another 1k in the final two weeks. Once I get the statement, does the cashback apply to 3.8k or 2.8k ?

If I understand your question, you are asking this: If I max out my card and pay the minimum each month, will I get credited for the cashback on the outstanding balance in subsequent months?

Hahaha! I&apos;m gonna say no on that... If the card charges 18% per annum on outstanding balances, that works out to approximately 1.5% per month. If they did what you are suggesting, anyone with a platinum Cash Advantage card and a limit over $3000 could max it out, pay minimum balances only and net 3.5% a month!!! dasteve Jun 14th, 2006, 11:13 PM If I understand your question, you are asking this: If I max out my card and pay the minimum each month, will I get credited for the cashback on the outstanding balance in subsequent months?

That&apos;s not what he was asking... He&apos;s asking if it&apos;s the statement balance that gives you the cashback %&apos;s, or your debits for the entire statement. Ie/ If I spend $6000 when my credit limit is $3000 (paying $3000 sometime in the middle), will the cashback be on $6000 or $3000? I think the answer is the cashback will be $6000 based on what I&apos;ve read in the thread. crxmugen Jun 15th, 2006, 04:42 AM Sorry if this has been asked before, it&apos;s kind of hard to find an answer through 59 pages.. but does anyone know if the cashback is calculated based on how much you charge in total each month or the remaining balance of the month that goes unpaid when they issue a statement?

Is there reference of some kind? Don&apos;t remember I see summary when sign up.

Another question if possible. If I order 8000 in certificate use this credit card and next month 1600 credit in my account. Do they take money from back if next month I don&apos;t buy and account balance -1600 credit? cactus Jun 15th, 2006, 11:20 AM I believe they use your name, phone number, address and DOB to look it up.

Yes, if you get your credits back, then you won&apos;t get the cashback for that portion, or else everyone would just buy stuff, get the money and then return everything.

They can discontinue anytime but 99.9% sure legally must provide reward or give ample time to use it up before terminating.

For the regular Cash Advantage (3%), they give you the max 3% for the first statement even if you&apos;re way under. ie/ spent only $100 in a month -- typically you would get $1 (1%), but the first month it would be $3 (3%) .. It&apos;s only the first statement and not for platinum (5%) cards. yu130960 Jun 16th, 2006, 12:25 AM Is there an online web site to check the balance for the cash advantage mastercard? burnaby Jun 16th, 2006, 12:30 AM NO :mad:

Not exactly understand what you were talking about. I assume you mean your ordered $8000 gift certficate and then cancel the order.

1. you can only get 3% and not 30%. Hence, you will get only $160.
2. they pay out only 4 times per year. Unless &apos;this&apos; month happens to be the pay out month, you don&apos;t get the credit.
3. Say, this month happens to be the pay out month, yes, they will reduce $160. burnaby Jun 16th, 2006, 01:03 AM Same question came up several times before starting way back with the 3% card.

You can call the 1-800 number on back of card to ask CSR for info including transactions, stmt dates, etc. Better than nothing, darn I miss my online stmt.

Those with 5% card better check their stmt date to plan their spendings to reach their target tier esp. on first stmt as 5% card does not have first 30days kickback bonus.

But the difference between the first and 2nd apps are:

Person 1 did not have a mortgage, asked for a supplementary card, is married, provided SIN, has a CT Options MC and no gas card, and has a credit score in 800s with many credit cards with high limits.

Person 2 has a mortgage, did not ask for a supplementary card, is not married, did not provide SIN, does not have a store or gas card, has a credit score in the 700s with a few credit cards with limits 5K or under.

Just called in today and found out person 2 got approved for the Platinum card with 5% cash back and got a $3200 limit. So looks like they are definitely not approving ppl with very high credit ratings for the 5% card. dasteve Jun 16th, 2006, 04:17 PM Just called in today and found out person 2 got approved for the Platinum card with 5% cash back.

Damn you! I&apos;m jealous. burnaby Jun 16th, 2006, 06:03 PM It&apos;s inconceivable how CT can grant a 12.5k limit when others have reported:
$100k income, own their home&amp;cars, no debt, good credit get less than half that limit.

What did you do to get that kind of limit?

I didn&apos;t do anything, I just applied online. My income is fairly high, I have a small mortgage, have always paid my bills on time, no other debt, fairly strong history for credit. No idea why my credit limit was $12.5K. My other cards have higher limits but $12.5K isn&apos;t bad for the 1st time I applied with them I guess.

Maybe the average RFD&apos;er is younger and therefore doesn&apos;t have as much credit history to justify a higher limit yet based on CT&apos;s formula? burnaby Jun 16th, 2006, 06:42 PM Would love to understand CT&apos;s limit formula which does not seem to follow usual banks.

Because of mail in and online app they granted me the 3% and 5% card each with $5k limit within 2 days of each other despite the request to cancel 3% card app. Wonder if they&apos;ll cancel the 3% card and add that limit to make the 5% card $10k limit.

3. Say, this month happens to be the pay out month, yes, they will reduce $160.

What I mean is if order 8000, next month I get credit 1600 back Athome gift certificate.

Let me make example. If I order just 9000 get 1800 back for 5% after 3 month. Month 4 is payout. After credit back, it is under limit for 5% so drop whole amount back to 3%?

Month 1:spend 3000
Month 2: spend 0, credit 600, balance -600

How do -600 get calculate?

To be save we need order 3600 for min 5%?

Sorry very confuse right now. Xiggy Jun 16th, 2006, 09:10 PM Your last bit of math is incorrect. I think you meant order $3750 and after 20% credit ($750) you&apos;ll be left with $3000 to qualify for the 5% cash back. So yes, to be on the safe side, order a minimum of $3750 and you get 5% for sure.

As for your question, it&apos;s answered in the terms&amp;conditions that came with your card. I&apos;ve read it but am still not exactly sure what it&apos;s trying to say. Although I&apos;m sure it&apos;s along the lines of&quot;we&apos;ll take back whatever cash back we gave you in the previous payout period if you&apos;ve returned/refunded your purchases&quot;. I&apos;m thinking if you got 5% cash back, they&apos;ll take it back at 5%. Don&apos;t know if they&apos;ll retro-actively recalculate your previous month&apos;s amount at the lower 3% if you happen to fall below the $3000 threshold (although I&apos;m sure they WILL... CT won&apos;t give you more than what you&apos;re suppose get). tjuzer Jun 18th, 2006, 12:43 AM Thank you.

Airmiles amex is bs, especially after they uped the $20 Dominion gift certificates from 125 miles to 140. I did the caluclation way back when but I think it works out to 1% and you have to do all the waiting and running around.

No they will not tell you at all, nor will they let you talk to anyone in the application&apos;s department.

Seems sometimes when they hear the word student like they did with me, they will automatically decline you without actually checking anything. Had I put my normal job only I&apos;m sure they wouldn&apos;t have flat out denied me. They didn&apos;t even do a credit check, I know cause I checked my credit report after they gave me oh your credit rating must not be good BS. hsedin Jun 20th, 2006, 03:24 PM I had applied for the Platinum last week.

I have the Options card with a limit of $20k and they give me such a low amount on this one :mad:


Suppose you charge $5000 and next month return an item for a credit of $2000 and charge $2500 for a net of $500. How much cash back would you get?

1st month $5000 at 5% = $250

2nd month -$2000 at 5% = -$100 or is it -$2000 at 3%?
new charges $2500 at 3% = $75
net charges $500 at 1% = $5

2nd month cash back = -$100$ + $75 =$25
or is it $500 net charges at 1% = $5? yu130960 Jun 20th, 2006, 04:29 PM I had applied for the Platinum last week. On seeing the above posts, I called CT on a whim and was told I had been approved for the Platinum and should be getting my card in 7-10 days! :lol:

2nd month -$2000 at 5% = -$100 or is it -$2000 at 3%?
new charges $2500 at 3% = $75
net charges $500 at 1% = $5

2nd month cash back = -$100$ + $75 =$25
or is it $500 net charges at 1% = $5?
Good Lord man., what sort of scam are you trying to concoct now? burnaby Jun 20th, 2006, 05:41 PM I had the exact same question but was too lazy to type it up.

Vaguely recall kickback is based on the amount paid thus in your example assuming you paid both bill in full:
1st month $5000 at 5% = $250
2nd month $500 at 1% = $5

Anyone read/understand the rules?

Finally!
I applied for the Platinum about 5 wks ago and today they tell me I was approved on June 9 for a limit of $4400. Can&apos;t believe I still haven&apos;t received it in the mail yet.
I have the Options card with a limit of $20k and they give me such a low amount on this one :mad:

Why does that matter? cactus Jun 20th, 2006, 05:56 PM Because I don&apos;t want them calling my manager, not that I&apos;m going to lie about anything, I just don&apos;t like to bother anyone with references unless it is really needed (ie. job reference)



Why does that matter? burnaby Jun 20th, 2006, 05:56 PM [edit:] They called my work number for confirmation. They wanted the company number which I didn&apos;t have so I told them to look it up.

No answers for you unless you provide a legitimate reason for asking

Since they ask you to provide a phone number, there is always a chance they will call. Well, get used to having a chance to bother someone because a lot of thing you apply for the future needs employer and phone number. bubble.tea Jun 20th, 2006, 06:16 PM Now say sorry to leafian for your lack of understanding of a rather confusing cashback situation.

well I was being facetious, clearly calculating returns and earnings...just seemed so awkward :lol: cactus Jun 20th, 2006, 06:24 PM Yes, there are a lot of applications out there where you have to fill in your employer and phone number. It&apos;s not hard to&quot;get used&quot;to it. I am just being considerate because my Manager is a very busy person and I do not want to bother her unless it is absolutely necessary. Plus the fact that she&apos;s always on the road, last time I needed her reference for something, they couldn&apos;t get a hold of her for over a week.

The thing is, my company is so big, I dont&apos; know what phone number to give them. No central line or switchboard or anything. I guess I can give them the information line and they can talk to the computer....I&apos;m just gonna give them my direct line. They will know I work there when they hear I say the company name after I picked up I guess.

Thanks for your help gman and burnaby!

When they call CT did ask if I own the company (yeah, I wish!). Told them it&apos;s a big company, I don&apos;t have the central number, told them to look it up. Not sure if they actually looked up the number and call but they did approve the card within 2 days.

Thanks for your help gman and burnaby! sjweyman Jun 21st, 2006, 11:20 PM I just spoke with a CSR at CTFS and she just told me that because I am in New Brunswick I am not eligible for the cash rewards on the card. I have the card in my wallet and have been using it. She even checked with supervisor who told her the same thing.

Is there anyone outside of the so-called&quot;test region&quot;(espeically interested in hearing from the Atlantic provinces) that has received one or more cash rewards????

She said it should be available in New Brunswick by late summer.

You mean you have the &apos;Cash Advantage&apos; card, but have been told that you won&apos;t be getting any cash? That&apos;s bizarre.

That&apos;s correct and I have no idea why that would be the case. I&apos;m assuming both she and her supervisor are misinformed ... but I wanted some independant confirmation to make sure. She sounded pretty certain. She was surprised I had the card at all but after I explained to her how I got the card she talked to her supervisor and told me that she didn&apos;t think I would be eligible for any cash back on the card until after they officially expand to other areas later this year. dasteve Jun 22nd, 2006, 09:14 AM That&apos;s correct and I have no idea why that would be the case.

It doesn&apos;t say anything of this on the back of the statement, legal conditions. I think they have to give you it, but I&apos;m not a lawyer. burnaby Jun 22nd, 2006, 01:28 PM Don&apos;t see legally how they can deny you the cash back. Take the scenario of moving from an eligible to an ineligible city. At most they can do is cancel your card and complete their cashback obligations. Unless the really fine print has an obscure condition or you live in Quebec with their law/regulations CT can&apos;t arbitrarily decide on eligiblility.

Just wondering what kind of math this is? At 5% $4950 will get you $247.50 back. The annual fee is $99. If you hit $3000 you will get $150 back. ($2999 will only get you $89.97). You just need to hit $3000 one time to make back your annual fee and a bit extra. FacistCop Jun 22nd, 2006, 10:21 PM Just wondering what kind of math this is? At 5% $4950 will get you $247.50 back.

and how does that make you feel? - psychology Dynomite2910 Jun 23rd, 2006, 09:26 AM Received my new Cash Advantage Platinum Mastercard today - exactly one week after applying online.

Limit is only $5,900 -- which seems a little low to me compared to what most card companies have given me in the past. I assume they will adjust upwards as we use the card agressively and responsibly.

My wife and I were spending approx 50K+ plus per year on 3 different cards previously without really trying. So our plan is to put all spending on this card and charge everything we can to hit the 3K/month magic number as often as possible. In theory, we should be able to get the full $2K back -- which would translate into a nice little vacation each year!

Let the spending begin! Thanks OP.

:D Thanks for the smile :) Octavius Jun 23rd, 2006, 09:53 AM I just got my Canadian Tire Cash Advantage Mastercard (non-platinum) in the mail a few days ago. It took me 3 weeks to get it since I applied online.

It expires in 2 years from now, and they gave me the most pitiful credit limit in the world, 1600.00.

Considering all of my other cards are 5k-8k, this is ridiculous. Gonna be difficult to stay below the limit, all while trying to ensure I get the max 3%....

They knew this would happen....they&apos;re making it difficult...

Thats ok though, buy stuff, wait for it to post on the account, then pay....

Win-Win :cheesygri

Edit: My credit rating isn&apos;t the problem here, it&apos;s around 750, its just their arbitrary credit limits :confused: burnaby Jun 23rd, 2006, 12:33 PM Applied via snail mail for 3%, then three weeks later 5% came available online thus applied for that. Called CSR to cancel 3% app, competent bunch. :(

PS. No idea what my rating is. Have never been denied for gold/plat card thus too darn lazy to get an Equifax report.

Many have reported getting around $5k when all their other gold/plat card are in the $20k range.

No doubt though the pain to hit the 1.5 to 1.6k range each billing period to max the benefits.

They told me this does NOT work when I spoke to the CSR. I asked her a million questions.

She said if you PREPAY before you charge something to the card giving you a positive balance (say +$500) then this positive balance will only be applied to your NEXT statement ... not purchases made on the current statement.

However, she did say it was possible to go make your $500 purchase, wait until it is applied to your card (call the 800 number to confirm your remaining limit has been reduced) and THEN make a $500 payment. She said you could use this method to get over the credit limit but paying in advance does NOT work.

Can anyone confirm or deny this who has actually tried it? Octavius Jun 23rd, 2006, 01:13 PM Quite true, but I don&apos;t mind doing a bit of extra work for the payoff, just a pain in the @ss, thats all.

Hopefully after 6 months of consistently doing that they&apos;ll up my limit to something decent, but with my luck it&apos;ll only be like another 1000.00

Still better then 1600 though&gt;&lt;

I charged&amp;paid&amp;then charged some more and it worked, plus I got the rebate for the full amount that I purchased, which was greater than my credit limit.

They seem to operate just like any other credit card, so typically if you prepay you can use the money right away, but the max individual purchase is your credit limit. So if you have a limit of 1000 and pre-pay 1000, you have 2000 available credit but can&apos;t do any single transactions over 1000. I have NOT tried this though... recordman Jun 23rd, 2006, 01:35 PM The CT cards are&quot;special&quot;in that the limit will not get reset until the purchases have been posted. e.g., I can have a credit of $5k, a hard limit of $4k, but my active limit is $400. When the purchases have been posted, the active limit goes back to the hard limit. I&apos;ve confirmed this by making a payment before the bill comes.

So what you&apos;re saying is you can do the following (in the same billing period):

1) Put a ton of extra money on your card to create a credit balance
2) Go out and make a purchase of exactly your credit limit
3) Wait until that purchase is posted
4) The purchase is automatically paid for by your credit balance
5) Because of 4, your credit limit immediately gets reset to the full amount
6) Now you can go make more purchases above and beyond what your credit limit is in the same month

I was very specific when speaking with her and she outright told me the above 6 steps are not possible. She said I would have to wait until the purchase was posted and THEN pay off the purchase ASAP. Either way, it isn&apos;t a huge issue ... I&apos;d just rather be able to dump some money onto my card when I feel like it instead of making sure the purchase has been posted first before putting the money on it. Xiggy Jun 23rd, 2006, 04:52 PM So what you&apos;re saying is you can do the following (in the same billing period):

1) Put a ton of extra money on your card to create a credit balance
2) Go out and make a purchase of exactly your credit limit
3) Wait until that purchase is posted
4) The purchase is automatically paid for by your credit balance
5) Because of 4, your credit limit immediately gets reset to the full amount
6) Now you can go make more purchases above and beyond what your credit limit is in the same month

These 6 steps will work. I&apos;ve tried it and can confirm that it works using the 3% card... I would expect it to work with the 5% card as well. The key is in step 3... your purchase must be POSTED before your prepayment is applied to reset your credit limit. This can take upto a week especially when buying GCs from MWI. sjweyman Jun 23rd, 2006, 07:28 PM Your CSR was wrong. These 6 steps will work.

Edit: For clarification - mine is a platinum dasteve Jun 25th, 2006, 10:00 PM They gave me one year :confused: Anyone else getting more than one?

If this isn&apos;t possible, then no one is able to have a positive balance, and they would have to REJECT pymt that&apos;s will result in positive balance.

It&apos;s like a credit card that refuses to accept the money you give them.

They could possibly charge you a credit balance fee, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything in the legal terms on this card. mpt Jun 26th, 2006, 11:35 AM Just got my 3% card in the mail with a $4800 limit. It came within 2 weeks after I applied. lint Jun 27th, 2006, 04:32 PM They gave me one year :confused: Anyone else getting more than one?

Edit: For clarification - mine is a platinum

I got one year as well, platinum. hsedin Jun 27th, 2006, 05:43 PM Platinum.. 1 year also. 5000 limit.. so.. are most ppl getting 1 or 2 year cards? sjweyman Jun 27th, 2006, 09:49 PM Platinum.. 1 year also. 5000 limit.. so.. are most ppl getting 1 or 2 year cards?

Mine was 1 year. Regular 3% card. Hellfire Jun 27th, 2006, 11:46 PM Well that lousy $3200 limit lasted me all of 48 hours. My card is maxed out :( story Jun 28th, 2006, 12:22 AM They could possibly charge you a credit balance fee, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything in the legal terms on this card.

Also it doesn&apos;t have an overlimit fee.

I never heard of credit balance fee, which card has that? embguy Jun 28th, 2006, 12:41 AM However, she did say it was possible to go make your $500 purchase, wait until it is applied to your card (call the 800 number to confirm your remaining limit has been reduced) and THEN make a $500 payment. She said you could use this method to get over the credit limit but paying in advance does NOT work.
May be CT purposely gives us the low credit limit so that we will be paying the them back early without waiting until the end of the grace period... CT makes us work for our 3% or 5% cash back. trolldealhunter Jun 28th, 2006, 01:58 AM so guys, my dads wants to go to 5%, shall we cancel now then apply? or what? im in Calgary, am i even getting the cash reward???? Drew_W Jun 28th, 2006, 02:04 AM You may not get approved for Platinum - it takes some whack set of characteristics to get the Platinum. DEFINITELY don&apos;t cancel before.
