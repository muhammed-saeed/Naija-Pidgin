 Subway tests gluten-free sandwiches 
 
Subway is testing a bun made of egg whites, corn starch and tapioca starches for customers with gluten sensitivities at 700 outlets in Dallas and East Texas.  The sandwich chain is also offering a gluten-free brownie for dessert.  The brownie is made of potato starch, cocoa and sugar.

“Gluten-free is something on the radar,”  said Les Winograd, Subway spokesman.  “There are number of people at Subway who are particularly interested in gluten-free items for their own particular digestive needs. It’s not something that’s unusual to us.”

With Subway exploring a wheat-free alternative, is this a sign that major food chains are paying more attention to gluten sensitivities such as celiac disease? 

Scott Adams, founder of celiac.com hopes so.

“Increasingly, restaurants are paying more attention to people with celiac,” he said, also listing Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill and P.F. Chang’s.

People with celiac disease , a digestive condition that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food, often have trouble finding food without gluten when eating at restaurants.  To varying degrees, they cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley.

Eating out with celiac disease “used to be hard,” Adams said.  He’d go to a food court and basically stick to white rice and stir fry (without soy sauce – because it contains gluten).

Celiac disease is a common genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 133 people.

“It can be a pain. That’s why these restaurants that offer gluten-free options are great,” Adams said.  “From my perspective, it’s getting easier and easier to eat out, for sure.”

Fast food chains such as Taco Bell , Arby’s and Wendy’s offer lists of allergens.

In January, Subway started testing a gluten-free, deli-style bun that arrives to stores pre-packaged.  The sandwich makers are instructed to use a one-time use knife to prevent cross-contamination with gluten products. The buns are baked at a separate facility.

“Being able to have the option to go into quick service restaurants such as ours gives more people options.  It gives them that feeling that they’re not so limited,” Winograd said.  There are no plans to expand the gluten-free experiment nationwide at this time, he said.

Subway is also testing a diabetes-friendly menu test in the Midwest, opening a few locations in the U.S. that serve kosher menus and serving halal foods in Europe.

I ate at Subway tonight while traveling. While it is safer to eat at home if you are Celiac or have a Gluton allergy (I have both), there are times when something in the scheduling of a large family, that makes it necessary to buy prepared food. How nice that a company would at least explore the option to make a sandwich gluton free. I hope they are able to successfully work out the details to make it work.

I just had my first Subway sandwich in over 10 years! I cannot believe how good it was. My mom, who does not have to eat gluten free, even loved it. I kept asking my daughter, who brought the sandwich to me as a surprise, if she was sure it is gluten free! I hope this catches on and goes Nationwide.

I am aware that Subway stores are privately owned, at least in New Zealand antway, so I am guessing that the gluten free options won&apos;t necessarily be a worldwide thing. You never know though. Surely as part of the franchise there must be some sharing of ideas and what works and what doesn&apos;t. Sounds a great step for we Coeliacs.

However, my concern is more toward the preparation of these new g free fast food items. Is there special utensils, changing of gloves, designated prep areas, for these g free products. Let&apos;s face it...we have all seen how Subway prepares their sandwiches...they drag the bread down the line moving their gloved hand from the sandwich to the meats and produce. They would have to have a completely different prep counter with all the same ingedients at it to prevent cross contamination. And if they are indeed&quot;baked fresh&quot;like the other products, are they on different sanitized baking sheets for their ovens.

I don&apos;t entirely trust these establishments that claim to be gluten free, using salad dressing that isn&apos;t g free, I now know that a lot of generic frozen veggies list wheat on their allergin list. Are restaurant&apos;s watching for this as well.

Also; have they checked their deli meat to ensure that is g free, the seasoning on the&quot;fresh&quot;(microwaved) meats, the condiments, the sauces...etc etc. Having a gluten free vehicle to get the other foods to your mouth is key only if the contents are g free as well. Otherwise I might as well eat breaded chicken on a g free bun. :-/

Kay, the Subway I visited today did exactly what you are concerned about. They did NOT use a special knife to cut the bread, did NOT change gloves, used the same toaster stuff and dragged the sandwich down the same board they do all other sandwiches. I&apos;m going to go over to Subways website and report this. Thankfully my daughter is not that sensitive to gluten even though she has Celiac Disease

I have eaten 3 sandwiches at subway and they have trained and stil are training .
and its only one person thats handling the gluten free bread,changed the gloves and takes care of you and you only.
The only concern is that they take the cheeses and condiments from same place but they go down further in the piles as to not hopefully come into contact with&quot;crumbs&quot;I have not gotten ill yet.They have taken great care of me and when you crave a subway its more then filling along with baked lays and a brownie so hooray for the gluten free at subway at least they are trying as unlike fast food at McDonalds with the nasty foods and big macs!
 February 2, 2011 at 14:42 | Report abuse | Jay 

Kay, my experience was positive. They wiped the board, fixed the sandwich on a fresh sheet of paper. The knife came out of plastic and was discarded after one use.
Yes, there was a photocopied&apos;gluten free&apos;menu. So they have identified what deli meats are/are not gluten free.
I do agree that for those with severe sensitivities, cross contamination in the veggies and cheese might still occur.
The bun was really good!

I just tried the gluten free bread at Subway. It had a nice texture and was really tasty.

Kay, in answer to your question, yes there is a special process, including changing gloves a couple of times, using a different knife to cut the bread, etc., to prepare the sandwich. BUT I do not have celiac disease so I was not as concerned about cross contamination as someone with the disease would be.

Celiac Disease is not fun and its more widespread then ever so to those of you who can eat anything anytime anywhere,Im happy that Subways trying this as Its like being diabetic and not ever having sugar again! These&quot;people&quot;that dont understand Celiac,maybe should google the disease and all the problems that goe with it! Bravo to subway! But keep it going and try in other states,i have a sister and brother and 2 neices with this awful illness! Thanks to the restaurants for going gluten free!

My daughter tried one of these sandwiches today and LOVED it. However the store I visited in Richardson off Arapaho, did NOT use a one time use knife, laid her sandwich on the same surface he lalid other sadwiches AND used the same toaster and toaster rack he used with other sandwiches. THANKFULLY he made her sandwich BEFORE my 6 inch on Wheat. Those that are more sensitive to Gluten need to MAKE SURE they follow policy.
 January 29, 2011 at 13:41 | Report abuse | Reply Nate 

My girlfriend is a Celiac and we have been discussing this new trend and we think it is a terrible idea. For some it may be great those who are slightly tolerant and can handle some cross contamination but she cannot handle even the tiniest crumb or bread. Subway is a fast food restaurant where they make sandwiches. The clerks may not realize how bad some people may be and cross contamination is likely to happen or even if something is not cleaned properly. They have one time use knives but what about the toaster oven? The tray they use to put it in the oven? The vegetables, they dont change gloves between touching the bread and the veggies some meats would be fine but there would be a limited selection and may have the same problem as the veggies. It would be nearly impossible to make a 100% gluten free sandwich in a fast-food restaurant who specializes in subs. For this reason we don&apos;t eat out anywhere ever. We cannot trust anyone to be as careful as needed to be able to make a meal that is completely 100% gluten free.

THIS WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE!
Subway is one of my favorite restaurants, until I found out I was allergic to gluten back in 2000. I am not too sensitive that if you placed a piece of bread on the same cutting board as a regular piece I would get sick–i just need gluten free bread..
PLEASE SUBWAY!–bring this to VA and NC!!!!!!

Ok, peeps, gf Subways: the trick is to get it toasted. Otherwise, tastes like hard, dry, nasty gf bread. Even if heated in microwave, get it TOASTED. Tastes like a real subway, that way. The lady in DeSoto did everything right to avoid cc: finished the sandwich she was working on, washed hands, changed gloves, pulled out a clean paper to work on, used and then discarded a new single-use disposable knife... Bravo!!

PLEASE! PLEASE! Get the word out that Subway is doing a trial test of a GF option! WHO KNEW? I accidentally came across this information. As I live in Fl., we are unaware of the testing markets. Please continue with your marketing campaign and expand your testing. However, one concern is also the deli meat used- is that also GF? We appreciate that this option is being considered- thanks for the effort required. We automaticaaly pass any Subway as I would never have imagined that as a option. Eating out is difficult if you are with family that needs a quick lunch to continue the day&apos;s activities and celiacs choices to eat out do not accomodate that need. Continue your efforts-on behalf ao all celiacs- Anita

OMG I hope they get this in Seattle! I was diagnosed with a gluten allergy over two years ago. I had no idea that eating wheat was the cause of 99% of my health issues. If I eat *anything* with even the slightest trace of gluten in it, I will start coughing, choking, and gagging within about 5-10 minutes and it doesn&apos;t stop for almost a half hour (and often it will make me sick to my stomach!!!). Eating out is always scary and taking a gamble–this would be SUCH a relief, as we all know how bad it SUCKS to try and go out anywhere for the day, not knowing if you can find a safe place to eat or not–my purse is always full of GF snacks&apos;just in case&apos;I can&apos;t find anything to eat anywhere, I&apos;m always bringing my own food to parties and dinners.....this would make the world just that much easier to live in. =D

Hey I love subway when I want something healthy and quick, you cant beat it especially with there five dollar foot long. If your in manhattan on 7th ave and 24th st Do Not Go to that one. The guys that work in there just robbed me for $2.50. It&apos;s not the money but the principal. When I asked for the receipt I noticed that they over charged me and instead of just doing the wright thing they started telling some B.S. why they charged me r$9.25 for just a sandwich when I know it should have been $7.35 because I always get the same thing. It would also be nice if they spoke english and had all the condiments that I like.

Very disappointed with subway I will never go back to the location again and my boy was very disappointed also.

Atlanta is in dire need of gluten free options. Subway used to be my standby before I was diagnosed with Celiac. It&apos;s comforting to think there is a place you can go to outside your own home that you can get something other than a salad that doesn&apos;t fill you up. With the increasing awareness of the disease more children are being diagnosed and they need a fast food alternative too. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll work out all the kinks!

I was skeptical at first, but I know others with more sensitivities than mine that love the Subway rolls and brownies. I tried one today, and it was like I was eating real bread. It wasn&apos;t hard, dry, or anything. It had the consistency of a dense croissant to me.

I know that others have a more serious variation than another, but we take those thoughts into account when we make decisions every day. If the companies want to try to help accommodate, then bravo for them. It makes life just a tad bit easier for the majority, especially if they follow through with their training.
