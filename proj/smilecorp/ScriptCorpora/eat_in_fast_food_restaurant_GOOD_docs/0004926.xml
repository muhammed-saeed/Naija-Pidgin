 Advantages Nice enough food, lots to keep kids entertained, quick and easy

 Disadvantages Not the most luxurious of food, can be pricey, unhealthy
 
I’ve been to London now a couple of times this year and one of the restaurants we’ve dined in, is Wendy’s. I’ve heard about Wendy’s in all the films, but had never tried it myself, so I was really excited!
We turned up at Wendy’s on Oxford street at around 12.30 ready for a spot of lunch. I was a bit worried about this place as I had read some not so good reviews on it however as we were incredibly busy we had to fit something quick in. when we arrived at around 12.25, the first thing that jumped out at us was how busy the place was. The tables were heaving with people however luckily, and what swayed it for us, was that there was just a tiny little queue. From the outside, Wendy’s looked quite attractive. It looked just like your typical burger joint or fast restaurant however it did look a bit “Posher” and more like a restaurant. The doors into the restaurant were slide doors which suggested to me that this was a very casual place and not one to get dressed up for.
Enterting the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised. I’d half been expecting a McDonald’s theme. It was similar but again it looked slightly better and definitely more impressive. Service is the same as McDonalds and KFC and so on, in that you order your food at the counter, wait on it being served up and then go and take your seat. The queue like I said was not very long and so we joined quite happily. While waiting in the queue I was quite disturbed by the noise. It was incredibly noisy inside but this is due to the fact it was packed full. There seemed to be a lot of kids in the restaurant too. Teenagers slurping on Milkshakes, seven year olds tucking into their children meals, and toddlers sitting in the highchairs, tongue hanging out their mouths, trying to take n their surroundings. I have to say that most of the kids were well behaved and not being excessively loud, and I think this is down to the fact that they were provided with colouring in sheets and coloured crayons.
After a short period of time we reached the counter. We were served by a very pretty young girl, who didn’t look very happy to be working on a sweltering hot day, but she wasn’t rude either. She asked us how we were before taking our order and smiled when we told her we were just fine. She rang up our bill on the till and we handed over the money. We didn’t have to wait very long, maybe two or three minutes at most, before our food was placed onto the tray in front of us and we were ready to find a table.
Luckily there was a family just leaving and so we plonked ourselves down. Not long had we sat down before a member of staff, about 20 years old came over and removed their rubbish and gave the table a quick dict. Thankfully this little wipe got rid of all the old broken pieces of chip and sticky finger marks.
The tables were a good size with enough room for two people, at the two seater table. There wasn’t enough room for our tray though so we had to put it onto the floor. This annoyed me a bit as it meant I had to spread napkins out all over the table as I hate eating off public surfaces such as tables.
 
Luckily napkins were free as I think I used about 12 of them just to cover my table never mind the 8 or more that I used to wipe my hands!
The food was quite tasty. I had ordered a quarter pound single with cheese and for my side order, I ordered a portion of fries. I also had a diet coke. My mum had ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and as a side order she had side salad. My mum had said the side salad was surprisingly nice. It looked delicious too and was quite bright in colours with pieces of lettuce, pepper, carrot and cucumber. Her chicken burger looked delicious too. The thick piece of battered chicken was pushed in between a delicious warm bun and it was topped with mayonnaise and salad. Apparently the chicken lived up to its spicy name and she downed her diet sprite alongside the burger. The bun was apparently quite nice but could have been a little less doughy. The mayo was apparently great as was the salad on her roll. Overall my mum was really quite pleased with her meal!
Mine was fantastic too. The beef burger I received was a lot bigger than I’d excepted. The beef was lovely and tasted quite similar to McDonald’s however it was definitely lightly thicker. The cheese melted in lovely and provided a really cheesy taste, from only a small amount of it! The bun was gorgeous and had maintained its warm temperature which for me was superb. The chips were great. I received a medium portion and there was plenty of them. They were more like Burger King chips than McDonalds id say. They were really fluffy on the inside and thankfully they were really quite hot! My diet coke was just your typical diet coke!
Overall our meal was really quite nice. It was nothing special and its not something I would chose to do again however if I ever pop in I do know that I can rely on good quality food.
Our two meals cost a little under £10 which is quite expensive but pretty typical of a fast food restaurant!
**
The menu.
The menu in Wendy’s Is absolutely massive and there is so much to choose from. The menu is split into sections to make it easier to choose what you want. There are your typical burgers and nuggets as well as some more unusual products too. Nutritional information is given about all of the products which I think is really handy, especially for me! At the time of eating my Wendy’s I was on a weight gain diet so I wasn’t too fussed about how many calories there were, however now I think if I was to go back, I’d be a lot more cautious.
Wendy’s old fashioned combo’s!
The combo section of the menu is where you can mix and match and get great offers and deals. This is what I went for. In the combo section you choose a drink, a burger or main part of the meal, and a side order. Included in the main part of the meal are things such as burgers like quarter pounders, half pounders, cheeserbugers of different sizes, chicken nuggets, chicken burgers and so on. In the side order section, you can order things such as chips, salads, and baked potatoes. And in the drinks section there are various thirst quenches to chose from including soft drinks and water bottles. 
Old fashioned hamburgers.
The hamburger section of the menu brings various different burgers. There really are plenty to chose from. Just some the classic delights include cheeseburger deluxes, single burgers, triple stacks, bacon burgers and various others. Each of these comes on a beautiful toasted bun and are usually filled with some type of salad. You can obviously request for the salad to be left out if you don’t like it.
Chicken and fish
This part of the menu is great for people who don’t like beef but want something on a bun! Amongst the products for sale are chicken wraps, chicken sandwiches, spicy chicken versions, club sandwiches, chicken nuggets, BBQ wings, sweet and spicy Asian wings, and buffalo wings. There is definitely plenty to chose from. If you want something fishy you could opt for the fish fillet which comes on a bun!
Garden Sensation Salads
There are various salads on the menu too. These include a plain salad, a ceasear salad, chicken blt salad, taco salad and various others. These can bought on their own or as part as a combo meal. from what I have seen, they are a decent size but I don’t think they would do for a main meal personally.
Super value menu
Much like the McDonalds pound saver menu, these are products which are meant to grab on the go or for a cheaper price. On the menu are chicken wraps, burgers, chicken burgers fries and drinks.
Hot Stuffed baked potatos
If you want something potato like but don’t want to indulge in fries , you can opt for a baked potato with one the fillings. Amongst the various fillings available are sour cream and chive, brocoli and cheese, and bacon and cheese. A woman at the table next to us had the brocoli and cheese one and it was absolutely massive! Definitely a substantial meal and more than a side order.
Side dishes
These can be bought separately or as part of a combo. On the menu are things such as fries, 5 chicken nuggets, chilli, and the baked potatoes. You can also get a tub of oranges if you like too!
Frosty
A frosty is an ice cold drink. Among the range are the originals including chocolate and vanilla, the shakes including frosty-cino, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and strawberry. If you want a frosty float then these are available too! The most tempting of all though I feel, are the twisted frosty’s. these come in delicious flavours such as MnM, Oreo, Coffee Toffee, and cookie dough! Delicious.
Beverages
There are plenty of drinks available too to wash down your meal. chose from delicious soft drinks such as pepsi, coke, sprite, and fanta as well as milkshakes in various flavours, punch and hot drinks too!
Kids Meal
As with all fast food places there is a kids menu. With the kids menu again you chose a main part of the meal, a side dish and a drink. The side dishes include oranges, or chips where as the main part you can pick from chicken nuggets, cheeseburger, burger, or chicken burger. The drinks are the same such as pepsi and fanta!
**
There is now nutrition available for every single product on the menu and this can be found at http://www.

**
The toilets in Wendy’s were quite clean and there were 8 cubicles. There was plenty of toilet paper and soap at the sinks but the water was pretty boiling hot!
There were high chairs available for little kids as well as drawing packs to keep them entertained. The particular one I went into wasn’t overly suitable for wheelchairs though, or so it seemed.
Overall I’d recommend this place for a quick bite to eat. Its just like an McDonalds or KFC in the area, but I feel it has something extra special about it.
