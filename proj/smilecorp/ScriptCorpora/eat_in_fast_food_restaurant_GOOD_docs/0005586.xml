 Children eschew the fat if dads aren&apos;t lenient (father gnaws best)

 Kids&apos;tell-all food diaries point finger at fathers&apos;nutritional ignorance 
COLLEGE STATIONThis Father&apos;s Day, dad&apos;s choice of where to eat could literally tip the scales on his children&apos;s health.
A father&apos;s use of restaurants and his perceptions of family meals carry more weight, so to speak, than mothers&apos;, according to a Texas AgriLife Research study, published recently in The Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior.
&quot;Dads who think that dinner time is a special family time certainly do not see a fast-food restaurant as an appropriate place for that special family time, so this means that his kids are spending less time in those places. Dads who have no trouble eating food in a fast-food restaurant are going to be more likely to have kids who do so,&quot;said Dr. Alex McIntosh, AgriLife Research sociologist.
 Childhood obesity study points to father&apos;s role 
New research indicates that father&apos;s are more likely than mother&apos;s to have an impact on childhood obesity. A study by Texas AgriLife Research showed that lenient fathers allow their children more trips to fast-food restaurants which have been linked to obesity in children.

The study began as a 15-month look at parents&apos;use of time and how that impacted meal choices. It aimed at the difference between fast-food and full-service restaurants because numerous studies have shown a correlation between fast-food consumption and weight gain.
Of particular interest for the research, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was parental choice of restaurants as a connection to childhood obesity, McIntosh said.
Almost as an afterthought, the researchers decided to ask children in these families also to record what they ate and whether it was at home or out. If a meal was eaten out, the name of the restaurant was not required.
&quot;It never occurred to me that we would have data on them eating out and where they were eating out. But the kidsif they said they ate out, they always wrote down where they ate by the name of the restaurant,&quot;McIntosh said.&quot;So it was just a matter of tracking down information about the restaurant to find out if they were full-service or more like a fast-food place.&quot;
That&apos;s where the real meat of the study was revealed, according to McIntosh.
&quot;We had been analyzing the data for a long time when it occurred to us that because the kids had done such a great job in their time diaries that we would actually be able to distinguish between a meal at a fast-food restaurant versus a meal at a full-service restaurant,&quot;McIntosh noted.&quot;And somewhat to our surprise, it was father&apos;s time spent at fast-food restaurantsnot mother&apos;s time spent therethat was associated with kids&apos;time spent in a fast-food place.&quot;
&quot;For a long time fathers have been told that they need to spend more time with their children. But often when this message is being transmitted, the message is&apos;you should be having fun with your children,&apos;&quot;the research said.
McIntosh said the message to fathers should be that they have some responsibility just like mothers to raise healthy, well-adjusted children. Also, fathers need to know more about nutritional content of fast food.
The only instances of mothers being more lax on the use of fast-food restaurants are those who are neglectful and those who are highly committed to their work, McIntosh said.
&quot;So mothers are not unimportant when it comes to eating out choices,&quot;he said,&quot;but in terms of statistical findings, the father findings are stronger.
&quot;Traditionally academics have blamed mothers for everything that goes wrong with children, especially when it comes to food,&quot;he added.&quot;But I think it&apos;s pretty clear that fathers have a substantial influence over what children are eating. And if that&apos;s the case, then they need to be the target of education just like mothers.&quot;
Such education might help a father change some of his own selections when at a fast-food restaurant with his family or at least have an effect on what restaurants they choose to go to, he noted.
&quot;When I mention these findings in class, my students say they can fully understand, because when they&apos;re with dad, he gives them choices,&quot;said McIntosh, who also is a professor in the recreation, parks and tourism sciences department at Texas A&amp;M University.&quot;They are the ones who get to choose where to eat or, if they are in a grocery store, what to buy as a snack.
&quot;So basically all you really need is a dad who says,&apos;no, I think we ought to eat someplace else and this is why,&apos;&quot;he said.&quot;It&apos;s about a father taking more of a responsible role when he&apos;s parenting.&quot;

I think this is a load (pun intended). I have a lot of friends and relatives with small kids who, unfortunately, engage in permissive parenting. The little cherubs are constantly squalling for something other than what is on the dinner table—like hot dogs or mac&amp;cheese—and 999 times out of 1,000, its the mom who races off to make a special meal. And the special meal ain’t nutritious.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: Opinionated Blowhard My son will be 3 the end of September. He has never had a hotdog, although I did buy a pack of Hebrew Nationals for grilling at the pool this weekend. He has also never had boxed mac n’cheese. He has had my homemade macaroni and cheese made with whole wheat pasta and real (not pasteurized product) cheese sauce from a bechemel base. My husband would flip if I fed him dogs and boxed dinners every meal. Our son asks for blueberries and avacadoes by name when he wants a snack, and that is because we never gave in with healthy eating. I have my husband to thank for that, because he completely supported my through a year of pumping and all the homemade baby food I stocked our freezer with.

“I think this is a load...”

Yes, I’m calling shenanigans on this one. The majority of women that I know shop for groceries and do the majority of the cooking. Most Dads that I know eat what is put in front of them. Maybe I know different type of women?

My kids eat junk food now, but I forgive them because they are both have been on the cross country team in high school, and do distance cycling with me (Did the MN Ironman with them May 1 -- 31 degrees, snow, and 30 miles into a 20mph headwind. I call them&quot;The Velocity Twins.&quot;
And I&apos;ve seen each of them run off to eat a whole grapefruit as a snack in front of the TV.
Cheers!

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies ] To: grey_whiskers Haha! When we do watch TV, which is when the weather sucks, my son runs in place. He is such an active guy and he totally takes after his father there. I don&apos;t mind the junk food later on, especially if he is going to continue to be active. I can&apos;t control every aspect, but while he&apos;s young I can give him a good start. Thank God my husband and I don&apos;t beat each other and do drugs, because our son runs around our weight room“using”the equipment. He knows exactly what to do with everything simply because he&apos;s exposed to it daily. That&apos;s the same reason I plant a garden and let him“help”me. I want him to have good, nutritious food, but I also want him to know where his food really comes from. It doesn&apos;t come from a window or even a store shelf. I think we might be in for some hard times, and dear God I hope I&apos;m wrong, but I want my kids to know how to feed themselves.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies ] To: momtothree I spent the last 8 months herding Grand Kids two days a week and cooking Utah Mountain food three dinners a week, at 5:30 PM. It is amazing what real food will do for a kid.

Anyone remember Todd Marinovich? Our kids eat what’s on the table and if it happens that there’s some boxed mac and cheese with hot dogs on it, so be it. It’s not an everyday thing. Both our kids like cod liver oil. Our almost 5 yr. old son likes pickled herring and sardines in hot sauce. Friday lunch is McDonald’s or Hardee’s. They eat fruit,they eat some candy. We just don’t go overboard with the“junky”stuff.

“It is amazing what real food will do for a kid”

What has surprised me in this day and age is that many people rely on processed foods only. When some of my kid’s pals join us for dinner, for example, some have never had mashed potatoes (that didn’t come from a box), or even plain steamed white rice (with butter). Most of what they eat comes from the freezer into the microwave, or a box that you mix with another ingredient. Just last week, for instance, my daughter had a playmate over for dinner and was amazed that I made meatballs. She had always had meatballs that were pre-formed (in a bag) that you heated in a microwave.

I asked my Granddaughter how much she weighted, she is kind of scrawny. She said,“I was forty pounds before you started cooking, now I am fifty.”My Granny would have been proud.

What you may not even realize is they will always remember your cooking. Whatever your specialties are, they will talk about the rest of their lives! You are a great Grandpop!!

 14 posted on 06/11/2011 11:33:24 AM PDT by momtothree [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies ] To: momtothree The only problem is that they will remember it but not do it. Cooking from scratch doesn&apos;t take much more time than throw it in the oven, just planning. America has wonderful regional dishes that taste good and don&apos;t require a lot of time, once you get the hang of it.
I remember my Grandmother and Aunt reducing three chickens to chicken, noodles, and veggies in and hour and a half after the first head flew off.

You are right. It is sad that many people don’t cook from scratch. It is certainly a lot healthier. To be honest, it doesn’t take a whole lot more time. For example, I am making meat sauce but I double the recipe. Tonight there is spaghetti on the menu and the leftover sauce will be frozen. By Friday, I’ll make a baked rigatoni with cheese. Two meals in one planning.

Good for you. I make my own bread, a pan de mei, French sandwich bread. Bread takes three hoursI use a bread machine to mix and proof the dough, clean house, go to the store, punch down, second rise and bake, finish cleaning house, bread for the week. If I have a roast cook at the same time.

I think they are referring to the DIVORCED dad here. Who does the guilty daddy thing“I don’t spend much time with my children so when they’re with me I want them to have a good time and not be disciplining them”mantra.

And of course divorced mom has her finger on speed dial to Child Protective Services whenever dad doesn’t give Junior/Princess what he/she wants. In today’s family court and gov’t agencies, discipline equals abuse.

I know b/c my hubby was written up for“abuse”by his ex wife for having the children do 20 minutes of light raking and having them eat a non-fast food meal. He eventually gave up and let his ex-wife dictate the terms of HIS non-parental status babysitting duties.

I generally follow the rule“Ingredients shouldn’t have ingredients.”What you end up with is a plate of real food. Meat, vegetables and fruit.

The other thing I think would go a long way in helping people with nutrition - throw away your pots and pans! Cook every meal on a grill. I have a little Weber Q-Grill I’ve hooked up to natural gas. One side is a griddle, the other a grate. The stove on the inside is practically unused.

It is near impossible to eat an unhealthy diet if you follow rule 1 and cook on a grill. Of course, you need to make some reasonable exceptions like a pan to cook oatmeal, coffee pot, a box of butter, etc.

I can fully understand a parent being lenient if they only see their kids on weekends. Who wants a weekend full of“you shouldn’t do this”or“why did you do that?”I feel sorry for your husband. Raking can be family fun.. you are outside, doing something worthwhile and usually having great conversations. (sounds to me like his ex is a few fries short of a happy meal).
