 Annual Obon Festival at the Monterey Peninsula Buddist Temple 
 Posted on July 8, 2012 by Lola Jane 1 
While the Washington D.C. area bakes in 100+ degree weather, the temperature was cool and in the 60′s today at the Monterey Peninsula Buddhist Temple , in Seaside, California—home base for the 66th Annual Obon Festival.

From the Monterey Peninsula Buddhist Temple website:

 The Obon festival is a Buddhist tradition to celebrate, remember and express gratitude to all family members who have died.  The Obon festival has been celebrated in Japan since 657 AD.  The first Obon in the United States was held in Hawaii in 1910; festivals on the mainland began about 20 years later.  2012 marks the 66 th year of the Obon Festival on the Monterey Peninsula. 

 The first Monterey Obon Festival was held on August 25, 1947 at the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) Hall in Monterey, home to the Temple then. In 1963, the event was moved to the Monterey County Fairgrounds where it was held for 30 years.  The Obon Festival returned to the Temple, now in Seaside, in 1993.  3,000 to 5,000 people from across the Monterey Peninsula and beyond attend each year. 

We visited the festival for the first time since moving to this area, and were pleasantly surprised.  It was a well-organized event, featuring plenty of food booths, martial arts demonstrations, tea ceremonies, a book and Asian gift store, and exhibits of bonsai - the practice of long-term cultivation and shaping of small trees growing in a container.

 

The bonsai displays were interesting, and once we realized how old the trees were—from 20 to 50 years old—we really appreciated the devotion it takes to practice this Japanese art form.

It is fascinating to see a redwood tree ( sequoia s) —the tallest living trees on our planet, and normally growing 300-350 feet tall—in miniature format, and growing in a tiny ceramic pot.

There were also presentations of ikebana –the Japanese art of flower arrangement.  As much as I love vases overflowing with flowers, it is enjoyable to see a minimalist style of presenting flowers, where the emphasis is also about the lines, the stems and the twigs.

Some beautiful examples below:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Did I mention the wonderful volunteers happily pouring free cups of hot green tea to festival attendees?  The hot green tea was perfect for the cool weather (warm sake, cold beer and sodas were also available for sale).

My one complaint…the Styrofoam cups, which are difficult to recycle!  If you read this and plan to attend next year, bring your own mugs for the free hot green tea and other beverages.

More photos from the festival, tomorrow…

 Found: U.S. farmed tilapia 
 Posted on May 21, 2012 by Lola Jane Reply 
It turns out you can find U.S. farmed tilapia for sale at stores—just outside of the Monterey Bay area.

So far, Lion Supermarket –located on Tully Road in San Jose. is the only store I have seen that offer whole, fresh, U.S. farmed tilapia.  Lion Supermarket products are geared towards the international and Asian community.  They have 5 store locations (mostly in San Jose).

 

The tilapia is from a company called Desert Springs Tilapia , based in Arizona

 

How can you tell — aside from 100% trust in your grocer and fish dealers—that your tilapia is from U.S. based farms?

These particular tilapia fish had the Desert Springs Tilapia tags.
 
U.S. Farmed Tilapia from Desert Springs (Arizona)
 
And…. just because tilapia fish are marketed as“farm raised”, it does not necessarily mean it is farmed in a safe and sustainable manner.  For more about tilapia fish, including Seafood Watch information and ratings, please see my post Tilapia – Top Aquaculture Fish. 

For local tilapia sources (Monterey Bay), please see post country of origin for tilapia fish sold locally. 

Now that I know more about tilapia, and after reading reports from the Seafood Watch program from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, I am only buying tilapia farmed in the U.S.A (best choice), or from countries listed as “good alternatives” .   How about you?

 Country of origin for tilapia fish sold locally 
 Posted on April 23, 2012 by Lola Jane 2 
This is a follow-up to the post Tilapia–top aquaculture fish .

I was curious about the country of origin of tilapia fish sold locally (Monterey County, California).  Here is a sample:
 
Sign - seafood counter at Phil&apos;s Fish Market, Moss Landing, CA
 
Phil’s Fish Market in Moss Landing had whole tilapia fish available (but no fillets) at the time of my visit.  However, their pricing sign did not indicate country of origin.  When I asked for assistance—near the bar and entrance—they did find out quickly, and told me their whole tilapias were farm-raised, from Canada.

There is room on the sign to write the country of origin, so it seems easy enough for Phil’s to let customers know where their tilapia is sourced.
 
Whole tilapia and other fish for sale at Phil&apos;s Fish Market, Moss Landing
 
If you visit Phil’s website , the home page states “In our continuing commitment to protect the environment&amp;provide the highest quality seafood available, we now partner with Safe Harbor, a comprehensive seafood safety certification program.” 

Safe Harbor Certified Seafood are tested for mercury, radiation, industrial pollutants, use of hormones, and unregulated aquaculture   For more on Safe Harbor, click here .

As far as I can tell, Safe Harbor is strictly a testing program for fish safety—to eat, which is great!.  But individual restaurants or fish markets still need to be mindful of fish sustainability practices (e.g., Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Program) along with being a Safe Harbor partner.
 
Fresh tilapia fillets - Whole Foods
 
The fresh tilapia fillets at Whole Foods (top photo) are from Ecuador and label indicates“fresh farmed, responsibly raised, hormone&amp;antibiotic free”.

Whole Foods fish counters had these Marine Stewardship Certification signs, indicating“third-party certified sustainable fishing”.
 
Whole Foods Market Marine Stewardship
 
They had frozen tilapia fillets available (bottom photo), also from Ecuador, and marked“no antibiotics, no preservatives, no added hormones”.
 
Frozen tilapia fillets - Whole Foods
 
At the Asian Market in Marina, tilapia was available in the freezer section only, and marked“Product of Taiwan, R.O.C.”.
 
Frozen tilapia fillets at the Asian Market - Marina

The chain grocery store, Save Mart, sold farm raised, previously frozen tilapia fillets, marked“Product of China”, as well as frozen whole tilapia, also marked“Product of China”.
 
Save Mart - previously frozen tilapia fillets
 
Whole tilapia fish - Save Mart
 
I did not find any tilapia from U.S. based fish farms—- not surprising, as the Seafood Watch Report from Monterey Bay Aquarium indicated less than 10% of tilapia consumed in the U.S. are from U.S.-based, tilapia fish farms.

As you can see from the photos, there is a big difference in tilapia price between the stores.  Only Whole Foods had tilapia sourced from areas marked as“Good Alternatives”on the Seafood Watch program—i.e., Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras.

Please visit the original post “Tilapia–Top Aquaculture Fish” for more information on the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch Program.

And let me know if you see tilapia from U.S. fish farms (rated“Best Choice”from Seafood Watch) for sale at our local markets, or restaurants.

 Tilapia–top aquaculture fish 
 Posted on April 20, 2012 by Lola Jane 2 
So, writing about the Philippine bangus / milkfish these last few days got me thinking about another popular farmed fish, the tilapia (Oreochromis, Sarotherodon) .

Introduction, from Tilapia Production Report , Globefish.org:

 Tilapia is both a genus of fishes in the Cichlidae family and the common name for nearly a hundred species of freshwater and some brackish water cichlid fishes belonging to the three genera Tilapia, Sarotherodon, and Oreochromis. Most important and abundant in production, capture and aquaculture, is the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus); followed by the Blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus); Mango tilapia (Sarotherodon galilaeus) and Sabaki tilapia (Oreochromis spilurus). These are native to Africa and the Middle East.  Blue and Mango tilapias are captured although in limited quantities while Sabaki tilapia is only cultured. 
 
Nile Tilapia Drawing (1898): WH Flower, Guide to the galleries of reptiles and fishes of the British Museum
 
 Tilapia is often called “St. Peter’s fish” because according to the Book of Mathew (17:27) the fish which St. Peter caught was a tilapia. Also, the miracle of Jesus Christ in which it says a crowd of five thousand people were fully fed with five loafs of bread and two fishes (Mathew 14:15-21) may have also been a tilapia since this is the species most found in Lake Tiberius (Sea of Galilee) in historical Palestine. It is also called as Nile m outh brooder, or Nile perch. 

 In the twenty-first century tilapia is dubbed as “wonder fish”. 
 
Photo Source: www.globefish.org
 
Although tilapia is native to Africa and the Middle East, 98% of all farmed tilapia is grown outside its native habitat, by about 85 countries.

Tilapia was the 4th favorite seafood in the U.S. in 2010, moving up from its previous position as 5th favorite.  And because it is an affordable fish, worldwide demand continues to grow (www.Globefish.org). 

According to a Seafood Watch report by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, tilapia are the most widely grown of any farmed fish. They are highly adaptable, easily cultured and

 provides more protein than it takes to raise it (unlike farmed salmon or tuna) are omnivorous and adapts eating habits to available food (they feed on phytoplankton or benthic algae but readily accept compound feed) can tolerate low oxygen levels and a range of salinities occupy a wide range of habitats (ponds, rivers, lakes, canals, irrigation channels) have high reproductive capacities and readily establish self-reproducing populations 
 
Photo Source: www.globefish.org
 
For many years, it has been available at Filipino supermarkets here in the U.S. and is a popular fish choice for markets that have a“free”fish frying service.

More and more, I see it offered as a fish option at restaurants, and it is usually always available as a fish choice in Filipino eateries.

From a sustainability standpoint, here is the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program’s stance on tilapia:
 
 Your“Best Choice”is tilapia grown in the U.S. in environmentally friendly systems.“Avoid”farmed tilapia from China and Taiwan, where pollution and weak management are widespread problems. 
 
 Seafood
 Rating Market Names Where Caught/How Caught Tilapia Best Choice Izumidai U.S.–Farmed Tilapia Avoid Izumidai China, Taiwan–Farmed Tilapia Good Alternative Izumidai Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras–Farmed 

More tilapia consumer notes from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch: 

 Most tilapia consumed in the U.S. comes from China/Taiwan (frozen) or Central and South America (fresh). Less than 10 percent of tilapia consumed in the U.S. is farmed domestically. 

 A mild, white fish, tilapia is available year-round. It’s available whole, fresh, frozen, or even live in some Asian restaurants. It can also be found as fresh or frozen fillets. Tilapia is known as izumidai when prepared for sushi. 

 Summary 

 Tilapia is an important source of protein, especially in developing countries. Tilapia is a good candidate for farming, as it provides more protein than it takes to raise it. This is in contrast to some other fish raised in farms, such as salmon or tuna. 

 Tilapia is a hardy, freshwater fish that tolerates a wide range of water conditions. This means it’s easy to farm, but it also means it easily invades many habitats and threatens native fish populations. 

 In the U.S., most tilapia is farmed in closed inland systems that guard against escapes and pollution. However, in many other countries, tilapia is often farmed in open systems where escapes and pollution are bigger threats. However, tilapia farming methods vary widely within any given country. 

 U.S. farmed tilapia is the“Best Choice,”with tilapia from Central and South America as a“Good Alternative”to other imported product.

The bottom line for U.S. consumers of tilapia:  Look at country of origin packaging labels, and and ask your fish dealer, or your restaurant, the country source of the tilapia that they sell and/or serve.

This way, you can at least know if you are consuming“Best Choice”—that is, U.S. farm raised tilapia—or“Good Alternative”, sustainably grown tilapias (again, from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Honduras).

Although tilapia is one of the better farmed fish to eat—because of its mild flavor, affordability, and from a sustainable fish standpoint—it is still a fairly new fish in the world of modern aquaculture.

Under the right conditions, they can become an invasive species when deliberately or accidentally introduced in tropical climates.

In Florida, the blue tilapia ( oreochromis aureus) is the most widespread of foreign fish species and a problem when tilapia populations compete with native fish.

Tilapia is now the second most popular farmed fish in the Philippines (after the bangus ).

A report from www.Globefish.org indicated that Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was introduced to the Philippines in the mid-1960′s.  Excerpt from Globefish report on the Nile tilapia:

 The culture of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) can be traced back to ancient Egyptian times as depicted on bas-relief from an Egyptian tomb dating over 4000 years ago, which showed the fish held in ornamental ponds. 

 While significant worldwide distribution of tilapias, primarily Oreochromis mossambicus, occurred during the 1940s and 1950s, distribution of the more desirable Nile tilapia occurred during the 1960s up to the 1980s. 

 Nile tilapia from Japan was introduced to Thailand in 1965, and from Thailand they were sent to the Philippines. Nile tilapia from Cote d’Ivoire was introduced to Brazil in 1971, and from Brazil they were sent to the United States in 1974. In 1978, Nile tilapia was introduced to China, which leads the world in tilapia production and consistently 
 produced more than half of the global production in every year from 1992 to 2008. 

I recommend reading the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch and Globefish.org reports below, if you need more information to decide if tilapia is a fish you want to include in your diet.

 Burgers…and Bangus? 
 Posted on April 16, 2012 by Lola Jane 2 
Where else, but the Philippine fast food restaurant Jollibee, can one order hamburgers AND fried bangus (pronounced something close to“bung-oose”), served with rice?

 Jollibee Food Corporation (JFC) started in Manila, soon after McDonalds made plans to enter the Philippine market.

They are one of Asia’s most successful and fastest growing companies, and the Philippines’largest chain restaurant.  They continue to expand beyond the Philippines, with most U.S. locations in California.

Not yet familiar with bangus (also known as milkfish)?  It is a commonly eaten fish in the Philippines, and an unofficial national symbol .  And because of its popularity in aquaculture or fish farms, it is available just about everywhere in the Philippines, and easy to find here in the U.S.

Here is a description and biology from Wikipedia:

 Milkfish (Chanos chanos) have a generally symmetrical and streamlined appearance, with a sizable forked caudal fin. They can grow to 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) but are most often about 1 metre (39 in) in length. They have no teeth and generally feed on algae and invertebrates. 

 They occur in the Indian Ocean and across the Pacific Ocean, tending to school around coasts and islands with reefs. The young fry live at sea for two to three weeks and then migrate to mangrove swamps, estuaries, and sometimes lakes and return to sea to mature sexually and reproduce. 
 
Bangus (Milkfish) - Chanos chanos by Sir Francis Day
 
And on the history of the bangus / milkfish :

 Milkfish aquaculture first occurred around 800 years ago in the Philippines and spread in Indonesia, Taiwan and into the Pacific. 

 Traditional milkfish aquaculture relied upon restocking ponds by collecting wild fry. This led to a wide range of variability in quality and quantity between seasons and regions. In the late seventies, farmers first successfully spawned breeding fish. However, they were hard to obtain and produced unreliable egg viability. In 1980 the first spontaneously spawning happened in sea cages. These eggs were found to be sufficient to generate a constant supply for farms. 

Bangus is available fresh or frozen at most Asian markets, and at chain supermarkets that serve the Filipino-American (Fil-Am) community (e.g., Seafood City, Island Supermarket).
 
Bangus milkfish for sale at Seafood City Markets - photo by Lolako.com
 
It is cooked in soups (sinigang), stewed in vinegar, ginger and spices (paksiw), fried, grilled or barbequed, stuffed (relleno style), and also“dinaing”, marinated in vinegar and spices, and fried, as in the style served at Jollibee.

Targeting the American market with their chicken and burgers, and offering a menu with familiar, native style foods like fried bangus seems like a solid marketing strategy, since U.S. Jollibee locations are in areas with established Fil-Am communities.

 

Bangus is a bony fish, so perhaps marinating or“dinaning”style of preparation is among the best method, as the acid in the vinegar makes the bangus bones soft, then crispy once it is fried.

 Bangus is also available at Jollibee for breakfast, served with traditional Filipino garlic fried rice (sinangag) —and an egg of course.  For the breakfast menu, they do call it milkfish, and highlight the belly  or middle part—a favorite for many, including me!

Bangus is a tasty fish, and it must now be abundant enough—and hopefully grown in a sustainable way—to meet the supply demands of a large restaurant chain like Jollibees.

I checked the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch list, and did not see anything on chanos chanos, milkfish or bangus.  They did have a Fish Farming Methods Fact Card that indicate recirculating type systems (enclosed fish tanks) as the best method, though costly to run due to reliance on electricity or other power sources.  If you happen upon this blog and know about the bangus industry, I would appreciate getting a comment on modern bangus aquaculture methods.

I often wondered why bangus often shows up as a Philippine national symbol.  So…now I know it is because Filipinos from 800 years ago were the first to capture bangus in the wild, and grow bangus in fish farms.

Lastly for this post…I found out there is a bangus festival in Dagupan City….happening now, until May.  Dagupan City—located in the province of Pangasinan—is known for having an abundance of fresh bangus.  A festival centered around the tasty bangus…sounds like fun!

 San Miguel–beer and more! 
 Posted on April 13, 2012 by Lola Jane Reply 
The choices for beer brands, specially from smaller, independent craft breweries in California is dizzying.  According to the California Craft Brewers Association , there are over 270 independently owned, craft breweries in our state alone!

Nationally, I’ve heard that there are now over 2,000 breweries in the U.S., producing 13,000 different labels of beer.
 
Source: www.sanmiguelbrewery.com
 
Beer brand choice was quite simple when I was growing up in the Philippines.

Beer was just beer, no need to say a brand name, simply because there was typically just one beer available for sale in the Philippines.  And that brand was San Miguel Beer .

San Miguel Beer was founded in 1890 as La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, a single-product brewery in the Philippines.

It is an iconic Philippine brand, and continues as the #1 beer brand in the Philippines, capturing over 95% of the beer market.

San Miguel has grown, and the brewery—the foundation of its business—is now a subsidiary of the vast San Miguel Corporation (SMC).  SMC is the largest food, beverage and packaging company in the Philippines, with over 100 facilities in the Philippines, China and Southeast Asia.

These days, the San Miguel Corporation’s products range from beer, hard liquor, juices, processed meats, poultry, dairy products, condiments, flour, coffee, animal feeds as well as packaging products.  Their“new business”seems far removed from their core beverage and food products, and are in the areas of:

 Fuel&amp;Oil infrastructure Power and Energy Mining Telecom Banking 

San Miguel was in my radar recently, when I read that the San Miguel Pure Foods Company’s (SMPFC) revenues hit an all time high in 2011.  Excerpt from San Miguel Corporation below:

 San Miguel Pure Foods Company Inc. (SMPFC) registered all-time high revenues of P89.6 billion for 2011, up 13% from P79.3 billion in 2010 and driven by increased demand, aggressive distribution expansion, introduction of new products, and higher export sales. 

 Despite a significant increase in input costs, particularly in its agro-industrial cluster, income from operations increased 4% to P6.1 billion, with significant contributions from its value-added meats, dairy, flour, and coffee businesses. 

 Profits were boosted mainly by higher volumes, improved efficiencies, a good wheat position, a strong peso, and effective cost reduction across the entire group. 

 Net income rose to P4.2 billion, up 4% from P4.1 billion in 2010. 

 Nearly all of SMPFC’s businesses posted significant revenue growth due to higher volumes and favorable selling prices. 

 Its Value-added business chalked 5% growth in revenue, while its Feeds business posted an 8% revenue growth in commercial feeds. 

 Revenue growths were also seen across Magnolia Dairy, Magnolia Ice Cream and San Miguel Coffee, which benefited from wider distribution, brand-building initiatives and better selling prices. 

For more on this topic, click on the article “SMC more than doubles revenues” from the Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation.

Pure Foods was acquired by San Miguel Corporation in May, 2001.

The San Miguel Corporation is huge, and hugely successful…and definitely not the San Miguel known by our parents, or THIS lola (grandmother).

 Purple yam or corn and cheese ice cream…anyone? 
 Posted on March 29, 2012 by Lola Jane Reply 
Have you eaten Filipino style ice cream?  If not, you are missing out on some of the best tasting and most interesting ice cream available to us, right here in the Bay Area!
 
Magnolia Brand&quot;UBE&quot;Ice Cream, from www.RamarFoods.com
 
When we lived in San Francisco years ago, Mitchell’s Ice Cream on San Jose Avenue (at Guererro and the corner of 29th Street) was the“go to”place for tropical ice cream.

These days, it is still the“go to”tropical ice cream place in SF.  It is quite unusual to see a business with over 1000 Yelp reviews , let alone one with over 2,000 reviews. Mitchell’s Ice Cream has 2,230 reviews (“in English”out of a total of 2,235 reviews).   And they rate consistently 4.5 out of 5 Yelp stars!  Their tropical ice cream menu consist of:

 Avocado Buko (baby coconut) Coconut Pineapple Ginger (available November through February only) Green Tea Halo-Halo (buko, langka, ube, pineapple, mongo&amp;sweet beans) Langka (also known as jackfruit, a relative of the fig) Lucuma (a tropical fruit native to Peru) Macapuno (sweet coconut) Mango Tropical Four (banana, guava, mango&amp;pineapple) Ube (purple yam) 

They note on their website that the most of the fruit imported for their tropical ice cream line is from the Philippines.

My grandsons like the purple, Filipino ube (pronounced“ou-beh”)—the purple yam ice cream, as well as the coconut or macapuno flavors, made from sweetened young coconut meat.
 
Mais Queso Ice Cream by Magnolia Foods. Photo from www.ramarfoods.com
 
And my favorite?  It is the uniquely Filipino, ice cream combination of corn and cheese!  Yes indeed, corn and cheese was my favorite as a little kid, and it still is among my favorite ice cream concoctions now that I am a Lola (grandmother) of two beautiful boys.

I don’t see my favorite Filipino ice cream flavor on Mitchell’s current menu. However, it is easy enough to find at most Asian/Filipino stores.

A popular Filipino brand is “Magnolia”by Ramar Foods .  Magnolia brand ice cream is made here in the U.S, at Ramar’s Pittsburg, California headquarters.  Magnolia’s ice cream fruits are also sourced from the Philippines, for the most authentic flavors.

 Ramar’s Magnolia Ice Cream line features 16 flavors, including a“halo-halo”flavor (see previous post) and my all time favorite, corn and cheese—though they call it the Spanish“mais queso”.

I know it sounds weird—well perhaps not so weird if you are of a Filipino background—but corn and cheese ice cream is really tasty.

The corn pieces give the creamy ice cream added unique texture and flavors, and along with the combination of slightly tart, orange-colored cheese bits…well, you will just have to trust me and try it.

But, I do understand if that sounds truly too strange for you to venture into the land of tropical ice cream.  So instead, you might just try:

 Avocado ice cream—avocados have long been eaten as a“sweet”in the Philippines, as in avocado icicles, or ice pops, or the iced-avocado, sugar and milk snacks of our childhood.  And now, I am seeing avocado cheesecake recipes in magazines!  So finally, it seems…..Americans are trying avocado beyond its role as a vegetable, in guacamole or as ingredients for a salad and sandwich. The mango, jackfruit or coconut flavors (like buko or macapuno) The delicious ube—or purple yam.  Thanks to this purple yam, you will see a good share of Filipino snack foods in shades of purple .  Ube is used not only in ice cream, but also sold as a preserve (nothing like purple yam jams!) and stuffed in breads and added to many Filipino rice-based desserts. And if you can’t decide and want to be adventurous, try the“halo-halo”ice cream, which translates to“mix-mix”or“to mix”, and where many ingredients are thrown in the ice cream mix (again, see prior post on halo-halo ). 

Growing up in the Philippines, I remember buying ice cream from the sorbetes man, scooped fresh, from his colorful push cart.

Jingling bells signaled the arrival of the sorbetes man on our street, and we would pop outside to let him know we would like to buy, and dash back inside to get our money, and favorite drinking glass, bowl, or cup, to contain the ice cream.

I can’t remember if there were even ice cream“cones”sold by sorbetes man back then, only that we would buy whatever scoop quantity we wanted and he would scoop it directly into our chosen containers.

Back inside and spoon in hand, we worked fast to eat our quickly melting ice cream.  Fresh ice cream from your favorite mamang sorbetero—the ice cream man—has to be one of the best snacks to eat on a warm, Philippine afternoon.

We did not know it, but back then, this was a very“green”method of getting a snack or treat, no waste of plastic packaging or paper trash to deal with.

Hmmm…I do wonder….can one still buy ice cream this way in the Philippines?

 Halo-Halo: Saveur’s Recipe Comix 
 Posted on March 22, 2012 by Lola Jane 5 
Is Filipino food going mainstream, finally?  The March, 2012 issue of Cook’s Illustrated magazine featured a recipe for the quintessential Filipino national dish, the chicken adobo (also noted by Local Nomad ).

And earlier this week, Saveur Magazine’s website featured this halo-halo cartoon recipe (as they note, proof that a recipe does not have to be just words on paper).

Halo-Halo translates to“mix-mix”and is a much-loved, icy, Filipino treat, perfect for the hot Philippine climate, especially in the mid-afternoon.  It is also delicious as a dessert.

The artist for this recipe comix is Toronto-based Michael Deforge .

 Halo-Halo is available at Goldilocks and other Filipino restaurants in the Bay Area.

In the Monterey Bay, Lola’s Kusina—not THIS Lola—on 265 Reservation Rd, in Marina (831)384-2600 is a good place to get your halo-halo fix.  My grandsons enjoy their halo-halo topped with their ube (purple yam) ice cream.

For a step-by-step (from scratch) halo-halo recipe, please visit Jun Belen’s blog, http://blog.junbelen.com/2010/10/10/how-to-make-halo-halo/ Jun Belen is a Philippine-born, San Francisco-based professional food and cookbook photographer.         I have been a fan since learning about Jun’s Saveur-nominated blog—a collection of his Filipino recipes with narratives, and his absolutely beautiful photographs.

And if you have a favorite Bay Area halo-halo spot, please comment and share.

Do you think one day, Filipino food will be as common—and as readily available—as Chinese or Thai food here in the U.S.?

 International Women’s Day 2012 
 Posted on March 8, 2012 by Lola Jane Reply 
Today is International Women’s Day (IWD), a global day celebrating the economic, political and social achievements of women past, present and future. Some countries celebrate IWD as a national holiday, including China, Russia, Vietnam and Bulgaria.

 Here in the U.S., the month of March is designated as Women’s History Month. 

To learn more about International Women’s Day—which celebrated its 100th year in 2011—click here to visit the website, www.InternationalWomensDay.com .

Locally, the Monterey Bay Chapter of the United Nations Association is hosting an International Women’s Day potluck dinner on Friday, March 9th.  Details below and on the UNA Monterey Bay Chapter website .

 Topic is“What would the world be like with more women leaders?” 

Location: Unitarian Universalist Church of the Monterey Peninsula, 490 Aguajito Road, Carmel, from 6:00 to 9:00 pm

The speaker is Ms. Rebecca Costa - Author of“The Watchman’s Rattle: Thinking Our Way Out of Extinction”

Everyone is encouraged to bring an international dish to share, and to wear international or ethnic clothing.  Admission is free!

Most of us have not heard of International Women’s Day….and may ask, is this really necessary?

Yes it is!

With the recent tirade by Rush Limbaugh (why are people listening to this VILE person?) after law student Sandra Fluke testified before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on contraception….with the violence and atrocities against women that we continue to hear about in war-torn areas of Africa…..and the inequities that women STILL endure in many parts of the world…yes, this attention is necessary.

And though it is now 2012, unfortunately, there is still much work and understanding needed to make women truly equal to men, in our modern world.

 Filipino Foodie Event in San Franciso Saturday, January 21: Kulinarya 2012 
 Posted on January 19, 2012 by Lola Jane Reply 
If you are a foodie and live in the Bay Area — or just interested in learning more about Philippine cuisine — make plans to go to the 2nd Annual Kulinarya event this Saturday, January 21st in San Francisco.

Kulinarya is the Filipino term for “cuisine” or “culinary”.  The event will feature cooking competitions and food tastings from Philippine food companies, local Filipino restaurants, and gourmet food trucks.   Admission is free, and food sampling tickets will be available for sale on site or in advance (details on advance ticket purchase at the end of this post).

Part of the proceeds will benefit the Typhoon Sendong relief efforts.

 

The event will take place from 3:00 to 8:00 PM, at Carnelian by the Bay, One Ferry Plaza, behind the Ferry Building.

Schedule and more delicious details on the official website www.KulinaryaShowdown.com (and the place to get your food tickets in advance).

My favorite Philippine nut—the pili—is featured in a pili nut cook-off. The pili nut is now among the country’s most important food product export.  If you have not had pili nuts—this is a good opportunity to sample this delicious nut, which tastes something like a cross between macadamia and almonds.
